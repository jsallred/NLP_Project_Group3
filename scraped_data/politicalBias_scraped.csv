An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows that 42 percent of voters expect the economy to improve over the next 12 months — the highest percentage since 2009 — and that 43 percent of voters think Mr. Obama would handle the economy better than Mr. Romney, compared with 43 percent who say the GOP candidate would do the better job.

SEE RELATED:

The results are a departure from polls throughout the race that consistently have shown that Americans think Mr. Romney is better equipped to handle the economy.

The poll, which surveyed 736 likely voters over the past week, also showed Mr. Obama with a 50-45 lead in the popular vote.

While the poll showed both candidates as even on the economy, Mr. Obama held significant edges in dealing with women’s issues and looking out for the middle class, and smaller edges in being a good commander-in-chief, dealing with Medicare and dealing with taxes.

The poll’s one bit of bad news for the president was that approval of his handling of foreign policy has slipped in the wake of ongoing unrest in the Middle East. Just 49 percent of voters said they approve of Mr. Obama’s foreign policy, down from 54 percent last month and his lowest figure since November 2010."

Nike Inc. stood by its decision to pull its Fourth of July sneakers from stores, even as the move dragged it once again into America’s culture wars and drew criticism from conservative lawmakers claiming political correctness has gone too far.

“We regularly make business decisions to withdraw initiatives, products and services. Nike made the decision to halt distribution of the Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation’s patriotic holiday,” the company said in an emailed statement Tuesday.

The Air Max 1 USA was intended as a celebration of U.S. Independence Day, with a flag that featured 13 white stars in a circle on the heel. The flag was created by Betsy Ross, an upholsterer in Philadelphia who has been credited for sewing the first stars and stripes flag in 1776, during the American Revolution. The design recently has taken on another meaning for some Americans as far-right groups have claimed it as a symbol of their cause. It has also been criticized as evocative of an era when slavery was still predominant in the U.S.

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, tweeted that he was “embarrassed” for Nike and said he had “ordered the Arizona Commerce Authority to withdraw all financial incentive dollars” that the state was planning to offer the company to open a manufacturing plant near Phoenix. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted that it’s a good thing Nike “only wants to sell sneakers to people who hate the American flag.”

Nike has made its decision, and now we’re making ours. I’ve ordered the Arizona Commerce Authority to withdraw all financial incentive dollars under their discretion that the State was providing for the company to locate here. 7/ — Doug Ducey (@dougducey) July 2, 2019

Nike has been planning to build a multimillion-dollar plant in the Phoenix suburb of Goodyear, a facility that would employ more than 500 workers within five years of opening, the Arizona Republic reported Monday. Nike said in the emailed statement that it was still committed to building a manufacturing center that will create 500 jobs, though it didn’t specifically name Goodyear.

The Beaverton, Ore.-based company is set to lose a grant of as much as $1 million, previously awarded through the Arizona Commerce Authority’s Arizona Competes Fund. The grants, which are discretionary, are given to projects that help the local economy and provide high-wage jobs, according to the authority. Nike, whose annual revenue tops $39 billion, last week reported sales rose 4% to $10.2 billion for the quarter that ended in May.

Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick was among the people who asked Nike to remove the shoe, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Nike took a calculated risk with Kaepernick ad, experts say »

The immediate outrage echoes the vocal response from a subset of Nike consumers in September, when Nike featured Kaepernick in an ad with the slogan, “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.” Anger and boycott calls on social media led to a brief dip for the company’s stock, which later rebounded. Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker praised the traffic and engagement generated by that polarizing ad.

It’s the second time in two weeks that the company has had to pull shoes because of political concerns. Last week, Nike withdrew from China a line of limited-edition shoes after the Japanese designer behind them posted in support of the Hong Kong protests against a proposed extradition bill.

Nike asked merchants to return the flag shoes, without saying why, the Journal reported, citing people it didn’t identify. The shoes aren’t available through the company’s apps or websites, the newspaper said.

Kaepernick, who endorses Nike products, contacted the company after the shoes were posted online, saying the flag is an offensive symbol because of its connection to an era of slavery, the newspaper said.

The former 49ers quarterback hasn’t played since 2016, when he began kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial inequality. Last year, Nike made Kaepernick the face of an advertising campaign while he was engaged in a dispute with the football league.

As controversy swirled, prices for the Air Max 1 USA jumped to $2,500 a pair — roughly 20 times higher than the retail price — on sneaker marketplace StockX, where buyers place bids and sellers set asking prices anonymously.

StockX CEO Scott Cutler said on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon that the company had decided to remove the listings.

We have decided to remove the Nike Air Max 1 USA from our site today and prohibit any further sales of this item on @StockX as the sale of this product on our platform does not align with our value system. — Scott Cutler (@cutlerscott) July 2, 2019

Nike’s shares closed down 0.5% to $84.96, giving Nike a market value of about $133.5 billion."

While no one seems to be saying that Ross herself was an evil racist, the fact that she lived—and allegedly sewed the iconic, 13-star flag associated with the American Revolution—during slaveholding times is apparently enough to ensure that she and her flag be canceled.

The controversy comes after Nike announced a new Fourth of July-themed sneaker, made in red, white, and blue materials and adorned on the heel with the Betsy Ross flag. After shipping the shoe—a version of Nike's popular Air Max 1—to stores, the company then abruptly called for their return.

""Nike has chosen not to release the Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July as it featured the old version of the American flag,"" was all a Nike spokesperson would say. But the shoes were reportedly yanked at the request of Colin Kaepernick, former NFL football player and current Nike representative.

According to some, the Ross flag has been co-opted by racists as a symbol of white nationalism, and therefore we're just supposed to just cede it to them and move on.

https://twitter.com/espiers/status/1146005159685885952

Not everyone agrees…

To be clear: I don't think it's wise to cede national or civic symbols to racists because they want them to be able to publicly present their ideology as ""patriotic,"" and what America should be, which is exactly what is being contested. Let them have the stars and bars. — Adam Serwer ???? (@AdamSerwer) July 2, 2019

For the record, ""whether Ross actually designed the flag is a matter of dispute,"" as The Washington Post notes. ""There is little evidence to back up assertions by her descendants that turned the Philadelphia-based upholsterer into a national heroine in the 1870s.

Nike's decision to pull the shoes sparked an immediate backlash, especially among folks on the right. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said he's canceling incentives the state had offered Nike to build a plant there.

Instead of celebrating American history the week of our nation's independence, Nike has apparently decided that Betsy Ross is unworthy, and has bowed to the current onslaught of political correctness and historical revisionism. 5/ — Doug Ducey (@DougDucey) July 2, 2019

QUICK HITS"
3,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/politics/tanks-july-4-washington/index.html,Left,"Washington CNN —

A small number of M1 Abrams tanks and other armored vehicles will participate in President Donald Trump’s July Fourth celebrations in Washington on Thursday, US defense officials have confirmed to CNN.

However, they will not parade down Pennsylvania Avenue due to the need to protect roads and bridges.

Trump later confirmed tanks would be present during remarks in the Oval Office.

“I’m going to be here and I’m going to say a few words and we’re going to have planes going overhead, the best fighter jets in the world and other planes too and we’re gonna have some tanks stationed outside,” Trump said while also acknowledging that measures would need to be taken to protect infrastructure.

“You’ve got to be pretty careful with the tanks because the roads have a tendency not to like to carry heavy tanks so we have to put them in certain areas but we have the brand new Sherman tanks and we have the brand new Abrams tanks,” Trump added.

While the US continues to operate the M1 Abrams tank the US military has not used World War II-era M4 Sherman tanks since the 1950s.

“We have some incredible equipment, military equipment on display – brand new. And we’re very proud of it,” Trump said.

The event is being referred to as a “Salute to America,” and will feature fireworks and a speech from Trump.

A US defense official said that the current plan is to have a very small number of armored vehicles participate as part of a “static display” at the event on the National Mall. The vehicles will not be moving thereby reducing the chance of damaging local infrastructure. The number of vehicles will be very small with the current plan to have two M1 Abrams tanks, two Bradley fighting vehicles and an armored M88 Recovery Vehicle, along with an “appropriate” number of accompanying personnel.

Multiple US military aircraft will participate in the celebrations as well, according to two defense officials, including the B-2 stealth bomber and F-22 fighter jets.

CNN had also previously reported that the Blue Angels demonstration team, which typically flies F/A-18s, would be present along with F-35 stealth jets and that the VC-25, the aircraft that serves as Air Force One when the President is on board, also will participate.

Earlier in his administration, Trump had announced his intent to hold a military parade on Veterans Day in Washington, DC, however he canceled those plans following estimates that put the cost of such a parade at tens of millions of dollars.

Trump blamed local Washington officials for the high costs of the canceled parade.

Military planners had determined that the now-canceled parade was not going to feature tanks or other tracked vehicles due to concerns they could damage infrastructure.

A Pentagon memo said the parade will “include wheeled vehicles only, no tanks,” adding that “consideration must be given to minimize damage to local infrastructure.”

By not having the tanks and Bradleys drive on DC streets as part of the July 4th festivities, planners hope to avoid any potential damage. As there are currently no armored vehicles stationed in DC, the vehicles are likely to be brought into DC via trains and transported to the location on the back of trucks.

The Washington Post was first to report Trump wanted tanks to take part in the July 4 event.

Other military assets will participate including the US Navy’s flight demonstration team the Blue Angels and ceremonial units such as the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, the US Army Band (“Pershing’s Own”), and the United States Marine Corps Silent Drill Team.

One military official told CNN that F-35 stealth jets will also likely participate.

The Pentagon declined to comment on any costs associated with the July 4th celebration and with the units associated.

A spokesperson for the military’s National Capital Region/US Army Military District of Washington referred CNN to the Department of the Interior, which did not respond to questions.

Officials told CNN that the White House has been actively involved in the planning of the celebration and had asked the Pentagon not to discuss details prior to the event.

A US military official told CNN last week that the cost of using military assets in this year’s July Fourth celebration was estimated to be less than $1 million and that the military personnel involved are to be drawn from units based in the Washington area, helping to drive down costs.

The Department of Interior previously confirmed that Trump will give his “Salute to America” address on the National Mall this July Fourth, an unusual move by the President.

Trump and other presidents have previously held events at the White House to celebrate the nation’s birthday, but typically have not been present at the traditional large celebrations on the Mall."
4,https://www.newsmax.com/politics/fourth-of-july-celebration-tanks-washington/2019/07/02/id/922935/,Right,"President Donald Trump isn't taking ""no tanks"" for an answer on the Fourth of July.

He said Monday that a display of U.S. military tanks will be part of a special event he's headlining July 4 in Washington, D. C., and photographers have spotted at least two M1A1 Abrams tanks and two Bradley Fighting Vehicles on flatcars in a railyard at the southeastern edge of Washington.

Military police were guarding the vehicles, which were visible to passers-by on nearby paths.

A U.S. official told the AP that the military vehicles to be used in the July 4 event were being stored at the railyard.

Trump had wanted a military parade of tanks and other equipment in the District of Columbia after he witnessed a similar parade on Bastille Day in Paris in 2017 . That plan eventually was scuttled, partly because of cost, though Trump apparently held on to the idea.

Local officials also had objected because of the damage the heavy armored tanks could do to city streets.

""We're going to have some tanks stationed outside,"" Trump said Monday from the Oval Office, appearing to acknowledge local officials' earlier concerns.

He offered no specifics on where the vehicles would be located.

""You've got to be pretty careful with the tanks because the roads have a tendency not to like to carry heavy tanks,"" he said. ""So we have to put them in certain areas, but we have the brand new Sherman tanks and we have the brand new Abrams tanks.""

Sherman tanks were the tank most widely used by the U.S. during World War II, but they have been out of service for decades. The M1A1 Abrams tank is currently the main U.S. battle tank.

Two M1A1 Abrams tanks and two Bradley Fighting Vehicles will be on display as part of Trump's ""Salute to America"" event, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the exhibits have not been made public.

The Abrams tanks weigh more than 60 tons apiece and were been shipped on railroad freight cars, from Fort Stewart, Georgia, the nearest Army base that has them. The White House declined to release more specific information.

Trump recalled his visit earlier this year to a plant in Lima, Ohio, where M1A1 Abrams tanks are refurbished. The plant had been at risk for closure but remained online due to Trump's investments in defense spending.

""We have some incredible equipment, military equipment on display — brand new,"" Trump said. ""And we're very proud of it. You know we're making a lot of new tanks right now. We're building a lot of new tanks in Lima, Ohio — our great tank factory that people wanted to close down until I got elected and I stopped it from being closed down, and now it's a very productive facility.""

Thursday's events are also expected to include a military demonstration by the U.S. Navy Blue Angels and other aircraft.

""We're going to have a great Fourth of July in Washington, D.C. It'll be like no other,"" Trump said. ""It'll be special and I hope a lot of people come. And it's going to be about this country and it's a salute to America.""

""I'm going to say a few words and we're going to have planes going overhead, the best fighter jets in the world and other planes, too,"" he said.

Trump plans to deliver a speech at the Lincoln Memorial during his ""Salute to America,"" which has been added to the regular schedule of Independence Day events in the nation's capital. The annual fireworks display will go off closer to the Lincoln Memorial instead of the Washington Monument, as has been the long-standing tradition.

The event is open to the public and free of charge, but a ticket-only area in front of the memorial is being set aside for VIPs, including members of Trump's family, friends and members of the military, the White House said.

Last year, Trump and his wife, first lady Melania Trump, hosted service members and their families at a picnic on the White House lawn and the president addressed guests from the balcony. No similar event is being planned this year.

Federal lawmakers, local officials and others have voiced concerns that Trump could alter the tone of what traditionally is a nonpartisan celebration of America's independence from the British by delivering a political speech. Trump formally announced his bid for re-election in June.

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, who oversees the National Mall and has helped orchestrate the president's vision, and other officials have said Trump's remarks will be patriotic."

A decorated Navy SEAL has been acquitted Tuesday of murder in the killing of a wounded Islamic State captive under his care in Iraq in 2017.

The verdict at a military court on Naval Base San Diego was met with an outpouring of emotion as the military jury also cleared Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, 40, of attempted murder in the shootings of two civilians and all other charges except for posing for photos with the body of the dead captive.

The case exposed a generational conflict within the ranks of the elite special forces group and the outcome dealt a major blow to one of the military's most high-profile war crimes cases.

Outside the court Gallagher greeted the media alongside his wife and lawyers. He spoke briefly saying: 'I'm happy and I'm thankful.

'I thank God, my legal team and my wife.'

According to Fox News he joked with his legal team that 'it's Independence Day'.

His wife Andrea said they are now looking forward to freedom: 'We just want to celebrate today.

'I was feeling like we're finally vindicated after being terrorized by the government that my husband fought for for 20 years.

'I think that this vindication, I hope, will be a lesson learned to everybody, that we need to uphold innocent until proven guilty (and) due process.' ⁣

'If this was a movie no one would believe it.'

The couple drove away from the court in a white convertible Mustang and headed to celebrate with his supporters joking they were heading for 'tattoos and alcohol'.

His wife said they are now looking forward to freedom. 'If this was a movie no one would believe it,' she said

Defense lawyer Marc Mukasey said Gallagher cried 'tears of joy, emotion, freedom and absolute euphoria'. Family and friends clutched each other in relief in the courtroom.

Mukasey added outside court: 'Suffice it to say this is a huge victory.

'It's a huge weight off the Gallaghers.'

The maximum sentence for posing with a corpse is four months and he spent longer than that in confinement awaiting trial before being freed by President Trump in March therefore he left the court Tuesday.

'We have a sentencing to do, but the maximum sentence of what they're about to sentence him on is much less than the time that they've already had him in the brig,' defense attorney Tim Parlatore said after Tuesday's verdict. 'So he is going home.'

Parlatore said the trial was a 'mutiny' and that he was being set up for the murder of the young ISIS fighter in 2017 by a group of younger SEALs who did not like his tough, old-school leadership style.

'The jury found him not guilty of murder, stabbing, the shootings, not guilty of all those things. They did find him guilty of taking a photo with a dead terrorist which we admitted all along, he's in that photo,' Parlatore added.

At the time they started complaining about him to their superiors, the other SEALs had been back in the US for six months and Gallagher was up for a promotion and a Silver Star.

The turning point in the court martial was when one of the SEALs, Corey Scott, who had been expected to testify for the prosecution took responsibility for killing the boy Gallagher was alleged to have murdered.

Scott now faces perjury charges from the Naval prosecutors he blindsided. They say he made it up to protect Gallagher after being granted immunity for his own war crimes.

Earlier Tuesday Andrea shared a black and white photograph on a Facebook page where she has been keeping fans and followers updated throughout the trial, Andrea Gallagher wrote: 'Please pray for a Not Guilty verdict and the #TRUTH to finally set us Free as the jury deliberates again today so this nightmare can end.'

Prosecutors told them that Gallagher's guilt was clear in photos he took with the dead militant's body.

They also pointed to texts where Gallagher allegedly told friends: 'Got him with my hunting knife' and 'there's a good story behind this', claiming those proved his guilt.

They tried to throw out the confession of another SEAL who took credit for killing the boy, claiming he was lying because he had been given immunity and wanted to protect Gallagher, and said jurors must focus instead on what Gallagher said after the boy's death.

On Tuesday morning, Andrea Gallagher, the SEAL's wife, shared this photo of him cuddling their son on social media. She captioned it: 'Please pray for a Not Guilty verdict and the #TRUTH to finally set us Free as the jury deliberates again today so this nightmare can end'

Andrea Gallagher shared this photograph of her hugging her husband from inside the Naval Base moments after the not guilty verdict was returned. She captioned it: 'NOT GUILT OF MURDER'

They claim he went off the rails after 19 years in the armed forces and stabbed the boy unexpectedly in front of other SEALs while clearing villages in May 2017.

Gallagher claimed he is not responsible for the boy's death and is being set up by younger, less disciplined SEALs who had it out for him because he had been tough on them on the battlefield.

The defense told jurors that those SEALs were lying when they claimed to have seen him stab the boy angrily.

He was only reported to his supervisors after the other SEALs learned he was up for a promotion and a Silver Star, the third highest honor in the military.

They said there was no evidence, aside from their testimony, that Gallagher committed pre-meditated murder and that he is being set up.

The prosecution needed two-thirds of the jury, or in this case five jurors, to agree to a guilty verdict to convict.

'Navy Cmdr. Jeff Pietrzyk said in closing arguments that text messages by Gallagher show he is guilty.

One message said: 'I've got a cool story for you when I get back. I've got my knife skills on.'

Another text stated: 'Good story behind this. Got him with my hunting knife.'

He then showed a photo of the dead prisoner with Gallagher holding up his head by the hair.

'The government's evidence in this case is Chief Gallagher's words, Chief Gallagher's pictures, Chief Gallagher's SEALs,' Pietrzyk said.

The prosecutor said the witness who changed his story and claimed to have killed the prisoner himself was lying to protect Gallagher.

'He [Corey Scott] changed his account to assist Chief Gallagher. He had his 'I am Spartacus' moment because he thought it would assist Chief Gallagher,' he said.

Pietrzyk acknowledged that the victim is not sympathetic but said the difference between ISIS and the US Army was that Americans did not kill once a fighter was taken out of battle.

'Before the air strike, he would have done anything in his power to kill an American,' Pietrzyk said, but he said the care of war prisoners is what sets U.S. forces apart.

'We're not ISIS. When we capture someone and they're out of the fight, that's it.

'That's where the line is drawn,' Pietrzyk said.

During the trial, it was revealed that nearly all the platoon members readily posed for photos with the dead prisoner and watched as Gallagher read his reenlistment oath near the body in an impromptu ceremony.

Defense lawyer Tim Parlatore began his closing argument the same way he started the trial.

'This is case is not about murder, it's about mutiny,' Parlatore said.

He added there were 'gaping holes' in the testimony and said Gallagher was the target of a 'fixation' of military prosecutors.

'They started with a conclusion ... [and] ... ignored everything that didn't fit,' he said.

The attorney said there's no body, no forensics, and the SEALs who testified against Gallagher lied because they didn't like his demanding leadership. He called the pictures of Gallagher clutching the corpse's hair and his texts about his knife skills just the dark humor of a warrior.

Parlatore also contended that investigators never asked Scott about the cause of the death, which is why they were surprised by his testimony.

The defense showed video clips by an Iraq TV crew of the prisoner being interviewed after he was hit, then arriving at the SEAL compound and being handed over to the SEALs by the Iraqi troops.

It also showed Gallagher pulling out his medical bag and treating the detainee.

Gallagher's attorneys said there are a number of things that could have caused the militant's death, including internal injuries from the blast.

Over the last two weeks, seven SEALs have testified against him in the Navy Base in San Diego.

They painted him as a blood thirsty leader who acted like God on the battlefield and thought himself above the law.

But one, who had been expected to testify in favor of the prosecution, stunned the courtroom by taking responsibility for the most serious charge - the murder of the young ISIS prisoner.

It blindsided prosecutors who have now threatened the SEAL with perjury charges. He had been granted immunity for any war crimes in exchange for his testimony.

In their closing arguments on Monday, prosecutors said Gallagher's guilt was undeniable.

THE WAR CRIMES GALLAGHER WAS ACCUSED OF Murder (not guilty) On May 3, SEAL Team 7 was clearing villages near Mosul when they learned that Iraqi forces, which they were helping to fight ISIS, had encountered a young, IS fighter. He was injured and in need of medical care after suffering a collapsed lung in a strike. The boy had been brought into the SEAL compound by a Humvee of Iraqi fighters, the SEALs testified. Gallagher was not at the compound but was out on the field. When he call came over the radio that the boy needed care, Gallagher volunteered. According to witness testimony, he told the Iraqi soldiers not to waste their own medics on caring for the enemy and that he instead would tend to him. 'Lay off him, he's mine,' he is accused of saying. When they got back to the base, some of the SEALs said they saw Gallagher give him medical aid. They then claimed, however, that he took his hunting knife and spontaneously stabbed him twice in the neck and once in the side. One testified that it caused him to bleed so profusely there was blood spurting from his neck. 'It looked similar to a baby throwing up,' said Special Operations Chief Craig Miller. Others say that the last time they saw the militant, he was alive and in Gallagher's care but he was dead when they returned. The testimony which varies greatest is Corey Scott's who said he was the one who killed the boy because he wanted to spare him the torture he faced from Iraqi soldiers. Attempted murder (not guilty) There are two charges of assault on 'noncombatants' listed in the charge sheet. One is against an elderly man who the SEALs say they saw Gallagher shoot from his sniper's nest for no reason. The other is a young, schoolage girl who they say he shot. The SEALs said he claimed to have killed them but it is not clear from the charging sheet if they actually died. According to testimony, he allegedly told them over the radio: 'You guys missed them but I got them.' On another occasion, the SEALs say he shot a different girl, aged between 12 and 14, in the stomach. She was wearing a floral hijab, they said. The defense argued that none of the witnesses actually saw him pull the trigger and that was entirely possible the civilians had been shot by ISIS and not Gallagher. Posing with a corpse, reenlistment ceremony next to a corpse and flying a drone over it (guilty of posing with corpse) Photographs that were shown to the jury showed Gallagher and the other SEALs posing with the corpse of the dead Iraqi fighter once he was dead. He sent the image to friends and boasted about it, according to the SEALs. Not long after he died, Portier reenlisted Gallagher into the Navy next to the boy's corpse which had been covered by a blanket. There was also a charge for flying a drone over it in a disrespectful way once he was dead. The other SEALs participated in all of these three charges which come under the term 'Novel'. The crime is that Gallagher discredited the Navy in his actions. All of the others, with the exception of Portier, were given immunity in exchange for testifying against him. Obstructing justice x 3 (not guilty) Prosecutors allege that Gallagher obstructed justice by trying to stop other SEALs from testifying against him once the investigation was underway and before it began. They say that he threatened them and told them he would kill them if they ever told superiors how he had behaved during the deployment. Unlawfully firing his gun (not guilty) Gallagher allegedly fired his rifle indiscriminately, at least '10 times' than some of the other SEALs said they did, while deployed. Unlawful possession of a controlled substance (dropped before trial) He is accused of having Sustaon 250, a testosterone injection. Prosecutors claimed he was using the steroid improperly. He argued that it was part of a medical kit he had been given to give to others that was discovered during a search of his house. Wrongful use of a controlled substance (dropped before trial) Gallagher also had tramadol, a highly addictive painkiller, which they say he was abusing. He argued that he had long held a prescription for it. Advertisement

THE PROSECUTION - War crimes including murder, attempted murder, obstruction of justice, conduct unbecoming of an officer - Gallagher was an unhinged 19-year veteran on his 8th tour who thought he was above the law - SEALs testified that he shot indiscriminately at Iraqi civilians including an old man collecting water and a girl - They say he boasted about killing 'hundreds' during his tours and was blood thirsty - When he was indicted, some of the SEALs said they spent more time protecting Iraqi civilians from Gallagher than they did fighting ISIS - They claim Gallagher plunged his knife into ISIS fighter's neck twice and his side once in a sudden attack - Afterwards, he justified it by calling him 'just another ISIS dirtbag' - The SEALs say they had to speak up against him for others' safety Advertisement

THE DEFENSE - Gallagher is an honorable, life-saving SEAL who has spent nearly 20 years in the military protecting people all over the world - He is a medic and a sniper whose mission is to protect and serve, no matter the mission - In 2017, he was leading a group of less disciplined SEALs during his 8th deployment and they were in Mosul, Iraq - Some were angry that he had been recommended for the Silver Star, the third highest honor in the Navy - He was tough on them, calling them cowards in the battlefield and accusing them of not pulling their weight, and they did not like it - On the day the ISIS prisoner died, Gallagher had given the young boy medical treatment - He made an incision in his throat to give him a breathing tube - However the boy lost his life after that was out of his control Advertisement

Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Dalton Tolbert

SO1 Dalton Tolbert

When the SEALs returned from Mosul and set up their WhatsApp group, SO1 Dalton Tolbert, who was a sniper during their tour, tried to drum up support from others to report Gallagher.

'I saw Eddie Gallagher shoot at someone who didn't deserve to die. I shot more warning shots to protect civilians [from Eddie] than I ever shot at ISIS,' he said in one message in their WhatsApp group, The Sewing Circle.

He gave one example where he said he saw Gallagher shoot an unarmed elderly Iraqi man in a tunic who had been collecting water from a river.

He claimed he fired a warning shot to try to scare the man away but that Gallagher fired at him and wounded him.

Tolbert had been accepted into the famous SEAL Team 6, which was responsible for taking out Osama Bin Laden.

He said that as a result of his testimony at Gallagher's trial, his dream of carrying out covert operations for that team is now over.

Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Dylan Dille

SO1 Dylan Dille is illustrated above in a shirt and tie, sitting in front of Gallagher, with a photograph in the background of the men crowded around the ISIS fighter once dead

Dille's testimony was some of the most damaging. He claimed that Gallagher told him that he would like to kill an ISIS prisoner if the opportunity arose.

His remarks were what informed the prosecution's arguments that it was a premeditated killing.

Dille claimed that on the day the boy died, he was with Gallagher when the call came over the radio that a prisoner was at the base.

'No one touch him. He's all mine,' he claimed he said.

He said Gallagher had told him earlier: 'If we ever get a wounded enemy, that the medics know what to do to nurse him to death.'

He did not claim to have seen Gallagher kill him. Instead, he said the boy was alive when he left him

He returned to his post and then came back to the group later but found the prisoner dead, he said.

Later that day, he said Gallagher held a meeting with the junior SEALs because they were so uncomfortable with what had happened.

He said that at that meeting, Gallagher told them: 'This was just an ISIS dirtbag. Next time we get a prisoner … it will be out of sight, out of mind.'

Dille served in the Navy from 2010 until last year.

Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Craig Miller

Miller's testimony was among the most dramatic. He said that he saw Gallagher plunge the knife into the boy's neck and that blood spurted out.

'I saw him stab the prisoner in the side of the neck. He kind of like jumped back a little bit,' after the alleged stabbing.

SO1 Craig Miller

'The blood just came out. It looked similar to a baby throwing up,' he said.

Miller was who led The Sewing Circle, according to Parlatore, Gallagher's lawyer.

He was the first to report him to superiors once they had returned from Iraq. It was around the time that Gallagher was up for promotion to Master Chief and he was being considered for the Silver Star, the third highest honor in the armed forces.

Miller first went to Lt. Commander Robert Breisch in around March 2018, when Gallagher was up for the award. He told Breisch that it was based on lies and that he didn't deserve it. When asked why, he first claimed Gallagher stole food from care packages in the platoon.

When he was told that wasn't enough to open an investigation, he claimed Gallagher used dangerous war tactics like using other SEALs as bait.

Again, he was told it was not enough. Over the next five months, Breisch said one of the SEALs went to him every week to complain about Gallagher.

Eventually, in around August 2018, Miller finally claimed he'd stabbed an ISIS prisoner.

'[He] blurted and vomited it out. He said, 'Eddie stabbed a prisoner,'' Breisch testified.

Since they returned, Miller has been promoted to chief.

Special Operator First Class Corey Scott

Scott had been expected to testify in line with the other SEALs and accuse Gallagher of murdering the boy.

But when he got on the witness stand, he blindsided prosecutors and the courtroom by claiming he was the one who killed the ISIS prisoner by closing off his air supply by covering his breathing tube with his thumb.

He said it was an act of mercy because he knew Iraqi forces would torture the young man if he let him live and handed him over.

Corey Scott (in a court sketch) was called as a prosecution witness on Thursday in the case against Gallagher but stunned the prosecutors by taking responsibility for the murder. Now, he is being threatened with perjury charges

Scott and Gallagher were the two medics on the scene and they were closest to the boy when he died.

He said he did see Gallagher stab him but that it was not what ultimately killed him.

Prosecutors have accused him of lying to protect Gallagher and say he only did it because he had been granted immunity himself.

He insisted he was being honest and merely did not want Gallagher, who has a wife and children, to spend the rest of his life in prison.

Scott has since been threatened by Navy prosecutors with perjury charges.

Special Warfare Operator First Class Joshua Vriens

SO1 Joshua Vriens

Vriens testified that he had seen Gallagher shoot a young girl in a hijab and sent others scattering.

He claimed to have watched through his scope as the girl was hit in the stomach and then dragged by one of her friends to safety.

But upon cross-examination, Vriens admitted he only saw it through his own sniper scope and did not see Gallagher pull the trigger.

He also conceded that ISIS had been shooting civilians that day, leaving open the possibility that it could have been one of their snipers who injured the girl.

Special Warfare Operator First Class T.C. Byrne

Byrne testified that he was wearing a helmet fitted with a camera when the ISIS prisoner was brought into the base.

Footage taken from it was shown to the jury. He said that he saw the prisoner alive but that he left him in Gallagher's care and returned to find him dead.

SO1 Terrance 'TC' Byrne is shown pointing to a photo of the dead fighter on the ground

Lt. Thomas MacNeil

MacNeil, who had roomed with Gallagher in the past, was the first to take the stand.

He claimed that after they returned from Mosul and there were rumors of an investigation, Gallagher and Portier approached him in a parking lot where he said Gallagher ran up to him and threatened him.

'Chief Gallagher got in my face and said 'If you take me down, I'll take all of you down. I've got s**t on all of you,' he told the trial.

Lt. Jacob Portier

Portier was the supervisor during the deployment and he has been charged separately for covering up Gallagher's alleged crimes.

He conducted the reenlistment ceremony next to the dead ISIS fighter's body once he had stopped breathing and was also filmed walking past the SEALs as they played with a drone near the youngster's body.

He allegedly ordered the SEALs to delete the incriminating photographs and videos taking during deployment which could put Gallagher behind bars.

Portier's own defense team has claimed, like Gallagher's, that they are being unfairly prosecuted.

At his trial, it was revealed that a repository where alleged war crimes are meant to be logged and then investigated has sat empty since it was created in 2009.

SEALs referred to Gallagher as 'el diablo' and plotted how to bring him down before war crimes trial in secretive WhatsApp group they called 'The Sewing Circle

The Navy SEALs who testified against Gallagher discussed reporting him to their superiors in a secret WhatsApp group called The Sewing Circle for months before he was indicted.

Seven members of the Alpha platoon Seal Team 7 testified against Gallagher at his two-week long trial in San Diego.

They had already spoken at length about why they thought he should no longer be allowed to serve in the military on the group, created after they returned from Mosul in 2017.

One SEAL claimed in their group text that he spent more time protecting civilians 'from Eddie' than he did fighting ISIS

The SEALs were deployed between February and September 2017.

When they returned home, Gallagher was celebrated for his bravery and the Navy was poised to award him the Silver Star, the third highest honor in the military.

News of the award prompted them to speak out.

The SEALs say it was because they could not allow him, in good conscience, to be celebrated when he had behaved in the ways they described.

Gallagher's attorney has suggested they were jealous that he was being recognized and they were not.

Among the messages was one where Corey Scott, the medic who took responsibility for the death of an ISIS prisoner Gallagher was charged with murdering, said he was 'ready to fight and kill.'

Others claimed in the messages to have spent more time trying to save Iraqi civilians from Gallagher than they did fighting ISIS.

How Trump weighed in on trial to get Gallagher better terms and may pardon him if he is convicted and the Navy SEAL's army of Republican support

The case not only made waves in the armed forces, it also caught the attention of prominent politicians and even the president.

Before he went on trial, Trump who intervened to free Gallagher from the brig, the Navy equivalent of prison, and give him better bail terms while he awaited his day in court.

'In honor of his past service to our Country, Navy Seal #EddieGallagher will soon be moved to less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court,' the president

'Process should move quickly!' Trump tweeted.

Two months later, it was reported that he would consider pardoning Gallagher should he be convicted.

His interference was the culmination of requests from Republicans to let Gallagher spend precious time with his family, at home, before potentially being jailed for life.

In March, Trump, responding to requests from Republican lawmakers and Gallagher's wife, moved him out of the brig and into less restrictive confinements

Gallagher's team of lawyers includes Marc Mukasey (left), who worked for Trump, and Navy veteran Tim Parlatore (right)

Rudy Giuliani has also weighed in on the case on Twitter, alleging misconduct against prosecutors

'We ask that you weigh this decision given the terrible message Chief Gallagher's confinement sends to our warfighters, that they can be confined behind bars away from their family, legal defense, and community for nine months before their day in court,' the lawmakers asked Navy Region Southwest commander Rear Adm. Yancy B. Lindsey.

Also on his team was Bernard Kerik, the former NYPD commissioner

One was Dan Crenshaw, the Republican representative for Texas who lost an eye fighting in Afghanistan and was a SEAL himself before taking up politics.

The other was Duncan Hunter, a Marine veteran from California.

In their request, they added: 'To confine any service member for that duration of time, regardless of the authority to do so, sends a chilling message to those who fight for our freedoms.'

Their support of Gallagher and concerns about the case are echoed on forums, petitions and support groups where his fans called the trial a 'mutiny'.

While Gallagher is yet to comment on the president's support, his strong ties to the administration and to GOP elite are clear.

One of his lawyers is Marc Mukasey, a former partner of Rudy Giuliani who has also worked for Trump in a personal capacity.

Another is Bernard Kerik, a long-time Trump associate and the former NYPD commissioner who was convicted of ethics violations, tax fraud and false statements.

The case has been eagerly watched by former New York mayor and Trump comrade Rudy Giuliani who has commentated on it on Twitter throughout and maintains there is something 'seriously wrong' with prosecutors' efforts to put Gallagher behind bars.

Tim Parlatore, the lead defense attorney, is a Navy veteran who served between 2002 and 2013.

Gallagher's wife appealed directly to Trump to free him from the brig. When he was put in barracks, she shared her thanks in a Facebook post.

Gallagher has also received support from strangers and the Navy SEALs Fund which has raised more than $730,000 to pay for his defense.

The proceeds of t-shirt sales by three different apparel companies are also contributing to his defense.

Kerik tweeted his support throughout the trial. On Monday, when the jury started deliberating, he tweeted this

Andrea Gallagher, Eddie' relentless wife and chief supporter who stood by his side through 'farce' trial and lambasted the 'mean girls' who testified against him

Gallagher said nothing throughout the nearly year-long process between being indicted and the end of his trial, but his wife Andrea was a constant presence in the media and by his side.

Since he was charged in September 2018, Andrea, 39, has relentlessly campaigned for her husband's exoneration.

She made multiple television appearances, first on Fox News and later, as the trial gathered speed, on Good Morning America to insist on his innocence and condemn prosecutors' attempts to put him behind bars.

In addition to her media campaign, the glamorous blonde launched social media pages where she shared photographs of their family.

In them, Gallagher is seen hugging their sons and kissing her. The Facebook page has more than 33,000 followers.

Andrea's searing confidence throughout was well documented in interviews.

Despite SEALs testifying to have witnessed her husband killing the ISIS prisoner, she said in one interview: 'He's confident. My husband has always maintained his innocence from the beginning; he has been confident.

'He's wanted to go to trial. We have waited so long for this opportunity,' she said.



On it, Andrea has shared photos of herself and Eddie on 'date night' during the trial.

Andrea has shared photographs of Gallagher with their sons on social media as part of her sustained campaign

On the page, Andrea refers to the men who testified against her husband as 'mean girls'

'I will NEVER give up or stop speaking out against the injustices my husband, children, and family have suffered during this horrific ordeal & utter TRAVESTY of JUSTICE,' she captioned the video.

She earlier called it 'corrupt', 'vile' and a 'farce' and has referred to the younger SEALs testifying against him as 'Mean Girls.'

She pleaded with the president to intervene when her husband was put in the brig, begging him: 'What is happening here isn't right, and we need your help.'

When he was released, she thanked him publicly.

The pair had been married for 12 years and Andrea says they are lifelong best friends.

The couple have three children together; a 19-year-old son, a teenage daughter and a 10-year-old son. They live in Florida.

She has previously told how he planned to retire next year, aged 40, after 20 years in the armed forces.

7,https://www.apnews.com/e3f009f195944d1f99b5c4ccd6bb31d2,Center,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — The same military jurors who acquitted a decorated Navy SEAL of murder in the killing of a wounded Islamic State captive under his care in Iraq in 2017 will return to court Wednesday to decide whether he should serve any jail time for the single charge he was convicted of: posing with the 17-year-old militant’s corpse.

The final step comes after the verdict Tuesday was met with an outpouring of emotion as the jury also cleared Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher of attempted murder in the shootings of two civilians and all other charges.

The outcome dealt a major blow to one of the Navy’s most high-profile war crimes cases and exposed a generational conflict within the ranks of the elite special operations forces.

Gallagher could face up to four months imprisonment for the single conviction along with a reduction in rank, forfeiture of two-thirds of his pay and a reprimand.

Having already served seven months in confinement ahead of the trail, the Bronze Star recipient is expected to go home a free man, his defense lawyers said. In the military justice system, the jury decides the sentence.

After the verdict was read, the defense attorneys jumped up from their seats as Gallagher turned and embraced his wife over the bar of the gallery.

Gallagher, dressed in his Navy whites sporting a chest full of medals, told reporters outside court that he was happy and thankful.

“I thank God, and my legal team and my wife,” he said.

He declined to address questions about his SEAL team. His lawyers said he might talk after the jury decides his sentence.

His wife, Andrea Gallagher, who was by his side throughout the court-martial, said she was elated.

“I was feeling like we’re finally vindicated after being terrorized by the government that my husband fought for for 20 years,” Andrea Gallagher said before the couple drove away from Naval Base San Diego in a white convertible Mustang to start celebrating.

She vowed to continue to take action over what she has described as prosecutorial misconduct and a shoddy investigation that led to her husband going to trial. She said she wants Naval Special Warfare Group 1 Commodore Capt. Matthew D. Rosenbloom to resign, among other things.

Defense lawyers said Gallagher was framed by junior disgruntled platoon members who fabricated the allegations to oust their chief and the lead investigator built the probe around their stories instead of seeking the truth. They said there was no physical evidence to support the allegations because no corpse was ever recovered and examined by a pathologist.

The prosecution said Gallagher was incriminated by his own text messages and photos, including one of him holding the dead militant up by the hair and clutching a knife in his other hand.

“Got him with my hunting knife,” Gallagher wrote in a text with the photo.

The defense said it was just gallows humor and pointed out that almost all platoon members who testified against him also posed with the corpse.

Gallagher’s family championed a “Free Eddie” campaign that won the support of dozens of congressional Republicans who brought the case to the attention of President Donald Trump.

Trump had Gallagher moved from the brig to more favorable confinement at a Navy hospital this spring and was reportedly considering a pardon for him.

The panel of five Marines and two sailors, including a SEAL, were mostly seasoned combat veterans who served in Iraq and several had lost friends in war.

Most of the witnesses were granted immunity to protect them from being prosecuted for acts they described on the stand.

Lt. Jacob Portier, the officer in charge of the platoon, has been charged separately for overseeing Gallagher’s re-enlistment ceremony next to the corpse and not reporting the alleged stabbing.

The Navy is still pursuing the case against Portier, defense lawyer Jeremiah J. Sullivan III said."

He’s for the impeachment of President Donald J. Trump. It’s not shocking that Rep. Justin Amash (I-MI) decided to declare his intention to leave the Republican Party. It’s the usual crap from these clowns. He’s doing it because of principles. That’s fine, but even his stance on why eh supported Trump’s impeachment was a bit shaky since it means buying into the alleged (and probable) abuse of power that was exercised by the government against the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. If the Department of Justice Inspector General report is as scorching as we’ve heard from the grapevine, then everyone on this impeachment train is going to look like idiots. No, a lot of them already are, but it’ll be even more so. Regardless, Amash is done. He announced his exit from the Republican Party in an op-ed for The Washington Post (via WaPo):

My parents, both immigrants, were Republicans. I supported Republican candidates throughout my early adult life and then successfully ran for office as a Republican. The Republican Party, I believed, stood for limited government, economic freedom and individual liberty — principles that had made the American Dream possible for my family. In recent years, though, I’ve become disenchanted with party politics and frightened by what I see from it. The two-party system has evolved into an existential threat to American principles and institutions. […] In this hyperpartisan environment, congressional leaders use every tool to compel party members to stick with the team, dangling chairmanships, committee assignments, bill sponsorships, endorsements and campaign resources. As donors recognize the growing power of party leaders, they supply these officials with ever-increasing funds, which, in turn, further tightens their grip on power. […] Modern politics is trapped in a partisan death spiral, but there is an escape. Most Americans are not rigidly partisan and do not feel well represented by either of the two major parties. In fact, the parties have become more partisan in part because they are catering to fewer people, as Americans are rejecting party affiliation in record numbers. […] Today, I am declaring my independence and leaving the Republican Party. No matter your circumstance, I’m asking you to join me in rejecting the partisan loyalties and rhetoric that divide and dehumanize us. I’m asking you to believe that we can do better than this two-party system — and to work toward it. If we continue to take America for granted, we will lose it.

I'm absolutely amazed at the number of Libertarians siding with @justinamash for openly supporting the police state. Trump basically did the Presidential equivalent of saying ""Am I being detained"" and the civil libertarians are running to the defense of the state. — Rob Eno (@Robeno) May 20, 2019

Every Republican, at some point, is going to disagree with the President about something. There’s nothing unusual about that because we’re not automatons. But calling for his impeachment after his Rights were violated by police-state opponents IS NOT a “principled position.” — Dan Bongino (@dbongino) May 20, 2019

Okay—it’s this crap we don't have time for, folks. Partisanship is good. It makes clear who are enemies are, and we have many on the Hill. Sorry if solid job creation is too partisan for Amash. Sorry if small business and consumer confidence reaching their highest marks in decades are too partisan. Sorry if rebuilding our military is too partisan, as is appointing solid conservative judges and reshaping the judiciary. Sorry if unemployment across all ethnic background reaching its lowest levels is too partisan or jobless claims hitting a half-century low is too divisive. Oh, and cutting taxes, regulations, and nixing the Obama Clean Power Plan that stuck a knife in the throats of those in coal country was just too icky for you.

We don’t have time for this nonsense. We need fighters. We need to have a ‘fix bayonets’ mindset until Election Day 2020 because our enemies are coming after us. From the Democratic Party to the liberal media, the enemies of the people are gearing up for a nasty race. We should too, with nothing being off limits. If you thought 1800, 1824, or 2016 were nasty elections—this might be the worst of all time. The Left is desperate to boot Trump and there is no say to what lengths they will go. We cannot tolerate those who cannot see the forest through the trees here. So, sayonara, Mr. Amash; don’t let that door hit you on the way out.

Back home, the now-ex-Republican congressman is facing a primary challenge, where his opponent is reportedly ahead of him by 16 points. Amash also has some investments that could be impacted by this ongoing tension with China on trade. I don’t think this is purely about principle, folks.

As for the rest of us, Happy Independence Day."

Washington CNN —

More than a dozen Justice Department and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives officials faced punishment Wednesday after a long-awaited report on the botched gun probe known as “Operation Fast and Furious.”

That probe and a previous investigation were marked by “a series of misguided strategies, tactics, errors in judgment and management failures” that allowed hundreds of weapons to reach Mexican drug cartels, the Justice Department’s independent inspector general concluded.

Within minutes of the report’s release, Justice announced rthat former acting ATF chief Kenneth Melson was retiring and another official, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein, had resigned.

Read excerpts from the report

Weinstein and Melson were among 14 people who “bore a share of responsibility for ATF’s knowing failure in both these operations to interdict firearms illegally destined for Mexico, and for doing so without adequately taking into account the danger to public safety that flowed from this risky strategy,” the report states. Weinstein failed to pass along key information about the flawed tactics being used in Fast and Furious, while Melson and other ATF officials didn’t properly supervise the probe, the report states.

The report referred them and another 12 officials in Washington and the ATF and U.S. attorney’s offices in Phoenix to Justice officials to determine “whether discipline or other administrative action” was required.

Holder reacts to report

“Fast and Furious” became public after guns traced to the probe turned up at the scene of a Border Patrol agent’s December 2010 killing. The resulting investigations discovered similar tactics in a 2006-2007 operation dubbed “Wide Receiver,” also run out of Phoenix.

Revelations that ATF agents watched suspected gun traffickers cross into Mexico with weapons purchased at U.S. gun shops outraged lawmakers. Larry Alt, one of the ATF agents who blew the whistle on the operation, told CNN that it was “egregious” that agents were watching people transfer guns to people who were handing them over to the cartels, “and we were not taking an enforcement action.”

“I would say that the persons responsible for this case … at the field level, the division level, and the headquarters level and as far as it went into the Department of Justice, should be held accountable for any decision that they made that allowed these guns to go out on the street unmonitored,” Alt said.

Making matters worse, the Justice Department initially denied guns were being allowed to “walk” across the border, only to have to formally retract that statement in December 2011. The controversy forced Melson out at ATF, but he remained in another post at Justice until Wednesday.

Acting ATF Director B. Todd Jones, meanwhile, said his agency “accepts full responsibility” for failing to oversee the Arizona probes.

What was ‘Fast and Furious,’ and what went wrong?

“This hurts. This hurts people here,” Jones told reporters. But he added that the ATF has been tightening up its procedures and won’t shy away from tough operations.

“All we can do is get off the mat again and keep swinging,” he said.

The controversy fueled Republican accusations of a cover-up by the Obama administration and led to an unprecedented vote to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress.

The report found that Holder was not informed of the controversial ATF operation until 2011, after Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed. In a written statement on the findings, Holder said the inspector-general’s report upholds “what I, and other Justice Department officials, have said for many months now” – that the tactics used pre-dated the Obama administration and that Justice Department leaders didn’t try to hide the facts from lawmakers.

“It is unfortunate that some were so quick to make baseless accusations before they possessed the facts about these operations – accusations that turned out to be without foundation and that have caused a great deal of unnecessary harm and confusion,” Holder said. “I hope today’s report acts as a reminder of the dangers of adopting as fact unsubstantiated conclusions before an investigation of the circumstances is completed.”

The truth about the Fast and Furious scandal

But Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who brought ATF whistleblower complaints to the department’s attention in early 2011, said the report “reaffirms virtually everything” that congressional investigators turned up.

“It’s clear that both the ATF and the Justice Department failed to provide meaningful oversight of Operation Fast and Furious,” Grassley said in a written statement. Those agencies “ignored warnings from employees” and refused to acknowledge how bad the problem was until after months of congressional pressure, he said.

And Grassley said the report inaccurately lets Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer “off the hook” regarding a February 2011 letter to Congress that denied guns were being allowed to cross the border. Along with the statement, Grassley released e-mails he said contradict the report.

Breuer acknowledged last November he had learned that guns were allowed to “walk” to Mexico, and apologized for not informing other senior Justice Department officials. The February 2011 letter to Grassley was later retracted by Justice officials.

Wednesday’s report criticized Breuer and another top official, Gary Grindler, who was acting deputy attorney general when the events took place, for failing to pass along information to the attorney general and other top officials. But they remain with the department.

A standoff over internal Justice documents erupted after the Obama administration said it was asserting executive privilege in the Fast and Furious case to shield documents that include internal deliberations traditionally protected from outside eyes.

That prompted the House of Representatives to vote a civil contempt charge against Holder – the first time a Justice Department chief has been held in contempt by Congress. Democrats protested the vote vehemently as being purely political, and the citation passed along party lines.

The House took the issue to court, where it is expected to linger until well beyond November’s presidential election.

By the numbers: Fast and Furious

Some of the documents the White House withheld under the privilege claim were included in the report. Grassley said that inclusion “proves that this subset of documents could have been released earlier,” and the president “was merely thumbing his nose at Congress” before the contempt vote.

Rep. Darrell Issa, who pushed for the contempt vote against Holder as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee, the report shows “widespread failures” and “a near-total disregard for public safety.”

“Attorney General Holder has clearly known about these unacceptable failures, yet has failed to take appropriate action for over a year and a half,” added Issa, R-California.

Holder had said he was awaiting the report to determine what actions to take against individuals involved in the case. But he has promised Congress that such “gun walking” of weapons into Mexico would never again be allowed.

Issa called on President Barack Obama to “step up and provide accountability” for the program. And Inspector General Michael Horowitz, whose office produced the report, is scheduled to appear before Issa’s committee on Thursday.

Tell us what you think: Share you reactions to the report."
10,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/19/management-failures-cited-fast-and-furious-report/,Right,"The Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General on Wednesday blamed the failure of Operation Fast and Furious on a series of “misguided strategies,” but found no evidence that Attorney General Eric. H. Holder Jr. knew of the misguided gunrunning investigation before its public unraveling in January 2011.

The long-anticipated 471-page report cites “errors in judgment and management failures” on the part of officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives headquarters in Washington and in the Phoenix field office, and says “questionable judgments” by Justice Department officials in Washington marred the department’s response to Capitol Hill inquiries.

The investigation came to light after two AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifles purchased as a part of Fast and Furious were found at the scene of the killing nearly two years ago of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. The report recommended that 14 department employees be reviewed for possible sanctions or other disciplinary actions.

The report also says Acting Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler, Mr. Holder’s chief of staff, received a briefing about Fast and Furious in March 2010, but that the briefing “failed to alert Mr. Grindler to problems in the investigation.” The report says Mr. Grindler learned three days after the Dec. 14, 2010, death of Border Patrol Agent Brian A. Terry of the link between weapons found at the scene of the killing and Fast and Furious, but did not tell Mr. Holder. It said he should have “informed the attorney general as well as made an appropriate inquiry of ATF or the U.S. attorney’s office about the connection.”

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein, who reviewed Fast and Furious wiretap applications, resigned Wednesday in the wake of the report, which says he should have asked more questions about Fast and Furious, given his knowledge of a similar 2006 program known as Operation Wide Receiver. Former Acting ATF Director Kenneth Melson, named in the report as failing to maintain “appropriate oversight” of Fast and Furious, announced his retirement Wednesday, effective immediately.

Seriously flawed

According to the report, both Fast and Furious and Wide Receiver were “seriously flawed and supervised irresponsibly” by ATF’s Phoenix field division and the U.S. attorney’s office in Arizona, “most significantly in their failure to adequately consider the risk to the public safety in the United States and Mexico.” It said both investigations sought to identify the higher reaches of firearms-trafficking networks by deferring any overt law enforcement action against the individual straw buyers — such as making arrests or seizing firearms — even when there was sufficient evidence to do so.

“The risk to public safety was immediately evident in both investigations,” the report says. “Almost from the outset of each case, ATF agents learned that the purchases were financed by violent Mexican drug-trafficking organizations and that the firearms were destined for Mexico.”

Rep. Darrell E. Issa, California Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which investigated Fast and Furious, said Wednesday the report confirmed findings by Congress of a “near total disregard for public safety in Operation Fast and Furious, contrary to the denials of the attorney general and his political defenders.” Mr. Issa said the report notes that information in wiretap applications approved by senior Justice Department officials in Washington “did contain red flags showing reckless tactics” and they fault Mr. Holder’s inner circle for their conduct.

Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz is scheduled to testify to the committee on Thursday on the findings of his investigation.

Holder’s response

Mr. Holder said Wednesday the report’s key conclusions are “consistent” with what he and other Justice Department officials have said for many months: The inappropriate strategy and tactics employed were field-driven and date back to 2006; the leadership of the department did not know about or authorize the use of the flawed strategy and tactics; and the department’s leadership did not attempt to cover up information or mislead Congress about it.

“I want to assure the American people that I, and my colleagues at the department, will continue to focus on our mission of protecting their rights and their security and doing so in a manner that is consistent with the high standards of the Department of Justice,” he said.

The report identifies persons ranging from field agents and prosecutors in Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz., to senior ATF officials in Washington who “bore a share of responsibility” for ATF’s failures in both Fast and Furious and Wide Receiver to interdict firearms illegally bound for Mexico, and for pursuing “this risky strategy without adequately taking into account the significant danger to public safety that it created.”

“We operated with complete and total independence in our search for the truth, and the decision about what to cover in this report and the conclusions we reached were made solely by me and my office,” Mr. Horowitz said. “I am pleased that we are able to put forward a full and complete recitation of the facts that we found, and the conclusions that we reached, with minimal redactions by the department to our report.”

He also said the Obama administration made no redactions for executive privilege, even though the report evaluates in detail and reaches conclusions about the department’s actions in responding to Congress, adding that Justice has agreed to seek court authorization to unredact as much of the wiretap information as possible.

Lack of oversight

According to the report, investigators found that no one responsible for the operations at either the ATF Phoenix field division or the U.S. attorney’s office raised serious questions or concerns about the government not taking earlier measures to disrupt a trafficking operation that continued to purchase firearms with impunity for many months.

The report says that failure reflected a “significant lack of oversight and urgency” by both ATF and the U.S. attorney’s office and a “disregard by both” for the safety of persons in the United States and Mexico.

According to the report, Mr. Holder was notified immediately of Terry’s death but was not told about the connection between firearms found at the scene and Fast and Furious. It said he learned of the connection sometime in 2011, after he received a letter from Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, asking about Terry’s death.

“Had the department’s senior leadership taken immediate action after learning that weapons found at the scene of a federal law enforcement agent’s murder were linked to a straw purchaser in an ATF firearms-trafficking investigation, the department likely would have gathered information about Operation Fast and Furious well before it received the inquiry from Sen. Grassley about the very same issue in late January 2011. The Department, however, did not do so,” the report said.

The report said Mr. Grindler and former Deputy Chief of Staff Monty Wilkinson should have told Mr. Holder about the connection. It also singled out Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer, who heads the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, for possible disciplinary action for failing to alert Mr. Holder or his deputy when he learned in April 2010 that ATF had allowed guns to walk in Wide Receiver.

In addition, the report says Mr. Weinstein should have asked more questions about Fast and Furious, given his knowledge of Wide Receiver. Both Mr. Breuer and Mr. Weinstein were criticized for failing to draw a connection between the allegations in Mr. Grassley’s letters and their knowledge of gun-walking in Wide Receiver.

Weinstein’s dissenting view

In his resignation letter posted on his attorney’s website, Mr. Weinstein said he found it “personally painful” to read the report’s “completely false conclusion” that he knew about and failed to act on Fast and Furious guns being allowed to walk to Mexico. He said he had been assured by the ATF and prosecutors in Arizona that guns were not being transported south of the border.

According to the report, a poorly executed information-gathering and drafting process, as well as questionable judgments by department officials, contributed to Justice’s inclusion of inaccurate information in its Feb. 4 response letter to Mr. Grassley. It said that in preparing the letter, department officials relied on information provided by senior officials that was not accurate, primarily from U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke, ATF Acting Director Kenneth Melson and his deputy, William Hoover. It says they failed to exercise “appropriate oversight of the investigation, and to some extent were themselves receiving incorrect or incomplete information from their subordinates.”

Mr. Holder said officials within ATF and the U.S. attorney’s office in Arizona identified in the report as having been responsible for designing, implementing or supervising Fast and Furious have been “referred to the appropriate entities for review and consideration of potential personnel actions.” He declined to elaborate.

Political reaction split

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said the report “debunks many of the extreme allegations made by Republicans,” instead confirming conclusions reached in a minority report issued nearly a year ago that said neither Mr. Holder nor senior Justice Department officials authorized or approved of gun-walking in Fast and Furious, that gun-walking started under the President Bush’s administration in 2006, and that ATF agents in Phoenix and the U.S. attorney’s office in Arizona shared responsibility for “misguided operations spanning five years.”

Mr. Grassley said the report confirmed that Fast and Furious was the “height of irresponsibility on the part of a number of people from the ATF Phoenix field office all the way up to the Justice Department headquarters.” He said he was “glad” Mr. Horowitz was joining with him and Mr. Issa in urging the Justice Department to unseal Fast and Furious wiretap applications “so the American people can read them and make up their own minds.”

ATF shut down Fast and Furious after two AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifles purchased by straw buyers from a gun shop in Glendale, Ariz., were found near Terry’s body. The agent had been killed during a shootout with Mexican drug smugglers just north of the U.S.-Mexico border, south of Tucson. The killing led to public testimony by ATF agents opposed to the operation, who said more than 2,000 weapons had been walked to drug smugglers in Mexico, about 1,400 of which are still unaccounted for.

While the network won’t stream the event live, a spokesperson told Politico that it would assess in real time whether to air clips from the National Mall, which will feature a speech from Trump at the Lincoln Memorial, a massive fireworks display, a flyover by Air Force One and military aircraft, as well as tanks.

Earlier Tuesday, MSNBC host Joy Reid expressed criticism for the event and said that the display of military vehicles in the nation’s capital was reminiscent of leaders such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.

CNN has not yet said whether it will cover the event, but Fox News has set aside two hours Thursday from 6 to 8 p.m. EST to cover it. C-SPAN will cover the “Salute to America” starting at 6:15 p.m., joined by the streaming platforms for ABC, CBS, and NBC."

http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/19/us/us-fast-furious-report/index.html?hpt=po_c2",Left,"Federal agents and prosecutors in Phoenix ignored risks to the public and were primarily responsible for the botched effort to infiltrate weapons-smuggling rings in the operation dubbed ""Fast and Furious,"" according to a report released Wednesday by the Justice Department's inspector general. The long-awaited report also criticized senior officials at the Justice Department and its Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Washington for lax oversight of the attempt to block the flow of weapons to Mexico’s violent drug cartels. Many of the weapons later turned up at crime scenes in Mexico and the United States, including one where a U.S. Border Patrol agent was killed.

The inspector general's report recommended that the Justice Department review the actions of 14 officials and consider whether disciplinary action is warranted. Among them are former acting deputy attorney general Gary Grindler, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, former acting ATF director Kenneth Melson, former ATF special agent in charge William Newell and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein.

The inquiry “did not find persuasive evidence that any supervisor in Phoenix, at either the U.S. Attorney’s Office or ATF, raised serious questions or concerns about the risk to public safety posed by the continuing firearms purchases or by the delay in arresting individuals who were engaging in the trafficking,” Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department’s inspector general, wrote in the 471-page report. “This failure reflected a significant lack of oversight and urgency by both ATF and the U.S. Attorney’s Office.”

In describing the actions of officials in Washington, the report said that “Fast and Furious received little to no supervision by ATF Headquarters despite its connection to a dangerous narcotics cartel in Mexico, the serious risk it created to public safety in the United States and Mexico, and its potential impact on the country’s relationship with Mexico.”

While the report criticized officials in Washington, it said Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had no advance knowledge of the tactics and risks involved in the operation until after it was stopped.

Holder issued a statement saying that the report’s conclusions were consistent with the Justice Department’s assessment that the strategy was flawed and that the agency’s leadership did not attempt to “cover up information or mislead Congress about it.”

He said that Melson, who had been transferred from the acting ATF director post to another position at Justice, has resigned. Weinstein, a deputy assistant attorney general under Breuer in the criminal division, also has resigned, Holder said.

A Justice official said Breuer has been “admonished” by Holder but will not be disciplined. The inspector general’s report said that Breuer did not authorize the investigative activities in Fast and Furious and that there is no evidence indicating he was aware in 2009 or 2010 that ATF agents were not interdicting firearms.

But the report criticized Breuer for not informing the deputy attorney general or the attorney general in April 2010 when he learned that the ATF had used similar tactics in another Arizona case called ""Operation Wide Receiver."" Breuer has already publicly apologized for that inaction.

The Justice official also said that Holder will not be taking any further disciplinary actions against department employees, including Grindler, who is now his chief of staff.

Fast and Furious allowed weapons from the United States to pass into the hands of suspected firearms smugglers so that they could be tracked to the upper levels of Mexican drug cartels. But the ATF lost track of about 2,000 guns, including AK-47-style rifles, and the report said the agency seized only about 100 weapons. Two guns linked to a suspected trafficker were found at the scene of the fatal shooting of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry in December 2010.

The report was based on interviews with 130 witnesses and a review of 100,000 documents over the past 18 months, according to the inspector general.

In a historic move in late June, the House of Representatives voted to find Holder in contempt for refusing to turn over some internal communications about the operation and its aftermath. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who praised the inspector general's report, has requested that Horowitz testify at a hearing Thursday morning.

The report’s conclusions were harsher than expected, although not surprising to officials who have followed the unfolding story of Fast and Furious. Last year, after Holder requested the inspector general’s investigation, the Justice Department forced Dennis Burke, the U.S. attorney in Phoenix, to resign. Several other officials were reassigned, including Melson; Emory Hurley, the lead prosecutor for the case in Phoenix; and Newell, the special agent in charge of the Phoenix ATF office.

Phoenix ATF agents testified that they watched as gun-trafficking suspects bought hundreds of weapons. Some agents said they were ordered to let the guns “walk” so the agency could trace them to a firearms-trafficking ring. Several of their supervisors said that they never allowed gun-walking but instead were told by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Phoenix that they did not have enough evidence to seize the weapons at the time.

ATF Acting Director B. Todd Jones accepted responsibility Wednesday for the failed gun operation."
13,http://townhall.com/tipsheet/KatiePavlich/2012/09/19/eric_holder_does_a_victory_dance_around_fast_and_furious,Right,"Attorney General Eric Holder is ""spiking the football"" with the release of the DOJ Inspector General report about Operation Fast and Furious. The report essentially lets Holder off the hook while blaming everyone else, including his second hand man Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, for the failed and lethal operation. From the IG report:

Attorney General Holder told the OIG that he did not hear of Operation Fast and Furious until late January or early February 2011, and was not aware of concerns with the tactics in the investigation until February. He said that he visited Sen. Grassley in the Senator’s office on January 31, 2011, and Sen. Grassley handed him two letters that referenced Project Gunrunner. Holder told us that he became familiar with the phrase “Fast and Furious” after visiting with Sen. Grassley. We found no evidence that Department or ATF staff informed Holder about Operation Fast and Furious prior to 2011. Melson stated that he did not inform Holder about the investigation, and Burke said he did not recall doing so.231 Melson also stated that the Department was not involved in formulating any of the tactical decisions in the investigation. Holder said that Melson did not identify to him any problems about Operation Fast and Furious in 2009 and 2010. Our investigation did not identify evidence that contradicted Holder’s statements to us regarding his knowledge of Operation Fast and Furious and the use of “gun walking” tactics in that investigation. As we describe below, we identified information regarding Operation Fast and Furious that reached the Office of the Attorney General in 2010 but not Attorney General Holder himself. However, we found no evidence that this information included the inappropriate tactics at issue in Operation Fast and Furious.

But what about the memos addressed directly to Holder about Fast and Furious? The IG report says they never reached his desk.

We found that the Offices of the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General received 11 weekly reports in 2010 from ATF, DOJ’s Criminal Division, and the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) that referred to Operation Fast and Furious by name. For example, six of seven NDIC reports included among several other entries a summary of the support that NDIC had provided Operation Fast and Furious. The summary, which was identical in six of the reports except for certain dates, stated that Celis-Acosta and the straw purchasers in Operation Fast and Furious were responsible for trafficking 1,500 firearms to Mexican drug cartels.232 Attorney General Holder told the OIG that he did not believe that he reviewed these reports at the time that his office received them and that his staff did not bring them to his attention. Former Acting Deputy Attorney General Grindler stated that he had no recollection of having reviewed any weekly report concerning Operation Fast and Furious or of his staff highlighting such information for his review. We found no evidence that these weekly reports were forwarded to the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General.

Holder put out a statement just moments ago, here it is in part.

I have reviewed the Office of the Inspector General’s report on Operation Fast and Furious and the key conclusions are consistent with what I, and other Justice Department officials, have said for many months now: -The inappropriate strategy and tactics employed were field-driven and date back to 2006; -The leadership of the Department did not know about or authorize the use of the flawed strategy and tactics; and -The Department’s leadership did not attempt to cover up information or mislead Congress about it.

The last line is key, ""The Department’s leadership did not attempt to cover up information or mislead Congress about it."" Holder seems to have forgotten about the February 4, 2011 Fast and Furious letter edited multiple times by Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, signed by Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich, submitted to Congress and withdrawn nine months later due to being full of false and misleading information. Holder also seems to have forgotten about the 74,000 Fast and Furious documents he has refused to hand over to Congressional investigators and his exective privilege bailout from President Obama back in June, further preventing Congress from obtaining more information. As a reminder, Holder changed his testimony about when he first found out about Fast and Furious, multiple times under oath.

UPDATE: The IG report contradicts Holder's claims senior officials made no effort to mislead Congress.

[B]y the date of its May 2 response letter, senior Department officials responsible for drafting the letter also knew or should have known that ATF had not made ‘every effort to interdict weapons purchased illegally and prevent their transportation to Mexico,’ either in Operation Fast and Furious or other firearms trafficking investigations, and that the Department's February 4 letter contained inaccuracies and could no longer be defended in its entirety …. Given that senior Department officials' confidence in the accuracy of the February 4 letter was decreasing rather than increasing as their internal review progressed, the OIG found it troubling that the Department's subsequent May 2 letter to Sen. Grassley included a substantive statement - albeit a qualified one - regarding the Fast and Furious investigation that could have been read to reaffirm the prior questioned letter …. Similarly, the report found that the Department should not have provided testimony on June 15 before the House Committee on Oversight and Governmental Reform in a manner that created ambiguity and uncertainty regarding whether the Department was still defending its February 4 and May 2 letters.

Holder is also moving quickly to ""hold people accountable"" for the operation.

“Based upon the information in the OIG report and other related information, I am also announcing additional personnel changes today.



“First, Kenneth Melson, the former Acting Director at ATF, has retired from the Department, effective immediately. Ken has served the Department in several important roles for over thirty years, including as a United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and more recently as an advisor on forensic science issues. I want to thank him for his dedication and service to the Department over the last three decades.



“Second, those individuals within ATF and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Arizona, whom the OIG report found to have been responsible for designing, implementing or supervising Operation Fast and Furious have been referred to the appropriate entities for review and consideration of potential personnel actions. Consistent with the requirements of the Privacy Act, the Department is prohibited from revealing any additional information about these referrals at this time.



“Finally, I have accepted the resignation of Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein, a longtime career prosecutor who most recently served in the Criminal Division where he led our violent and organized crime, computer crimes and intellectual property enforcement efforts. Jason has dedicated much of his career to fighting violent crime and has led highly successful efforts around the country in this effort. The American people are safer because of his work. His commitment to the Department has been unwavering, and I deeply appreciate his 15 years of distinguished service here at Main Justice as well as in Baltimore and New York.

Now that the DOJ investigation of the DOJ is complete, will Holder release the remaining 74,000 Fast and Furious documents to Congress? In the name of transparency, the answer should be yes.

Parting thought: If Holder's hands really are clean in this, why is the executive privilege necessary?"

15,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/2/trump-drops-push-citizenship-question-2020-census/,Right,"President Trump’s quest to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census ended Tuesday, with the administration caving on the plans, bowing to a Supreme Court ruling and an intractable time crunch.

A Justice Department attorney, in an email that found its way onto Twitter, said the department had finalized the questionnaire and given the green light to print it without the citizenship question.

The decision is a symbolic blow to Mr. Trump, who staked significant political capital on his ability to get the question added and who had said it was “ridiculous” to conduct a census without asking about citizenship.

As late as Monday, the president told reporters he was considering ordering an unprecedented delay of the 2020 count to try to shoehorn the question into the form.

But by Tuesday, the realities of the calendar and his administration’s own legal positioning had set in.

“We can confirm that the decision has been made to print the 2020 Decennial Census questionnaire without a citizenship question, and that the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process,” Kate Bailey, one of the Justice Department attorneys involved in the case, said in the email that found its way onto social media.

Adding the question was going to be a long shot after the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., erected a roadblock last week.

The court ruled that while a citizenship question can be legal — and indeed has been asked on the full census before — the Trump administration cut too many corners by adding it this time.

The chief justice said he doubted the explanations of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for the need to add the question. He called it “contrived” and ordered a do-over.

The only problem was that the administration told the court that it faced a June 30 deadline — Sunday — for finalizing the questionnaire and sending it to the printer.

Mr. Trump was faced with options of either arguing that the deadline wasn’t real or attempting to delay the census entirely, which would have invited a whole new round of legal battles.

Democrats, who accused Mr. Trump of trying to weaponize the census to suppress Hispanic and immigrant participation, cheered the president’s failure.

“A citizenship question would have pushed us backward for nothing more than crass political calculations,” said Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., New Jersey Democrat. “Today America won, and Donald Trump and his political minions lost.”

The citizenship question had become a microcosm of the broader debate over Mr. Trump’s approach to racial and immigration matters, and both sides turned up the rhetoric.

“Nobody can believe this, but they spend billions of dollars on the census, and you’re not allowed to ask?” an incredulous president told reporters Monday.

He added: “There’s a big difference, to me, between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.”

Opposing Mr. Trump was the full array of liberal forces, including Democrat-led states, immigrant rights groups, civil rights organizations and progressive campaigns.

“The Trump administration’s politically motivated efforts to undermine the Constitution in this instance were so reprehensible that even the conservative Supreme Court couldn’t let them get away with it,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat.

The Trump administration seemed to have bungled the citizenship question effort from the start.

Mr. Ross said he added it after a request from the Justice Department, which said more specific citizenship data would help police voting rights laws.

But evidence emerged that Mr. Ross had been inclined to add the question before the Justice Department request and had been in contact with Trump political allies who had other reasons for wanting the data.

Critics also said the question, asked by this administration, would reduce the response rate.

Three district court judges ruled that Mr. Ross ignored those findings and cut too many other corners in his zeal to get the question approved in time.

The Supreme Court sped the case onto its docket without waiting for circuit courts of appeals to rule. In a stunning decision last week, the severely divided court, in a 5-4 ruling, ordered Mr. Trump to take a do-over.

But the ruling was handed down June 27, three days before the deadline for the census forms to go to print.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, Maryland Democrat and chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said the Supreme Court’s decision was a victory, but he added that he will continue an investigation into why it was added in the first place.

“The attorney general and the secretary of commerce must now turn over all of the documents our committee has subpoenaed on a bipartisan basis,” Mr. Cummings said.

Job openings in the U.S. increased just 1.4% from the same period last year, according to the employment site’s June 2019 Job Market Report."
17,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/business/what-job-growth-in-june-can-reveal-about-a-fed-rate-cut-in-july,Right,"Slowing private payroll growth in June, an indicator of broader labor market performance, will play a key role in whether the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates later this month.

Non-government employers added 102,000 jobs, according to a Wednesday report from payroll-services provider ADP that economists view as a gauge of overall hiring. While a sharp rebound from gains of 41,000 in May, it’s still well below the average of 224,000 for the first four months of 2019.

“The job market continues to throttle back,” Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said in a statement. “Job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, as businesses have turned more cautious in their hiring.”

The slowdown described by APD, led by declines at manufacturing, construction, and mining firms, is reflected in forecasts for the U.S. Labor Department’s broader assessment, scheduled to be released on Friday. Economists predict employers including federal, state, and local governments added 163,500 workers.

As with the ADP data, that would represent a sharp turnaround from tepid expansion in May, while still reflecting reluctance to hire new employees after the Trump administration more than doubled tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports and threatened duties on the $300 billion-plus in remaining goods.

The duties have pushed up the price of supplies for U.S. manufacturers, while eating into their profits and raising costs for customers.

Fallout from the White House’s trade disputes, which extend from Beijing to Europe and Japan, have raised the odds that the Fed will reduce interest rates, a move Trump has long advocated. While the central bank’s monetary policy committee will probably prioritize business confidence and investment in deciding whether to cut rates in July, job growth will affect the odds, said Robert Martin, an economist with the Swiss lender UBS.

If the U.S. adds more than 185,000 jobs, he said, the odds of a July rate cut will fall. If the labor market grows by fewer than 100,000 positions, the odds increase.

“It’s one of the more critically important monthly readings we’ve had in some time,” Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com, told the Washington Examiner. Job growth sagged below 100,000 – the number needed to keep pace with population growth – in two of the first five months of the year, he noted.

The question now is how much the labor market will slow and “whether there is going to be a Federal Reserve rate hike, as investors are heavily betting there will,” he said.

If job growth in June is similar to the 75,000 positions added in May, a July rate cut is probably warranted, said Michelle Meyer, an economist with Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America.

“This is not a Fed that’s willing to tolerate any signs of a recession,” she said. “They want to sustain the recovery.”

The lender predicts at least three rate cuts, which would take the benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%, down from a current level of 2.25% to 2.5%.

Trading in interest-rate futures tracked by CME Group’s Fed Watch Tool indicates a 70% change that the central bank’s monetary policy committee will trim rates by 25 basis points at its July 31 meeting."
18,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/03/jobs-data-could-show-slowing-trend-and-prompt-the-fed-to-cut-rates.html,Center,"Ten years into the recovery, the economy's ability to create new jobs may be slowing, both because the U.S. is running out of workers and because the trade war may be worrying employers.

Economists expect to see 165,000 jobs were added in June, after a stunningly low 75,000 payrolls added in May, according to Dow Jones. But a soft ADP report Wednesday, with just 102,000 new private payrolls, dampened expectations for the government's June payroll report, which will be released Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET.

The jobs report is also seen as a major input for the Fed to consider when it meets at the end of the month, and if there is more weakness than expected in job growth or wages data, it could be another catalyst for an expected interest rate cut. In the June report, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.6%, while average hourly wages are expected to increase by 0.3%, or 3.2% year over year, up from 3.1% in May.

""We've known for a while with a very low unemployment rate that we're running out of workers. Payroll gains are going to slow at some point. I don't know if this is the point or not. I don't trust the ADP number. I don't know if the day of seeing 200,000 job numbers is over,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.

ADP is not seen as a strong indicator for the government's employment report, but in May, its initial report of just 27,000, later revised to 40,000 jobs, sent a strong message about a hiring slowdown that later showed up in the government's weak May report.

On the other hand, some employment indicators remain strong. Weekly jobless claims data, viewed as the most current data on the labor market, fell by 8,000 to 221,000 in late June, signaling a solid enough jobs picture when it was released Wednesday.

But ADP's data also contained some worrisome details, such as the decline of 37,000 jobs in companies employing one to 19 people. ""The thing that's really puzzling is the slowdown in small business hiring. That's really the engine for job growth in the economy. Seeing that slowdown is concerning,"" said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies.

So far, it's not clear how much employers are holding off on hires because they are fearful about an economic slowdown or because of uncertainty about trade or tariffs. But other data, showing slower manufacturing activity and weaker investment spending, has been a concern.

""Certainly, it would be a problem if jobs were weak for a second month in a row. For the Federal Reserve, they're certainly worried and teed up to cut rates on July 31. Any weakness in payrolls for a second month would be a virtual green light for a Fed rate cut,"" said Rupkey. ""It's not going to be shocking for the market. ... But is the economy really ready to go into a tailspin with an actual downturn here? It just doesn't feel like it. Consumer spending is still high.""

But the average hourly wage number inside Friday's report could also be a factor for the Fed, especially if it's shy of expectations.

""Expectations are for a deceleration in job growth. Job growth is decelerating quite sharply from 2018. The real issue for the Fed is what's wage growth, and it's not been promising of late,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. ""We've seen 3.1% after hitting a peak of 3.4%. If we stay in that 3% range, that's enough for the doves at the Fed to go. The question is can they bring the hawks along with them. They're really going to be looking at the wage number.""

Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said he expects 135,000 jobs were added in June and that the report will show both a lack of workers and the impact of trade wars and tariffs on the economy. The ADP report is published in collaboration with Moody's. Zandi said the ADP report reflects just private sector hires, and he expects a surge in government workers in June.

""I think the trade war is causing real damage. We were going to see some slowdown anyway because we were not going to be able to fill these open positions. This feels like it's more than that. We went from a monthly gain of 225,000 last year to 165,000, and the recent numbers suggest we could be at 125,000 to 150,000. That's more than can be explained than that people can't find workers,"" said Zandi.

At J.P. Morgan, economists are expecting a below-consensus 140,000 jobs in June.

""We are watching the different labor market reports for information about how the job market is responding to recent news on trade policy and other economic developments. While there have been occasional worrisome readings, overall it looks like the trend in job growth is cooling, but not in an especially severe way. We continue to forecast that Friday's BLS report will show nonfarm job growth of 140,000 in June,"" wrote economist Daniel Silver."
