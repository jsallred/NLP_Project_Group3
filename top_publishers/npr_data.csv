A federal appeals court in Manhattan says President Trump cannot block critics from his Twitter account, calling it ""unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.""

In a 29-page ruling on Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's decision that found that Trump violated the First Amendment when he blocked certain Twitter users, because he uses his Twitter account ""to conduct official business and to interact with the public."" By preventing critics from accessing his feed, the president is barring them from participating in what the judges deemed a public forum.

""[The] First Amendment does not permit a public official who utilizes a social media account for all manner of official purposes to exclude persons from an otherwise-open online dialogue because they expressed views with which the official disagrees,"" the judges wrote.

The case stems from a lawsuit filed by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University on behalf of seven people who were blocked from the @realDonaldTrump account after posting replies criticizing the president and his policies. That meant the users could not view the president's tweets, reply directly to them or use the account's webpage to view the comment threads associated with Trump's tweets.

""Public officials' social media accounts are now among the most significant forums for discussion of government policy,"" Jameel Jaffer, the Knight Institute's executive director, who argued the case before the 2nd Circuit panel in March, said in a statement.

""This decision will ensure that people aren't excluded from these forums simply because of their viewpoints, and that public officials aren't insulated from their constituents' criticism,"" Jaffer said. ""The decision will help ensure the integrity and vitality of digital spaces that are increasingly important to our democracy.""

Several of the plaintiffs celebrated the legal victory on Twitter.

""We won on appeal,"" Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza wrote.

Buckwalter-Poza, who is a writer and legal analyst in Washington, D.C., said she was banned from the president's feed after a comment she posted about Russia's involvement in the election was retweeted by thousands of people.

""Take us to the Supreme Court if you dare @realDonaldTrump,"" wrote plaintiff Eugene Gu, a California surgeon and scientist.

Plaintiff Holly Figueroa, a Grammy-nominated songwriter and one of the national organizers of the March for Truth movement, wrote in a June 2017 piece for The Washington Post that she had ""accumulated a very vocal group of Twitter followers who cheer me on when I troll the president."" But she says she was blocked in May 2017 after a tweet in which she called Trump a ""bloody idiot.""

""The Founding Fathers didn't foresee Twitter, but they certainly provided a framework to make sure we could always engage with the people who purport to represent us,"" Figueroa wrote.

The government had argued that Trump acted as a private Twitter user when he blocked people on the social media platform, ""because the function is available to all users."" But the panel of judges said that argument ""founders in the face of the uncontested evidence"" that Trump's account is ""one of the White House's main vehicles for conducting official business.""

Trump often uses the platform to announce new policies, legislative changes, staff hirings and firings and diplomatic matters.

The court also noted that then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in 2017 that Trump's tweets should be considered ""official statements by the President of the United States.""

""In resolving this appeal, we remind the litigants and the public that if the First Amendment means anything, it means that the best response to disfavored speech on matters of public concern is more speech, not less,"" the judges wrote.

Trump has not tweeted about the ruling, but Justice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco said in a statement to NPR, ""We are disappointed with the court's decision and are exploring possible next steps."""

Updated at 6:45 p.m. ET

Planned Parenthood's President Leana Wen was removed from the position on Tuesday after less than a year on the job.

Wen, who said she and the board had been in negotiations about her management style, wrote on Twitter that she was ousted during a ""secret meeting.""

""I am leaving because the new Board Chairs and I have philosophical differences over the direction and future of Planned Parenthood,"" Wen later said in a statement.

""I believe the best way to protect abortion care is to be clear that it is not a political issue but a health care one, and that we can expand support for reproductive health care as the fundamental health care that it is,"" the 36-year-old former health commissioner in Baltimore added.

Wen took over in September 2018 after longtime president Cecile Richards stepped down. Wen was only the second medical doctor to run Planned Parenthood.

Her removal comes at a critical moment for the organization as state legislatures have recently passed severely restrictive abortion bans that could end up before the Supreme Court — and lead to the overturning of Roe v. Wade now that the court has a conservative majority with the addition of Brett Kavanaugh.

Wen's departure also follows an announcement by the Trump administration Monday night that it is enforcing a rule that clinics that refer patients for abortions risk losing federal funding under the Title X program.

The move is a major blow to Planned Parenthood which is the largest single recipient of funding from the program.

NPR's Sarah McCammon reported that Planned Parenthood employees have noted concerns about Wen's leadership style and questioned whether she was equipped to lead the organization through such a turbulent period. Additionally, they were increasingly uneasy about her ability to execute on the advocacy that the board sees as imperative to the group's mission.

However, McCammon reported, there is internal skepticism that Wen's firing stemmed from philosophical differences. One person said that Wen was perceived as being ""out of her depth.""

The board of directors of both the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund issued a terse statement Tuesday, thanking Wen for her brief stint at the helm but did not provide an explanation for her firing.

Alexis McGill Johnson is stepping in as acting president and CEO effective immediately.

""Alexis is a renowned social justice leader, lifelong political organizer, and a tireless advocate for reproductive rights and access to quality, affordable health care,"" PPFA board Chair Aimee Cunningham and PPAF Board Chair Jennie Rosenthal said in a joint statement.

McGill has served as a Planned Parenthood board member for nearly a decade and acted as Planned Parenthood's Board Chair from 2013 to 2015.

McGill said she is ""proud to step in to serve"" in the role and to "" facilitate a smooth leadership transition in this critical moment for Planned Parenthood and the patients and communities we serve.""

Planned Parenthood said it will start the search for a new leader early next year."

More than 60 percent of Mexicans believe migrants are a burden and that they take away jobs and benefits, according to a recent poll. A majority supports deporting them.

NOEL KING, HOST:

Last month, Mexico made a deal with the United States to crack down on Central American migrants who are trying to make their way to the U.S. border. In June, Mexico arrested and deported the highest number of migrants in more than 10 years, and there were questions about how this tough approach would play in Mexico. But new public polling shows that Mexicans are in favor of this strategy. James Fredrick has the story from Mexico City.

JAMES FREDRICK, BYLINE: A poll conducted by The Washington Post and Mexican newspaper Reforma shows 55% of respondents think migrants should be deported back to their home country. For years, the largest share of migrants going to the U.S. came from Mexico. But now with thousands of Central Americans fleeing violence, repression and poverty, Mexico has become primarily a transit country for migrants. Late last year, when a large migrant caravan marched through Mexico, polls showed a majority of Mexicans thought their country should help the caravan. But support for migrants has eroded since. Claudia Leon Ang studies migration in Mexico and is the operations director of the Jesuit Refugee Service. She says anti-immigrant sentiment often comes from local media.

CLAUDIA LEON ANG: (Speaking Spanish).

FREDRICK: She says the content and style of local news often frames migrants as criminals. It's a compelling narrative in a country experiencing its highest levels of violent crime ever. But she says there's no evidence that immigrants are a driving force behind crime. Another issue is the growing number of asylum-seekers stuck in Mexico. Under a U.S. policy known as Remain in Mexico, nearly 20,000 asylum-seekers have been sent back to Mexico to wait months or even years for their asylum case to be heard in the U.S. But 6 in 10 people polled said migrants are a burden on the country. Here's Claudia Leon again.

ANG: (Speaking Spanish).

FREDRICK: She says, in a country with so much inequality, poverty and abandonment by public institutions, you're going to generate resentment. It seems this is now a fight of the poor versus the poor, she says. Another important detail in the poll, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whose administration is leading the crackdown on migrants, has a 70% approval rating. The Mexican government may have public support, but it faces steeper challenges as tens of thousands of people hoping to request asylum in the U.S. may now be stuck in Mexico surrounded by a public that doesn't want them.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jonathan Wiggs/Boston Globe via Getty Images Jonathan Wiggs/Boston Globe via Getty Images

With his latest round of attacks on four first-year members of Congress who are women of color, President Trump has once again touched the raw nerve of racism in American life.

He has also tapped into one of the oldest strains in our politics — the fear and vilification of immigrants and their descendants.

Although three of the four women were born in the United States, the president said they should all ""go back"" where they came from. That phrase has echoed down generations of nativist discourse as successive waves of newcomers have been targeted by individuals, groups and even whole political parties.

At times, the motivations have been economic, focusing on competition for jobs and such social goods as housing or welfare programs. But there has also been a recurrent theme of cultural differences – an emphasis on characteristics of religion or language that identify new arrivals as ""the other.""

Anti-immigration sentiments emerged in force starting in the 1830s, when U.S. citizens descended primarily from English and Scottish settlers bridled at the influx of Irish. Most of the arriving Irish were Catholic, prompting a hostile reaction among some Protestants that led to deadly riots in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. The persistence of such prejudice made ""No Irish Need Apply"" one of the most iconic signs in the national memory.

After the Irish, the hostile reaction extended to a surge of new arrivals in the 1840s from Germany, again largely Catholic. In ethnic terms, the Irish and Germans were akin to other colonial Americans (and to immigrants arriving from Scandinavia). But they were viewed as different, clannish and hard to assimilate. They were seen as not just competing for jobs but as threatening the social, cultural and political order.

They were pilloried as susceptible to criminality and drunkenness and seen as loyal to the foreign power of the pope in Rome.

In the 1840s and 1850s, political parties formed in the U.S. to oppose the permissive immigration policies of the time. Some of these parties embraced the term ""Native American,"" spawning the label ""nativist"" that has stuck to succeeding generations of immigration opponents.

Perhaps the best known of these was the American Party, which began as a semi-secret society (""The Order of the Star Spangled Banner""), with members being told to deny any knowledge of it.

When they claimed to ""know nothing"" of the group, they were pilloried as the ""Know Nothing"" party – a name that would long survive the entity itself. The party railed against the new arrivals as an economic, social and cultural threat that was bringing crime, disease, social unrest and the prospect of political takeover at the local level.

The Know Nothings had attracted scores of members of the U.S. Congress at the height of their influence in the mid-1850s, stepping into the vacuum left by the collapse of the Whigs.

In 1856, they nominated Millard Fillmore, a former president and former Whig, as their national candidate. Fillmore got 21% of the popular vote but only a handful of Electoral College votes, as many of the Know Nothings crossed over to vote for John Fremont, the first nominee of the fledgling Republican Party.

The 1860s brought the Civil War and a desperate need for soldiers, leading to greater acceptance of new arrivals who were willing to join the Union Army. In the years that followed, some immigrants found acceptance as veterans, others made their way west to farm the interior or work in its burgeoning cities.

The Know Nothings were not an organized force again after the Civil War, but resistance to immigration never left the national conversation. The importation of Asians to work on the Western railroads and harvests introduced another enduring chapter of American nativism. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first legislation to restrict immigration based on nation of origin. Some of the jobs denied to Chinese workers were soon filled by Mexicans.

Toward the end of the 1800s, the flow of immigrants from Europe swelled again and changed in its origin. The new arrivals now hailed from Eastern and Southern Europe, as well as from countries that had been sending opportunity seekers across the Atlantic for generations.

The proportion of U.S. residents who were foreign-born hit 13.5% in the census report of 1911, the highest it had ever been and a level not reached again until the present decade.

When the World War I ended, anti-immigration sentiment reached a new level of intensity as it swept much of the country, helping to fuel a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan among other extremist groups.

An old association of immigration and urbanization was renewed when the census of 1920 showed immigrants had helped shift the center of U.S. population from rural areas to cities and big towns. Congress, dominated by members from rural, traditional parts of the country, simply refused to reapportion its seats and redraw election districts to reflect the new numbers.

That refusal lasted through four biennial election cycles, during which time Congress also passed an emergency ceiling on annual immigration levels and then lowered that by half again in the Immigration Act of 1924. That law set quotas by country of origin and explicitly preferred Northern Europeans over all others.

The official attitude in the 1920s and 1930s included an ambivalence toward refugees from conflicts around the world. In 1939, a German ship called the St. Louis tried to make port in Florida with more than 900 passengers, most of them Jewish refugees seeking asylum from Nazi persecution in Germany.

U.S. officials in the administration of President Franklin Roosevelt refused to let them land. They tried to persuade Cuba to take them, but without success. The ship returned to Europe, where many of the passengers were later arrested. Researchers believe that more than 250 perished in the Holocaust.

A generation later, in 1965, Congress passed a more liberal immigration law that eliminated quotas based on nation of origin. The law sought to reunite families and level the playing field for prospective immigrants around the world – and its impact went far beyond what its sponsors might have imagined.

The proportion of foreign-born in the U.S. population rose again from just 5% in 1965 to 14% over the next half century. And these new waves of arrivals would be far more diverse than their predecessors were. They came not only from different parts of Europe but from Asia, Africa and South America as well.

By the 1970s, the political focal point was the effect the law was having on the Southwest and the influx of Mexicans and other Spanish-speaking populations. Pressure for changing the law grew as latter-day nativists again saw the new arrivals as a social, cultural and political challenge.

Many of the same arguments made against previous generations of newcomers were lodged again against Hispanics, including that they would cling to their national culture and language and refuse to assimilate.

Labor groups also sought to control the competition from workers willing to take lower wages. But there were powerful business interests, particularly from the agricultural sector, determined to preserve access to migrant workers.

In 1986, the Simpson-Mazzoli Act sought to control future immigration, but also granted amnesty to millions of the undocumented people who were already residents. President Ronald Reagan signed it into law. It was a compromise meant to appease all sides, but it satisfied few.

President George W. Bush, who had long enjoyed high levels of Hispanic support as a candidate in Texas, threw his support behind a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws in the mid-2000s. He was joined by Republican rival Sen. John McCain of Arizona and by the Democratic leadership. But conservatives more generally opposed the bill as another extension of amnesty, despite all the sponsors' denials.

Since then, the Republican Party has moved far from the Reagan-Bush-McCain attitudes on immigration and embraced the nativist tradition that has also been an element in the mix of its history back to 1856.

Declaring his presidential candidacy in June of 2015, Trump issued his much-quoted summary of immigrants:

""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us. [sic] They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. ""It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all South and Latin America, and it's coming, probably, probably, from the Middle East. But we don't know, because we have no protection, and we have no competence and we don't know what's happening.""

By repeating that these immigrants are ""not ... you,"" the president defined these immigrants as ""the other"" in stark terms.

In the past two days, we have seen the president return to that blunt language in describing four women who were elected to Congress in November 2018, largely on the passion of their opposition to the nativism that he, and much of his party, have embraced.

The battle lines could not be clearer. And it is a battle that is nearly as old as America itself."

Updated 1:35 p.m. ET

Rep. John Ratcliffe is President Trump's choice to become the next top leader of the U.S. intelligence community.

The Texas Republican thanked Trump on Twitter following the president's earlier announcement, also on Twitter, that Ratcliffe is his nominee to replace outgoing Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.

Coats and Trump haven't been simpatico from the beginning, and the White House has been telling journalists for weeks that the president wants somebody else.

If the transition isn't a surprise, however, the choice of Ratcliffe might be — and some key senators have yet to state one way or another how they feel about the nominee.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., didn't mention Ratcliffe in a statement on Sunday that praised Coats but that also emphasized what McConnell called the need for a president to get candid advice.

""The U.S. intelligence community works best when it is led by professionals who protect its work from political or analytical bias and who deliver unvarnished hard truths to political leaders in both the executive and legislative branches,"" McConnell said. ""Very often the news these briefings bring is unpleasant, but it is essential that we be confronted with the facts.""

One question raised by McConnell's statement: Would Ratcliffe be so much of a loyalist that he would tell Trump only what he wanted to hear — and Congress and the public what Trump wanted them to hear? Or could he be the honest manager that the Senate majority leader says is needed?

Republicans control the Senate and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which would consider Ratcliffe's nomination before the full body voted to confirm him.

That's if Trump formally submits the congressman's name.

In the past, Trump has sometimes said he intends to nominate someone for a post but then has never actually transmitted the person's name to the Senate.

That's what happened, for example, when Trump nominated economics commentator Stephen Moore and former pizza magnate Herman Cain to the board of the Federal Reserve. Ultimately, senators were spared the need to actually assess or cast votes on them.

North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said in a statement Monday that he spoke with Ratcliffe over the weekend ""to congratulate him"" on the nomination.

Continued Burr: ""When the White House submits its official nomination to the Senate intelligence committee, we will work to move it swiftly through regular order.""

Other members of the panel have so far been silent on Ratcliffe's nomination.

Coats, a long-serving former member of Congress, was well known to many lawmakers and was confirmed in early 2017 by a vote of 85 to 12. At the same time, the Senate has considered and endorsed a close-call nominee of Trump's before — CIA Director Gina Haspel.

She was controversial because of her role in President George W. Bush's terrorist interrogation program, but she also was a career officer with deep experience inside the agency.

Ratcliffe sits today on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence but had little intelligence or foreign affairs experience before that, as some commentators observed after Trump's announcement.

Democrats faulted what they called Trump's bid to fill an important role with what they called a flunky and another ""television character.""

Trump vs. the spooks

Trump, Coats and the leaders of the intelligence community have endured uncomfortable stretches for as long as Trump has been in office.

The spy bosses assessed that North Korea is unlikely to surrender its nuclear weapons, for example, even though Trump has made much of his personal rapport with the country's leader, Kim Jong Un.

The leaders of the intelligence and national defense establishment told Congress that Iran was abiding by its commitments under the nuclear deal, but Trump sought to abrogate it and went ahead with withdrawing the United States.

And Coats and the other leaders of the intelligence community also continued their focus on foreign election interference in parallel with the investigation by then-special counsel Robert Mueller into Russia's attack on the 2016 election.

Trump goes back and forth as to what he accepts about foreign interference generally and Russia's role specifically in the 2016 election.

Agency leaders reportedly have been told, however, not to mention the topic to Trump and to keep their discussions of it ""below his level.""

The news on Sunday about Coats' departure and Ratcliffe's nomination followed an earlier announcement by Coats that he was appointing a new election security czar within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and was directing the other agencies within the intelligence community to do the same."

The first official presidential debate isn't until Oct. 3 in Denver. But as The New York Times writes, last night on CBS News' 60 Minutes there was something of a ""shadow debate that offered a likely preview of the tone and substance"" of what will happen on stage next week.

The Times notes that Republican nominee Mitt Romney, ""criticized President Obama ... for refusing to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, during this week's United Nations General Assembly meeting, saying it sends a message that the administration is distancing itself from an important Middle East ally.""

Obama, meanwhile, ""said he spoke frequently with Mr. Netanyahu ... [and] also challenged Mr. Romney, who has accused Mr. Obama of not standing up forcefully enough to Syria and Iran, to be more specific about his foreign policy plans. 'So if Governor Romney is suggesting that we should start another war,' Mr. Obama said, 'he should say so.' ""

On Morning Edition, NPR's David Schaper reported that during the interviews, Romney also said ""I'm going to win this thing,"" and that when it comes to the details of what loopholes, deductions and exemptions he would eliminate to help pay for his plan to lower taxes, ""that's something Congress and I will have to work out together.""

Pressed on why the nation's unemployment rate has remained above 8 percent throughout his time in office, Obama repeated something he's said many times on the campaign trail — that ""the hole was so deep when we got in [office] that we lost 9 million jobs. We've created 4.6 [million].""

60 Minutes has posted its report, and videos from the interviews, here.

Updated at 10:05 a.m. ET

When Toni Morrison received her Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993, her remarks began with a reflection on the phrase once upon a time. In her signature, measured cadence, Morrison told the Swedish Academy she believed these were some of the first words we remember from our childhoods.

Morrison, who was 88, died Monday night at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, according to her publisher, Penguin Random House. Morrison's family, in a statement released by the publisher, said she died ""following a short illness"" and surrounded by loved ones.

""She was an extremely devoted mother, grandmother, and aunt who reveled in being with her family and friends. The consummate writer who treasured the written word, whether her own, her students or others, she read voraciously and was most at home when writing,"" her family said. ""Although her passing represents a tremendous loss, we are grateful she had a long, well lived life.""

Morrison's work focused on African American life and culture, and she dominated an industry in which depictions of black life were often limited and rooted in stereotype.

Her masterwork, Beloved, was a ""once upon a time"" based in bloody truth. Its real-life inspiration was Margaret Garner, a woman who escaped slavery and attempted to kill herself and her children — her 2-year-old daughter died — rather than be captured and returned to a plantation. Beloved was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1988. A decade later, Oprah Winfrey produced and starred in a movie based on the book.

Morrison was 56 when Beloved was published in 1987, but she had been living with stories since childhood. Born Chloe Wofford, she grew up with tales being told all around her in her hometown of Lorain, Ohio. Her grandparents, like millions of blacks, left the segregated South for the North, during the Great Migration.

""I lived in a little working-class town that had no black neighborhoods at all ..."" Morrison told Fresh Air's Terry Gross in 2015. ""We all played together. Everybody was either somebody from the South or an immigrant from East Europe or from Mexico.""

She said that she wasn't particularly aware of segregation growing up, but that her father ""was very, very serious in his hatred of white people."" Her mother mitigated that. ""Everybody was an individual whom she approved of or disapproved of based on her perception of them as individuals,"" Morrison recalled.

As a child, young Chloe listened when the adults told stories about their Southern homes. In a 2010 interview, she said their language stayed with her. Within her own family, she said. ""There was street language, there was sermonic language. You know, people actually quoted the Bible to you.""

Wofford went to college at Howard University (where she became Toni, using the nickname of her baptismal saint, Anthony). It was there that she experienced, for the first time, a hierarchy of color within the African American community. ""On the campus, where I felt safe and welcome, I began to realize that this idea of the lighter, the better and the darker, the worse ... really had an impact on sororities, on friendships, on all sorts of things, and it was stunning to me,"" she said in 2015.

She earned her master's at Cornell and married architect Harold Morrison, with whom she had two sons. They divorced after seven years.

Morrison started her early publishing career as an editor, first in textbooks, then for general circulation books. She told an audience at the 92nd Street Y in New York that she wasn't happy with how most black books were being edited back then. ""I thought the editing was sloppy,"" she recalled. ""I thought the productions were mishandled, even the great books, like Roots. ... When you read them carefully, you'd see that nobody was paying any attention.""

So she consciously sought out excellent black authors, pulling them into what was — and mostly still is — the alabaster publishing industry. She edited Angela Davis, Muhammad Ali and the novelist Gayl Jones during the social upheaval of the late 1960s and early '70s. Morrison saw this as her contribution to the civil rights movement.

""I made it my business to collect African Americans who were vocal, either politically, or just writing wonderful fiction,"" she said.

Even as she edited, Morrison secretly wrote for herself, getting up before her children were awake. She later said that when she wrote, she was free from pain. ""It's where I have control,"" she said. ""It's where nobody tells me what to do. It's where my imagination is fecund and I am really at my best. ... I'm thinking up dangerous, difficult things, but it is also extremely safe for me to be in that place.""

The Bluest Eye By Toni Morrison Purchase BookPurchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

Her first book, The Bluest Eye, was published in 1970. It's a tale about a dark-skinned little girl who believes blue eyes will make her beautiful and cherished.

Piper Huguley, a professor at Spelman College in Atlanta, recalled how she felt when she read The Bluest Eye as a college student. It helped her see ""colorism and its connection to self-loathing, and how deeply embedded that could go,"" she said. It was a theme Morrison explored further in her 2015 book God Help the Child.

Huguley said that kind of frankness about race has made Morrison's work essential reading. ""She exists in a class we call Seminal Writers, that every English major must take,"" Huguley explained. ""That means she belongs for us here at Spelman, and no doubt elsewhere, as part of the African American literary canon, that is, an author who must be read.""

Morrison's stories weave between the familiar and the fantastical: In Song of Solomon, a key element was an ancient folk tale about black people flying away from enslavement and back home to Africa. The theme of mother-daughter love runs through several books, such as Beloved and A Mercy, in which women make terrible sacrifices for their children.

These are books that focus, without apology or explanation, on black lives. And in 1998, as a guest on a talk show, she said she had no interest in making white characters more central to her stories.

""I've spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books,"" she said.

Morrison was grounded in the black cultural liberationist art of the 1960s, said Richard Yarborough, who teaches African American literature at the University of California, Los Angeles. She and others in that generation ""expressed their mission"" by focusing on black lives, he said.

And generations of black female writers, no matter their genre, have been touched by her. ""Morrison is such a monumental figure, that there is no way you could write about black women's experiences without taking her into account,"" he said.

She showed, by example, the validity of black, female lives. And through her many ""once upon a times,"" Morrison's expansive vision of black humanity now resonates around the globe."

Federal immigration officials raided several food-processing plants in Mississippi on Wednesday and arrested approximately 680 people believed to be working in the U.S. without authorization.

The coordinated raids were conducted by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations ""at seven agricultural processing plants across Mississippi,"" according to an ICE statement. In addition to the arrests, agents seized company business records.

More than 600 ICE agents were involved in the raids, surrounding the perimeters of the targeted plants to prevent workers, mainly Latino immigrants, from escaping. The actions were centered on plants near Jackson owned by five companies, according to The Associated Press.

One of the plants is owned by Koch Foods Inc., which bills itself as one of the largest poultry processors in the U.S. with more than 13,000 employees. Forbes ranks it as the 135th largest privately held company in the country, with an estimated $3.2 billion in annual revenue, according to Fortune.

Another plant raided Wednesday is in Canton, Miss., and is owned by Peco Foods Inc., based in Tuscaloosa, Ala. It is the eighth-largest poultry producer in the U.S., according to the company's website.

No representatives for either company responded to an email request or telephone call for comment.

The arrested workers were bused to a local Mississippi National Guard hangar, where they were interviewed about their immigration status, including whether they already had deportation orders.

""Today's raids are part of the ongoing war against immigrant families and the communities in which they live,"" Julia Solórzano, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in an emailed statement. ""It is especially sickening that days after immigrants were targeted by a gunman in El Paso, Texas, workers at plants across Mississippi witnessed armed agents descending on their workplace.

""It's also worth noting that immigration agencies that have repeatedly blamed 'over capacity' detention facilities for the horrific treatment of those imprisoned nevertheless detained more than 600 people today,"" she said.

The size of the raid operation harks back to 2008 when, under the George W. Bush administration, more than 400 unauthorized workers were arrested in a meatpacking facility in Iowa."

Enlarge this image toggle caption John Moore/Getty Images John Moore/Getty Images

Using the example set by the life of slain U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, President Obama this morning told delegates to the United Nations that the diplomat's killers will not determine the world's future. Instead, Obama said, it will be people such as Stevens who build ""bridges across oceans and cultures"" and set the world's agenda.

We updated as the president spoke. Scroll down to read through the highlights.

Earlier today, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney spoke to the Clinton Global Initiative in New York City. See our post about that: ""Romney Touts 'Prosperity Pacts' To Help Middle East, Developing Nations."" Obama will address former President Clinton's forum later today.

Update at 10:52 a.m. ET. In Conclusion, He Returns To Stevens' Example:

""I promise you this,"" Obama says as he concludes. ""Long after these killers are brought to justice, Chris Stevens' legacy will live on in the lives he touched. In the tens of thousands who marched against violence through the streets of Benghazi; in the Libyans who changed their Facebook photo to one of Chris; in the sign that read, simply, 'Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans.'

""They should give us hope. They should remind us that so long as we work for it justice will be done; that history is on our side; and that a rising tide of liberty will never be reversed.""

Update at 10:47 a.m. ET. U.S. Will ""Do What We Must"" To Keep Iran From Developing Nuclear Weapons:

""Make no mistake,"" Obama says, ""a nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained. It would threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations, and the stability of the global economy. It risks triggering a nuclear-arms race in the region, and the unraveling of the non-proliferation treaty. That is why a coalition of countries is holding the Iranian government accountable. And that is why the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.""

Update at 10:43 a.m. ET. All Hate Speech Must Be Condemned:

""The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam,"" Obama says. ""Yet to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see when the image of Jesus Christ is desecrated, churches are destroyed, or the Holocaust is denied.""

Update at 10:36 a.m. ET. On The ""Crude And Disgusting Video"":

The president moves to the issue of the Innocence of Muslims video that has incited outrage and violence in some Muslim nations.

""I have made it clear that the United States government had nothing to do with this video,"" he says, ""and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity. It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well — for as the city outside these walls makes clear, we are a country that has welcomed people of every race and every faity. We are home to Muslims who worship across our country. We not only respect the freedom of religion — we have laws that protect individuals from being harmed because of how they look or what they believe. We understand why people take offense to this video because millions of our citizens are among them.

""I know there are some who ask why we don't just ban such a video. The answer is enshrined in our laws: our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech. Here in the United States, countless publications provoke offense. Like me, the majority of Americans are Christian, and yet we do not ban blasphemy against our most sacred beliefs. Moreover, as President of our country, and Commander-in-Chief of our military, I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day, and I will always defend their right to do so.""

Nations will disagree about whether limits should be put on free speech, Obmaa adds, but ""on this we must agree: there is no speech that justifies mindless violence.""

Update at 10:30 a.m. ET. Why Ambassador Stevens And Those Like Him Must Determine The World's Future:

As he begins his address, the president speaks of Chris Stevens, the slain U.S. ambassador to Libya.

""Chris Stevens embodied the best of America,"" Obama says. ""Like his fellow Foreign Service officers, he built bridges across oceans and cultures, and was deeply invested in the international cooperation that the United Nations represents. He acted with humility, but stood up for a set of principles – a belief that individuals should be free to determine their own destiny, and live with liberty, dignity, justice, and opportunity.

""The attacks on our civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America. We are grateful for the assistance we received from the Libyan government and the Libyan people. And there should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice. ...

""But understand, the attacks of the last two weeks are not simply an assault on America. They are also an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was founded — the notion that people can resolve their differences peacefully; that diplomacy can take the place of war; and that in an interdependent world, all of us have a stake in working towards greater opportunity and security for our citizens.

""If we are serious about upholding these ideals, it will not be enough to put more guards in front of an Embassy; or to put out statements of regret, and wait for the outrage to pass. If we are serious about those ideals, we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of this crisis. Because we face a choice between the forces that would drive us apart, and the hopes we hold in common.

""Today, we must affirm that our future will be determined by people like Chris Stevens, and not by his killers. Today, we must declare that this violence and intolerance has no place among our United Nations."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Zach Gibson/Getty Images Zach Gibson/Getty Images

Former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig goes on trial Monday, accused of making false statements connected to work he did on behalf of powerful interests in Ukraine.

Craig, a top attorney in Democratic political circles who worked for two Democratic presidents, was indicted in April on two counts of providing false statements to the Justice Department related to his Ukraine work. The judge presiding over the case threw out one of those counts last week, but Craig will still go to trial on the single remaining count.

The case against Craig, who has pleaded not guilty, was born out of former special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. During its investigation, Mueller's team uncovered evidence of alleged wrongdoing by Craig, but referred the material to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia for prosecution.

It is one of several cases to emerge from the Mueller inquiry that allege violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

The law, known as FARA, requires that people doing political or public relations work in the U.S. on behalf of a foreign entity disclose that fact. It is illegal to willfully not register or to provide false or misleading statements to the Justice Department's FARA unit.

Politics Lobbyists See The Indictment Of Powerful Lawyer Gregory Craig As A Warning Lobbyists See The Indictment Of Powerful Lawyer Gregory Craig As A Warning Listen · 2:48 2:48

In Craig's case, prosecutors say he did just that in connection with his work for the Ukrainian government. The indictment alleges that Craig withheld information that he knew he should have provided to the department and provided other information that he knew was incorrect.

Craig's lawyers, William W. Taylor III and William J. Murphy of the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder, have denied that Craig broke the law. In a statement at the time of the indictment, they called the government's prosecution ""a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion.""

The case against Craig dates back to work he and his law firm — Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom — did for Ukraine's pro-Russian government in 2012.

Paul Manafort, who was advising the government in Kiev at the time, helped hire Craig and Skadden to draw up a report on the government's prosecution of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.

Manafort, of course, later became Trump's campaign chairman in 2016 before quitting the post amid questions about his Ukraine work. He was later convicted in a bank and tax fraud trial in Virginia brought by Mueller's team.

Internationally, the case against Tymoshenko was viewed as a politically motivated sham pushed by her rival, then-President Viktor Yanukovych.

After it was brought on board, Skadden drew up a report that validated the Tymoshenko prosecution. Craig then allegedly briefed journalists to shape early international coverage of the report.

Craig and Skadden, however, did not register their activities with the Justice Department.

Prosecutors say Craig did not register his work with the Justice Department in order to avoid disclosing that Craig and Skadden had been paid $4 million for the work. Publicizing that fact would have undermined the perceived independence and credibility of the report, prosecutors say.

Early this year, Skadden reached a settlement of its own with the Justice Department that allowed it to avoid prosecution. It agreed to register under FARA and pay about $4.6 million.

Craig's trial opens Monday with jury selection. The trial is expected to last 2 1/2 weeks."

Two ads released Wednesday by the campaigns of President Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney are worth noting because of how they illustrate the very different challenges now facing the two candidates.

One thing both ads rest on is some form of guilt.

For Obama, who has the advantage of being ahead in new polls in several battleground states, the challenge is to keep his supporters from assuming the president has victory in the bag, and therefore not voting.

It's also a way to get them to vote in an election that lacks the history-making excitement of 2008, and which finds the hope of four years ago tempered by Washington reality.

So Obama's new ad uses the tried-and-true marketing technique of anticipatory guilt.

YouTube

In an ad clearly aimed at younger voters with gay or female friends, the narrator says:

""What are you going to tell them? You were just too busy. You didn't think it mattered."" (At this point, the screen is occupied by young men with video controllers in their hands who appear fixated on a game.)

""Is that what you're going to tell your friends who can't get married? The ones who couldn't serve openly in the military? Are you going to tell them they can't make decisions about their own bodies anymore because you didn't think your vote counted?""

You get the picture. With more than a month to go before Election Day, but with early voting either already under way or soon to start in some swing states, the Obama campaign is tugging firmly on the cord connected to the human guilt response.

Romney, by contrast, was working on doing some damage control following the release of the now-infamous video in which he can be seen talking about the ""47 percent"" of the electorate.

While he hasn't technically apologized for his remarks, Romney was clearly guilty of creating a controversy that appears to have hurt him in the polls.

To many who saw the video Mother Jones made famous, Romney was reminiscent of Gordon Gekko. It didn't help that he was already being likened to that fictional Wall Street master of the universe even before the video from the fundraiser emerged.

So Romney's ad featured the candidate talking directly into the camera to demonstrate that he does care about the concerns of average Americans. Repeating an argument he has turned to in recent days, Romney says in the ad:

YouTube

""Too many Americans are struggling to find work in today's economy. Too many of those who are working are living paycheck to paycheck trying to make falling incomes meet rising prices for food and gas. More Americans are living in poverty than when President Obama took office and 15 million more are on food stamps. ""President Obama and I both care about poor and middle-class families. The difference is my policy will make things better for them ... ""

Obviously, no presidential campaign would choose to spend its time and money essentially telling voters ""I care"" this late in the game. But it's a message Romney was forced into by the video made at the Boca Raton, Fla., fundraiser.

Meanwhile, the Obama campaign is already shifting its media messaging into get-out-the-vote mode. And in any election, it's getting out your vote that, in the end, really matters."

Updated at 5:37 p.m. ET

Planned Parenthood is leaving the federal Title X family planning program rather than comply with new Trump administration rules regarding abortion counseling.

The new rules, issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year, prohibit Title X grantees from providing or referring patients for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest or medical emergency.

""The Trump administration has forced Planned Parenthood grantees out of Title X,"" said Alexis McGill Johnson, Planned Parenthood's acting president, in a conference call Monday. ""The impact of the Trump administration's gag rule will reverberate across the country.""

Health Care Planned Parenthood May Reject Federal Funds Over Changes To Title X Planned Parenthood May Reject Federal Funds Over Changes To Title X Listen · 3:53 3:53

Officials say that means patients are likely to see longer wait times or increased costs for reproductive health services.

Planned Parenthood and other medical groups say the rule is unethical and interferes with the doctor-patient relationship. Abortion-rights opponents, meanwhile, have long argued for a complete separation between federal dollars and any organization involved in providing or facilitating abortions.

The announcement follows a letter submitted by Planned Parenthood last week to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. An attorney for Planned Parenthood said the organization had hoped to remain in the program but stop using Title X funds while the matter is being litigated. But, the letter says, recent guidance from HHS informed grantees that they would have to leave the program if they could not show ""good-faith efforts"" to comply. The letter expresses ""deep regret"" but says Planned Parenthood clinics ""now have no option but to withdraw from the Title X program.""

In a statement to NPR Monday, HHS officials said, ""Every grantee had the choice to accept the grant and comply with the program's regulations or not accept the grant if they did not want to comply. Some grantees are now blaming the government for their own actions – having chosen to accept the grant while failing to comply with the regulations that accompany it – and they are abandoning their obligations to serve their patients under the program.""

Planned Parenthood's withdrawal from the $286 million federal program represents a significant shift in the way the family planning program operates. The organization has been involved in the program since its inception, and officials say it serves about 40% of the nation's 4 million Title X recipients, who receive services such as contraception and STD screenings.

Planned Parenthood officials declined to say how much money flows to the organization's clinics nationwide through Title X.

Doreen Denny, senior director of government relations for Concerned Women for America, which opposes abortion rights, called the news ""a day of reckoning and decision"" for Planned Parenthood.

""I think that Planned Parenthood certainly knew that they had a choice to make when they first applied for grants this round. They knew that these rules could take effect,"" Denny said. ""So this isn't a surprise to them.""

Abortion-rights opponents have called on political leaders to defund Planned Parenthood and have praised President Trump for his administration's efforts to deliver on his campaign promise to do just that.

The impact of the rule change is not limited to Planned Parenthood. Maine's sole Title X grantee, Maine Family Planning, is also withdrawing. In a letter to HHS, CEO George Hill said his group is leaving the program ""more in sorrow than in anger.""

Emily Nestler is an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Maine Family Planning in its own legal challenge to the Trump administration rules. She said the move could force as many as 15 clinics to close in the largely rural state.

""Today is the tipping point, I think, and you're going to really see the unwinding of a program that has provided extraordinary care and been a huge success for decades,"" Nestler said in an interview with NPR.

Anti-abortion advocates say they hope the changes to the Title X program will open up funding for other groups, including religiously based organizations and crisis pregnancy centers that counsel women against abortions. Some of those groups do not provide a full range of contraceptive services."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eraldo Peres/AP Eraldo Peres/AP

Brazil says it will reject an offer of at least $22 million from the rich countries in the Group of Seven to help fight fires sweeping through the Amazon rainforest. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says he doesn't want the money — unless it comes with an apology from French President Emmanuel Macron.

Bolsonaro and Macron have engaged in a days-long spat after the French leader used the G-7 summit this week to call for action to protect the Amazon and said the fires are a world environmental crisis that Bolsonaro has allowed to worsen. He also said that Bolsonaro, a climate change skeptic, had lied about his effort to combat deforestation.

Bolsonaro responded angrily, saying Macron had insulted him and was trying to undermine Brazil's sovereignty by intervening in the Amazon.

""This squabble is infuriating Bolsonaro's critics,"" NPR's Philip Reeves reports from Rio de Janeiro. ""They say he should fight the fires — not the French.""

On Monday, Bolsonaro said in a tweet that he won't accept what he called Macron's ""attacks."" He also accused Macron of treating Brazil ""as if we were a colony or no man's land.""

In an interview on French TV, Macron later referred to the Amazon as ""the lungs of the planet"" and pledged that the G-7 countries would help Brazil balance its economic development with environmental concerns. In an aside addressed to Bolsonaro, he added, ""But we cannot allow you to destroy everything.""

On Tuesday morning, Bolsonaro said Macron would have to take back all the things he said about him before he would even consider the offer of monetary aid from members of the G-7: the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.

Bolsonaro made those remarks to reporters in Brasilia shortly after the website G1 reported that the president's chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, had rejected the offer outright.

""Thanks, but perhaps these resources are more relevant to reforesting Europe,"" Lorenzoni was quoted as saying. Referring to the recent Notre Dame blaze in Paris, he went on to suggest that if Macron cannot ""avoid a predictable fire in a church,"" he might not have much to teach to Brazil.

YouTube

President Trump came to Bolsonaro's defense on Tuesday, saying via Twitter, ""He is working very hard on the Amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of Brazil — Not easy.""

In reply, Bolsonaro thanked Trump and wrote, ""The fake news campaign built against our sovereignty will not work.""

Macron made the devastating fires in the Amazon a key point for the G-7 summit even before meetings began in Biarritz, France. ""The ocean and the forest that burns in the Amazon call us. We have to answer them,"" he said, adding, ""The time is no longer for words, but for deeds.""

The offer of money from the G-7 nations also has drawn attention over its modest size — because it is coming from some of the world's largest economies and because of the task it is meant to accomplish.

""It's really only symbolic,"" Nigel Sizer, the chief program officer at the nonprofit Rainforest Alliance, told NPR. ""It's less than Americans spend on popcorn in a typical day.""

In that light, Sizer said, it's not surprising that Brazil has rejected the offer. And he added that the problem is partly political, as well.

""The fact is that Brazil has the resources and the expertise to address this challenge,"" Sizer said. ""Since the Bolsonaro government came into power at the beginning of this year, they have systematically defunded their environmental protection agencies.""

The shocking losses in the Amazon rainforest have prompted intense reactions globally. In addition to the formal G-7 offer, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has offered to send the affected nations 10 million pounds (around $12.2 million), and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered to send CA$15 million (around $11.2 million) and water bomber planes to fight the fires.

As awareness has spread on social media and elsewhere, donations have poured in from all over, Sizer said.

""The people of the world actually are pledging more resources than the G-7 has been committing,"" he said. ""We've seen millions and millions of dollars coming in.""

Actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio has also stepped in, with his Earth Alliance group creating a $5 million emergency Amazon fund to help indigenous communities and others who are working to protect the Amazon's prodigious biodiversity from being destroyed."

Early in-person voting has begun in Iowa, the first swing state to open polling sites.

Residents of the battleground state can now vote in person at their local county auditors' offices or turn them in by mail. Some areas will offer additional satellite locations.

At the Polk County Auditor's office in downtown Des Moines Thursday morning, a line of voters stretched down the block as the door opened.

Peter Clay, 62, was among the many supporters of President Obama. He says he's volunteered for the campaign on his days off from his job as a zookeeper.

""It's important to have a lot of folks showing up today because it shows there's passion and energy in this campaign,"" Clay says. ""This is our first chance to show how much we care about the outcome and to demonstrate we want this president in office for another four years.""

Democrats also seemed to dominate as Johnson County opened its polls in Iowa City.

Victoria Walton, a librarian in Iowa City and an Obama supporter, says she doesn't see any reason to hold off until Election Day.

""I'm very concerned about the election, and wanted to place my vote as soon as possible,"" she says. ""I've already decided and the debates are not going to change my mind in any way. I've been listening carefully and thinking about this a long time.""

Aleta Alexander, 63, of Waterloo in eastern Iowa, was among several voters who said they were volunteering for the Obama campaign.

""I voted for him in 2008 because I thought for sure he was the president that was for all the people — not just blacks for whites or whatever but for everybody,"" she says. ""And I still believe that. So that's why I'm voting for him again.""

There were Romney supporters, even if they were a bit harder to find.

Virginia Sourbeer of Des Moines, a retired state legislative staffer and former teacher, describes herself as socially moderate. But she says she's worried about the federal budget and spending in programs like Medicare and Social Security.

Sourbeer says she trusts Romney more when it comes to the economy.

""I just think that his background, for one thing, and his record in Massachusetts, that he dealt with difficult economic times there, that he'll deal with the issue,"" she says. ""Because we've had somebody who will not deal with the issue the last four years.""

The Republican National Committee's Iowa spokesman, Tom Szold, says Republicans have intentionally held off on most efforts to promote absentee voting until this week. He says they believe Romney voters will show up on Election Day if not before.

""It's common knowledge that the Democrats are ahead of us in this,"" he says. ""They start much earlier and they focus largely on their base. And we think that's because they're basically worried that their base is not going to turn out on Election Day.""

But Erin Seidler, President Obama's campaign spokeswoman in Iowa, says promoting early voting just makes sense.

""We have 40 days to vote in Iowa. Why you would let any one of those days go by without getting folks to the polls is surprising to me,"" Seidler says.

The Obama campaign has pushed early voting across the country, urging Iowans in particular to ""Be the First"" to vote for the president.

Democrats have requested the overwhelming majority of absentee ballots in Iowa. But Republicans have an 18,000-person lead in voter registration.

Polk County Auditor Jamie Fitzgerald says Democrats have a longer track record of working to get out the early vote.

""Recently Republicans have started doing it,"" he says. ""So the numbers are going to come a little bit closer. But the Democrats have been known for a lot of shoe leather, and working early.""

Iowa is among more than 30 states that allow early voting.

An oddity of U.S. presidential politics is that candidates and their campaigns spend nearly all their time telling voters how superior they are to their rivals in virtually every area: the wisdom of their policy proposals; the soundness of their characters and judgments — everything, really.

Except for debating.

It's the old game of setting the bar high for your opponent and lower for your candidate, of course. That way, anything short of a disastrous debate performance can be claimed as a knockout victory.

Still, it's curious, given that presidential campaigns usually aren't in the business of acknowledging that the other side could be more competent in something. Indeed, they spend millions of dollars trying to establish just the opposite.

The 2012 election cycle's example of this practice is a memo to ""interested parties"" from the Romney campaign first reported by CNN. The memo from Beth Myers, a senior adviser to Mitt Romney, sings President Obama's praises as a debater. An excerpt:

""President Obama is a uniquely gifted speaker, and is widely regarded as one of the most talented political communicators in modern history. This will be the eighth one-on-one presidential debate of his political career. For Mitt Romney, it will be his first."" ""Four years ago, Barack Obama faced John McCain on the debate stage. According to Gallup, voters judged him the winner of each debate by double-digit margins, and their polling showed he won one debate by an astounding 33-point margin. In the 2008 primary, he faced Hillary Clinton, another formidable opponent — debating her one-on-one numerous times and coming out ahead. The takeaway? Not only has President Obama gained valuable experience in these debates, he also won them comfortably.""

But the 2008 race was a long time ago. The president obviously hasn't had many opportunities to keep his debating chops in performance shape.

Indeed, it's more plausible that, far from being well-primed by his 2008 experiences for Wednesday's debate, the first of three, he'll be rusty.

Then there's Romney's participation in 23 debates during the Republican primaries, which served the role of warm-up bouts to the championship fights to occur in October.

That's not exactly the rationale White House and campaign officials are leaning on to explain why Romney has the alleged edge. Instead, they have focused on how busy the president has been doing his day job, leaving less time than they had hoped for debate rehearsals.

Jen Psaki, the Obama campaign's traveling press secretary, made the point on Thursday as the president traveled to Ohio to campaign, that not only has Romney spent more time preparing for the debate than the current president, but probably more time in preparations than any other president.

""The president will have some time to prepare, and he's been doing some studying, but it is certainly less than we have anticipated because of events in the Middle East, because of his busy travel schedule — because of just the constraints of governing. So it is less than we originally planned. ""Mitt Romney, on the other hand, has been preparing earlier and with more focus than any presidential candidate in modern history. Not John F. Kennedy. Not President Bill Clinton. Not President George Bush. Not Ronald Reagan has prepared as much as he has. So there's no question that he will have a lead on how prepared he is.""

Psaki was asked what the worst-case debate scenario could be for the president:

""Well, he could fall off the stage.""

In the annals of expectations-setting for a presidential candidate, that may take the prize."

Updated at 5:10 a.m. ET Thursday

Hurricane Dorian is ""expected to become a major hurricane on Friday,"" according to the National Hurricane Center.

Maximum sustained winds at 5 a.m. ET Thursday were 85 mph — a Category 1 hurricane — with higher gusts, according to the center's most recent update. Dorian was about 150 miles north northwest of Puerto Rico, moving about 13 mph toward the northwest.

Dorian's sustained winds topped 80 mph, hitting Puerto Rico and St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands before heading northwest. Forecasters are now warning that the storm will strengthen into a dangerous Category 3 hurricane, defined as sustained winds of at least 111 mph.

""Heavy rains are expected to occur over portions of the Bahamas, Florida, and elsewhere in the Southeastern United States later this week and into early next week,"" forecasters said.

""All indications are that by this Labor Day weekend, a powerful hurricane will be near or over the Florida peninsula,"" the National Hurricane Center said at 5 a.m. ET.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for 26 counties in the possible path of the hurricane.

""The Hurricane Warning for Vieques, Culebra, and the U.S. Virgin Islands has been discontinued,"" the National Hurricane Center report said earlier. ""The Hurricane Watch and Tropical Storm Warning for Puerto Rico have been discontinued.""

Dorian caused only limited damage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

""We're happy because there are no damages to report,"" Culebra Mayor William Solís told The Associated Press. He said only one community on his island lost power.

Current predictions show Dorian's center hitting Florida's coast late Sunday/early Monday.

The hurricane center has said it's too early to give an exact location where the eye will come ashore, and everyone in the affected area should make emergency preparations.

The NHC said the northern Bahamas and coastal sections of the Southeast United States could see 4 to 8 inches of rain, with 10 inches possible in isolated areas. ""This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods,"" it said.

NHC Director Ken Graham cautioned that anyone on the Southeastern U.S. coast from Florida up through Georgia and South Carolina should watch for potential hazards.

Earlier, President Trump had declared an emergency in the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, ordering the Federal Emergency Management Agency late Tuesday to provide ""equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency.""

Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced thanked Trump for approving the declaration, saying it would ""allow federal aid to arrive more quickly"" after the storm passes.

Trump approved an emergency declaration for the Virgin Islands on Wednesday.

In a statement about its preparations, FEMA said that its ""stock on the island compared to 2017 levels includes three times as many generators, nine times as many meals, five times as many liters of water and 16 times as many blue tarps.""

Meanwhile, the fifth named storm of the 2019 Atlantic season formed late Tuesday, as Tropical Storm Erin's winds reached 40 mph. The storm, which was several hundred miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C., was downgraded to a tropical depression on Wednesday. Erin is expected to remain on a north-northeastern track, likely arriving at Canada's coast late this week.

Enlarge this image toggle caption WPA Pool/Getty Images WPA Pool/Getty Images

Updated at 6 p.m. ET

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ready to call a snap election after lawmakers cleared the way for a vote on Wednesday to prevent the U.K. from leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement at the end of October.

The announcement was the culmination of a dramatic day that saw a defection rob Johnson and his ruling Conservative Party of their single-seat majority in Parliament.

""I don't want an election, but if MPs vote tomorrow to stop negotiations and to compel another pointless delay to Brexit potentially for years then that will be the only way to resolve this,"" Johnson said after the 328 to 301 vote to seize control of parliamentary time on Wednesday.

A general election, which Johnson's aides say he wants for Oct. 14, would be the third in just four years for Britons.

On Tuesday, less than two months from the date he set for the U.K.'s divorce from the European Union — with or without a deal on the terms of the breakup — Johnson suffered another significant blow to his fraying support in Parliament: Phillip Lee, a fellow Tory, defected from Johnson's Conservative Party in a dramatic scene in the House of Commons.

As Johnson addressed the chamber, Lee silently crossed the room and took a seat with the opposition Liberal Democrats under a heavy rain of jeers and cheers from his fellow members of Parliament. The seemingly outsize reaction was warranted: The loss of Lee's vote erases the tenuous working majority enjoyed by the prime minister's coalition, just as a possible vote looms on a bill that would bar Johnson from leaving the European bloc without a deal.

""Sadly, the Brexit process has helped to transform this once great Party in to something more akin to a narrow faction, where an individual's 'conservativism' is measured by how recklessly one wishes to leave the European Union,"" Lee said in a statement released on Twitter. ""Perhaps most disappointingly, it has increasingly become infected with the twin diseases of populism and English nationalism.""

Lee's defection comes on perhaps the most consequential day so far for Johnson's young premiership. Parliament returned to session for the first time since the prime minister moved to suspend the lawmaking body, beginning around Sept. 9 and leaving it in recess until Oct. 14 — or for more than half the weeks remaining before Johnson's deadline.

That decision elicited fierce resistance, not just from opposition lawmakers but from members within his own party, as well. Commons Speaker John Bercow, for one, said last week that the suspension of Parliament ""represents a constitutional outrage,"" and more than a dozen of Johnson's own Tories have threatened to back the bill blocking a no-deal Brexit.

Meanwhile, protests have erupted outside the Houses of Parliament, as well.

Johnson, for his part, has sought to quell the mutiny within the Conservative Party with threats of deselection and expulsion.

""To these rebels in his own party, he said, effectively, 'I'm going to kick you out if you defy me.' And this would effectively end their careers,"" NPR's Frank Langfitt explained on Morning Edition Tuesday before the day's tumult in the House of Commons. ""Some people find this quite ruthless, but the rebels' view is that 'we're going to choose what we see as the future of the country and the best interests of the country over party.' ""

Johnson could also seek a snap general election next month if he does not get his way — which would be the U.K.'s third general vote in three years. On NPR's Here and Now, Langfitt explained that Johnson may choose to run a campaign critical of Parliament and essentially say that lawmakers are ""trying to rob the people of the Brexit vote"" — and that he just needs an electoral majority to push it through.

""One thing is critical: If we are to succeed in these negotiations [with EU officials], we need to get behind the prime minister,"" Conservative MP Michael Gove told lawmakers Tuesday in the House of Commons.

""And if it is the case that the motion before the House is passed tonight and the legislation which it gives effect to is passed tomorrow,"" he continued, ""then we will allow the European Union to dictate the length of any extension and to put any conditions they wish to on that extension. That would totally undermine the government's capacity to negotiate in the national interest.""

Jo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the party to whom Lee defected, didn't buy arguments such as Gove's

""The prime minister has lost his majority with the honorable member from Bracknell joining the Liberal Democrats,"" she said on the chamber floor, adding: ""When will the prime minister stop playing with people's lives and stop Brexit?"""

Updated at 5:05 p.m. ET

U.S. employers added 130,000 jobs in August, according to a monthly snapshot from the Labor Department, signaling a slowdown in the pace of job growth.

Forecasters surveyed by the Reuters news service had predicted job gains of around 158,000.

The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%.

The jobs total would have been lower without the addition of 25,000 temporary census jobs. Job gains for the two previous months were revised downward by a total of 20,000.

The report will be studied closely by forecasters trying to gauge the strength of the U.S. economy, which has been sending mixed signals in recent days.

Surveys this week from the Institute for Supply Management painted starkly different pictures of the manufacturing sector, which has been battered by the U.S. trade war with China, and the much larger services side of the economy, which continues to show strong growth.

Factories added just 3,000 jobs last month. Manufacturing activity shrank in August for the first time in three years.

""We've certainly seen a divide where the manufacturing sector has weakened much more notably,"" said senior economist Sarah House of Wells Fargo Securities. ""But we have seen some softening in the broader service sector as well.""

Employers added fewer than two-thirds as many service jobs in August as in the two previous months.

Still, manufacturing is more sensitive than the services sector to global forces such as the trade war. If the manufacturing slowdown is contained, the fallout could be limited.

""We haven't had a manufacturing-led recession for 50 years,"" said Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""[It] doesn't mean we couldn't. But we're now talking about a sector that's 8% of employment and 11% of output. Those numbers used to be three times that.""

Bernstein said that while the manufacturing sector is probably in a recession already, that need not bring down the larger economy.

""It's not pretty and it's not something I like to see and it's a totally self-inflicted wound, so it's really dumb,"" said Bernstein, who served as economic adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden. ""But I don't know that it's recessionary at this point.""

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell also downplayed recession fears Friday during an appearance in Switzerland.

""We see the most likely case for the U.S. and for the world, too, as continued moderate growth,"" Powell said. ""We're going to continue to act as appropriate to sustain this expansion.""

The Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point when officials meet later this month. But Powell acknowledged differences among his colleagues about how much monetary medicine the slowing economy needs.

""There will always be questions about how much to do and how fast to move,"" Powell said. ""Sometimes things are relatively clear. Other times, it's murky out there. There's a range of views. And I think this is one of those times.""

The jobs report seemed likely to reinforce those Fed officials who are calling for a modest dose of additional stimulus.

Average hourly wages rose by 11 cents in August, to $28.11 — an average annual increase of 3.2%.

Wage gains and low unemployment helped to fuel strong consumer spending during the spring and summer.

""Household consumption right now is propping up the U.S. economy,"" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist for the audit and consulting firm RSM. ""We'll see if the uncertainty tax that's been placed on the economy by trade policy begins to adversely influence consumer attitudes.""

A significant chunk of consumer spending is now going to nontraditional retailers. The retail sector continued to hemorrhage workers, shedding 11,000 jobs in August.

There was some positive news in the monthly jobs report. The labor force participation rate jumped two-tenths of a percentage point to 63.2%. And the average workweek rose by a tenth of an hour."

A judge is basically ""postponing Pennsylvania's tough new voter identification requirement, ordering that it not be enforced in the presidential election,"" The Associated Press writes.

But in a ruling that's rather difficult to follow if you're not very familiar with the case, Commonwealth Court Judge Robert Simpson also says he ""will not restrain election officials from asking for photo ID at the polls; rather, I will enjoin enforcement of those parts of Act 18 which directly result in disenfranchisement.""

Simpson ruled that a voter's ""provisional ballot"" cannot be declared invalid because of the lack of an ID and that the state's transitional effort to amend its laws regarding such votes must not take effect before Election Day — Nov. 6.

So, it appears from his ruling, election officials can ask for an ID. But a voter's lack of one will not invalidate his vote.

The ruling can be appealed to the state's Supreme Court.

As the AP wrote before the ruling was released:

""Pennsylvania's new law, among the toughest in the nation, is a signature accomplishment of Republicans in control of Pennsylvania state government who say they fear election fraud. But it is an emotional target for Democrats who call it a Jim Crow-style scheme to make it harder for their party's traditional voters, including young adults and minorities, who might not carry the right kind of ID or know about the law.""

Update at 10:20 a.m. ET. Bottom Line Is ""Pennsylvanians will not be required to show ID to vote this year.""

Harrisburg's The Patriot-News sums up the story this way:

""Commonwealth Court Judge Robert Simpson has ruled that Pennsylvanians will not be required to show ID to vote this year. Simpson is postponing Pennsylvania's tough new voter identification requirement, ordering that it not be enforced in the presidential election. ... ""The ruling means people will be asked to show ID but will be allowed to vote even if they don't. That was also the policy in effect for the primary this year.""

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette explains Simpon's ruling this way:

""The injunction would have the effect of extending the transition period of the law — when voters were asked for identification but could vote without it — through the November election."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP

Updated at 6:25 p.m. ET

House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff vowed Thursday he is willing to sue the Trump administration over a dispute about the content of an as-yet-unknown complaint to the intelligence community's official watchdog.

Schiff told reporters after a closed-door meeting with the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, that the Justice Department has opined that the material is shielded by privilege and can be withheld from lawmakers.

Not so, Schiff argued, and ""if we have to go to court to get this, we will have a good case.""

The dispute is over a complaint to Atkinson brought by someone inside the spy world over activity involving someone high-ranking, which Schiff said very likely means Trump or someone close to him.

Newspapers have reported the basis of the complaint involved something Trump said to a foreign leader. Schiff said on Thursday he doesn't know whether that is accurate, but he argued the law and practice are clear: Congress oversees the spy agencies and in this case it must see the materials at issue.

""If any party — whether it's the Department of Justice or the White House or someone indeed who may be the subject of the complaint — is able to ... deprive Congress of that information simply because they choose to, then the whistleblower statute doesn't work at all and it chills people from coming forward,"" Schiff told NPR Thursday afternoon.

Trump scoffs

President Trump denied on Thursday he said anything inappropriate to a foreign leader.

The Washington Post reported that Trump, in a phone call with an unnamed foreign leader, made an unspecified promise that so alarmed one member of the intelligence community, it yielded the complaint.

In a series of tweets, Trump called the report ""Fake News.""

""Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself,"" Trump wrote, adding: ""No problem!""

Trump went on to wonder, ""is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!""

Schiff said in an earlier statement that the intelligence community's IG determined that this complaint is ""both credible and urgent, and that it should be transmitted to Congress under the clear letter of the law. The committee places the highest importance on the protection of whistle-blowers and their complaints to Congress.""

Schiff said acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will testify in an open session before the panel next week.

""We will hear more. We will learn more,"" he said. And if that hearing does not answer some of these questions, Schiff said, he will confer with the House's general counsel about legal action.

The committee later released letters it received from the inspector general.

The panel also released a letter from Schiff to acting DNI Maguire.

The alleged phone call

The Post reported that the as-yet-unknown intelligence official filed a formal complaint to the IG on Aug. 12 and that records show the president had ""conversations or interactions"" with five foreign leaders in the preceding weeks, including a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and two letters from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Other members of Congress away from Schiff's committee say they are waiting to learn more about what's behind all the hubbub. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who sits on the Senate intelligence committee, said he believes his panel may be next in line.

""I'm anxious to hear more about it, but I expect we will in due course,"" he said.

New battle, old war

The contretemps over the IG complaint is the latest political battle between Schiff and Trump, who skirmished for months during the height of the Russia imbroglio.

Schiff was among Democrats who said there was evidence that Trump's camp colluded with the Russian attack on the 2016 election, citing the meeting that Donald Trump Jr. and other top aides took with a delegation from Moscow that year at Trump Tower.

But Schiff also alluded to evidence that wasn't public, including with questions about whether Trump Jr.'s phone records from before the Trump Tower meeting might suggest that he had spoken with his father as it was being arranged.

As it turned out, they did not, and Trump Jr. and the president have made Schiff a target of mockery and one of the faces of what Trump says is baseless hounding.

The president revived that leitmotif on Thursday with another post on Twitter that complained about ""Presidential Harassment!""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Steve Helber/AP Steve Helber/AP

A Virginia judge has blocked efforts to remove the statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee that was at the center of the deadly violence that erupted in Charlottesville in 2017.

In a ruling issued this week, Judge Richard E. Moore said that any effort to remove the Lee statue would violate a state historic preservation statute and issued a permanent injunction preventing its removal. His decision extended to a separate monument to Confederate general Stonewall Jackson that city leaders and local activists had hoped to get rid of.

In 2017 Charlottesville's city council voted to remove the two statues, saying they were examples of racism.

Local residents filed a lawsuit in response, saying the council vote violated a state law barring the removal of war memorials. That August, white nationalists rallied in the city to protest the removal of the Lee statue. The rally would lead to the death of 32-year-old counter-protester Heather Heyer, and two state troopers who were killed in a helicopter crash while patrolling the rally.

In the aftermath of the violence, black shrouds were placed over the two statues, but in February 2018, Moore ordered them removed.

In his latest ruling, Moore cited the intent of the preservation law, saying, ""I don't think I can infer that a historical preservation statute was intended to be racist,"" he said. ""Certainly, [racism] was on their minds, but we should not judge the current law by that intent.""

Moore determined damages could not be awarded, but that attorneys' fees would be given to the plaintiffs' counsel."

Updated at 7:15 p.m. ET

President Trump said Wednesday that the push for his impeachment is a ""hoax,"" again denying any wrongdoing during a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during which he pushed for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 rival.

""No push, no pressure, no nothing — it's all a hoax, folks. It's all a big hoax,"" Trump said.

Trump's remarks capped a whirlwind day of revelations, allegations and counterclaims that have rocked Washington and are likely to play a pivotal role in the runup to the 2020 presidential election. An account of his scrutinized July call with the Ukrainian president was released Wednesday morning, and Trump's Republican allies contend that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has made a fatal error by pursuing an impeachment inquiry into the president over the allegations. The Democrats, meanwhile, say they believe the account of the call provides sufficient evidence of Trump's alleged wrongdoing.

At a news conference in New York, Trump also said that he has spoken with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Republicans and that he ""fully supports transparency"" on the whistleblower information.

He took few questions about the Ukraine call, instead opining mostly about the economy, trade, meetings with world leaders and other matters.

Congressional members review whistleblower account

On Wednesday afternoon, congressional leaders and members of the House and Senate intelligence committees were allowed to view the still-classified whistleblower account.

House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said he found the allegations set forth ""deeply disturbing,"" ""very credible,"" ""well-written"" and a road map for follow-up from ""other witnesses.""

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said the report was ""serious, urgent and credible and we should hear from the whistleblower"" via testimony.

He also told NPR's All Things Considered that he did not see the full report and that the committee will ask acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire for more materials in a meeting Thursday.

""It's really unfortunate that for the first time in the history of the whistleblower law for the intelligence community that we are being blocked from hearing from the whistleblower or having the full report,"" Swalwell said.

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., said he plans to push Maguire for answers on what the motivations were behind not turning the whistleblower report over to Congress.

""It's very well done. It's thorough,"" Krishnamoorthi said. ""It raises a lot of questions about what else is out there.""

Republicans were largely silent on Wednesday evening, but Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., told CNN's Jeff Zeleny that there were ""real troubling things"" in the complaint.

""Republicans ought not just circle the wagons and Democrats ought not be using words like 'impeach' before they knew anything about the actual substance,"" Sasse — who once frequently criticized Trump but has since garnered his endorsement — said.

Rough transcript contradicts Trump denials

Trump has been defending the call, saying the record proves he did not pressure the Ukrainian leader. But that isn't quelling the movement toward impeachment in Congress — in fact, top House Democrats say it confirms the need for an inquiry.

The president said he decided to release the call recap, saying, ""I was just getting such fake news, I just thought it would be better.""

Trump also said he would be willing to release a prior call with Zelenskiy, along with conversations that Vice President Pence had with the foreign leader.

Earlier on Wednesday, Trump appeared alongside Zelenskiy from New York, where both denied that Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden's son Hunter.

Trump emphasized that there was ""no pressure"" and repeated stories that he and his private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have told that insinuate the younger Biden took part in corrupt activities in China and Ukraine. As explained here, Trump and Giuliani have not provided any evidence of wrongdoing.

When asked whether he had been pushed to investigate Hunter Biden, Zelenskiy said, ""I'm sorry, but I don't want to be involved in democratic, open elections in USA."" He described the phone call as ""good"" and ""normal."" ""We spoke about many things,"" Zelenskiy said, adding later, ""Nobody pushed me.""

But the rough transcript contradicts those denials. Trump notes at the outset that ""we do a lot for Ukraine."" He asks Zelenskiy about a ""favor,"" later going on to tell him ""I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation in Ukraine"" and the Bidens.

Democrats move forward on impeachment inquiry

Earlier Wednesday, Pelosi said in a statement that ""the transcript and the Justice Department's acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President's lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry.""

Pelosi added, ""I respect the responsibility of the President to engage with foreign leaders as part of his job. It is not part of his job to use taxpayer money to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign.""

Schiff called the president's conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart ""a classic mafialike shakedown of a foreign leader.""

""The notes of the call reflect a conversation far more damning than I or many others had imagined,"" he said Wednesday on Capitol Hill.

Trump pushed back during his news conference, calling it a ""perfect"" and ""beautiful"" call. He argued that Pelosi was allowing more liberal members of her caucus to push her toward impeachment proceedings.

""When Nancy Pelosi allows her position to be taken over by radical far-left socialists, or worse, that's pretty bad,"" the president said.

Trump also said he had thought that impeachment talk was dead after former special counsel Robert Mueller released his report into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

""What these Democrats have done to ruin lives is so sad,"" Trump said.

Schiff said he didn't want to ""get ahead of ourselves"" when asked whether the House would definitely vote on articles of impeachment. ""It will be a decision for us once we conclude our investigative work whether to bring this or other matters in the form of articles to a vote,"" he said. ""And we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.""

""But no one should have any illusions,"" he continued, ""about the seriousness of what is already uncontested — and that is the president of the United States has betrayed his oath of office and sacrificed our national security in doing so.""

In a joint statement, Schiff and other House committee chairmen including Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said, ""No quid pro quo is required to betray our country. Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections — that is betrayal enough. The corruption exists whether or not Trump threatened — explicitly or implicitly — that a lack of cooperation could result in withholding military aid.""

Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, a frequent GOP critic of the president, called the memo ""deeply troubling."" Speaking at a conference in Washington, Romney said: ""If the president of the United States asks or presses the leader of a foreign country to carry out an investigation of a political nature, that's troubling.""

Republicans defend Trump

Other Republicans, however, rallied to the president's defense. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a fervent support of Trump's, said the memo of the call showed that Pelosi ""has been functionally 'catfished' into a politically fatal impeachment proceeding based on rumors, based on faulty evidence, and based on a bloodlust for the President politically that does not serve our nation well.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called the rough transcript of the call ""underwhelming."" Graham said ""Impeachment over this? What a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger. Democrats have lost their minds when it comes to President Trump.""

A dozen GOP members of the House and Senate were given an advance view of the memo at a White House meeting attended by White House counsel Pat Cipollone. One of those present, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said, ""We certainly saw no quid pro quo,"" and, also employing the culinary metaphor, ""It's turning into a real nothingburger.""

The document released by the White House is labeled a ""memorandum"" that ""is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room duty officers and [National Security Council] policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place.""

Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, without having access to the transcript. But she said earlier in the day that evidence of a quid pro quo was not a ""requirement.""

Pelosi called Trump's actions a ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

""The president must be held accountable,"" Pelosi said. ""No one is above the law.""

She had previously resisted pressure from more liberal members of her caucus who have been pushing for impeachment.

Impeachment — the formal charging of wrongdoing against a president — could likely pass in a Democratic-controlled House. Just two presidents have been impeached in history: Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. President Richard Nixon was staring down an impeachment vote amid the Watergate scandal but resigned before formal impeachment articles were brought forward.

However, no president has ever been convicted in the Senate and subsequently removed from office. And such a feat would be tough in the GOP-controlled Senate, where 67 votes would be required.

We're nearly to the last of the many milestones that come along during presidential campaigns.

The primaries? Long over.

The conventions? All wrapped up.

Labor Day, when voters supposedly start paying attention? That was four weeks ago.

Now we turn to the debates, which begin Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET. The first setting: The University of Denver. The focus: Domestic policy. The moderator: Jim Lehrer from PBS-TV's NewsHour. The stars (just for the record, we suspect you know by now): President Obama and his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.

The rest of the debate schedule (they all are scheduled to last from 9 p.m to 10:30 p.m. ET:

-- Oct. 11, the vice presidential debate between incumbent Joe Biden and his GOP challenger, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wis.

-- Oct. 16, a presidential ""town hall"" style debate, covering foreign and domestic issues.

-- Oct. 22, the third and final presidential matchup, focusing on foreign affairs.

The Washington Post writes this morning that ""on the eve of the first presidential debate,"" its latest Post-ABC News poll shows the race between Obama and Romney remains tight nationally. But, ""52 percent of likely voters across swing states side with Obama and 41 percent with Romney in the new national poll.""

Real Clear Politics, which sifts through all the major national and state polls, says it looks like 265 Electoral College are either ""solid, likely or leaning"" for Obama, with 191 fitting into those categories for Romney. It takes 270 Electoral College votes to become president.

Our colleague Ken Rudin says it's debatable whether the debates will change the nature of the campaign. Check out his look back at the debates since 1960 and whether they did or didn't make much of a difference.

We'll be following this week's debate, and the others, over at It's All Politics. Join us if you can."

The mystery of the outbreak of vaping-related lung illnesses is still not solved.

But investigators in Illinois and Wisconsin have found some clues, they announced Friday in a press briefing.

Investigators in these two states conducted detailed interviews with 86 patients — mostly young men — and 66% said they had vaped THC products labeled as Dank Vapes. THC is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.

What are Dank Vapes and how could they be fueling the outbreak?

""Dank Vapes appears to be the most prominent in a class of largely counterfeit brands, with common packaging that is easily available online and that is used by distributors to market THC-containing cartridges,"" said a report from state investigators published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC has been warning since the outbreak began about the risks of buying products ""off the street,"" and Friday's update highlighted the risks of the black market. Sometimes young consumers don't even realize that they're buying unregulated or illicit products.

""THC-based products were most often acquired from informal sources such as down the street from friends or from a dealer,"" said Jennifer Layden of the Illinois Department of Public Health at the press briefing.

Around the country, law enforcement is trying to crack down on black market dealers. In Wisconsin earlier this month, two brothers were arrested for allegedly running a large THC vape ring.

And earlier this week, police in Waynesboro, Va., arrested three men and recovered more than 1,000 vape cartridges that were labeled as containing a 90% THC oil mixture.

""They're labeled Dank Vapes,"" Capt. Mike Martin of the Waynesboro Police Department says. ""They appear commercially packaged, and there are a variety of different flavors.""

The mixture appears as ""a standard-looking brownish oil. ... It has the consistency of ... maybe, like a motor oil,"" Martin says.

""We've never seen a haul like this,"" Martin says. He estimates they recovered about $35,000 worth of vaping product. ""They were selling these [on] the street.""

One difficultly in unraveling this outbreak is that many of the patients around the country who have gotten sick acknowledge using both THC and nicotine vaping products and have used a wide variety of brands and products. In fact, the 86 patients in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using 234 different products.

Nonetheless, investigators now seem more focused on the role THC may be playing in this outbreak, since the majority of the people who have become ill around the country reported using THC or both THC and nicotine, according to a CDC report published Friday. And the CDC updated its warning against vaping to emphasize the risk of THC products: ""CDC recommends people consider refraining from using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, particularly those containing THC,"" the CDC's Anne Schuchat said during a telebriefing Friday.

For people who are unsuspecting, black market products like Dank Vapes can be deceptive.

""Dank Vapes sounds like a cool name, it sounds like a cool product and it looks like legitimate packaging,"" says Jeffrey Kahn, who operates a medical marijuana dispensary in Washington, D.C. But, he says, unlike the regulated products he sells, you don't necessarily know what's in black market products. ""If one or two or hundreds of people are unscrupulously filling them with dangerous material, then people could suffer,"" he adds."

Updated at 6:22 p.m. ET

A Dallas jury has found former police Officer Amber Guyger guilty of murder for fatally shooting a neighbor who lived in the apartment directly above hers last year. She had testified that she entered Botham Jean's unit after a long day at work, thinking it was her own home and that he was an intruder.

The jury took five hours to decide Guyger had committed murder, rather than a lesser charge of manslaughter. Jurors heard testimony Tuesday afternoon in the sentencing phase of the trial. Testimony resumes Wednesday. Guyger faces a possible punishment of five to 99 years in prison.

She is the first Dallas police officer to be convicted of murder since the 1970s.

Prosecutors maintained that Guyger, who is white, committed murder when she overlooked signs that the apartment she entered wasn't her own — the wrong floor, the smell of marijuana coming from the apartment, a bright red doormat — and shot Jean, a 26-year-old black accountant who was sitting in his living room eating ice cream when Guyger killed him last September.

""There was no other floor mat like this is the entire building. This sticks out, literally, like a red thumb,"" lead prosecutor Jason Hermus said during closing arguments Monday, displaying the doormat to the jury. ""And she walked up to it and stood on top of it.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News via AP Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News via AP

But in tearful testimony last week, Guyger said she was ""scared to death"" when she opened what she thought was her own apartment door and saw the silhouette of a man she mistook for an intruder.

""I was scared whoever was inside my apartment was going to kill me,"" she told the jury. ""No police officer would want to hurt an innocent person.""

Guyger lived on the third floor of an apartment complex just south of downtown Dallas. Her lawyers said she was in uniform and had just finished a 13-hour workday on Sept. 6th, 2018, when she mistakenly opened Jean's door.

""What was going through Amber's mind was just, 'I'm going home,' "" defense lawyer Robert Rogers said. "" 'I'm exhausted, and I'm going home.' ""

Guyger testified that she had put her key in the door and realized it was unlocked. Thinking someone had broken in, she drew her gun and entered the apartment.

Guyger said she ordered Jean, ""Let me see your hands,"" and that he instead started to move toward her. Prosecutors countered that nobody in the apartment complex heard her instruct Jean to raise his hands.

Within seconds of opening the door, she fired two shots at Jean. One of the bullets struck him in the chest, killing him.

Guyger called 911 and told the operator over and over: ""I thought it was my apartment.""

The case transfixed observers around the country for the delicate questions it presented. Was the shooting a noncriminal accident equal to a ""tragic mistake,"" as Guyger's lawyers argued? Or were Guyger's mistakes so reckless that they constituted manslaughter, or so intentional that it amounted to murder?

In deciding that she was guilty, the jury, about half of whom were African American, sided with the prosecution's argument for murder.

Under Texas law, convicting a defendant of murder requires proving someone intentionally killed another person, as opposed to manslaughter, in which prosecutors have to show someone was killed because of recklessness.

Some have described the facts of the case as the latest example of a white police officer killing an unarmed black man. Civil rights groups rallied behind Jean, a native of the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. And many police officers came to the defense of Guyger, who was fired nearly three weeks after the shooting.

During her testimony, Guyger seemed to cast aside race as a factor. The encounter was ""not about hate,"" she said. ""It's about being scared.""

To prosecutors, Guyger's distraction led to a crime.

Just before Guyger entered Jean's apartment, she had a 16-minute phone conversation with a fellow officer, Martin Rivera. Authorities say the two had a romantic relationship and that they had been swapping sexually explicit messages.

Prosecutors argued that Guyger was so absorbed with those communications that she was too preoccupied to realize she was heading toward the wrong apartment.

In cross-examining Guyger, prosecutors emphasized that her training as a police officer should have informed her to back away from the door, hide and call for backup if she had suspected an intruder.

Guyger had her police radio, and she lives just two blocks from police headquarters, so she could have had other officers arrive quickly, prosecutors pointed out. Had she done that, Guyger was asked, might Jean be alive today?

""Yes, sir,"" she said.

Before jurors began their deliberations Monday, Texas District Judge Tammy Kemp allowed them to consider what is known as the ""castle doctrine"" as a possible defense, despite the objections of prosecutors who called the move ""absurd.""

Similar to self-defense laws known as ""stand your ground,"" the Texas statute says a person is justified in using deadly force if someone enters or attempts to enter a person's own home.

""It may have been a stretch for Judge Kemp to allow that jury to consider it,"" Tim Powers, a former Texas prosecutor and judge, told NPR.

The judge's decision raised a unique set of legal facts that experts said has not been tested in Texas courts: considering a ""castle doctrine"" defense in a location that is not one's ""castle.""

""This is a case of first impression, which means we don't have any precedents of this where the mistake of fact defense merges with the castle doctrine,"" said Peter Schulte, a Texas defense lawyer and former prosecutor.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Tom Fox/Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News via AP Tom Fox/Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News via AP

But in the end, the jury rejected the controversial use of that legal standard as a possible defense. Both Powers and Schulte think the issue will be raised during Guyger's expected appeal.

In the state's closing arguments on Monday, prosecutor Hermus said the only way a defendant can claim self-defense to murder is when there is no other reasonable alternative.

Hermus said that was not the case when Guyger shot Jean.

""Self-defense means you're acting defensively,"" Hermus said. ""She became the aggressor. That's not self-defense.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images

President Obama and his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, engaged Thursday night in a sometimes spirited, but always cordial, debate that got very technical at times.

It was the ""corporate executive"" (Romney) vs. the ""government professor"" (Obama) and the GOP nominee appeared to be ""full of confidence and full of sales pitch,"" NPR Senior Washington Editor Ron Elving says, while Obama put pressure on the Republican to explain what he would do as president.

There were few memorable lines — Romney at one point labeled Obama's policies ""trickle down government"" and Obama said Romney's plans for tax cuts would leave average Americans ""picking up the tab."" But overall, it wasn't an affair full of ""zingers."" Instead, the two contenders tossed around numbers — Obama said Romney would cut taxes for the wealthy by $5 trillion and Romney said Obama would cut Medicare funding by $716 billion — that they each disputed.

Will the debate at the University of Denver, the first of three in coming weeks, change the dynamics of what appears to be a very tight battle for the White House?

NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson said afterward that as of this evening, there wasn't any reason to think the debate would change the race. But that could change in coming days as pundits weigh in and as video clips start circulating.

We live blogged as they debated at the University of Denver. The moderator was Jim Lehrer of the PBS NewsHour.

Update at 10:35 p.m. ET. In Closing, Two Different ""Paths"":

Obama, as determined beforehand, gave the first closing statement. He ran through some of the things accomplished the last four years, including the end of the war in Iraq and the killing of Osama bin Laden. And he said that among the promises he made four years ago was that he ""wouldn't be a perfect president ... but would fight every day"" to do what's right. ""I've kept that promise,"" he said, and promised to do so again if he's re-elected.

Romney said he and the president would take the nation on ""two paths that lead in very different directions."" And if you look at Obama's record, Romney said, the path the president would take the nation would likely lead to weak job growth, cuts in Medicare and ""dramatic cuts to our millitary.""

Update at 10:25 p.m. ET. Romney Says Federal Government Has Role To Play In Education; Obama Says ""Budgets Matter""; Romney Raps Obama's Priorities:

The Republican nominee says he agrees with some of the things the Obama administration has been doing on education. Obama responds that Romney's tax cuts for ""folks like me and him"" would force a 20 percent cut in federal education spending. To which Romney says he would not cut education funding and criticizes the Obama administration for putting ""$90 billion into green jobs. That would have hired 2 million teachers.""

Update at 10:15 p.m. ET. Romney Cites Reagan As A Model For How To Govern:

Obama says Romney isn't giving Americans enough details about the policies he would pursue. Romney responds that ""my experience as a governor is that if I come in and lay down a piece of legislation and say 'it's my way or the highway,' "" not much gets done. He would emulate Ronald Reagan, who ""laid out his principles"" and then worked with Congress.

Update at 10:10 p.m. ET. Romney Pushes To Repeal ""Obamacare""; Obama Says It Was Modeled After Romney's Effort In Massachusetts:

After Romney makes his case for why ""Obamacare"" should be repealed — focusing on what he says are too-high costs and an ""unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have"" — Obama says ""we've seen this model work really well, in Massachusetts, because Gov. Romney did a good thing working with Democrats in the state.""

Romney responds that Obama didn't work across party lines, but instead came up with a plan ""that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best idea.""

To which Obama says that his plan originally was bipartisan, but it was Republicans in Congress who chose to not work with his administration. ""Democrats in Massachusetts might have given Republicans in Congress some advice on how to cooperate,"" Obama says.

The president also disputes the charge that an unelected board will tell people what treatments they can have. It will be ""health care experts"" trying to ""figure out how we can reduce the cost of health care,"" he says.

""This board ... can't make decisions about what treatments are given,"" Obama adds. ""It's prohibited in this law.""

Update at 9:55 p.m. ET. Sharp Differences On Medicare Policies:

Obama begins a discussion of entitlements by talking of his grandmother, who was able to remain independent at the end of her life because, he says, ""of Social Security and Medicare.""

Romney, looking to reassure seniors that he wouldn't do anything to affect them, says ""neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for current retirees."" But Obama, Romney says in a repeat of things he's said many times before, would reduce benefits for future retirees by ""cutting $716 billion from the program.""

Obama, who has previously said his cuts would not affect retirees, counters that the ""voucher plan"" favored by GOP vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan would ""cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.""

PolitiFact has previously said the charge that Obama would ""funnel"" $716 billion out of Medicare at the expense of the elderly is ""mostly false."" The charge that Ryan's plan would raise costs for Medicare beneficiaries by $6,000 each is ""half true,"" PolitiFact says.

Update at 9:40 p.m. ET. Romney Points To Broken Pledges; Obama Talks Of Being Balanced:

Romney takes the president to task for promising to cut the budget deficit in half, but instead being in the Oval Office as annual deficits grew to more than $1 trillion. Obama, meanwhile, faults Romney for saying during the GOP primaries that he wouldn't accept $1 in higher taxes in exchange for $10 worth of spending cuts. There has to be a balance between raising revenue and cutting spending, the president says. Romney responds that ""you'll never balance the budget by raising taxes."" The way to do it, he says, is to reduce tax rates so that job growth resumes and more people are paying taxes.

After the president says that some corporations can get tax deductions for moving jobs overseas, Romney — citing his business experience — says, ""I have no idea what you're talking about. ... I may need to get a new accountant.""

Update at 9:30 p.m. ET. More Dispute Over Taxes:

The president says again that Romney wants to ""cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in spending that the military is not asking for."" If the American people think that can be done and they won't end up ""picking up the tab ... then Gov. Romney's plan is the one for you,"" he says.

Romney says, again, that ""I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. ... That's not my plan."" He wants to ""bring down rates ... but also bring down deductions at the same time.""

Update at 9:19 p.m. ET. Differences On Job Creation, Taxes:

The first question from Lehrer is about jobs. ""What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating jobs?""

Obama first says the most important point he wants to make is that ""20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.""

He then goes on to say that four years ago the nation was facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. He cites the creation of about 5 million jobs since he took office. But more work needs to be done, he says.

Romney, says Obama, believes that cutting taxes alone will get the economy moving. ""I think we've got to invest in education and training"" and take other steps, Obama says.

Voters, he says in a reference to GOP positions, need to decide whether they want to ""double down on the policies that got us into the mess.""

Romney begins by congratulating the Obamas on their wedding anniversary, and jokes that ""this was obviously the most romantic place you could imagine ... Here with me.""

Then Romney begins drawing differences with the president. ""It's going to take a different path"" to boost job growth, he says. ""My plan has five basic parts"": Energy independence. More trade. Training. A balanced budget. And ""championing small business.""

""The path we've been on is just not successful,"" says Romney, calling Obama's plan ""trickle down government.""

Asked by Lehrer to address the president directly, Romney disputes Obama's claim that the GOP candidate has a $5 trillion tax cut plan. ""I don't,"" he says. And he tells Obama that ""middle income families are being crushed.""

Romney continues on taxes, saying, ""I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and reduce the revenues to the government. ... There will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit.""

Obama says that ""Gov. Romney's proposal ... calls for a $5 trillion tax cut. ... He is saying he's going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. ... He's been asked more than 100 times how he's going to pay for them"" and hasn't been able to answer.

""Virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate,"" Romney responds. ""I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans,"" Romney adds, after joking that as the father of five boys he's used to having someone say something many times even if it's just not true in the hope that it will be believed.

""For 18 months he's been running on this tax plan and now, five weeks before the election he's saying his big, bold idea is 'nevermind,' "" Obama says. It's impossible, he says, to enact Romney's plans without either increasing the deficit or raising taxes on the middle class.

Watch for this discussion to be among the several that fact checkers pay close attention to.

Update at 8:55 p.m. ET. Lehrer Tells Audience To ""Sit On It!"":

Adding to the earlier warning about not making noise during the debate, Lehrer just instructed the crowd that ""if you hear something that's really terrific, sit on it! If you hear something you don't like, sit on it!""

He jokingly asked first lady Michelle Obama and Ann Romney, wife of the GOP nominee, to enforce the rules on each of their sides.

Update at 8:45 p.m. ET. No Cheering, Please, Audience Is Told:

With ""50 to 100 million"" Americans watching tonight, ""it's wrong for us to intrude on them,"" debate commission Co-Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf just told the several thousand people in attendance. ""So please, don't clap, don't cheer, don't make any noise.""

He also asked those in the building to turn off their cellphones. ""Hopefully, we can live for 90 minutes without these things on,"" Fahrenkopf said.

Fahrenkopf is a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. The other commission co-chairman is Mike McCurry, one-time press secretary to Democratic President Bill Clinton.

Update at 8:35 p.m. ET. What Does Each Man Need To Do?

On All Things Considered today, NPR's Mara Liasson said the conventional wisdom holds that Romney ""has the bigger task."" He needs, she said, to ""criticize the president without looking too harsh or negative."" And Romney must ""show how his economic policies can make people's lives better in the future.""

One advantage Romney has, Mara said, is that he comes in ""as an underdog."" So the expectations are lower for the Republican.

President Obama, she said, must ""avoid a mistake ... [and] not come off as smug or arrogant or thin-skinned.""

As for how important the debates may be, Mara said it's ""hard to find an example since the Kennedy-Nixon debates"" in 1960 when they appeared to significantly affect the outcome of an election. But in a race that's likely to be ""decided by a hair,"" said Mara, ""little things really do matter"" and a good or bad debate performance could be important.

Update at 8:25 p.m. ET: What's The Format? What Are The Topics? According to the Commission on Presidential Debates, tonight's debate will be divided into ""six segments of approximately 15 minutes each. ... The moderator will open each segment with a question, after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. The moderator will use the balance of the time in the segment for a discussion of the topic.""

A coin toss has determined that President Obama will get the first question. Romney will get the last word before the debate ends.

Domestic policy is the overall topic tonight. Lehrer has announced that he plans to focus on the economy in the first three segments. After that, he plans to move to health care, ""the role of government,"" and ""governing.""

As The Christian Science Monitor notes, in past years ""debates have typically had more questions and shorter discussion times. Lehrer, in part, advocated for the new format, and pushed to reduce the number of questions from nine to six, in the hopes that it would encourage more of a television talk-show approach, in which the candidates engage in discussion rather than just deliver talking points.""

The other presidential debates will be on Oct. 16 (a town hall format) and Oct. 22. The one debate between Vice President Biden and his GOP challenger, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, is set for Oct. 11."

I have spent the past few days sequestered with a crack team of political pros — actually, curled into a fetal ball, clutching a fading 1980 John Anderson poster — to gird myself for the vital first debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney.

So many questions lingered:

Would Romney offer to wager Obama $10,000 on who wins the race?

Would Obama tell Romney, ""You're taxable enough, Mitt""?

Would the two men reveal the secret handshake taught only to graduates of both Harvard College and Harvard Law School? (Didn't remember Romney had the J.D. as well as the MBA, did you?) Would they be able to toss zingers with tight spirals in the thin air of Denver?

Would the competing journalistic fact checking units break into open warfare before the end of the actual debate?

Some surprises:

1. Obama became the first incumbent president to use the word ""sweetie"" in the response to the first question posed at an actual presidential debate at which the moderator was not a child of 4. (Directed at his wife of exactly 20 years, undoubtedly in part to compensate for ruining any actual anniversary date, and undoubtedly in part to pander to married women across the country, among whom he has a lead in the latest Pew poll.)

2. Romney apparently believes the word ""question"" is a synonym for the word ""rebuttal.""

PBS's Jim Lehrer: ""But first, Gov. Romney, do you have a question that you'd like to ask the president directly about something he just said?"" Romney: ""Well, sure. I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut.""

My punctuation may fail me, but that doesn't sound like there was a question mark in there.

3. This was the ""prevent defense"" debate. Neither man made a glaring mistake, but neither could have stirred much of a pulse even in a Red Bull addict. Obama seemed particularly flat. Was he aware they were actually on TV? And, as a result, Romney's fans will be galvanized by this relatively sedate debate, because he did perfectly fine.

4. Romney announced he would cut Obamacare and Big Bird — along with declaring, ""I love Big Bird.""

The Wall Street Journal's James Taranto called fowl:

Romney; ""I love Big Bird."" Brazen pandering to Avian-American vote. #2012 — James Taranto (@jamestaranto) October 4, 2012

‏

No word on the governor's stance on Cookie Monster.

5. It would seem the president has killed that whole ""mesmerizing celebrity meme"" that so haunted him during the campaign of 2008. The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg:

Obama's just not used to being challenged anymore. Should have hired Bibi Netanyahu to play Romney in debate prep. — Jeffrey Goldberg (@JeffreyGoldberg) October 4, 2012

6. The stakes were high, the lights hot. Early on, Romney was visibly perspiring. Not a Nixon-like precipitation, but a well-planned ploy to prove that he's not Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. That, or the programmers made adjustments to the operating system.

7. Obama was shamelessly willing to get in the gutter and match his opponent, one droning, statistic-laden-argument-over-arcane-policy-distinction after another.

8. The NFL should have hired Romney as a replacement referee — the man wanted to moderate his own debate, repeatedly talking over the genial Lehrer: ""I think I get the last word.""

9. Lehrer had a tough time holding onto the conductor's baton:

It seems mediator Jim Lehrer has lost control of the debate. What are you thoughts on what the candidates have said so far? #Latism — Fox News Latino (@foxnewslatino) October 4, 2012

Those who do get the last word — OK, the next-to-last-word before the voters — debated among themselves how to go through this ritual once more. I'm talking the journalists, analysts, pundits and prognosticators.

New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen mocked the professional flock for just showing up to Denver.

Almost all journalists at the debate tonight will have to watch it on TV in the media space. Q. Why are they there, then? A. The spin room. — Jay Rosen(@jayrosen_nyu) October 3, 2012

Purity! Stay out of the spin room! Hear the people online! All the major news outlets built up their online presences based in large part on social platforms. ABC's joint site with Yahoo (going full tilt in the absence of any TV presence before the 9 pm ET start ) — sorted through the tweet-per-minute ratios; CNN tweeters tracked how well independent voters with little instant opinion knobs liked the two candidates. Social media is the future of the media!

""I think with Twitter, and the way information now moves, the sense of how the debate is being played out occurs in almost real time,"" Romney spokesman Brian Jones told The Huffington Post's Michael Calderone. ""In years past, you may have had to wait until the debate concluded.""

Except for the objection raised by CBS political director and Slate columnist John Dickerson:

Twitter is the new spin room. #deepthoughts — John Dickerson (@jdickerson) October 3, 2012

So wait — the empowering, democratizing, level playing field of social media is also spintastic?

What to do?

National Journal reporter Jim Tankersley announced an hour before the debate, he had a solution at hand:

Powering down the Twitter machine in a few mins - writing NJ snap-analysis of debate; gonna do it noise-free. c: @brendannyhan — Jim Tankersley (@jimtankersley) October 3, 2012

In other words, the one place you don't want to talk politics is Twitter. A fact that he was most directly able to communicate to 3,047 followers via the direct information IV drip that rhymes with ""litter."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption John Locher/AP John Locher/AP

Updated at 3:50 p.m. ET

MGM Resorts International has agreed to pay up to $800 million to settle thousands of liability claims stemming from the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, lawyers announced Thursday, almost exactly two years after the massacre.

On Oct. 1, 2017, a gunman on the 32nd floor of the MGM-owned Mandalay Bay resort opened fire on a crowd of people at a country music festival, killing 58 and injuring hundreds.

Lawyers representing survivors and victims wanted MGM held liable for negligence because the shooter was able to enter the hotel with luggage that held an arsenal of high-powered, assault-style weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition.

""He brought in over 20 huge heavy bags over a three- or four-day period,"" Catherine Lombardo, a lawyer representing some of the shooting victims, told NPR last year.

Robert Eglet, a lawyer who has been leading talks on behalf of shooting victims, said in a statement Thursday that MGM's insurance will be paying out between $735 million and $800 million, depending on the number of claimants and that the agreement resolves ""substantially all"" of the lawsuits filed. Eglet said his firm represents nearly 2,500 people who said they were affected by the mass shooting.

An independent claims administrator will be appointed by a court to distribute money from a settlement fund. The payout process is expected to be completed by late 2020, lawyers said.

""While nothing will be able to bring back the lives lost or undo the horrors so many suffered on that day, this settlement will provide fair compensation for thousands of victims and their families,"" Eglet said, adding, ""We believe that the terms of this settlement represent the best outcome for our clients and will provide the greatest good for those impacted by these events.""

Lawyer Mo Aziz, who represents more than 1,000 people expected to file claims, said he hopes the payouts would provide closure and also prompt hotels across the country to bolster security measures.

""In this era of mass shootings, this settlement sends a strong message to the hospitality industry that all steps necessary to prevent mass shootings must be taken,"" Aziz said.

Last year, MGM spurred outrage when it aggressively tried to avoid liability by countersuing victims. The company cited a federal law passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that encouraged companies to deploy anti-terrorism security technology without fear of being held responsible for damages in the event of a terrorist attack.

But now, MGM Resorts Chairman and CEO Jim Murren says that ""prolonged litigation around these matters is in no one's best interest. It is our sincere hope that this agreement means that scenario will be avoided.""

The deal is not an admission of any wrongdoing by MGM, Murren said in the statement.

The 64-year-old gunman, Stephen Paddock, was found dead in his hotel room from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Federal investigators have not been able to identify a motive for the shooting.

Former Vice President Joe Biden called for President Trump's impeachment and removal from office, on Wednesday.

Up until now, Biden had reserved judgment, saying he supported the House's impeachment inquiry and wanted to see what the facts showed.

But in a campaign speech in Rochester, N.H., Biden was unequivocal, saying that ""to preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, [Trump] should be impeached.""

Biden said the case was already clear before the public.

""With his words and his actions, President Trump has indicted himself. By obstructing justice, refusing to comply with the congressional inquiry, he's already convicted himself,"" Biden said. ""In full view of the world and the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts.""

Biden later argued that ""impeachment isn't only about what the president has done — it's about the threat the president poses to the nation if allowed to remain in office.""

Accordingly, Biden said, Congress should remove him before voters go to polls to choose the president on Election Day next year.

Biden and his family were the subject of an effort by Trump to request political assistance from the government of Ukraine that was connected to U.S. military assistance and offers of engagement with Trump himself.

Trump, his aides and some State Department diplomats were involved with an effort to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to launch investigations into Biden's family and into a conspiracy theory believed by Trump about the political interference in the 2016 presidential race.

Trump has defended the propriety of those actions and also called for the government of China to investigate the Biden family, too. Trump and his supporters have sought to call attention to what they call the questionable business dealings of Biden's son Hunter.

The president mocked the Bidens on Wednesday on Twitter in a response to the campaign speech.

Deadlock in Washington

The back and forth between Trump and Biden followed the White House's declaration on Tuesday that it would not accommodate Congress with documents or witnesses in the impeachment inquiry.

Without a vote to initiate an inquiry by the full House, argued White House counsel Pat Cipollone, there is no impeachment inquiry the administration is bound to respect.

But White House officials also won't commit to cooperating with Congress if the House were to convene a vote on launching an impeachment inquiry.

Biden used his speech in New Hampshire to fault what he called that rejection laws and democratic norms, saying of the president that ""he is seeing no limits to his power regardless of what the Constitution says"" and that ""he believes if he does something, it's legal — period.""

Trump ""believes he can and will get away with anything he does. We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it,"" said Biden, alluding a statement Trump made during the 2016 campaign.

""It's no joke,"" Biden insisted. ""He's shooting holes in the Constitution, and we can not let him get away with it.""

Biden has led the crowded Democratic primary field since he entered the race but has since been caught in polling by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren —who earlier called for Trump's impeachment.

A Biden aide says that the former vice president has seen the past two weeks as ""a remarkable period in American history"" that made clear what he believes are Trump's obstruction and wrongdoing. That gave Biden no choice but to make his stance on impeachment clear, the aide says.

A pair of missiles hit an Iran-flagged oil tanker steaming off the coast of Saudi Arabia in the Red Sea, causing an explosion and oil spill, Iranian officials said Friday.

Iran's state-run IRNA identified the tanker as the Sabiti, and Iranian state television says the explosions damaged two storage tanks and caused an oil spill that is now reportedly under control.

The Iranian media reports did not assign responsibility for the incident.

""The oil tanker named SABITI belonging to the company sustained damages to the body when it was hit by missiles 60 miles from the Saudi port city of Jiddah,"" IRNA said.

MarineTraffic, a ship-tracking website, says Sabiti was en route from Port Said, Egypt, to an unknown destination.

The incident is the latest in a series in recent months, most or all of which have occurred on the opposite side of the Arabian peninsula in waters near the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. has blamed Iran for the attacks, but Tehran denies any involvement.

Saudi Arabia made no immediate comment on the reported attack.

Last month, a major Saudi oil processing plant and an adjacent oil field were hit in a missile-and-drone attack claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels but that Riyadh and the U.S. blamed on Tehran.

Iran, which has supported the Houthis' fight against the Saudi-backed government in Sana'a, has denied any involvement in the attack."

Updated at 12:59 p.m. ET

The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in a long-awaited set of cases testing whether the federal law that bars sex discrimination in employment applies to LGBTQ employees.

Specifically, the question is whether employers are free to fire employees because they are gay or transgender.

Justice Neil Gorsuch said the text of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination ""because of sex,"" or ""on the basis of sex,"" appears to favor the plaintiffs in the case, but he wondered whether the court should also consider ""the massive social upheaval"" that could follow a ruling in favor of LGBTQ workers. The court's conservative justices, who are in a majority, appeared somewhat skeptical of the arguments of the lawyers for the LGBTQ workers.

Justice Samuel Alito, another of the court's conservatives, said if the court decided to update the statute, it might as well ""just be a legislature.""

Justice Elena Kagan, one of the court's liberal justices, said, however, that employers cannot treat a man who loves other men differently than a woman who loves men.

""I was fired for being gay""

At the front of these cases is Gerald Bostock, who, for 10 years, was the child-welfare coordinator for Clayton County, Ga. His primary responsibility was a program that provides advocates in court for abused and neglected children.

""It was the job I loved, and my employer loved me doing the job,"" says Bostock, noting that under his leadership, the child advocates program ""reached the benchmark of serving 100% of the children in foster care,"" an ""unheard of milestone"" for any such program in the greater metro Atlanta region.

But in 2013, Bostock joined a gay recreational softball league. And ""from that point on, my life changed, "" he says. ""Within months, I was fired for being gay. I lost my livelihood. I lost my medical insurance and at the time I was fighting prostate cancer. It was devastating.""

""In truth ... even I do not fully understand it myself""

Also front and center on Tuesday was Aimee Stephens. She worked for the Harris Funeral Home in Livonia, Mich., as a funeral director for six years, presenting as a man. But by 2012, at age 51, she was in despair over her gender identity and contemplating suicide.

""I stood in the backyard for an hour with a gun to my chest, but I couldn't do it,"" she says.

Stephens decided she would come out at work as a transgender woman. For eight months, she worked on a letter to her boss and co-workers telling them of her gender identity.

""I have realized that some of you may have trouble understanding this,"" she wrote, adding, ""In truth, I have had to live with it every day of my life, and even I do not fully understand it myself.""

Two weeks after giving the letter to her boss, Stephens was fired.

Stephens and Bostock both took their former employers to court, charging that their dismissals were based on sex and thus violated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

The owner of Harris Funeral Homes, Tom Rost, explained in a videotaped interview with his lawyers that he was concerned about how the families of the deceased would react to Stephens who was, in Rost's words, ""the face of the Harris Funeral Home.""

Neither Clayton County officials nor their lawyers would comment about Bostock's firing.

A ""common-sense argument""

But in their briefs, the lawyers in both cases argue that Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act does not apply to sexual orientation or gender status at all. ""Everyone understood in 1964 [when the Civil Rights Act passed] that sex meant biological sex,"" says John Bursch who argued on behalf of Harris Funeral Homes in the Supreme Court. That means that neither women nor men can be treated unequally in the work-place, he says, but that ""just does not translate into other categories"" such as sexual orientation or gender identity.

Supporting that argument are 15 states, including Texas, and its solicitor general, Kyle Hawkins. The ""common-sense"" argument, he asserts, is that ""sex is not the same as sexual orientation and not the same as gender identity.""

But lawyers representing the fired workers counter that the Supreme Court over the last half-century has interpreted the law far more broadly than that. They note that the justices have applied the anti-discrimination statute to a variety of situations that Congress wasn't thinking about in 1964.

For example, ""in 1964 you wouldn't find a single dictionary that defined the term 'sexual harassment' and yet the Supreme Court has held that Title VII [of the 1964 Civil Rights Act] prohibits sexual harassment of women"" and ""also sexual harassment of men,"" observes Stanford Law Professor Pamela Karlan.

Where and how to draw the line

Indeed, more than two decades ago, the Supreme Court ruled that even same-sex sexual harassment was illegal under the statute. Writing for a unanimous court, conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, said that while same-sex sexual harassment was ""not the principal evil Congress was concerned with"" in 1964, ""statutory provisions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils."" And, he said, ""it is ultimately the provisions of our laws, rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.""

Stanford's Karlan, who argued for Bostock on Tuesday, reminded the justices of the court's very first sex discrimination case after enactment of the 1964 law: Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corporation. At issue was an employer's policy barring the hiring of women with young children.

The court ruled unanimously that the policy was illegal sex discrimination. Karlan argues that just as women with children are a subset of women covered by the anti-discrimination law, so too are gay, lesbian and bisexual employees.

""If it's sex discrimination to say, 'You can't work for us if you are a woman and you have children at home, it's also sex discrimination to say you can't work for us because you're a woman and you have a wife at home,' "" says Karlan.

Similarly, she maintains, ""If you wouldn't fire a man for marrying a woman, but you would fire a woman for marrying a woman, you've discriminated against the woman who works for you.""

The transgender argument: politically difficult but analytically stark

The argument for transgender employees may be more politically difficult to sell. But it is arguably more stark. It goes like this: If an employer hires a man and later fires the employee when the employee shows up as a woman, how is that not discrimination based on sex?

Lawyer Bursch will tell the justices that sexual orientation and gender status simply do not fit under the 1964 anti-discrimination formula. He warns that if the court were to rule against the employers in these cases, it would have ramifications beyond employment.

""If we redefine the meaning of sex in federal law,"" he predicts, it would allow ""biological men to identify as women and take women's places on sports teams."" Bursch argues that has already happened in some places, with cisgender women losing out in medals to transgender women.

Could employment cases affect school sports?

Federal law does indeed bar sex discrimination in sports programs at schools that get federal money. And the NCAA has developed regulations for when trans student-athletes may or may not participate. But as Stanford's Karlan observes, Title IX, best known for its impact in advancing women's sports, ""is a different statute."" And the regulations for education funding under Title IX ""are different than the rules in the workplace"" under Title VII.

Lawyers for the employers respond that Congress in 1964 simply did not anticipate the questions raised in these cases about the scope of Title VII and that Congress, not the courts, should be addressing these issues.

The case has drawn even more attention than anticipated, with dozens of friend-of-the-court briefs on each side. Siding with the employers are business groups that, for the most part, have some religious affiliation. But weighing in on the other side, in favor of protection for gay and trans employees, are 206 major corporations that employ over 7 million workers.

The Trump administration, reversing the position of the Obama administration, will argue in the Supreme Court against the LGBTQ employees."

Updated at 11:10 a.m. ET

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, a Baltimore attorney and civil rights advocate who served in Maryland's legislature before representing the state in the U.S. House, where he took on a lead role in investigating President Trump, has died. He was 68.

Cummings, the head of the powerful House Committee on Oversight and Reform, died early Thursday at Johns Hopkins Hospital from complications related to longstanding health challenges, according to The Associated Press.

""He worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation's diversity was our promise, not our problem,"" said Cummings' wife, Maryland Democratic Party Chair Maya Rockeymoore Cummings. It's been an honor to walk by his side on this incredible journey. I loved him deeply and will miss him dearly.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Cummings ""my brother in Baltimore"" as she spoke about him on Thursday.

""In the Congress, Elijah was considered a north star,"" Pelosi said. ""He was a leader of towering character and integrity."" She added, ""He lived the American dream, and he wanted it for everyone else.""

President Trump issued a statement via Twitter saying:

""My warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings. I got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!""

Former President Barack Obama issued his own statement saying, ""Michelle and I are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, Elijah Cummings.

""As Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, he showed us all not only the importance of checks and balances within our democracy, but also the necessity of good people stewarding it,"" Obama said.

The 12-term congressman had failed to return from an unspecified medical procedure and missed two legislative roll call votes on Tuesday, the first day after a two-week recess, according to The Baltimore Sun.

In a statement on Sept. 30, Cummings said his doctors expected him to be able to return to Washington ""when the House comes back into session in two weeks."" It said he'd be in ""constant communication"" with his staff and congressional colleagues while he was away.

Cummings was among the three Democratic committee chairmen who signed a letter last month that accompanied a congressional subpoena of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has declined to testify in the ongoing impeachment inquiry of the president.

According to an official biography of Cummings, the Baltimore native attended Howard University, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in political science and served as student government president. He later obtained a law degree from the University of Maryland School of Law.

He served for 13 years in Maryland's House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in 1996.

""Congressman Cummings has dedicated his life of service to uplifting and empowering the people he is sworn to represent,"" his official biography says.

""He began his career of public service in the Maryland House of Delegates, where he served for 14 years and became the first African American in Maryland history to be named Speaker Pro Tem,"" it says. ""Since 1996, Congressman Cummings has proudly represented Maryland's 7th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.""

Cummings was born and raised in Baltimore and lived there his entire life in what he described as the ""inner inner city."" He was one of seven children of parents who worked as sharecroppers before moving to the city in the 1940s, according to the Sun.

Discussing Cummings' connection with his constituents in Baltimore, Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, tells NPR's Noel King, ""he really was a moral force in the community.""

""People trusted him in the unrest after Freddie Gray was killed — it was Elijah Cummings who could walk into the crowd and be recognized and have people respond to him,"" Ifill says. ""And so I think what the country has seen of him over the last year is a reflection of what many of us here in Baltimore have known for the 20 years of his leadership. A man of tremendous, tremendous integrity.""

As a prominent Democratic lawmaker, Cummings frequently found himself on the receiving end of Trump's Twitter account. In an infamous series of tweets in July, the president referred to Cummings' Baltimore district as ""rat and rodent infested"" and suggested that the congressman seldom goes there.

Elijah Cummings spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through “Oversight.” He does NOTHING for his very poor, very dangerous and very badly run district! Take a look.... #BlacksForTrump2020 https://t.co/seNVESZUht — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2019

""Mr. President, I go home to my district daily,"" Cummings fired back in a letter to Trump. ""Each morning, I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors.""

Referring to investigations of the president, which he perceived as the true impetus for the derogatory remarks, Cummings said in the letter that it is ""my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch. But it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents.""

Despite the president's remarks, Cummings continued to reach out to the White House and called on government officials to stop making ""hateful, incendiary comments"" that divide and distract.

Mr. President, we can address this together. Two years ago, I went to the White House to ask you to endorse my bill to let the government negotiate directly for lower drug prices. — Elijah E. Cummings (@RepCummings) July 27, 2019

When Democrats took the House in the 2018 election, political pundits had predicted that Cummings' chairmanship of the Oversight Committee would be a ""nightmare"" for Trump.

""Are we going to be the nightmare? he mused in an interview with the Sun. ""It's in the eye of the beholder.""

President Trump fired him (after he submitted his resignation) and earlier this week reportedly called him ""the world's most overrated general,"" but former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had a few barbs of his own to sling in a speech he gave in New York on Thursday.

Delivering the keynote address at the 74th Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, Mattis — a retired four-star U.S. Marine general — said he felt he had finally ""achieved greatness.""

""I'm not just an overrated general, I am the greatest, the world's most overrated,"" he said to laughter.

""I'm honored to be considered that by Donald Trump, because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress,"" Mattis continued. ""So, I guess I'm the Meryl Streep of generals. Frankly that sounds pretty good to me.""

The jibes were a departure for Mattis, whose book Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead, published last month, was met with criticism from some who said he had pulled punches in characterizing the president's erratic leadership style.

In an interview with NPR promoting his book, Mattis declined to discuss his relationship with Trump. ""I don't discuss sitting presidents,"" Mattis said. ""I believe that you owe a period of quiet.""

Thursday's annual gala, named after the former New York governor who won the Democratic nomination for president in 1928, was hosted this year by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York.

Mattis said he had been asked what he thought of Trump's remarks, which reportedly came during a White House meeting with congressional Democrats on Wednesday.

""I earned my spurs on the battlefield ... Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor,"" he said in a reference to a medical deferment for bone spurs that kept Trump from serving in the military during the Vietnam War.

Although Trump's nickname for Mattis was ""mad dog"" — a nickname the former general despised — Mattis said these days he feels more like ""an emotional support animal.""

""And that's really great, because now the airlines allow me to fly for free,"" he said.

But Mattis quickly moved on from the jokes and picked up a more serious tone, citing a speech that Abraham Lincoln gave in 1838 to the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Ill.

In it, Lincoln ""observed great nations crumble for one of two reasons,"" the first being foreign invasion, Mattis said, which the future president dismissed as ""inconceivable.""

The second, he said, paraphrasing Lincoln, ""was corrosion from within – the rot, the viciousness, the lassitude, the ignorance.""

""Anarchy is one potential consequence of all this. The other is the rise of an ambitious leader, unfettered by conscience, or precedent or decency, who would make himself supreme,"" he said.

Decrying the lack of bipartisanship, Mattis warned of a ""national paralysis"" that has ""supplanted trust and empathy with suspicion and contempt.""

""We have scorched our opponents with language that precludes compromise and we have brushed aside the possibility that the person with whom we disagree might actually sometimes be right,"" he said.

""We owe a debt to all who fought for liberty, including those who tonight serve in the far corners of our planet, among them the American men and women supporting our Kurdish allies,"" the retired general said.

In conclusion, Mattis again paraphrased Lincoln, this time that president's famous Second Inaugural speech, delivered in the closing days of the Civil War: ""With malice for none and charity for all, let us restore trust in one another."""

With a new report showing the nation's unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent last month, the Obama administration got good news Friday: Jobs are indeed growing. But, as Republicans noted, the pace remains well below the level needed to provide paychecks for the 12.1 million people seeking them.

The truth is, each party could find evidence to support either a positive or negative spin on the labor market, which is recovering — yet weak.

At a Friday campaign rally in Virginia, President Obama focused on the continued growth. He said the jobs report is ""a reminder that this country has come too far to turn back now.""

Republican candidate Mitt Romney saw something very different. ""If not for all the people who have simply dropped out of the labor force, the real unemployment rate would be closer to 11 percent,"" he said in a statement.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Steve Helber/AP Steve Helber/AP

The competing views both have validity. Before considering the spin, here are the facts:

Enlarge this image toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP

All this year, the unemployment rate had been vacillating in a narrow range between 8.3 percent and 8.1 percent, where it stood in August. But the rate fell to 7.8 percent in September, after a household survey showed more people say they are working.

The Labor Department also revised some summer data. August payrolls actually rose by 142,000, better than the initially reported 96,000, while July was revised up to 181,000, from an earlier estimate of 141,000. Last month, employers added 114,000 jobs, almost exactly what economists had predicted.

A Negative Take On The Jobs Data

The pace of improvement is far too slow to absorb the backlog of people seeking work. About 100,000 new jobs are needed each month simply to keep pace with population growth.

The jobless rate would be much higher today — more like the 11 percent Romney notes — if labor force participation were as high as when Obama took office. Many people have dropped out of the workplace, either to take early retirement, go back to school or to stay home, because they don't see much hope of finding a good job.

To return to, say, 6 percent unemployment within three years, economists say employers need to be adding about 375,000 workers a month.

Alternatively, A Positive Take

In January 2009, when Obama took the oath of office, the U.S. economy lost more than 800,000 jobs.

By spurring Congress to immediately pass the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the president turned around that employment plunge and ""kept our economy from swerving over the cliff,"" according to Rebecca Thiess, a policy analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the stimulus created up to 3.3 million full-time jobs and helped stabilize the labor market in the 2009-2011 period. Since the recovery kicked in, the private sector has added jobs for 31 straight months, bringing the total to 5.2 million new jobs.

So What's The Outlook?

The past three-and-a-half years could be considered a split decision, with good points and bad. But what lies ahead?

Romney says his economic policies would create about 12 million jobs over the next four years. But many independent economists say that's the same number of jobs that would be created under current policies.

Joseph Davis, chief economist for the mutual fund giant Vanguard, said he doesn't see the unemployment rate improving significantly until Congress takes definitive action to reduce the deficit and the debt. Having lawmakers constantly put off major decisions about taxes and spending is creating tremendous uncertainties for employers who feel they can't make hiring plans until they know what their taxes will be and whether government spending — on infrastructure, defense contracts and more — will continue.

""If we don't see a meaningful change in terms of clearing up policy uncertainty, then it's very difficult to see the economic trajectory change,"" Davis said. ""If we could adopt a credible and binding plan to reduce the deficit, that would go a long way in reducing uncertainty"" and opening the door to new employees, he added.

What Are People Saying Today?

Friday's big move in the jobless rate did not go unnoticed by Romney supporters, many of whom suggested the Labor Department manipulated the data. For example, Jack Welch, the retired CEO of General Electric, tweeted that the drop in the jobless rate was ""unbelievable,"" and added this reference to Obama: ""can't debate, so change numbers.""

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has a reputation for honest work. The monthly jobs report is put together by dozens of career professionals who tabulate and analyze data. Mainstream economists say that with so many people involved, manipulating data is extremely implausible.

Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, speaking on CNBC, said the jobs report is reliable. ""These are our best-trained and best-skilled individuals working in the BLS, and it's really ludicrous to hear that kind of statement"" from Welch, she said.

The BLS report is supported by an independent measure, which found similar results. Gallup, the polling company, calculated that September's unemployment rate, without seasonal adjustments, fell to 7.9 percent, which was ""the lowest [level] Gallup has recorded since it began collecting employment data in January 2010."""

Updated at 6:30 p.m. ET

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter to Democrats on Monday that the House will vote to formalize the procedures in the ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Trump.

The resolution will outline the terms for public hearings, the disclosure of deposition transcripts, procedures to transfer evidence to the House Judiciary Committee and due process rights for Trump.

Senior Democratic aides said the resolution will be released on Wednesday, with a House vote on Thursday.

""We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump Administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives,"" Pelosi wrote.

House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff confirmed that the resolution will establish a format for open hearings.

""The American people will hear firsthand about the President's misconduct,"" Schiff said in a statement.

So far the White House has refused to comply with the inquiry because the House has not voted. It is unclear if passage of the resolution will change the White House's strategy as the investigation intensifies.

White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham responded briefly in a statement Monday, saying ""We won't be able to comment fully until we see the actual text, but Speaker Pelosi is finally admitting what the rest of America already knew – that Democrats were conducting an unauthorized impeachment proceeding, refusing to give the President due process, and their secret, shady, closed door depositions are completely and irreversibly illegitimate.""

The White House and congressional Republicans have criticized Democrats for not conducting a full House vote at the onset to authorize the impeachment inquiry, as Congress did for Bill Clinton's impeachment. Neither the Constitution nor House rules require that, but it has given Republicans a unifying talking point to attack the inquiry so far.

Republicans were quick to move the goal posts following Pelosi's announcement. ""We will not legitimize the Schiff/Pelosi sham impeachment,"" tweeted Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is leading the impeachment investigation.

Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham said he believes Democrats were ""forced to change course"" because Senate Republicans and the American people demanded a vote. Still, he said the vote now is like ""un-ringing a bell as House Democrats have selectively leaked information in order to damage President Trump for weeks.""

""I look forward to reviewing their proposal,"" Graham said, ""and ensuring it provides President Trump with the rights and privileges Republicans afforded former President Clinton during the 1998 impeachment process.""

Congressional Republicans have largely focused their lines of defense on the process and not on the substance of the allegations against Trump that he abused his office to pressure Ukraine to advance investigations that would help him politically. House GOP strategy will also have to evolve as the investigation takes a more public turn.

So far the inquiry has taken place behind closed doors. Schiff has promised public hearings, and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., has said he would like the House to wrap up its work on impeachment by the end of the year. The House is currently scheduled to be in session just 19 more days this year, putting Democrats under an ever-increasing time crunch.

If the House approves any articles of impeachment against Trump, it will trigger a near immediate trial in the Senate to decide whether to remove him from office. The most recent impeachment trial, of Clinton in 1999, lasted five weeks. Many lawmakers say they would like to conclude the impeachment process before ballots start being cast in the 2020 presidential primary season, which kicks off Feb. 3 with the Iowa caucuses."

Updated 8:12 a.m. ET

Christopher Anderson, a career foreign service officer in the State Department, will tell House impeachment investigators on Wednesday that President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani stood in the way of the White House strengthening ties with Ukraine, according to a copy of Anderson's opening statement obtained by NPR.

Anderson, who spent five years working on Washington-Kyiv relations, will describe a meeting he had with former national security adviser John Bolton on the topic of having senior White House officials engage more with Ukraine. In it, Bolton noted a possible hitch.

""He cautioned that Mr. Giuliani was a key voice with the President on Ukraine which could be an obstacle to increased White House engagement,"" Anderson will tell the House committees, according to his prepared remarks.

House committees are set to question Anderson and Catherine Croft, another foreign service officer and Ukraine expert, on Wednesday as part of the impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused his office by prodding a foreign power to help his 2020 reelection bid.

Their appearance comes a day after Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's top expert on Ukraine, told impeachment investigators that he was so troubled by Trump's demands that Ukraine investigate the Bidens, that he reported it to a superior.

In a rough transcript of a July 25 call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that was released by the White House last month, Trump appears to ask Zelenskiy to investigate a debunked conspiracy about missing Democratic National Committee emails, as well as look into Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.

In Wednesday's testimony, Anderson is expected to tell the committees that he saw a better relationship between the countries, including inviting Zelenskiy to the White House, as a way to help bring Russians back to the negotiating table with Ukraine. Yet Giuliani was persistent in his calls for Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens, even though Anderson and other top State Department officials cautioned against it.

""We agreed on the importance of not calling for any specific investigations,"" Anderson will tell investigators.

Trump drafted a letter inviting Zelenskiy to the White House, which Zelenskiy had been pushing hard for, but Trump never committed to a specific date.

Anderson is also expected to say that in November 2018, when Russia seized three Ukrainian ships near Crimea, senior White House officials blocked the State Department from releasing a statement condemning Moscow's action.

At the time, Anderson was an aide to Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine. Anderson's assignment ended on July 12, 2019, two weeks before Trump's call with Zelenskiy.

He was succeeded by Croft, who had started working on Ukraine issues in 2013. She is also scheduled to testify before impeachment inquiry investigators on Wednesday in a separate hearing.

The aid was held up ""at the direction of the President""

According to Croft's opening statement, obtained by NPR, she first learned of the White House's plan to hold up Ukrainian military assistance during a July 18 Office of Management and Budget meeting she listened in on by video conference.

An OMB official told the group that White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney had placed an ""informal hold"" on the $391 million in aid to Ukraine.

""The only reason given was that the order came at the direction of the President,"" Croft is expected to tell House lawmakers.

Croft was traveling when the July 25 call between Trump and Zelenskiy occurred. And Croft says she never had any direct contact with Giuliani, though she was aware that he was in touch with Volker.

Croft plans to tell House committee members that while she was at the NSC but before she became an aide to Volker, former Congressman-turned-lobbyist Robert Livingston called her several times in an effort to enlist her help in forcing the resignation of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled in May 2019.

Livingston described Yovanovitch as an ""Obama holdover,"" claiming she was ""associated with George Soros,"" according to Croft's opening statement.

""It was not clear to me at the time — or now — at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,"" Croft plans to tell impeachment investigators.

She plans to tell lawmakers that she reported her interactions to her boss, Fiona Hill, who has testified that she was alarmed about the smear campaign against Yovanovitch and moved her concerns up the chain of command.

Both Anderson and Croft expect to tell lawmakers about the important role the U.S. can play in addressing the bloody conflict stoked by Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine.

""It is my hope that even as this Committee's process plays out, we do not lose sight of what is happening in Ukraine,"" Croft will tell the committees.

White House insists impeachment inquiry is a ""scam""

Text messages sent by Volker appear to indicate that he was furthering Trump's wish to have Ukraine open an investigation into the Bidens, but Volker told House lawmakers that he did not know why exactly the administration had suspended the military assistance.

Anderson worked for two years as an assistant to Volker, a longtime Europe expert who was serving as a part-time, unpaid envoy in the Trump administration.

On Tuesday, Vindman, the NSC Ukraine expert, testified that he twice raised concerns over how Trump and ""outside influencers"" were undermining the U.S. government's efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine.

Vindman's testimony was backed up by other State Department officials who have told the impeachment investigators that Trump's inner circle opened a back channel of communication with Ukraine that ran afoul of long-established White House procedure on conducting foreign policy.

Significantly, Vindman was the first witness to testify who has firsthand knowledge of the phone call at the center of a whistleblower complaint that set the impeachment inquiry in motion.

According to The New York Times, Vindman told lawmakers that key words and phrases were omitted from the transcript that was made public and that he tried and failed to have the information restored.

Also on Tuesday, House Democrats unveiled a resolution expected to be brought for a full House vote on Thursday, establishing rules for the impeachment inquiry. The proposed rules say that witness hearings will start to be public, transcripts of previous witness interviews will be released, and the president and his lawyers will be allowed to cross-examine witnesses.

The White House, which has attempted to prevent witnesses from testifying to House investigators, condemned the resolution as a ""scam"" and renewed attacks on the inquiry as being unfair to Trump.

""This resolution does nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the Administration,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP

President Trump has lost another legal fight in his efforts to keep his tax returns private. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that Trump's accounting firm must turn over the returns to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.

The president will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, said Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's outside attorneys.

""The decision of the Second Circuit will be taken to the Supreme Court. The issue raised in this case goes to the heart of our Republic. The constitutional issues are significant,"" said Sekulow in a statement.

Vance has sought the records as part of an investigation into whether two women who said they had affairs with Trump were paid for their silence before the 2016 election.

The appellate court's order upholds a U.S. District Court order from last month requiring Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, to turn over Trump's personal and business tax returns starting from 2011.

As a candidate and as president, Trump has broken from long-standing practice to make his returns public. Unlike other past presidents, Trump has also not divested from his business interests.

Trump's attorneys claim that as president, he is immune from criminal investigation. A lower court found that argument ""repugnant to the nation's fundamental structure and constitutional values.""

The appeals court did not rule on the merits of that claim but said that because Vance's office was seeking the records from Trump's accounting firm, and not the president, the question of immunity was not a factor.

""The subpoena at issue is directed not to the President, but to his accountants; compliance does not require the President to do anything at all,"" wrote Judge Robert Katzman on behalf of the three-judge panel.

Vance's office is looking into whether any New York state laws were broken when Trump's then-attorney, Michael Cohen, arranged payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in the closing weeks of the 2016 election. Trump has denied having sexual relationships with the two women.

The president is also fighting efforts by the House of Representatives to obtain his tax records."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Steve Helber/AP Steve Helber/AP

Updated at 2:45 a.m. ET Wednesday



Democrats had a strong election night on Tuesday, leading the race for governor in Kentucky and taking back full control of the Virginia legislature for the first time in nearly a quarter century.

With all precincts reporting in Kentucky, Democrat Andy Beshear bested Republican Gov. Matt Bevin by 5,198 votes, or 0.36% of all votes cast. While The Associated Press says the race is too close to call, Beshear declared victory. Bevin refused to concede.

If Beshear's margin holds, it's a blow to President Trump, who rallied in the state for Bevin on the eve of the election.

Loading...

Beshear, the attorney general of Kentucky, was able to drive up turnout in the commonwealth's urban and suburban centers and received stronger-than-expected numbers in some rural areas. His lead suggested voters are still willing to make a distinction between state and federal races, even in a hyperpartisan political environment.

""Our elections don't have to be about right versus left. They can still be about right versus wrong,"" Beshear said as he claimed victory.

Bevin's second-place position also suggests there may be limits to Trump's typically uncanny ability to turn out his base for a candidate.

Kentucky is a GOP stronghold at the federal level, having gone for Trump by 30 points in 2016, but has a long history of electing Democrats at the state level. When he won in 2015, Bevin became just the third Republican governor in Kentucky since World War II.

However, Kentucky Republicans won all of the state's other constitutional offices on Tuesday, further evidence that this contest was more of a referendum on Bevin than a party shift.

As governor, Bevin made plenty of enemies while doing little to make friends. His approval ratings showed him to be one of the most unpopular governors in the country, and he only narrowly won his primary over a little-known opponent. Bevin picked fights with and offended Kentucky teachers over pension reform, resulting in a major voter backlash. Even his relationships with GOP state legislators were rocky.

Bevin focused on national issues in the race, touting himself as stridently anti-abortion and tough on illegal immigrants, with his ads showing menacing-looking gang members pouring over U.S. borders. He highlighted his support for Trump and was a vocal opponent of the impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Beshear's father Steve was a popular Democratic governor who immediately preceded Bevin and had expanded Medicaid in Kentucky under the Affordable Care Act. Bevin tried to roll back access to Medicaid by implementing work requirements.

During the campaign, Beshear pledged to restore ""respect"" and ""Kentucky values"" to the governor's office, and to protect Medicaid expansion and education funding, focusing the race on state and local issues instead of the nationalized vote Bevin wanted.

Virginia legislature turns blue

In Virginia, Democrats' victories showed that the commonwealth is moving away from its swing-state status and more firmly into the blue column. The legislative wins gave Democrats control of state government, as they now hold the governorship along with both houses of the Virginia General Assembly.

Those new Democratic majorities could lead to greater gun control measures, further expansions to Medicaid and a shot at becoming the final state needed to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. New court-ordered district lines redrawn earlier this year in the state House helped Democrats flip the chamber along with the state Senate. Now that they're in control, Democrats can help determine congressional and legislative district lines in the future.

The battle for control of the statehouse in Virginia attracted big money — some individual races raised more than $2 million — and big names. Just last weekend Vice President Pence and former Vice President Joe Biden held events in the state for their respective parties.

Democrats won majorities in both houses of the General Assembly despite scandals affecting the three top statewide officials in their party. Attorney General Mark Herring admitted earlier this year to wearing blackface when he was younger; Gov. Ralph Northam admitted to darkening his face in 1984 to impersonate Michael Jackson in a dance contest; and two women have accused Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault, which he denies.

GOP success in Mississippi

Republicans did have a good night in Mississippi, keeping an open-seat race in their column as Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves defeated Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood for governor.

The race was closer than usual in Mississippi, with Hood playing up his opposition to abortion rights and gun control while also campaigning to expand Medicaid in the state, which Reeves opposed.

Reeves' campaign got a boost when Trump campaigned in Tupelo, Miss., for him last Friday ahead of the election. The GOP also swept all the down-ballot races — marking the first time since Reconstruction that Republicans will hold all statewide offices.

Enlarge this image toggle caption David Goldman/AP David Goldman/AP

In the five days since Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was declared by many the winner of the first presidential debate, political watchers have waited to see if polls would shift in response to his performance. And, they did.

Not only has the Gallup tracking poll tightened to a tie — 47-47 — but the Pew poll, which last month found President Obama with a strong lead among likely voters — 51-43 — has also seen a huge swing. In the latest poll, Romney now leads 49-45.

""He had a 46 percentage point margin of victory in the debate; by a 66 percent to 20 percent margin, he was declared the winner by the people that we questioned,"" Andy Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center, tells All Things Considered host Robert Siegel. ""According to Gallup, that's one of the biggest debate wins ever.""

Kohut says the debate had ""a very positive impact"" on Romney's image.

""His favorable rating, for the first time in this campaign, hit the 50 percent mark,"" he says. ""He came across as the candidate of new ideas over Obama by a seven-point margin, and he was seen, unlike a month ago, as apt to be as strong a leader as Obama. So he fixed his image very well in this debate victory.""

Obama also lost some of his popularity among women. In September, just 42 percent viewed Romney favorably, while 60 percent had positive impressions of Obama. Now, 51 percent see Obama favorably; 48 percent see Romney favorably.

Romney now finds himself doing well in some issue areas where he had problems among women.

""Romney made gains on health care, taxes, foreign policy, the role of government,"" Kohut says. ""He now ties Obama on those issues and he trailed by rather respectable margins a month ago. It's sort of an across-the-board win. And the climate of opinion is strongly Romney compared to a month ago when it was strongly Obama.""

Kohut noted that these polling numbers were gathered after the debate and amid new data released Friday, which show the unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent last month.

But Romney's jump in the polls comes with some mixed reviews. As many as 62 percent of voters agree with the statement: ""Romney is promising more than he can deliver."" And among swing voters, 75 percent say that people seem to be saying, ""I don't believe he can do what he says, but I like what he says just the same.""

""Yes, and many of them say, 'It's hard to know what he stands for,' "" Kohut says. ""But on the other hand, a 54 percent majority of them say, 'We don't think Obama knows how to fix the economy.' And that's really what's going on here. People have mixed views of both of these candidates, and the candidate who is able to strike the right chords in any given moment will tap into the reservations people have about the other candidate and seem better by comparison."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP

Just how many abortion positions does Mitt Romney have? Once again, that answer is unclear.

This time the confusion began Tuesday, during a meeting with the editorial board of the Des Moines Register.

""There's no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda,"" Romney said.

He went on to add that he would use an executive order to reinstate the ""Mexico City Policy,"" which bars U.S. aid to international groups that lobby or pay for abortions.

But the comment about not pushing abortion-restricting legislation surprised those on both sides of the abortion debate.

""That's quite a shock, coming from Mitt Romney, who has consistently called for the overturn of Roe v Wade; who said that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would do just that; who has an extensive pro-life agenda on his website that anybody can access,"" says Beth Shipp, political director of NARAL Pro-Choice America.

That agenda includes things like defunding Planned Parenthood, which would require legislation. Romney has also endorsed legislation to ban abortions at the point fetuses can theoretically feel pain.

In addition to a terse statement from the campaign vowing that, if elected, Romney would ""be a pro-life president,"" the candidate himself tried to walk back some of his comments when asked by reporters at a campaign stop Wednesday.

""I think I've said time and again, I'm a pro-life candidate. I'll be a pro-life president,"" he said during a rope line in Ohio.

Even before Romney's walk back, however, he was being defended, if somewhat weakly, by abortion opponents.

""No one likes to be caught flat-footed or see your hero flat-footed. But those moments do come,"" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List.

Dannenfelser said she thinks Romney's comment to the editorial board was nothing more than a slip — that he just has too much else on his mind to keep issues like abortion front and center.

""I think the simple truth of the matter is his head is in jobs and the economy almost all day long, almost every single day,"" she said. ""And of course we want at least a third of his focus to be on it all the time, but you don't always get everything that you want.""

NARAL's Shipp, however, thinks it's anything but an accident — just as it was no accident when Romney said in a CBS evening news interview in August that he supported abortions when the pregnant woman's health — not just her life — was threatened. That position was also reversed later, quietly, by staff.

""I know Mitt Romney really wants women to vote for him,"" Shipp says. But the way that he's going about this, by lying to people about where he stands on the issues, is not going to serve him well come Nov. 6.""

Still, political scientist John Green of the University of Akron says what Romney is doing isn't all that unusual.

""There's a long tradition of candidates adopting one kind of position for a broad audience, maybe on television, then having a different position in direct mail or in smaller venues,"" he says.

Green says Romney is running into trouble because in today's world of Twitter and nonstop cable news, there's no such thing as being able to deliver different messages to anyone anymore.

""We've discovered over the last couple of election cycles, and we've seen it in many examples this year, is that it's hard to keep those different venues separate because of our communication technology today,"" Green says.

With an issue as touchy as abortion, that can become even more hazardous, says Green.

""The people who really care about something like abortion, whether they're in the Republican base or the Democratic base, have very firm convictions on where a candidate should stand,"" he says. ""And variation on those convictions can create very real problems.""

Those problems include both alienating one's own voters, and mobilizing those on the other side.

At least for now, however, Romney seems to be making it work. There's still nearly a month until Election Day, however, and two more debates to go."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP Charlie Neibergall/AP

Neither candidate let his opponent get away with much of anything during the vice presidential debate Thursday night.

The tabletop discussion between Vice President Biden and Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin showcased their clear differences over policy. The two disagreed about nearly every issue that came up, whether it was military posture, tax policy or abortion.

Many of these differences were expressed in negative, sometimes surprisingly personal terms.

Ryan blamed the Obama administration for failing to do anything to address the nation's debt crisis, while Biden said Ryan bore much of the blame for deficits because he had voted to put two wars, the Medicare prescription drug benefit and sizable tax cuts ""on a credit card.""

Here are some of the main dynamics and moments that struck us:

They Spoke To Their Bases, Not To The Middle

Biden pushed back against Ryan in ways that President Obama failed to do against GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney in the first presidential debate last week.

More than once, Biden brought up Romney's videotaped comments about the ""47 percent"" of Americans who lack personal responsibility. When it comes to entitlements, Biden said of the Republican ticket, ""Their ideas are old and their ideas are bad and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare.""

For his part, Ryan laid the blame for continuing high unemployment and a sluggish economy straight at the White House doorstep.

""You have a president who ran four years ago promising hope and change who has now turned his campaign into attack, blame and defame,"" Ryan said. ""You see, if you don't have a good record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone to run from.""

The Candidates Dominated Discussion, But The Moderator Mattered

One question from the moderator, Martha Raddatz of ABC News, invited Ryan and Biden to decry the negativity of the campaigning. Instead, they engaged in more of it.

Still, in contrast to last week's presidential debate, Raddatz managed to steer much of the discussion. She moved the discussion quickly through a number of complicated topics.

She didn't challenge the substance of the candidate's responses, but she did press them to be more specific and, at times, to stick to the subject at hand.

She even asked Biden to elucidate his euphemistic phrase, ""This is a bunch of stuff."" He explained that it meant ""malarkey.""

But the job of challenging what a candidate meant by any particular statement fell, typically, to the opposing candidate. Neither Biden nor Ryan let many statements go unchallenged.

For All Their Courtesy, Biden And Ryan Routinely Insulted Each Other

There have been previous debates that featured candidates seated close together at a table in a format that seemed to minimize personal attacks and bombast.

This wasn't one of those occasions. Throughout the debate, Ryan and Biden insulted each other in subtle and not so subtle ways.

In true senatorial fashion, Biden referred several times to Ryan as ""my friend."" But he didn't come across as a highly patient friend.

""I have never met two guys who are more down on America across the board,"" Biden said of the Republicans.

At times, Biden not only challenged the veracity and consistency of Ryan's responses but seemed to be heckling him, interjecting phrases during Ryan's time such as ""that didn't happen,"" ""that's a bizarre statement"" and — shades of the 1988 vice presidential debate — ""Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy!""

Ryan, who referred repeatedly to Biden as ""Joe,"" may have come to the Centre College stage in Danville, Ky., with a couple of pointed lines prepared at the vice president's expense. But Biden may have topped one of them with an ad lib.

Ryan tried to explain away Romney's comments about the 47 percent by alluding to Biden's own widely noted proclivity for gaffes, saying, ""I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.""

Biden countered, ""But I always say what I mean, and so does Romney.""

A Debate About Defense Contained More Heat Than Light

The last presidential debate, on Oct. 22, will focus on defense and foreign policy. Up to this point, however, the vice presidential discussion featured more substantive discussion of such issues than any other campaign event thus far.

The two men seemed to express strong differences when it comes to levels of military spending and the U.S. posture toward countries including Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and Iran.

But when Ryan was pressed, he sometimes came up short in trying to explain how the Republicans would handle things differently than has the Democratic administration.

On Syria, for example, Ryan complained that the Obama administration had wasted time by letting a U.N. envoy seek a deal with President Bashar Assad. It would have been better to work through allies in the region, he said, such as Turkey and Qatar to identify friendly forces within Syria.

But he suggested that it would be a mistake to send in U.S. troops for humanitarian reasons. ""Putting American troops on the ground, that's got to be within the national security interests of the American people,"" Ryan said.

It's Not Just What You Say. It's How You Say It

It's become a truism of campaign debates that body language matters — that how the candidates appear with the sound off matters as much as the substance of their remarks.

There was certainly a stark contrast between the two men in terms of demeanor. Biden seemed to have two main forms of expression — laughter and anger.

At times, he was openly frustrated with Ryan's comments, flashing a broad, toothy smile and all but rolling his eyes. Biden looked alternately puzzled and bemused as he listened to Ryan's characterizations of Obama administration policies.

Biden embraced his role as the elder statesman on the stage, unabashedly touting his own long record in Washington by saying on several occasions that ""I was there"" when big deals were made years or even decades ago on tax cuts and Social Security policy.

Ryan was occasionally wonky, talking repeatedly about a ""status of forces agreement"" in regard to Iraq. Most of the time, however, he emphasized his Midwestern roots, referring to a friend from his hometown serving in Afghanistan, or having viewed the ultrasound image of his first child at the hospital where he himself had been born.

Ryan was consistently calm, sober and unblinking, but occasionally he appeared to silently seethe at Biden's remarks, showing a pained, dimply half-smile as he waited for his chances to respond.

At one point, he objected to Biden's heckling by saying, ""Mr. Vice President, I know you're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if we don't keep interrupting each other."""

For our series First and Main, Morning Edition is traveling to contested counties in swing states to find out what is shaping voters' decisions this election season. The latest trip took us to Larimer County, Colo.

The presidential race has become much tighter in recent days, and in Colorado, a recent poll puts Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in the lead.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Becky Lettenberger/NPR Becky Lettenberger/NPR

Colorado is one of several swing states where campaign efforts will be concentrated in these past few weeks before the election. Of those efforts, actually getting people to the polls will be one of the most important.

In Colorado, both the Romney and Obama campaigns have an eye on Latino voters in particular. The state has seen a tremendous amount of growth in the Latino population. According to census data, that particular demographic grew by 41 percent between 2000 and 2010. Latinos make up about 21 percent of Colorado's overall population.

They're a smaller percentage of the population in Larimer County — only about 11 percent — but in a hotly contested swing county, it's a voting bloc that neither candidate can afford to ignore.

On a rainy evening in downtown Fort Collins, we met with three Latino women — Betty Aragon, Guadalupe Salazar and Jan Barela-Smith — at their favorite Mexican restaurant. They'd been caught in a downpour on their way to meet us, and by the time we arrived, they were drying off and warming up with bowls of hot chili verde.

All three women are Democrats, which puts them in sync with most Latino voters. Polls show Latinos support President Obama at a rate of more than 2 to 1.

Aragon, a self-employed resident of Fort Collins, explains to us why she thinks that is: ""We're talking about the DREAM Act,"" she says. ""We're talking about the immigration issue. These are issues that really impact the Hispanic community.""

But Salazar and Barela-Smith — both of whom work in higher education — think that it's more than just traditional issues that keep Latinos in the Democratic camp. Salazar points out that the Romney campaign has raised the idea of cutting back on Pell Grants for higher education. That, she says, disproportionately affects Latinos — either preventing them from pursuing education or forcing them to take out more loans.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Becky Lettenberger/NPR Becky Lettenberger/NPR

""Since Obama has been in office, the Pell Grant went up from $4,300 to $5,550,"" she explains. ""That's a lot of money. That pays a full tuition, books and fees at Front Range [Community College] for a student to go. Without that money, they're not going to be able to go to college, and then they will take loans.""

While the Democrats are counting on Latino support, Republicans are trying to prove that their party is the natural home for Latino voters. One man who agrees with that is Joe Andujo, an information analyst for a health care group and a member of the Northern Colorado Hispanic Republicans.

""Faith, family, freedom"" — those are the values that he says he believes are held by both Latinos and by the Republican Party.

""None of us,"" he says, ""want handouts. We want a hand up. We want to be able to work hard and keep what we earned. And I think the Republican Party best demonstrates, or best helps us to achieve those goals of retaining what we have and living the American dream, which is why most immigrants come to this country to begin with.""

Andujo says he thinks the Republican Party could do much more to educate Latinos about who Republicans are and what the party stands for. That strategy could one day pay off for Republicans in attracting larger numbers of Latino voters.

In the meantime, there's no guarantee that Latinos will turn out in great numbers. Both campaigns will be using these remaining few weeks to get out the vote."

The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments Tuesday in a highly anticipated set of cases that threatens the legal status of some 700,000 young immigrants — often called DREAMers — who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. It's a program that President Trump tried to rescind seven months after taking office, only to have the lower courts block his action.

In 2012, President Barack Obama put the program in place to temporarily protect these young people from deportation. If you were in school, were a high school graduate, or had been honorably discharged from the military, and if you passed a background check, you were eligible for temporary legal status and a work permit, renewable every two years. The program is formally known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.

""Rest easy""

President Trump, from the beginning, seemed conflicted about DACA, caught between the mass deportations he promised his political base during the campaign and his admiration for what so many of the DREAMers have accomplished.

These DACA recipients, who come from around the world, have become teachers, psychologists, business owners and doctors.

Their successes illustrate the reason that Republicans and Democrats in Congress tried to work out a DACA deal that Trump would sign in 2017. ""Rest easy,"" Trump told the DREAMers in an April 2017 interview with The Associated Press.

Trump ""kept waffling back and forth""

But he ""kept waffling back and forth over what he would be willing to accept, and wouldn't be willing to accept,"" in terms of a DACA deal, says Julie Hirschfeld Davis, co-author of Border Wars and congressional editor for The New York Times.

At the end of the day, Trump's indecision was so frustrating for Senate Republican leaders that they worked out a compromise with Democrats on their own. Just hours before the deal was to come up for a vote on the Senate floor, however, the administration branded it unacceptable in a midnight press release, according to Davis.

Shortly thereafter, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the DACA program would end because, he said, it was illegal and unconstitutional to begin with.



""They are dead wrong ...""

""They are dead wrong when they say that the DACA program adopted by the Obama administration was illegal,"" says Ted Olson, who served as solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration and is representing DACA plaintiffs in the Supreme Court.

Olson points to programs similar to DACA that were put in place by every other president dating back to Dwight Eisenhower. These programs granted temporary legal status, for instance, to 600,000 Cubans in the 1950s and '60s and 1.5 million other undocumented immigrants under another program in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations.

Janet Napolitano was secretary at the Department Homeland Security when DACA was created. ""Not only is there a long history of deferring action for particular groups under the immigration laws,"" says Napolitano, ""but there's the whole concept of prosecutorial discretion, which gives the executive branch the authority to make decisions about who is going to feel the full brunt of the federal government in an enforcement proceeding, versus not.""



Prosecutorial discretion vs. ""complete suspension of the law""

""The Supreme Court has long recognized that there may be a line between prosecutorial discretion, not enforcing the law in every instance, and a complete suspension of the law,"" counters John Eastman, a constitutional law professor at Chapman University who has filed a brief siding with the Trump administration in the DACA case.

Eastman maintains that DACA is different from other, similar programs in prior administrations, citing DACA recipients' benefits — including work authorization, Social Security benefits and tax credits on tax returns — as different from prior administrations.

Napolitano replies that granting temporary legal status to DACA recipients enables them to work, and when they work, they must pay into Social Security and pay taxes.

Indeed, government statistics indicate that some 91% of DACA recipients have jobs, allowing them to support their families and generating, over a 10-year period, nearly $60 billion in federal tax revenue that the government stands to lose if the DACA program is abolished.

Is this illegally arbitrary?

Napolitano is no longer DHS secretary. She is the president of the giant University of California system, including 1,700 students with DACA status. And in that capacity, she is challenging Trump's revocation of the DACA program as so arbitrary and unsupported by stated reasons and data that the revocation is itself illegal.

""If they had done a full policy review and had set forth all their reasons and demonstrated that they had weighed the pros and cons and just came to a different conclusion, they might be able to prevail in this case,"" says Napolitano. ""But they didn't do that. Instead they just simply issued basically a one-sentence order that said since DACA is illegal or was illegal, we're going to undo it.""

Sometimes lost in all the legal discussion are the people whose lives will be affected by the Supreme Court's decision in the DACA case. DACA recipient Mitchell Santos Toledo, brought to the U.S. when he was 2 and now in his last year at Harvard Law School, remembers crying when he received his Social Security card. ""This is home for us. It's not a place I call home. It is home,"" he says.

A first-of-its-kind video friend of the court brief filed by United We Dream seeks to highlight other DACA stories. ""We got DACA and it's like we got wings. I am a mom, a wife and a business owner,"" says Angelica Villalobos, who owns an auto repair shop.

""I worked on a project that won two Grammys, "" says Emmanuel A. ""I did some fieldwork picking strawberries. I decided to become a teacher so that students could have that role model,"" says Maricruz R.

Public support for DACA is illustrated by a distinct imbalance in friend of the court briefs filed in the case. Six have been filed supporting the administration's position. They include briefs filed by conservative organizations and individuals and a brief filed by 12 Republican-dominated states.

A total of 35 briefs have been filed in support of DACA. Among them are briefs filed by higher education associations, health professionals and even briefs filed by more than 145 corporations and business organizations arguing that if the court were to side with the Trump administration and abolish DACA, their companies and industries would be significantly disrupted.

A decision on DACA is expected by summer, just as the 2020 election is kicking into high gear. Republicans in Congress may be hoping that the high court will let them off the hook and rule in favor of DACA.

Whether the current Supreme Court, dominated by conservative justices inclined to defer to presidential power, fulfills those hopes, however, remains to be seen."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP

Two witnesses seen as crucial to the case against President Trump in the impeachment inquiry testified Wednesday.

Much of what was said by acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and George Kent, the State Department's top official on Ukraine policy, was previously known from their lengthy depositions released last week.

But there were some new things — and several moments that stood out. Here are seven:

1. A new detail from a new witness emerges

Taylor revealed that in the past week, a member of his staff shared some new information with him about a call between President Trump and European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland that tied Trump to an effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

""Following the call with President Trump,"" Taylor said, ""the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of (Joe) Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.""

Multiple congressional sources identified David Holmes as the aide to Taylor. Holmes is scheduled to testify in a closed-door session on Friday.

It's unclear whether he would also be called to testify in an open session.

2. Trump felt he was wronged and Ukraine owed him

On President Trump's now-infamous call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump said, ""[T]he United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily ...""

Can't see the video? Click here.

Taylor testified that Sondland explained to him that Trump was a businessman and that a businessman expected something in return when writing a check. Taylor said he didn't think that made sense, because Ukraine didn't owe Trump anything.

Still, Taylor tried to explain that the president thought he was, in fact, owed something after what he saw as people in Ukraine being against him during the 2016 election.

""There was a feeling by President Trump,"" Taylor said, ""that he had a feeling of having been wronged by the Ukrainians, and so this was something that he thought they owed him to fix that wrong.""

3. The controversy about the Bidens

Kent noted that during the Obama administration, he raised concerns about the potential perception of a conflict of interest of Hunter Biden serving on the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, while his father, Joe Biden, was handling Ukraine policy as vice president. He said nothing was done about it.

Can't see the video? Click here.

But he dismissed the notion that Joe Biden did anything wrong.

Asked whether there was any factual basis to support allegations against Biden, Kent replied: ""None whatsoever.""

He said the former vice president acted in accordance with U.S. policy. And when asked if it was fair to say that Biden was participating in a wholly anti-corruption effort, and that Trump was not, Kent said, ""That's a fair assessment.""

He added that the president's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was ""looking to dig up political dirt on a political rival in the next election cycle"" in Ukraine.

Taylor agreed with Kent's assessment.

4. ""You're their star witness?""

One of President Trump's chief defenders Wednesday was Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.

He argued that neither Taylor nor Kent had firsthand knowledge of many of their allegations and, therefore, had less credibility. Jordan dismissed Taylor this way:

""You weren't on the call, were you? ... You didn't listen in on President Trump's call, President Zelenskiy? ... You never talked with Chief of Staff Mulvaney. ... You never met the president. ... You had three meetings with Zelenskiy, and it [security assistance for investigations] didn't come up. ... And President Zelenskiy never made an announcement. This is what I can't believe, and you're their star witness.""

Can't see the video? Click here.

Taylor testified that Sondland told an aide to President Zelenskiy that security assistance was unlikely to come if there was no public statement of support for the investigations into the conspiracy theories about Ukraine's role in the 2016 election and the Bidens.

After learning of Taylor's testimony, Sondland amended his and admitted he did, in fact, say that.

5. GOP raises Ukrainian suspicions, corruption

Taking center stage were the staff counsels, the Democrats' Daniel Goldman and Republicans' Steve Castor.

""Now Mr. Kent, corruption in Ukraine is endemic, correct?"" Castor asked.

""That's correct,"" Kent replied.

""And it affects the courts, the prosecutors, and there have historically been problems with all the prosecutors in Ukraine, correct?"" Castor added.

Can't see the video? Click here.

Castor tried to establish that Ukrainian corruption is rampant, so it would make sense that President Trump would want that looked into. And he also tried to raise suspicions around Ukrainians who said not-so-nice things about candidate Trump.

As Taylor explained to California Rep. Devin Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee's ranking member, Trump said during his presidential campaign that perhaps Crimea should be recognized as Russian.

""That sentiment is amazingly inflammatory to all Ukrainians,"" Taylor said.

6. Summing up the GOP rebuttal

New York Rep. Elise Stefanik summed up the GOP rebuttal as to why Trump should not be impeached by making two points:

""For the millions of Americans viewing today,"" she said, ""the two most important facts are the following:

""No. 1, Ukraine received the aid.

""No. 2, there was, in fact, no investigation into Biden.""

Can't see the video? Click here.

Jordan and others laid out why it would be valid for Trump to ask about the things he asked Zelenskiy to look into because:

1. Various Ukrainians did have problems with Trump (planting the seed that it's possible that Ukrainians had some role in 2016 election interference).

2. The head of Burisma was seen by many U.S. and international officials as corrupt, so it's a valid request to ask for an investigation, especially in a country known for corruption.

The U.S. intelligence community has assessed, and the Mueller report affirmed, that it was, in fact, the Russians who interfered with the 2016 elections, not Ukrainians. Kent also pushed back on the idea that Ukraine interfered.

""To my knowledge, there is no factual basis, no,"" he said.

Republicans also argued that Taylor and Kent's testimonies were based on hearsay, and that, in the end, Trump favored more robust military aid to Ukraine than President Obama.

7. Leaving a seat open for President Trump

Republicans complained on several occasions during Wednesday's testimony that they'd like to see the whistleblower testify, going so far as to unsuccessfully raise a procedural motion to bring the whistleblower before the committee.

""There's one witness they won't bring in front of us,"" Jordan said, ""they won't bring in front of the American people. That's the guy who started it all — the whistleblower.""

Can't see the video? Click here.

Peter Welch of Vermont parried back: ""I'd say to my colleague, I'd be glad to have the person who started it all come in and testify. President Trump is welcome to take a seat right there.""

In the United Kingdom, Veterans Day is celebrated with red paper poppies pinned to lapels in remembrance of those who served in World War I. The practice caught on after the bloody battlefields of France bloomed with red poppies following the war. Every year, British people wear these red flower pins for about a month leading up to Nov. 11, and buying one of these paper flowers funds veterans groups. The U.K. memorializes the end of World War I with purpose and style.

Veterans Day began as a commemoration of World War I, that 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918 when the guns were silenced and the armistice was called and peace came at last. After four long years of fighting in the ""war to end all wars,"" the dead numbered an estimated 9 million troops. Nearly 120,000 were Americans.

Nov. 11 was originally Armistice Day in the United States, though it wasn't ratified by Congress until 1938. By the mid-1950s veterans groups urged Congress to change the day to honor Americans who had served in all wars, removing the distinctive honor for those who served in World War I.

So here we are now, 101 years after the Armistice of 1918, and many Americans have all but forgotten World War I. Americans reenact the Civil War, salute the remaining veterans of World War II with Honor Flights to the monuments and Arlington National Cemetery and for years have remembered Vietnam War vets with Rolling Thunder on Memorial Day. (That holiday honors all war dead.) But where are the World War I remembrance ceremonies on this important day that ushered in the many wars of the last century?

The nation's capital has a tremendous World War II Memorial, a moving Korean War Memorial and an iconic Vietnam War Memorial. The only World War I memorial in the city is a small stone gazebo, dedicated to those who served from Washington, D.C. A new national World War I memorial is planned near the White House, but it's now more than 100 years since the guns were silenced. It's too late for those troops. They're long gone and mostly faded from our collective memory. But here's the story of one of them.

Sgt. Charles Kelley, Company C of the 12th Machine Gun Battalion, joined Gen. Pershing's American Expeditionary Forces in France in late summer of 1918. He was 18 years old. During the Meuse-Argonne offensive, which began in September 1918, Kelley, according to Pentagon records, ""led his platoon in the attack with great bravery against strongly held enemy trenches. Shortly after reaching his objective he was wounded in the throat. He refused to be evacuated, but continued to actively command his men until the night of Oct. 1, by which time, due to his wound, he had lost the power of speech.""

The Meuse-Argonne offensive was the single bloodiest battle in American history with more than 26,000 Americans killed. For his heroism, Sgt. Kelley was honored with the Distinguished Service Cross, second only to the Medal of Honor. My family has worked to get him upgraded to a posthumous Medal of Honor for his courage and bravery, but the Army says too much time has passed. There are no more eyewitnesses. It's true. We — his family — had never realized his heroism while he was alive. We never realized what the initials DSC meant on his gravestone at Arlington National Cemetery. It was only a few years ago that we looked up his records to see what he'd done to earn this high honor.

But now, we salute our grandfather. We honor him and all those of that generation who courageously took on a fight that cost the lives of so many and ultimately did nothing to end or prevent war.

Today I am wearing a red paper poppy on my lapel in the memory of the tens of thousands of Americans, as well as the millions worldwide killed in a war that ended 101 years ago, but has all but been forgotten by Americans.

Updated at 5:18p.m. ET

Two correctional officers who were assigned to guard Jeffrey Epstein on the night he died in his cell have been indicted for allegedly ignoring more than 75 mandatory checks on the wealthy financier then fabricating records to cover it up.

Federal authorities charged Michael Thomas and Tova Noel with multiple counts of falsifying records and conspiracy. The two worked as guards at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal facility in Manhattan that is mostly used for defendants awaiting trial.

At a court appearance on Tuesday, Thomas and Noel pleaded not guilty and a judge released each of them on a $100,000 bond.

The indictment provides the first official account of what happened in the hours before Epstein's death.

According to video surveillance footage obtained by prosecutors, Epstein was in his cell unobserved for eight hours before he was found dead. The unit he was in requires that all inmates be accounted for twice an hour.

Prosecutors say that while working an overnight shift, Thomas and Noel, the only two officers assigned to Epstein's wing, neglected to check on him.

Instead, Thomas and Noel sat at their desks and browsed the Internet for furniture, motorcycle sales and sports news instead of monitoring Epstein in his cell, some 15 feet away in the Special Housing Unit, according to the indictment.

Authorities said for about two hours during their shift, footage shows that the two guards were apparently sleeping.

It was only when inmates' breakfast was to be served around 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10 that Thomas and Noel entered Epstein's unit.

""Epstein hung himself,"" Noel told her boss, according to the indictment.

""We messed up,"" Thomas said to the same supervisor, the document states.

U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said the two had signed more than 75 separate 30-minute round entries falsely stating that they were monitoring Epstein.

""They repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction,"" Berman said.

Prosecutors said security footage confirmed that nobody went into the section of the jail housing Epstein before he died, undercutting conspiracy theories that someone else was responsible for his death.

Epstein's cell mate had been transferred, leaving Epstein alone in his unit. Jail worker union officials said it was unusual to have a prisoner in this section of the jail alone in a cell, saying that had someone been housed with Epstein, the episode may have been prevented.

In response to the indictment, Bureau of Prisons Director Kathleen Hawk Sawyer issued a statement saying her agency takes any allegations of misconduct seriously.

""I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public's trust in us,"" Sawyer said.

During a Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Sawyer told lawmakers there is no evidence to suggest Epstein died any way other than suicide.

Epstein, 66, the wealthy financier who faced sex-trafficking charges at the time of his death, was awaiting trial in a case that, if he was convicted, could have resulted in a decades-long prison sentence.

The New York City medical examiner said in August that an autopsy showed that Epstein had hanged himself in his cell, a conclusion that has been rejected by both conspiracy theorists and members of Epstein's family, who have claimed his death was a homicide and hired a private forensic pathologist to probe the incident.

There were warning signs that Epstein was a high-risk inmate. In July, guards found Epstein unconscious and with bruises on his neck. After that, Epstein was placed on suicide watch for 24 hours then transferred to a hospital ward for less than a week. He then returned to a special detention unit where inmates receive extra supervision, including being checked in on once every 30 minutes. Less than two weeks later, Epstein was found dead.

Before his death, Epstein had pleaded not guilty in a case in which authorities said he ""enticed and recruited"" girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan and his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., to sexually abuse them.

Prosecutors said he paid the girls hundreds of dollars in cash for their silence and coaxed them into finding him other victims. The girls, as young as 14 years old, were brought to his properties ostensibly to provide Epstein massages, but he would escalate the encounters by making unwanted physical contact that would ultimately end in sexual abuse, prosecutors wrote in a federal indictment filed in July that involved allegations stretching back to the early 2000s.

Attorney General Bill Barr said shortly after Epstein's death that he was ""appalled"" that such a high-profile defendant was not properly guarded in a federal facility. Barr said the Justice Department, the FBI and other authorities have launched inquiries to get to the bottom of what led to Epstein's dying in a jail cell.

Jose Rojas, an official with the union that represents Federal Bureau of Prisons officers, said in an interview with NPR that the two guards are being scapegoated for much deeper systemic problems dealing with the chronic understaffing of federal detention facilities.

""The emphasis should be on the conditions that caused the shortage of staff. And then who made the decision to take him off suicide watch? And who made the decision to leave him in the cell alone?"" Rojas said.

He said the facility that Epstein was housed in was not operating with a full staff, and officers like the two charged on Tuesday worked mandatory overtime.

""If the DOJ wants to blame someone, they should look in the mirror,"" Rojas said. ""There is a crisis in our agency. Not just in Manhattan, but throughout the Bureau. We are short of staff.""

toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images

Updated at 9:05 a.m. ET

Candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination took to the debate stage for the fifth time Wednesday night. There weren't any groundbreaking or game-changing moments, but here are five things that stood out:

1. Impeachment hearings may have taken some steam out of the debate

Let's face it: The biggest story of Wednesday was not the debate, it was the impeachment testimony of Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.

And you have to wonder if that had some effect on the energy in the debate and the willingness of the candidates to go after one other. For the first 90 minutes of the two-hour debate, it was a fairly staid affair. That changed when the subject turned to race.

Can't see the video? Click here.

2. Buttigieg held up to criticism

The story going into Wednesday's debate, as far as the Democratic presidential field was concerned, was the rise of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg is surging in early state polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. Could Pete take the heat? For the most part, he did.

Early on, the candidates didn't go after him, but eventually Buttigieg had to answer questions about his record on race relations in South Bend and his depth of experience. Buttigieg was able to parry both, showing humility on race and questioning the value of ""Washington experience.""

""There's more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage,"" said Buttigieg, ""and where are we right now as a country?""

Buttigieg's biggest vulnerabilities remain twofold — (1) He's been unable to win over African American voters so far — and it's nearly impossible to win the Democratic nomination without them; and (2) when voters look at him — he's 37 — do they see a president?

3. Biden stumbles — again — but will it matter?

Former Vice President Joe Biden had some cringeworthy moments in this debate — when discussing violence against women, he said it's necessary to ""keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it.""

And he said he had the support of ""the only African American woman that had ever been elected to the United States Senate."" Biden meant first, not only, but it was awkward, considering a black female senator was on that stage running against him for the nomination, Kamala Harris, who interrupted to say, ""The other one is here.""

Biden also stammered his way through other answers, but he has remained remarkably steady in the polls, especially with black voters and older voters.

There is a segment of the Democratic Party that has a deep affection for Biden, his life and experience — and some voters resent the way some of the other candidates go after him.

4. Booker, Klobuchar have strong debates

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker made the most of the opportunities he got Wednesday night. And he had to, because he has not yet qualified for the December debate.

Booker came out swinging against Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposed wealth tax, arguing Democrats should be talking about ""how to give more people opportunities to create wealth, to grow businesses, to have their American dream.""

Klobuchar also didn't pass up opportunities to jump in, and she made her points cogently. She took on Buttigieg on the issue of experience. ""I have won statewide,"" Klobuchar said to him, adding that while she had ""appreciation for your good work as a local official ... I think experience should matter.""

5. Foreign policy, voting rights, child care took a more prominent role

Maybe it's partially because of the impeachment hearings, given Ukraine has been featured so prominently in domestic political news, maybe it was partially because of the moderators, but this debate featured more foreign policy than others and was the first to address child care and voting rights.

There were questions and answers that involved everything from Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Russia, North Korea, Iraq, Mexico, Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, China and Hong Kong, Israelis and Palestinians, and nuclear treaties.

It makes sense that voting rights was discussed given where the debate was taking place, in Atlanta, after Georgia's bitter and contentious 2018 governor's race. And, as Vox notes, ""It took a debate with all-female moderators to ask Democrats about paid family leave."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP

Federal prosecutors have unsealed an indictment accusing former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh of using her series of self-published children's books to commit fraud, evade federal taxes and illegally boost her own political campaigns.

Pugh, 69, resigned in May after public outcry over a scandal involving hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of Healthy Holly books that she sold to a nonprofit health care company. She was on the board of that company when she was a state senator, raising questions about self-dealing — and even about the existence of the books, which feature a young black girl who touts the benefits of nutrition and exercise. After Pugh was paid, thousands of books apparently were never delivered.

The 11-count federal indictment made public Wednesday reveals a fuller picture of what the government says was a scheme in which she collected payments from the books to line her own pocket, donate to her own political campaign and even buy a house. At the same time, authorities say, customers waited around for Healthy Holly books that never arrived.

Pugh now stands accused of federal crimes including multiple counts of wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and tax evasion.

""Fraud and corruption of the sort we are addressing today undermine the public's faith in public officials,"" Robert Hur, U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland, told reporters Wednesday in Baltimore. ""This is a tragedy and the last thing that our city needs.""

Prosecutors also announced that two of Pugh's associates, former city employees Gary Brown Jr. and Roslyn Wedington, have accepted plea deals.

Brown, 38, admitted to crimes including wire fraud for cashing checks that he said Pugh wrote to him for the children's books, then using the money to pay down Pugh's debt and make political donations to her. Prosecutors say Brown then tried to cover the ruse by filing false documents to the Internal Revenue Service.

Pugh and Brown, according to the indictment, secretly moved tens of thousands of dollars from the book sales to her political campaign under other peoples' names — what prosecutors call ""straw donations"" — in an alleged attempt to make it appear as if the money was flowing from other sources.

Wedington, 50, accepted a plea bargain from the government in a separate ploy in which she dodged federal taxes and then attempted to conceal it. Brown admitted that he assisted in this scheme.

""Corrupt public employees rip off the taxpayers and undermine everyone's faith in government,"" Hur said in a statement.

If convicted, prosecutors said Pugh could face lengthy prison time. Authorities are also seeking to recover some $769,000 in profits from the alleged fraudulent book sales.

Prosecutors said in the indictment that they might try to seize her home in a wealthy section of northwest Baltimore that authorities allege was purchased and renovated with ill-gotten profits.

Pugh is expected to turn herself in to U.S. Marshals ahead of an expected court appearance and arraignment on Thursday before U.S. District Judge Deborah Chasanow. She is expected to enter a plea of not guilty.

Pugh's lawyer, Steven Silverman, declined to comment, telling NPR that he ""will address this matter in open court tomorrow.""

In late April, the FBI and IRS raided Pugh's home as part of the federal investigation into the children's book scandal first exposed by The Baltimore Sun.

A week later, her resignation was announced at an event in which she was not present. In her absence, Silverman read a statement in which Pugh apologized for ""the harm I have caused to the image of the city of Baltimore and the credibility of the office of the mayor.""

Pugh has been in self-imposed seclusion in her home following an initial leave of absence she claimed was over a bout of pneumonia."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Gregory Bull/AP Gregory Bull/AP

The U.S. Navy said Thursday that it will proceed with a hearing to consider the expulsion of Special Operations Chief Eddie Gallagher from the Navy SEALs, despite his support from President Trump.

Gallagher and three supervising officers were informed of the administrative review board hearing, set for Dec. 2, on Wednesday.

""The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin,"" said Trump in a tweet earlier Thursday. ""This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!""

The Trident Pin is a symbol of membership in the SEALs.

In July, Gallagher was acquitted of murdering a wounded Islamic State militant in Iraq in 2017, but he was convicted on the single charge of posing with the body of the dead prisoner. Last week Trump restored Gallagher's rank after he had been demoted to petty officer first class. But the president did not pardon Gallagher for his offense.

In a statement issued late Thursday, Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, Chief of Information, said:

""The Navy follows the lawful orders of the President. We will do so in case of an order to stop the administrative review of SOC Gallagher's professional qualification. We are aware of the President's tweet and we are awaiting further guidance.""

The White House didn't respond to an NPR request for comment on the tweet.

Gallagher's lawyers say Navy brass is seeking to expel him from the SEALs in retaliation for Trump's reversal of his demotion. They filed a complaint with the Navy Inspector General claiming that Naval Special Warfare Commander Rear Adm. Collin Green is defying the president.

""How can Admiral Green credibly preach about preserving good order and discipline while publicly flouting the orders of the commander in chief?"" Gallagher's attorney Timothy Parlatore said as quoted by the Associated Press.

If a review board decision goes against Gallagher, he can then appeal to the Navy's Personnel Command."

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has taken the brunt of the responsibility for the attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi, in which ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed.

As we've reported, what the White House knew and what they told the public officially has come under heavy scrutiny and sharp criticism from Republicans.

In fact, during the vice presidential debate, the first question asked of Vice President Joe Biden was about the incident and whether it represented a major intelligence failure. Biden said the White House did not know extra security had been requested by the outpost and he also asserted that the intelligence community believed that the attacks were, indeed, triggered by a protest against an anti-Muslim film.

In an interview with CNN last night, Clinton was asked if the Obama administration was trying to throw her ""under the bus.""

""I take responsibility,"" Clinton told CNN. ""I'm in charge of the State Department's 60,000-plus people all over the world — 275 posts. The president and the vice president wouldn't be knowledgeable about specific decisions that are made by security professionals. They're the ones who weigh all of the threats and the risks and the needs.""

In an interview with NBC News, Clinton also said that politics should be kept out of this kind of situation.

""I really believe that tragedies like what happened in Benghazi should be viewed in a non-political way,"" Clinton said. ""Everybody should pull together as Americans.""

She told NBC that she wasn't focusing on whom to blame but ""what was happening and could happen. We did everything we could to keep our people safe, which is my primary responsibility."""

The annual Harvard-Yale football game was delayed for almost an hour on Saturday as climate change activists rushed the field at the end of halftime.

Unfurling banners with slogans like ""Nobody wins. Yale and Harvard are complicit in climate injustice,"" protesters from both schools called on the universities to divest their multi-million dollar endowments from fossil fuels companies, as well as companies that hold Puerto Rican debt.

Clad in winter coats and hats, about 150 students sprawled around the 50-yard line at Yale Bowl as loudspeaker announcements and police demanded protesters leave the field. As protesters clapped and chanted ""disclose, divest and reinvest,"" organizers say several hundred more fans left their seats in the stands to join in. By the time play resumed, several dozen people were issued misdemeanor summonses for disorderly conduct.

Harvard senior Caleb Schwartz, one of the protest organizers who was arrested on Saturday, told NPR the mood on the field was joyful, despite the possibility of arrest.

""That moment, when we saw people running onto the field was just really incredible,"" he said. ""I saw organizers around me crying because it was such a beautiful moment.""

""We know that we don't have a lot of time to act to curb the effects of climate change, and the longer it takes for our universities to acknowledge their role in the climate crisis and accept responsibility, the longer the urgent action we need to take on climate change is going to be delayed,"" he says.

Schwartz says the Harvard-Yale rivalry game has been played since 1875, and organizers knew alumni from all over the world would be tuning in.

""Although it was disruptive and some people were not too happy we were on the field, it was really important because our universities are just not listening to our voices and our generation's calls for urgent climate action.""

In a statement, the student groups behind the protest, Fossil Free Yale, the Yale Endowment Justice Coalition and Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, wrote:

""Harvard and Yale claim their goal is to create student leaders who can strive toward a more 'just, fair, and promising world' by 'improving the world today and for future generations.' Yet by continuing to invest in industries that mislead the public, smear academics, and deny reality, Harvard and Yale are complicit in tearing down that future.""

Harvard and Yale are not the first universities to face criticism over fossil fuel investments. The first campus divestment movements started at Swarthmore College in 2011. Harvard has repeatedly said it would not pursue divestment, while Yale has made some moves in recent years to consider climate change in its investment decisions.

Karen N. Peart, director of University Media Relations at Yale, told NPR in a statement:

""Yale stands firmly for the right to free expression. Today, students from Harvard and Yale expressed their views and delayed the start of the second half of the football game. We stand with the Ivy League in its statement that it is regrettable that the orchestrated protest came during a time when fellow students were participating in a collegiate career-defining contest and an annual tradition when thousands gather from around the world to enjoy and celebrate the storied traditions of both football programs and universities.""

Saturday's protest during a marque rivalry football game attracted widespread attention, including tweets of support from several Democratic presidential candidates including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders.

The protest garnered so much interest, that Schwartz changed his bus ticket back to Cambridge on Saturday so he could stay and field the deluge of media inquiries.

""We will win this fight, and we will get the university to divest,"" he told NPR from his bus home. ""I truly don't think it's a question of if, it's a question of when. And the more pressure we can put on them, the sooner they will."""

Move Thanksgiving to Friday? That's what F.B. Haviland asked President Herbert Hoover in 1929.

toggle caption National Archives

Didn't happen. But while we're on the subject, ever wonder why we carve our gobblers on the fourth Thursday of November? Hint: It's not because Thanksgiving Thursday is more alliterative than Thanksgiving Friday.

In 1789, President George Washington declared Thursday, Nov. 26, as a ""Day of Publick Thanksgivin,"" according to the National Archives. But in the years following, the date for the holiday was announced by presidential proclamation and was celebrated on various days and in different months. When President Abraham Lincoln made his Thanksgiving proclamation in 1863, the last Thursday of November became standard.

Then came the big date dispute of 1939, when two Thanksgiving holidays were observed.

toggle caption Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum

You see, according to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, a five-Thursday November fell in 1933, and some retailers asked President Roosevelt to move the holiday to a week earlier.

The president denied the request, and Americans ate their turkey on the last Thursday as always in 1933.

But Roosevelt was president for a long time, long enough for another five-Thursday November to roll around in 1939. Once again, some business leaders asked if the date for the holiday could be a week earlier to give people more time to shop for Christmas, and this time Roosevelt agreed to do it. This raised a hue and cry as many people felt that he was catering to large retailers so they could make more money.

Sixteen governors decided their states would have Thanksgiving on the last Thursday of the month as usual, and that's how some people ended up celebrating it a week earlier or later than others — for two years.

Roosevelt stuck with the second-to-last-Thursday schedule, some states stuck with the last-Thursday-of-the-month schedule and finally on Dec. 26, 1941, Congress passed a law making Thanksgiving the fourth Thursday of November.

Now you have a story to tell over Thanksgiving dinner. You're welcome."

Enlarge this image toggle caption 101cats/Getty Images 101cats/Getty Images

Cruelty to animals is now a federal crime under a new law signed by President Trump on Monday.

The Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act (PACT) is a bipartisan initiative that bans the intentional crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, impalement or other serious harm to ""living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians.""

The law also bans ""animal crush videos,"" meaning any photograph, motion picture film, video or digital recording or electronic image that depicts animal cruelty.

The penalty for violating the law can include a fine, a prison term of up to seven years or both.

The measure was introduced in the House by Ted Deutch, D-Fla., and Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., and pushed through the Senate by Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Patrick J. Toomey, R-Pa.

Animal welfare activists said a federal law was necessary even though every state already has laws criminalizing animal cruelty. They argued that the lack of federal legislation made it difficult to prosecute animal cruelty cases that span different states or jurisdictions.

""PACT makes a statement about American values. Animals are deserving of protection at the highest level,"" Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, said in a statement.

""I'm grateful to see the PACT Act finally signed into law. The barbaric torture of animals has no place in a civilized society and should be a crime — and thanks to this new law, now it is,"" Blumenthal said. ""Senator Toomey and I worked together for years to ensure that this kind of despicable torture of animals is forbidden for good.""

The new law was endorsed by some law enforcement groups, such as the National Sheriffs' Association and the Fraternal Order of Police, who say there is a link between extreme animal cruelty and violence against people."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Seth Wenig/AP Seth Wenig/AP

Updated at 7:41 p.m. ET

The shootings that left at least three civilians and one police officer dead Tuesday in Jersey City, N.J., was a targeted attack, according to local authorities. Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop explained Wednesday that the pair of shooters, who were also killed, had clearly singled out the kosher market on which they opened fire.

""At the time of the incident yesterday, it was difficult to understand intent, and there's still a lot of questions around that. But after reviewing the [closed-circuit TV] cameras on the Jersey City side, we do feel comfortable that it was a targeted attack on the Jewish kosher deli across the street here,"" Fulop told reporters during a morning snowstorm, gesturing at a storefront crowded with emergency personnel.

Six people died in Tuesday's attacks, including the suspects: David N. Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50.

New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal identified the shooters at a joint news conference with other law enforcement leaders Wednesday afternoon. He said Anderson and Graham killed Detective Joseph Seals, 39, during an encounter near Bayview Cemetery prior to the main shootout.

""Thereafter, at approximately 12:21 p.m., a white U-Haul van driven by Mr. Anderson parked directly across the street from the JC Kosher supermarket, which is approximately 1 mile from the cemetery,"" Grewal said.

""Within seconds of arriving, Mr. Anderson exited the driver's side door of the U-Haul with a rifle in his hand. He walked towards the JC Kosher supermarket and immediately began shooting. Ms. Graham, the passenger in the van, followed Mr. Anderson into the store.""

Four people were inside the supermarket at the time, according to the attorney general. One escaped with gunshot wounds. The three others died. Grewal identified them as: Mindel Ferencz, who is in her early 30s; Moshe Deutsch, 24; and Miguel Douglas, 49.

The ensuing standoff between suspects and police lasted about three hours, before a police armored vehicle broke into the storefront and officers discovered the shooters' bodies inside.

Afterwards, authorities say they recovered a pipe bomb and ""numerous firearms"" from the scene.

The vehicle used by Anderson and Graham ""was searched by our state police professionals forensically. They did locate in that, amongst other items that I won't be discussing, a pipe bomb — improvised explosive device,"" FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregory Ehrie told reporters.

""It was a viable device, meaning it could be a device that would have exploded. It was, again, a pipe bomb by design — not complicated, but sophisticated in the sense that time and effort went into creating it,"" Ehrie said.

In statement released Wednesday, Rabbi David Niederman mourned Ferencz and Deutsch as prominent members of the local Jewish community.

""Of course, we'll collect ourselves and go on with our lives. At the same time, we can't let the horrible hate go on and threaten us. It's too late already. The hate that springs up all over now cut short lives so close to home,"" said Niederman, the president of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg and North Brooklyn.

""But we have to act now so that we don't have to mourn precious lives in the future,"" he said.

At his news conference, Fulop said there likely would have been more victims if two police officers nearby had not responded quickly after hearing the gunshots while they were on patrol one block away.

""From what we can tell on the CCTV cameras, had they not responded — and had they not been there in that location — more than likely more people would have died,"" Fulop said. ""The reason that those perpetrators seemed to be inside of that deli, and not able to move potentially to the school or to inflict more harm, was because the police responded immediately and returned fire.""

Both officers sustained gunshot wounds in the exchange of fire, according to James Shea, the public safety director in Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan.

Jersey City Police Officers Benevolent Association set up an official GoFundMe fundraiser to support Seals' wife and five children.

Local officials on Wednesday called it a targeted attack on the kosher deli, but they did not describe shooting specifically as an anti-Semitic attack.

""I didn't use the words 'anti-Semitic.' The motives are still part of the investigation,"" Shea told a reporter. ""They exited the van, and they proceeded to attack this location in a targeted manner. Anything else is open for investigation.""

Still, Fulop later came out much more forcefully on the matter, saying in an afternoon news conference that ""there is no question that this is a hate crime"":

""When you look at the facts of what transpired yesterday, it's difficult to argue anything other than that. We know that they traveled over a mile of deliberately and slowly to this location. We know that they bypassed many targets on the way. We know that they bypassed targets immediately near the store. We know that they took out long rifles across the street after selecting this location and coming here. We know that they fired aggressively into that place. We know that they posted favorable sentiment on social media towards anti-Semitic groups.""

Bill de Blasio, mayor of neighboring New York City, demonstrated no reluctance assigning a motive. In a series of tweets overnight, the mayor said the shooting ""tragically confirms that a growing pattern of violent anti-Semitism has now turned into a crisis for our nation.""

Though there was ""no credible threat,"" he said he had directed the New York Police Department to ""assume a state of high alert"" and protect ""key locations in the Jewish community."" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also announced Wednesday that ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he was also directing state police to increase security around synagogues and other Jewish community buildings.

We shouldn’t parse words. To stop hate + anti-semitism we need to call it out QUICKLY for what it is. Some will say don’t call it anti-semitism or a hate crime till a longer review but being Jewish myself + the grandson of holocaust survivors I know enough to call it what this is — Steven Fulop (@StevenFulop) December 11, 2019

""We have to understand, as I've heard from so many members of Jewish community, that people are now living in constant fear,"" de Blasio said at a news conference Wednesday.

""Members of the Jewish community have told me they no longer feel comfortable wearing anything that is a symbol of their faith for fear of an attack. It is absolutely unacceptable in a free society that anyone should have to feel that way — from any faith, any background.""

The attack in Jersey City comes just over 13 months since a gunmen killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. The suspected attacker was charged last year in a 44-count indictment, which alleges that during the massacre, he ranted about his desire to ""kill Jews.""

Due largely to the attack, anti-Semitic homicides reached the highest level ever recorded in the FBI's annual statistics on hate crimes, released last month.

President Trump on Wednesday is expected to sign an executive order to make clear that anti-Semitic acts are also barred under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bans discrimination based on race, color or national origin in programs that receive federal funding.

This is a developing story. Some things reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from police officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images

A judge has handed Exxon Mobil a victory in only the second climate change lawsuit to reach trial in the United States. The decision was a blow for the New York Attorney General's Office, which brought the case.

Justice Barry Ostrager of the New York State Supreme Court said that the attorney general failed to prove that the oil giant broke the law.

""Nothing in this opinion is intended to absolve ExxonMobil from responsibility for contributing to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gasses in the production of its fossil fuel products,"" Ostranger wrote. But, he added, ""this is a securities fraud case, not a climate change case.""

In a three-week trial, New York state prosecutors argued that the oil company had downplayed the financial risks it faces from possible climate regulation. Attorney General Letitia James said doing so made Exxon's assets appear more secure than they really were, which in turn affected its share price and defrauded investors.

Ostrager concluded that James' office ""failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that ExxonMobil made any material misrepresentations that 'would have been viewed by a reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ""total mix"" of information made available.' ""

James released a statement following the verdict, saying that the case had compelled Exxon ""to answer publicly for their internal decisions that misled investors.""

""Throughout this case, we laid out how Exxon made materially false, misleading, and confusing representations to the American people about the company's response to climate change regulations,"" James said.

""Exxon's inability to tell the truth further underscores the lies that have been sold to the American public for decades,"" she said. ""Despite this decision, we will continue to fight to ensure companies are held responsible for actions that undermine and jeopardize the financial health and safety of Americans across our country, and we will continue to fight to end climate change.""

Exxon said the ruling ""affirms the position ExxonMobil has held throughout the New York Attorney General's baseless investigation. We provided our investors with accurate information on the risks of climate change. The court agreed that the Attorney General failed to make a case, even with the extremely low threshold of the Martin Act in its favor.""

""Lawsuits that waste millions of dollars of taxpayer money do nothing to advance meaningful actions that reduce the risks of climate change,"" the company said.

There were signs of weakness in the state's case. On the last day of the trial, the attorney general's office withdrew two counts of fraud from its lawsuit. Exxon asked the judge to rule on those counts anyway, saying the state had tarnished the company's reputation in making its case on them.

The state went forward with two counts based on the Martin Act, a New York statute that grants the state's attorney general the authority to pursue investigations and actions against those it suspects of securities fraud.

The Martin Act has a lower burden of proof: Prosecutors must show that a company made misrepresentations to investors and that there were consequences.

Ostrager minced no words in describing how he thought the trial had gone: ""The testimony of the expert witnesses called by the Office of the Attorney General was eviscerated on cross-examination and by ExxonMobil's expert witnesses.""

Ostrager said his ruling found Exxon not liable on any of the counts.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images

The highest-profile witness in the landmark case was former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Exxon's CEO from 2006 to 2017.

Exxon used two ways to estimate the impact of potential climate-change regulations on its future business. Tillerson testified that one assessment was used to estimate the effect of future climate change regulation — such as a carbon tax -- on the global energy system. But for specific projects, such as the Alberta oil sands in Canada, the company would use a different way of calculating a ""greenhouse gas cost.""

Tillerson insisted that this was appropriate and that Exxon had no incentive to underestimate carbon costs internally, since ""we'd be misinforming ourselves.""

Exxon battled for years to prevent this case and others from reaching trial, but there are now numerous pending lawsuits against Exxon and other oil companies, including a similar case that was recently brought in Massachusetts.

In Massachusetts, Attorney General Maura Healey accuses ExxonMobil of systematically misleading investors about climate change's impact on the economy and its own business, and of deceiving consumers about fossil fuel's environmental impact.

Elsewhere, many city and state governments are using ""public nuisance"" arguments to try to hold energy companies accountable for their role in climate change. The idea is to force them to help pay for the mounting impact of climate change that communities now struggle to address.

Fossil fuel companies often attempt to get the cases moved to federal courts, which they believe will be more sympathetic to their side."

President Trump has decided to stay out of the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the House of Representatives.

White House counsel Pat Cipollone rejected an offer from House Democrats that would have allowed the president to send counsel to represent him at future impeachment hearings.

In a short two-paragraph letter to Democrats, Cipollone said the impeachment inquiry is ""completely baseless and has violated basic principles of due process and fundamental fairness.""

""House Democrats have wasted enough of America's time with this charade,"" Cipollone said. ""You should end this inquiry now and not waste even more time with additional hearings.""

The decision is in line with the White House's general approach toward the House probe. Trump and his supporters have repeatedly called the investigation a sham and argued it was unfair to the president.

At the same time, the White House has ordered current and former officials to not testify and has refused to turn over documents.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that the House Democrats were moving ahead with drafting articles of impeachment.

Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released a 300-page report this week outlining evidence that they say shows that Trump abused his office and pressured Ukraine to open investigations that would boost him politically."

Updated at 4:15 p.m. ET

Former Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin departed the governor's mansion three days ago, but the reverberations of some of his final actions are still being felt across the state.

Bevin, a Republican who narrowly lost a bid for a second term last month, issued pardons to hundreds of people, including convicted rapists, murderers and drug offenders.

In one case, Bevin pardoned a man convicted of homicide. That man's family raised more than $20,000 at a political fundraiser to help Bevin pay off a debt owed from his 2015 gubernatorial campaign.

In all, the former governor signed off on 428 pardons and commutations since his loss to Democrat Andy Beshear, according to The Courier-Journal. The paper notes, ""The beneficiaries include one offender convicted of raping a child, another who hired a hit man to kill his business partner and a third who killed his parents.""

Bevin's controversial decisions have been greeted with shock and consternation from many across the state.

Some residents reacted angrily to a Thursday Twitter post from Bevin's official account of a sunset along with #WeAreKY.

""Winter sunset ... "" Bevin wrote, ""Phone camera doesn't do it justice...Truly spectacular. #WeAreKY""

Twitter user Josh Trosper blasted the governor in a tweet: ""I guess you can snap pics when you don't have the time to look families (or voters) in the face and tell them you pardoned murderers and rapists.""

Rob Sanders, the Kenton County commonwealth's attorney, told The Cincinnati Enquirer that he had backed Bevin but the pardons changed his mind.

""I was somebody who supported him and believed in him and I'm disgusted at myself for having done so,"" Sanders said to the Enquirer about Bevin.

One pardon that had Sanders — and many others — particularly outraged was that of Micah Schoettle. He's a 41-year-old convicted of raping a 9-year-old child last year. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison, according to the Courier-Journal.

In his pardon order, Bevin wrote, ""Micah Schoettle was tried and convicted of a heinous crime based only on testimony that was not supported by any physical evidence.""

He added: ""This case was investigated and prosecuted in a manner that was sloppy at best. I do not believe that the charges against Mr. Schoettle are true.""

Bevin commuted Schoettle's sentenced to time served and ordered a full and unconditional pardon.

Another of Bevin's pardons was of Patrick Brian Baker, who was convicted in 2017 of murdering Donald Mills and tampering with physical evidence, among other charges.

As the Courier-Journal also reports, Baker's family ""raised $21,500 at a political fundraiser last year to retire debt from Bevin's 2015 gubernatorial campaign."" Baker's brother and sister-in-law also donated $4,000 to Bevin campaign, according to a state election finance database, the paper reports.

""Patrick Baker is a man who has made a series of unwise decisions in his adult life,"" Bevin wrote in his pardon letter dated Dec. 6, adding that evidence in his conviction was ""sketchy at best.""

""I am not convinced that justice has been served in the death of Donald Mills, nor am I convinced that the evidence has proven the involvement of Patrick Baker as murderer,"" Bevin wrote.

Baker was sentenced to 19 years, but served just two. His sentence was commuted to time served and a pardon only for the charges connected to the conviction.

Not all of Bevin's pardons were so contentious.

He also pardoned Tamishia Wilson of Henderson, Ky., convicted in 2006 of trafficking marijuana and drug paraphernalia possession. She was also convicted in 2004 of theft.

Bevin proclaimed in a Dec. 9 letter that she ""is a new woman. She has turned her life around and become a model citizen.""

The former governor also spared the life of death row inmate Gregory Wilson, who was convicted in 1988 of murder. The Courier-Journal reports the trial was widely described as ""a travesty of justice and a national embarrassment for Kentucky.""

The paper said Wilson's defense team consisted of two lawyers, one of whom ""had never tried a felony before"" and a lead counsel who ""had no office, no law books and on his business card, he gave out the phone number to a local tavern.""

An array of other ethical woes plagued the case.

Bevin commuted his sentence to life in prison with the possibility of parole, writing that Wilson received ""the short end of the justice stick. ... Regardless of the final resolution of future parole board hearings, Mr. Wilson at least deserves an equal opportunity for justice to be served.""

Reached on Thursday for comment by The Washington Post, Bevin said of the pardons, ""I'm a believer in second chances.""

""If there has been a change and there's no further value that comes for the individual, for society, for the victims, for anybody, if a person continues to stay in,"" Bevin noted, ""then that's when somebody should be considered for a commutation or a pardon.""

During his tenure as governor, Bevin took a special interest in criminal justice reform and creating Kentucky's Criminal Justice Policy Assessment Council. At the council's first meeting in 2016, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported the panel's mission was to ""study the state's criminal code ... and suggest improvements for the 2017 General Assembly to consider.""

In 2017, Bevin, through an executive order, restored the voting rights of 284 people convicted of nonviolent felonies, according to member station WFPL in Louisville.

Earlier this year Bevin signed a bill that deepened the pool of people eligible to have their low-level criminal records expunged.

Beshear, the current Kentucky governor, spoke Friday with NPR and WBUR's Here & Now about his own move to restore voting rights to 140,000 nonviolent offenders who have completed prison sentences. He was asked about Bevin's slew of pardons and expressed displeasure over one case in particular.

While he didn't refer to the case by name, Beshear mentioned the pardon of Dayton Ross Jones, who pleaded guilty to the 2014 sexual assault of a 15-year-old boy. The act was captured on video and shared on social media, according to the Kentucky New Era, and Jones was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2016.

""A young man was attacked, was violated, it was filmed, it was sent out to different people at his school,"" Beshear said. ""It was one of the worst crimes that we have seen.""

Kentucky's attorney general's office, which Beshear previously headed, prosecuted the case.

""I fully disagree with that pardon,"" Beshear said. ""It is a shame and its wrong.""

Bevin gave no explanation of why he issued Jones a pardon and commuted his sentence to time served."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eric Gay/AP Eric Gay/AP

In at least one sense, the final presidential debate of the year looked a lot like the previous ones between Mitt Romney and President Obama.

Regardless of what they were asked, each offered talking points he had prepared and was determined to make. The candidates, not moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS News, set both the tone and the pace of the debate.

That included switching gears far from the nominal subject of Monday's debate in Boca Raton, Fla., which was foreign policy. The domestic economy received at least as much attention and verbiage as Iran, Libya or China.

Here are some of the moments and dynamics that struck us during the third and final presidential debate of 2012:

The Real Enemy Is My Opponent

This debate did not look like last week's town hall-style confrontation, when Obama and Romney circled each other like a couple of caged panthers. Monday's tabletop discussion did not allow for the same type of overt finger-pointing.

Still, both men were frequently on the attack. The president especially, perhaps still seeking to make up for his lackadaisical performance in his first debate with Romney, was consistently critical of his opponent.

Obama had some barbs ready. After Romney repeated his frequent complaint that the U.S. Navy now has its fewest ships since World War I, Obama got off a line that launched the trendiest meme of the night: ""Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed.""

At times, the president's tone seemed to verge on sarcasm. On a pair of occasions, Romney said, ""Attacking me is not an agenda,"" arguing any political points the president scored would do nothing to address challenges in the Middle East or increase trade.

Romney Didn't Define Many Policy Differences

Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, got off several tough lines against the president's record. He said that nowhere in the world has America's influence grown on Obama's watch.

""What we've seen over the last four years is something I don't want to see over the next four years,"" Romney said.

Still, Romney expressed agreement with Obama administration policies nearly as often as he disdained them. At one point he began an answer by saying, ""I want to underscore the same point the president made ..."" He passed on the chance to attack Obama once again, as he's done repeatedly over the past month, for the killings of four Americans at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

Romney instead congratulated the president for killing Osama bin Laden and sought to ""underscore"" his agreement with at least some current policies with regard to Afghanistan, Syria and Iran.

Rather than accepting compliments where he could get them, Obama essentially accused Romney of being a flip-flopper and having shifted his positions.

Romney Sought To Play The Statesman

Romney's strategy may not have been to stay sharply on the attack. In general, he sought to project an image of strong leadership without coming across as bellicose.

Obama may have alluded to the long wars started under President George W. Bush, but Romney sought to reassure Americans that he had little interest in fresh military engagements abroad.

""We don't want to get drawn into a military conflict,"" Romney said about Syria. And, speaking of the Middle East in general, he said, ""We can't kill our way out of this mess.""

Still, Romney's message was hardly that of a pacifist. He warned about ways in which U.S. stature could be diminished if defense spending is cut, or if the domestic economy is not healed.

Did Someone Say This Was A Foreign Policy Debate?

The U.S. economy seemed as much on the candidates' minds as any foreign challenge. After Schieffer asked them to define America's role in the world, they launched into a discussion about domestic issues that at one point led to a disagreement about whether Romney deserved credit for school funding levels in Massachusetts.

They also argued about the revival of the domestic auto industry and Medicaid.

Many of their lines during such seeming digressions had the ring of familiarity to those who had watched the first two debates.

Obama accused Romney of having invested personally in questionable Chinese companies, while Romney said Obama had made a mistake in seeking to pick winners by investing government dollars in individual companies, such as the failed solar company Solyndra.

What Undecided Voters?

Commentary on Twitter and television networks suggested that partisans in both camps believed their own champion got the better of most exchanges during the debate.

Perhaps that's because in a race that is essentially tied in national polls, neither candidate said much that sounded like even an attempt to move the few remaining undecided voters in swing states. (Conversely, anti-war Democrats may have been dismayed by Obama's boasting of rising military spending, while GOP defense hawks may have found Romney insufficiently tough.)

It's not clear which foreign policy issues would prove decisive at this point to the few remaining undecided voters. But each man tried to present himself as, overall, the more attractive choice.

Obama warned that Romney would lead the country back toward Bush-era policies that led to recession and long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

""Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s,"" Obama said early in the debate.

Toward its end, Romney said, ""I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years,"" blaming Obama for falling incomes and unemployment.

""It's just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours that these last four years have been so hard,"" Romney said.

In short, each candidates continued with his campaign's overall game plan of making his opponent seem unacceptable."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Listen to The NPR Politics Podcast here.

The impeachment of President Trump has dominated the news this week. But the political focus shifted to the Democratic presidential candidates Thursday night for their sixth debate, this one in Los Angeles and hosted by the PBS NewsHour and Politico.

The first subject to come up? Impeachment. But there are no real cleavages between the candidates on that subject. After all, each of the candidates thinks he shouldn't be in office. That's why they're running against him.

There was a notable moment when former Vice President Joe Biden defended his continued regard for bipartisanship despite him and his family coming under attack from Republicans in the Ukraine saga.

""If anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate, it's me,"" Biden said, adding, ""I have no love. But the fact is, we have to be able to get things done. And when we can't convince them, we go out and beat them like we did in the 2018 election in red states and in purple states.""

1. Biden was steady

Biden was crisper than in most of the other debates, and, unlike those other debates, his steadiness lasted mostly all the way through. He sidestepped a question, about whether he would run for a second term if elected, given his age — 77. And he was, at times, tougher with his opponents. For example, telling Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to put his hand down while Biden was finishing an answer.

Biden didn't dominate the debate, and, at times, he faded from view, but that's something of a win for him. The steadier he is, the fewer of Biden's supporters — and potential supporters — will be wringing their hands.

2. Buttigieg came under attack

It took awhile for it to happen, but, as expected, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg faced some pointed attacks. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts went after him on fundraising (yes, in a ""wine cave"") and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota on his experience.

""The mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900-a-bottle wine,"" Warren said. ""Think about who comes to that.""

""I have not denigrated your experience as a local official,"" Klobuchar said, pointedly contrasting Buttigieg's municipal job with hers in Congress.

Buttigieg parried the attacks with some skill, especially toward Warren on fundraising. ""I am literally the only person on this stage who is not a millionaire or a billionaire,"" he said, adding, ""This is the problem with issuing purity tests you cannot yourself pass.""

Buttigieg also hit back at Klobuchar, noting that he had won the 2015 South Bend mayor's race ""with 80% of the vote as a gay dude in Mike Pence's Indiana.""

But Klobuchar got the last word, noting he had lost the 2010 race for Indiana state treasurer ""by 20 points. I'm sorry. That's just the math."" (It was 25 points.)

Buttigieg has been surging in Iowa and New Hampshire, and both Warren and Klobuchar see him as an obstacle to their candidacies. He leads with college-educated whites, a group Warren is second with, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. And for Klobuchar to have a chance at the nomination, she has to do well in Iowa, as she's from a neighboring state.

Media no longer available

3. Money remains a key divide — and potential problem for Democrats

The exchange between Warren and Buttigieg on fundraising highlighted an important split in the Democratic Party — how to raise money.

But it also highlighted another reality — money is important in politics.

Polling shows Democratic primary voters want to get money out of politics, but running presidential campaigns costs billions of dollars. Literally, billions.

And here's the reality: President Trump doesn't care where the money comes from, and, so far, is raking in far more than any of the Democratic candidates.

""It's not an easy decision, especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections,"" Barack Obama said in 2008 of his decision to forgo public financing. ""But the public financing of presidential elections, as it exists today, is broken and we face opponents who've become masters of gaming this broken system.""

Democrats will have a lot of catching up to do on the fundraising front once a nominee is named. It's one reason incumbent presidents have such an advantage.

4. Some issues came up that hadn't and others got attention in different ways

Climate change was a focus earlier than in past debates.

And other topics, which have received little-to-no attention, also came up — everything from trade and China to Muslim Uighurs and Israel and the Palestinian territories.

It's a reminder that there are lots of things a president has to deal with — and often has more control over — than many of the topics that dominate presidential campaigns.

5. Health care didn't come up until late

One topic that came up later than usual (10:06 p.m. ET, more than two hours into the debate) was health care. The candidates have debated health care ad nauseam in prior debates, but Thursday night's had a new wrinkle – whether the candidates calling for big change would be in favor of less sweeping measures if Medicare for All failed to pass Congress as a replacement for private health insurance .

The question was directed to Sanders, and he wouldn't say. ""We're going to have the American people behind us; we will have the Congress behind us,"" Sanders insisted.

Biden said he didn't think that was ""realistic."" And that highlights the real fracture in the Democratic Party primary — the purists versus the pragmatists.

Klobuchar chimed in to defend both Biden and herself. ""I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time,"" she said, adding that Sanders' fight wasn't really with her or Biden, but with new House members from moderate districts and with Andy Beshear, the new Democratic governor of conservative Kentucky, who wants to build on Obamacare.

""If you want to cross a river over some troubled waters,"" Klobuchar said, ""you build a bridge, you don't blow one up.""

Notably, the other candidate in favor of Medicare for All stayed silent for most of the exchange. When Warren did speak up, she answered the moderator's original question and noted some less-sweeping health care measures she supports and believes could pass Congress.

Last month, Warren walked back her full-throated support of Medicare for All, endorsing an interim step – a Medicare for All ""option."" It's a critical change for Warren. It makes her look more practical, and the move represents a pivot and admission that her full and uncompromising support of Medicare for All was hurting her presidential bid. After all, Medicare for All as a full replacement of private health insurance is much less popular than if presented as an option.

6. Democrats had to deal with a less-diverse stage

With Sen. Kamala Harris of California dropping out of the race and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and former Obama housing secretary Julián Castro not qualifying for the debate, this was not only the smallest number of candidates on a Democratic stage this cycle, but it was also the least diverse.

""It's both an honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight,"" entrepreneur Andrew Yang said, adding that while he was called names for being Asian growing up, blacks and Latinos ""have something much more powerful working against them than words. They have numbers.""

Yang noted that African Americans and Latinos have only a fraction of whites' net worth. ""These are the numbers that define race in this country,"" he said. ""And the question is, 'Why am I the lone candidate of color on this stage?' Fewer than 5% of Americans donate to political campaigns. You know what you need to donate to political campaigns? Disposable income.""

The other candidates on stage tried to point out, in different ways, their own claims to diversity. Buttigieg noted that he is the son of an immigrant father and at least twice made reference to being gay.

Warren and Klobuchar highlighted, in sometimes humorous ways, that they were the only women on stage. Warren, 70, was asked about the fact that if elected, she would be the oldest person to take office as president (a distinction currently held by Trump; Biden and Sanders would be older still).

""I'd also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated,"" she quipped.

And Klobuchar said she once pointed out to Trevor Noah of The Daily Show, ""in the history of the Senate, there was something like 2,000 men and only 50 women in the whole history."" (The numbers are 1,926 and 56, according to Senate and House historians.)

Noah's response, Klobuchar said: "" 'If a nightclub had numbers that bad, they would shut it down.' """

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf visited a construction site in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas on a windswept day last month and repeated a Trump administration pledge.

""We are on track to build 450 to 500 miles of new wall by the end of 2020,"" he told reporters. Behind him, steel panels atop a concrete levee wall, 30 feet in all, are rising from the sugar cane fields and bird sanctuaries of the valley — which is really a river delta. They are the first section of new border wall built under President Trump where there was no barrier before.

But that swaggering Washington confidence is not shared down on the border. Asked about Trump's Election Day deadline, Carmen Qualia, an assistant chief with the Border Patrol, acknowledged it's slow going.

""[Trump] said, 'Hey, here's my deadline, here's what I need you to do.' So we're gonna continue to work towards meeting that deadline,"" said Qualia, who is in charge of the Rio Grande Valley wall team. ""And we're either going to make it or not.""

Trump gets an additional $1.4 billion toward his massive wall along the 2,000-mile southwest border under a government spending bill he is expected to sign. But in Texas, there's widespread skepticism the president will have anywhere near the 450 miles of wall he wants by next December. Construction has already fallen behind schedule because of how difficult it is to take private land.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Cedar Attanasio/AP Cedar Attanasio/AP

One contract reviewed by NPR, called RGV10, says construction isn't expected to begin on certain wall segments until March 2021 — well after the election.

""If you don't have 12 months to acquire property, you're cutting it way too short,"" said Hyla Head, a former real estate specialist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who spearheaded land acquisition for the first phase of wall-building under President George W. Bush in 2008.

Customs and Border Protection, which is part of Homeland Security, doesn't yet own most of the land where it plans to build the wall. In fact, Wolf's photo op was staged on a half-mile section of the levee that was only recently acquired by the federal government. Hidalgo County land records show that much of the property needed to complete that stretch of wall is still in private hands.

Disorderly property records, complications with landowners and a cumbersome condemnation process have slowed progress to a snail's pace. That's despite an army of federal land specialists trying to rush the process to please the president.

Consider this: The government plans to erect 110 miles of the total 450 miles of barriers in the Rio Grande Valley. But as of last week, the feds still needed to acquire about 90 miles from private landowners. In fact, since January 2017 the administration has only taken three miles from private owners in the Rio Grande Valley, according to a CBP spokesperson.

""It's a big project,"" Qualia said. ""We're gonna continue to do what we can to make it happen.""

But she says agents want the tall wall, along with floodlights, sensors, cameras and a 150-foot-wide enforcement zone to combat drug and human trafficking.

""We've been asking for these tools, this technology ... the roads,"" Qualia said. ""And if it takes longer, it takes longer.""

Most of the borderlands in Texas are privately owned, unlike states to the west where a strip along the border is mostly federal property.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Verónica G. Cárdenas for NPR Verónica G. Cárdenas for NPR

""Every project that has real estate acquisition is prevented from making faster progress,"" said a senior manager with detailed knowledge of wall building in the Rio Grande Valley who is not authorized to speak publicly.

Under eminent domain, the government can take private property for public use, but it has to pay for it. And that process is laborious and legalistic.

""Federal entities that acquire property have a process,"" said Head. ""You may not like it, but this is tried and true. We have laws to protect property owners.""

Roy Brandys, an eminent domain lawyer in Austin, Texas, has long experience representing border clients. Asked about completing the border wall in the valley by next December, he said, ""That would be a very aggressive schedule, very difficult to get accomplished just because of all the different issues that properties have.""

Each step of the process is proving problematic. First, the government has to identify and make contact with each property owner.

In Starr County, at the western end of the Rio Grande Valley, the government is planning 52 miles of border wall. Ultimately, the administration will need to acquire acreage on hundreds of individual parcels. So far, the wall contractor has broken ground only in one unit owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

""It's very difficult to know who the rightful owners are. That's the biggest challenge,"" said Rosalva Guerra, the chief appraiser of Starr County, where property records are notoriously incomplete.

Enlarge this image toggle caption John Burnett/NPR John Burnett/NPR

In her tidy office, she pulls up a map on her computer screen that shows all the properties in the county. The map is awash with red, the color used to denote parcels where the county is unsure of the owner.

In Starr County, property has been handed down through many generations, some of it going back to land grants made by the King of Spain. Tracts are divided and subdivided between heirs, but Guerra says they rarely establish clear title.

""So can you imagine the long list of heirs to partition that?"" Guerra said. ""It's a nightmare. Yeah, it's just going to take a long time to be able to do that. I don't think it's going to happen by 2020.""

Yet a senior CBP official in Washington was not so pessimistic about the construction timetable. ""If [landowners] don't voluntarily sell and we have to condemn the property,"" the official said, ""the judge can grant possession to the government nearly immediately after the declaration of taking and we can begin construction. ... We're getting a lot of offers to sell down there.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Verónica G. Cárdenas for NPR Verónica G. Cárdenas for NPR

Identifying the owner is only the first step. Then the government must request access to survey the land. So far, the Justice Department has had to sue nearly 50 property owners in the Rio Grande Valley just to get that access.

One of those defendants is Delfino Garza, an architect in Starr County. He didn't want government surveyors coming on his property outside Rio Grande City where he has a vineyard. As a sideline, he planted grapes a decade ago, clearing thick brush down by the Rio Grande for his vine rows.

""After about the third year, we started to make wine. And now in the last year they came to us about putting a border wall on our property,"" Garza said.

Garza is fighting the border wall. He voted for Trump, but he says he won't do so a second time. He fears the wall will kill his infant winemaking business.

""People don't go to wineries to see a border wall,"" he said. ""We want this to be an attraction for the city. And this is just hurting us.""

Qualia, the Border Patrol official in charge of the Rio Grande Valley wall team, says the government is trying not to be heavy-handed. Land acquistion specialists are spending time talking to landowners like Garza about the placement of the barrier on his vineyard property.

""I think it's important to note that we all live here, too,"" Qualia said. ""Our kids go to school. We go to church. So we really take that into consideration when we're sitting down and meeting with these owners.""

And, inevitably, those discussions with landowners will delay the project further. ""Things that are complicated typically do take time,"" Qualia added.

Meanwhile, Trump has appointed his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner to oversee and speed up completion of the border wall. The president has asked for frequent updates. He reportedly told aides earlier this year, just ""take the land.""

But in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, it's not that easy.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Wong Maye-E/AP Wong Maye-E/AP

North Korea doesn't really do Christmas cards, but if it did, its card would probably have a picture of the nation's leader, Kim Jong Un, riding a white horse through a snowy wilderness. In fact, North Korean state media released those exact images this month, and the message was clear: Kim, frustrated with how things were going, was pondering a new direction.

""The idea is that he was making this journey to commune with the universe in order to settle on his course,"" says Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, who tracks North Korea.

Kim is tired of two years of failed diplomacy with the U.S. and South Korea. North Korea wants sanctions relief. But the U.S. has refused to budge unless the North gives up its entire nuclear arsenal — something it's not willing to do.

For a while, both sides ignored the gap to get good press and photo-ops, but that time may have passed. ""They just aren't able to paper over those differences any longer,"" Lewis says.

Now North Korea's leadership is promising a ""Christmas gift"" for the Americans. Here are the options:

Space launch

Enlarge this image toggle caption AP AP

North Korea could launch a rocket with a satellite or other payload into space. Such a move would be seen as provocative by the U.S., but North Korea would be able to claim it was peaceful, according to Ankit Panda, author of the upcoming book Kim Jong Un and the Bomb. ""It does create an interesting space for negotiation,"" Panda says.

However, little activity has been seen at North Korea's main space-launch site, according to a recent analysis of commercial satellite imagery by the website 38 North. Moreover, North Korea has, so far, not issued the standard warnings to aircraft and ships that often accompany such a launch.

Underground nuclear test

Enlarge this image toggle caption AP AP

North Korea's previous nuclear tests have been felt across the world, sending a powerful reminder of the North's nuclear prowess.

Its last test, in 2017, was a thermonuclear whopper. But the following year, North Korea demolished tunnel entrances at its underground test site at Punggye-ri.

Panda says there's no sign of activity at that site, and North Korea is under pressure from neighboring China not to conduct further nuclear tests. ""That said, there is nothing stopping [Kim's government] from constituting another test site,"" he says.

Long-range missile test

Enlarge this image toggle caption AFP contributor/AFP via Getty Images AFP contributor/AFP via Getty Images

Option three would be a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile or similar long-range weapon that could reach the U.S. or its territories. North Korea launched several such missiles in 2017.

""The safe bet is an improved version of one of the missiles that we've already seen,"" Lewis says. ""But the thing that I worry about is a new, much-longer-range, solid-propellant missile.""

Long-range, solid-propellant missiles are an advanced technology that only a few countries possess. They can be launched in a matter of minutes, according to Panda. ""In a crisis, those missiles can be ready much faster than liquid-propellant missiles that have to be fueled,"" he says.

That makes them harder to take out in a preemptive strike.

Panda says there's reason to worry, especially when looking at other shorter-range tests recently conducted by the North. ""Every single missile they've tested in 2019 so far has been a solid-propellant missile,"" he says.

While the exact kind of missile matters to the experts, what matters to everyone else may be whether there's a long-range missile test at all. President Trump has framed the lack of long-range missile tests by North Korea as a huge diplomatic win for his administration. He has spoken of love letters from Kim.

Lewis says a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile would burst the bubble and cause both sides to ramp up the rhetoric. ""We're going to have this incredibly tense situation, and even if no one wants it to break out into a war, the chance that something might go wrong is very real,"" he says.

""We are not headed to a good place in 2020,"" agrees Panda. ""The North Koreans and the Trump administration are putting in place the building blocks of a new crisis."""

West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice announced Monday he has approved recommendations to fire all of the correctional officer cadets who participated in an apparent Nazi salute during a class photo.

""As I said from the beginning, I condemn the photo of Basic Training Class 18 in the strongest possible terms,"" Justice said in a statement.

""I also said that this act needed to result in real consequences — terminations and dismissals,"" he added. ""This kind of behavior will not be tolerated on my watch in any agency of State government.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety/Courtesy of Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety/Courtesy of Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety

Two academy trainers and a cadet were fired after the photo was first released by the state's Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety on Dec. 5. Thirty-four others were put on unpaid leave.

A third staff member who failed to report the contents of the photograph will also be fired, bringing the total number of staff terminations to three. Additionally, four academy instructors who are known to have seen the picture and failed to report it will also be suspended without pay.

In the image, nearly all members of the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation Basic Training Class #18 — 31 cadets — are giving what appears to be a Nazi salute. The others are posing with a clenched fist in the air.

The photo, which was included in graduation packets, carries the state seal and the official symbol of the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation. It is captioned ""Hail Byrd,"" a reference, officials say, to instructor Karrie Byrd, who was responsible for teaching cultural diversity, West Virginia Public Broadcasting reported.

National West Virginia Corrections Employees Fired, Suspended Over Nazi Salute Photo West Virginia Corrections Employees Fired, Suspended Over Nazi Salute Photo Listen · 2:48 2:48

According to the executive summary report drafted by Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation Commissioner Betsy Jividen, the hand gesture started in the second or third week of the academy session as a sign of respect for Byrd.

""The investigation disclosed that she encouraged it, reveled in it, and at times reciprocated the gesture,"" the documents state.

The picture was apparently taken at the request of Byrd. Multiple cadets allege it was taken several times because not everyone agreed to participate in the gesture. In the end, in an effort to comply with Byrd's order of the salute, seven people opted to hold up a closed fist.

Byrd told investigators she was unaware of the ""historical or racial implications of the gesture."" She insisted it was ""simply a greeting,"" according to the report. But her statement was contradicted by multiple sources, the report says.

When questioned about the photo by a secretary who expressed concern, Byrd allegedly explained the cadets did it ""because I'm a hard-a** like Hitler.""

She added that there was nothing wrong with the photo because ""we have people of all colors and backgrounds in the picture and every one of them are participating.""

The secretary and two other instructors separately approached Capt. Annette Daniels-Watts who, according to the investigation, said: ""Well, this is going to bite us in the a**.""

While Daniels-Watts admitted she found the picture ""horrible,"" the captain ""never addressed Byrd, had the pictures pulled from the packets, or reported the situation to her supervisor.""

With the exception of Byrd, the names of the cadets and other members of the department have not been released. As Dave Mistich of West Virginia Public Broadcasting reported, Military Affairs and Public Safety secretary Jeff Sandy said they were being withheld after threats to harm those involved began to surface.

The governor's decision comes just days after a man entered a rabbi's home in New York on Saturday and stabbed several people who had gathered there to celebrate the seventh night of Hanukkah.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the attack was part of anti-Semitic ""hatred exploding"" across the country.

Cuomo characterized the violent episode as ""an act of domestic terrorism.""

The final report on the West Virginia incident determined that while the gesture captured in the photo was ""highly offensive,"" it did not reveal any overt motivation or intent that this was a discriminatory act towards any racial, religious, or ethnic group.""

The participants were instead motivated by ""poor judgement, ignorance, peer pressure, and fear of reprisal.""

The graduating class of the academy would have gone on to work as correctional officers within the Bureau of Prisons and Jails, in work-release programs with the Bureau of Community Corrections and with young people within Bureau of Juvenile Services, Lawrence Messina, a spokesman for the Division of Correction and Rehabilitation told NPR.

""We have a lot of good people in our Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety. But this incident was completely unacceptable. Now, we must continue to move forward and work diligently to make sure nothing like this ever happens again.""​"

Enlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images

Hurricane Sandy's on-the-ground devastation has yet to be cataloged, and how the violent storm may affect the presidential campaign with just a week to Election Day is equally uncertain.

Will President Obama's response to the disaster help or hurt his re-election prospects? Or will the campaign's new trajectory — canceled appearances, postponed early voting — ultimately benefit Republican Mitt Romney?

Not really thinking much about that, are you?

That's why poll expert Cliff Zukin tells us that the presidential election survey world now needs to be divided: there's pre-Sandy and post-Sandy.

Any polls taken after the storm and while millions of Americans' lives remain disrupted, he says, carry with them a very real potential for accuracy problems.

""We're into a really cataclysmic event,"" says Zukin, former president of the American Association of Public Opinion Research. ""We don't know how many people are going to be affected and for how long.""

Post-Sandy surveys, says Zukin, a Rutgers University political science and public policy professor, ""are going to be really suspect.""

Those living in the dozen states that declared Sandy-related states of emergency will be occupied for many days — if not weeks — waiting for power to be restored, cleaning up, clearing out and dealing with insurance companies.

What's not likely to be a priority, Zukin says, is answering the phone to take questions about who they plan to vote for in the tight presidential race.

That means that surveyors will be hard-pressed to contact enough people by landline and cellphones to find a representative sample — meaning enough respondents to give pollsters the information they need to produce an accurate analysis.

And in fact, at least three national presidential tracking polls were temporarily suspended because of the storm: Gallup, Investors Business Daily/TIPP, and Public Policy Polling.

NPR contacted Zukin before Sandy hit, intending to talk with him in general about how voters should assess the blizzard of polls that have accompanied the final weeks of the presidential campaign.

While we ended up talking about the Sandy effect, Zukin also provided a few guidelines for those trying to make sense of the surveys. Here's what he advises, including his Sandy analysis.

1.) Don't compare anything pre-storm and post-storm. Anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of the country will be missing from polls for awhile as they try to get back to their regular lives. If the polls show what appears to be a pre- and post-Sandy change, it will be unclear if conditions have actually changed, or if what's changed is surveyors' ability to find people and have them respond in adequate numbers.

2.) Don't trust robocall polls that don't include cellphones. Federal law prohibits automated calling of cellphones, so pollsters who use landline robocalls should also be hand-calling cellphone users. Thirty percent of American adults use cellphones exclusively, and not sampling them will skew results in favor of people who are older, white and more conservative. For a sample of 1,000 people to be representative, about 300 of those contacted should be cellphone users.

3.) Don't compare polls done by different people or organizations. Every pollster uses different formulas to take survey results. Pollsters employ different methods of asking and ordering their questions, and use different tools (the U.S. Census, voter lists, for example) to ""weight"" their field results and come up with what they have determined is a representative sample. You're better off comparing over-time polls conducted by the same person or organization to detect legitimate trends.

4.) Look at the average of polls like the one maintained by Real Clear Politics. Its average of polls in both 2004 and 2008 were quite close to the final results.

But with Sandy wreaking havoc on land and in the polling world, the only remaining survey with any veracity may be the one on Nov. 6."

Two other U.S. officials told NPR that some are going to Kuwait temporarily.

The troop movement — signaled by heavy helicopter traffic out of a U.S. base in central Baghdad — was coupled with confusion about a letter sent by the U.S. military to Iraqi officials. That letter said the movements were in response to the Iraqi call for U.S. forces to leave the country, and the letter implied a withdrawal was underway. Late Monday, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that the letter was ""poorly worded.""

Esper also told reporters at the Pentagon that an Iraqi parliament vote on Sunday to expel U.S. troops was nonbinding and that there are no plans to leave Iraq yet.

The Pentagon press office underscored the message, saying in a tweet, ""There has been no change in US policy with regard to our force presence in Iraq. We continue to consult with the Iraqi government regarding the defeat-ISIS mission and efforts to support the Iraqi Security Forces.""

A U.S. military official in Iraq told NPR that the troops would be moved to ""other, safer countries"" while training missions were suspended. He added that most are coalition and NATO forces, not American.

A letter from Brig. Gen. William Seely to the director of the Iraqi joint operations task force informed the Iraqi government that the U.S. would be ""repositioning forces over the coming days and weeks to prepare for onward movement.""

The military official said the operation involved several hundred troops, mostly coalition and NATO forces being moved from the main military base in Baghdad's Green Zone. The base had been a frequent target of rocket attacks.

Top administration officials are scheduled to brief all House members on the unfolding events in Iran and Iraq on Wednesday, a Democratic aide told NPR.

Esper, Pompeo, CIA Director Gina Haspel, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley and Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will brief the House in a closed-door session.

Administration officials are scheduled brief senators on Wednesday.

Iraqi lawmakers passed a resolution on Sunday calling for all foreign troops to leave the country.

NPR's Tom Bowman reported that there are about 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, helping in the fight against ISIS there. But U.S. military officials said they would halt those efforts while bracing for retaliation from Iran.

The rising tensions stem from a U.S. drone strike that killed top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and several others last week — a move that Iran said was a violation of the country's sovereignty. Iran has vowed to avenge.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he hopes the Iraqi parliament will reconsider its decision.

Meanwhile, President Trump threatened Baghdad with sanctions if U.S. forces were required to leave the country.

This is a developing story. Some things reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from officials, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops."

It's not yet time to change the subject. That might pose a problem for Mitt Romney.

Media coverage of Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath has been intense in recent days, dominating regular news shows and prompting prime-time specials. With just a few days left before the election, the presidential contest has become an afterthought.

""It interrupted the news cycle at a time when there were favorable horse race stories for Mitt,"" says Tom Rath, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign. ""In a campaign, you don't get to design the racetrack; you play the cards you're dealt.""

Romney has been sensitive to the ravages caused by the superstorm, collecting donated food in Ohio on Tuesday, calling for donations to the American Red Cross and sending out messages of sympathy.

Still, he has not commanded the same amount of attention that President Obama naturally attracts, given his role heading up the federal government's response to the storm and cleanup efforts.

Obama was touring New Jersey Wednesday with Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who has praised Obama for his handling of the disaster. Romney was campaigning in Florida.

""The attention is all on the president,"" says William Schneider, a senior fellow at Third Way, a centrist think tank. ""It's going to be a little harder for [Romney] to argue that this is a failed presidency, because the president appears to have performed well in this crisis.""

Sandy may not pay any direct political dividends for Obama. People expect their leaders to step up at times of crisis. ""I don't see a rallying-around-the-president effect,"" says David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University.

The storm is also unlikely to reshape the electoral map, given that the worst of the destruction occurred in northeastern states that were considered certain to vote for Obama.

But the more days that pass without much media attention paid to the campaign, the harder it will be for Romney to erase Obama's thin polling leads in the battleground states that matter most.

For all the talk over the years about ""October surprises"" — late-breaking news stories that were thought to sway voters or divert attention from the presidential race — Yepsen says there's never been an event as dominant as Sandy in the closing weeks of any campaign.

""This is a seismic national tragedy,"" he says. ""I don't think there's anything that Romney or the president can do. This is a story in which the narrative has to play out for a few days.""

Speaking strictly in terms of media attention, though, all hot stories eventually cool off. With any major news event, there's a point at which most media outlets decide they've reached a saturation point and begin dialing back the coverage — at least outside the affected areas.

Certainly, the presidential election will take precedence in terms of media coverage at some point between now and next Tuesday.

It's hard to know exactly when that might happen, though. Schneider, who is also a public policy professor at George Mason University, suggests that Friday's jobs report might change the subject — particularly if unemployment numbers are looking worse than they were in September.

""Romney has to broaden the issue to the last four years, not the last few days,"" Schneider says.

Even if Romney isn't able to get much attention for final rallies and appeals — and Obama doesn't turn his attention to campaigning, either — it may not matter much, suggests David Carney, a Republican consultant.

Voters have already heard just about enough of this campaign. The vast majority of Americans seem to have made up their minds early in the process. And, especially with millions having voted early, it's not clear that a strong closing argument from a candidate or a bit more coverage from the media would change the eventual outcome.

""Traditionally, in the last week of the campaign, the messages have all been sent and it's really about turning out your voters,"" Carney says. ""If the 65 trillion TV ads haven't affected you yet, there isn't a week of TV or some new slogan that can move you one way or another.""

Rath, the Romney adviser, suggests that voters are sufficiently invested in the presidential race to want to make their choices known, regardless of the shape and coverage of any final campaign sprint, or lack thereof.

""Everybody is overwhelmed and moved by the pictures, which are compelling beyond measure, but at the end of the day, they'll think, 'We've got to vote,' "" Rath says. ""The American people are going to say, after putting up with this race for 18 months, 'It's time for me to make my decision.' """

Enlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images

Updated 9:15 p.m. ET

The House of Representatives approved a resolution that would force President Trump to seek consent from Congress before taking new military action against Iran.

The move comes nearly a week after President Trump greenlighted a U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general and led to increased tensions with Tehran.

The nonbinding war powers resolution was approved in a mostly party-line vote of 224-194. Only three Republicans and one independent joined Democrats to pass the measure. Eight Democrats opposed it.

The Senate could consider a similar measure — but one that has the force of law — as early as next week, but it is unclear if it has enough votes to clear the chamber. Trump administration officials maintain the president already has the authority to take action against Iran under a 2002 war authorization passed by Congress in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.

The House vote also comes after briefings for lawmakers on Wednesday from top Trump administration officials left Democrats — and some Republicans — unhappy with a lack of transparency about what fueled the decision to strike the Iranian general.

""You would think anytime we would engage in such an important change in approach that we would be working together, consulting together, respecting the approach that each sides takes to all of this and hopefully be on one side of it all,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said ahead of the resolution's passage. ""What this does is very important for the security of this country.""

The measure was sponsored by Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., a former CIA analyst who worked on Middle East policy.

In response to the vote, the White House said the president ""has the right and duty to protect this nation and our citizens from terrorism. That's what he continues to do, and the world is safer for it.""

""This House resolution tries to undermine the ability of the U.S. Armed Forces to prevent terrorist activity by Iran and its proxies, and attempts to hinder the President's authority to protect America and our interests in the region from the continued threats,"" White House Spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement Thursday evening. ""These Congressional actions are completely misguided. In fact, this ridiculous resolution is just another political move because, under well-established Supreme Court precedent, it's non-binding and lacks the force of law."" The White House reiterated its stance that the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani was authorized under ""his constitutional powers as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive as well as the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force.""

President Trump also addressed the vote at a campaign rally Thursday night in Toledo, Ohio, and mocked the idea of consulting Congress while carrying out an operation like the killing of Soleimani.

The war powers measure crafted by House Democrats was written as a concurrent resolution, which is traditionally considered nonbinding and doesn't require the president's signature.

Earlier Thursday, Pelosi said they purposely took this approach to ensure that the chamber could send a clear message to the president.

""We are taking this path because it does not require ... a signature of the president of the United States,"" she said. ""This is a statement of the Congress of the United States, and I will not have that statement be diminished by whether the president will veto it or not.""

The concerns touch on a years-long discussion over whether the president's war powers are woefully outdated. Under the Trump administration, Democrats and some Republicans have renewed calls for new legislation addressing the president's authorization for use of military force.

Congress has debated how to craft a new AUMF specifically focused on Iran, but it has failed to get consensus on language that would satisfy the broad ideological spectrum that wants the legislative branch to reassert its power to declare war.

On Thursday, administration officials issued a statement strongly opposing the House war powers measure.

""This concurrent resolution is misguided, and its adoption by Congress could undermine the ability of the United States to protect American citizens whom Iran continues to seek to harm,"" the statement from the Office of Management and Budget on the administration's policy said.

A series of Trump allies and House Republicans also expressed their opposition to the measure on the House floor on Thursday. They argued that Trump used the authority given to the president under an authorization of approved after the Sept. 11 attacks.

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise said that Trump was working well within his war authorities by striking out against Iran and that the move to kill Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani ended the life of an ""evil terrorist.""

""This place is a safer place with Soleimani gone,"" the Louisiana Republican said.

Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, also attacked the Democrats' efforts.

""Thankfully this is a resolution going nowhere,"" he said. ""This is not a resolution, this is a retreat, a de facto apology.""

However, some Senate Republicans have expressed interest in recent days to support a similar measure in their chamber.

Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who is sponsoring the war powers resolution, says he could bring up his measure for a vote as early as Tuesday. He said it would likely have to be coordinated with a potential trial if articles of impeachment are sent to the chamber beforehand.

Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, have already said they will support the measure. And Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Todd Young, R-Ind., have also been in talks with Kaine about the legislation and could line up support.

""We are at the brink of war right now. So I think the stakes are much higher now,"" Kaine said in arguing for the measure. ""I think it increases the necessity of the bill."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

The nation's unemployment rate edged up to 7.9 percent in October from 7.8 percent in September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says.

But private and public employers added 171,000 jobs to their payrolls — nearly 50,000 more than economists had expected.

So the news is somewhat mixed: While the jobless rate remained stuck near 8 percent, job growth was better than forecast.

We'll have more from the report and reactions to it as the morning continues. Hit your refresh button to be sure you're seeing our latest updates. Or, click these links for:

-- President Obama's reaction.

-- Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's reaction.

-- Why the jobless rate went up even as more jobs were added to payrolls.

Update at 11:35 a.m. ET. Romney Focuses On Obama's Record:

At 7.9 percent, the jobless rate is more than 2 points higher than President Obama said it would be by this time in his administration, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney just told supporters in Wisconsin. The difference equals 9 million fewer jobs than Obama had predicted, according to Romney. He has also echoed comments he made earlier about the economy not getting on track during Obama's time in office.

Update at 10:55 a.m. ET. Obama Hails Growth, But Says ""We've Got More Work To Do"":

At a campaign rally in Ohio, President Obama just pointed to some of the good news in the report, including the word that private employers added ""more workers in October [184,000] than at any time in the last eight months."" In February, private payrolls rose by 254,000 jobs.

""We've made real progress, but we are here today because we know we have more work to do,"" Obama added.

Earlier, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said that ""today's increase in the unemployment rate is a sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill.""

Update at 9:40 a.m. ET. Economy Is ""Continuing To Heal,"" White House Says:

""While more work remains to be done, today's employment report provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to heal from the wounds inflicted by the worst downturn since the Great Depression,"" Alan Krueger, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, says in a statement just released by the White House.

He also points to this:

""Over the last 12 months, the economy has added a total of 2.1 million jobs, as compared to 1.9 million over the preceding 12 months.""

Update at 9:30 a.m. ET. More On The Differences Between The Surveys:

As we said earlier, BLS really does two reports. One is based on a survey of employers (it concluded that 171,000 jobs were added to payrolls) and one is based on a survey of households (it concluded that the jobless rate rose to 7.9 percent). John Galvin, the acting commissioner at BLS, says in a statement that:

""The household survey and establishment survey employment measures often show different month-to-month changes. The establishment survey employment series has a smaller margin of error than the household survey because of its much larger sample size. An over-the-month employment change of about 100,000 is statistically significant in the establishment survey, while the threshold for a statistically significant change in the household survey is about 400,000. However, the household survey has a more expansive scope than the establishment survey because it includes the self-employed, agricultural workers, and other workers who are excluded by the establishment survey. Over longer periods of time, the employment measures from the two surveys tend to track more closely.""

Update at 9:15 a.m. ET. Romney Says Economy Is ""At A Virtual Standstill"":

""Today's increase in the unemployment rate is a sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill,"" Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney says in a statement just released by his campaign. ""The jobless rate is higher than it was when President Obama took office, and there are still 23 million Americans struggling for work.""

In the year before President Obama took office, the jobless rate rose from 5 percent in January 2008 to 7.8 percent in January 2009. The rate then continued upward, to a recent peak of 10 percent in October 2009. It didn't drop back below 8 percent until this September.

Planet Money has charted the 22 million Americans who are ""unemployed or can't find full-time work.""

Update at 9:10 a.m. ET. Another Way Of Looking At Why The Jobless Rate Went Up:

-- 578,000 people reported they had joined the labor force, either by finding work or just by looking for a job.

-- 410,000 people said they had found employment.

-- So, the ranks of the unemployed grew by about 170,000.

Reminder: BLS is really reporting on two surveys: One of households and one of employers. Two surveys mean two sets of results that sometimes seem to say different things. In this case, though, both surveys are showing job growth in October.

Update at 9 a.m. ET. Households Report Even Stronger Job Growth:

Though public and private employers said they added 171,000 jobs to their payrolls, the BLS says its survey of households indicates that 410,000 more Americans report they were working in October. That follows an increase of 873,000 in that figure from August to September.

As we explained last month, the agency's two surveys — one of employers and the other of households — can produce different results.

Update at 8:55 a.m. ET. First Republican Reaction:

""Four years of persistently high unemployment and long-term joblessness might be the best President Obama can do – but it's nowhere near what the American people can do if we get Washington out of their way,"" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) says in a statement just released by his office.

Update at 8:45 a.m. ET. Why Did The Jobless Rate Go Up?

When job growth is stronger than forecast but the unemployment rate still rises, economists look at whether more people joined the labor force — hopefully because many of them are optimistic about being able to find work.

According to BLS, ""the civilian labor force rose by 578,000 to 155.6 million in October, and the labor force participation rate edged up to 63.8 percent [from 63.6 percent]."" Meanwhile, ""there were 813,000 discouraged workers in October, a decline of 154,000 from a year earlier."" Discouraged workers are those folks who aren't looking for work ""because they believe no jobs are available for them.""

Those figures may signal that the jobless rate stayed near 8 percent in part because of good news — that more Americans are feeling better about the economy and have decided to start looking for work. That increased the size of the labor force, though, and helped lift the jobless rate a tenth of a point.

Update at 8:40 a.m. ET. September Job Growth Revised Up:

There were 148,000 jobs added to payrolls in September, BLS now says. That's up from the agency's initial estimate of 114,000.

Our original post (from 7 a.m. ET). ""Jobless Rate Likely Edged Up In October, Job Growth Was Likely Modest"":

The last major economic report before Election Day is due at 8:30 a.m. ET and economists say we should expect to hear that the unemployment rate ticked up to 7.9 percent in October from September's estimated 7.8 percent and that payrolls grew by just 125,000 jobs.

Whatever the Bureau of Labor Statistics says, the news is sure to be a hot topic on the campaign trail and among political pundits. As you've surely heard many times:

-- Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney says President Obama's economic policies haven't done enough to spur job growth and bring down unemployment.

-- The president has been touting the slow job growth and gradual decline in unemployment since the jobless rate's recent peak of 10 percent in October 2009. He says they're signs the economy is on the right track.

They're likely to hit those themes again today.

Meanwhile, some skeptics — such as former General Electric CEO Jack Welch — will be watching closely to see if the BLS report fits with their view of how the economy is doing.

We'll update this post with the news after the report is released, and follow with highlights and reactions. Also check Planet Money for economic analysis and It's All Politics for more on how the report might affect the campaign."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images

Updated at 6:20 p.m. ET

A federal watchdog concluded that President Trump broke the law when he froze assistance funds for Ukraine last year, according to a report unveiled on Thursday.

The White House has said that it believed Trump was acting within his legal authority.

Trump's decision to freeze military aid appropriated by Congress is at the heart of impeachment proceedings against the president that are shifting venues this week from the Democrat-controlled House to the majority-Republican Senate.

Democratic lawmakers have accused Trump of abusing his office by withholding hundreds of millions in assistance in order to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

The Office of Management and Budget blocked the Defense Department from spending money designated by Congress on July 25, ""pending a policy decision,"" according to OMB General Counsel Mark Paoletta. That hold was lifted on Sept. 12.

But a 1974 law that governs budget procedure within the government ""does not permit OMB to withhold funds for policy reasons,"" said Thomas Armstrong, general counsel for the watchdog Government Accountability Office.

The full report is available here.

President proposes, Congress disposes

Documents and testimony released during and after House impeachment hearings revealed some administration officials had raised concerns that the Ukraine hold might have violated the law known as the Impoundment Control Act.

The law further designates the ways in which Congress has the power of the purse. Under the Impoundment Control Act, it is illegal for OMB to withhold money that has been appropriated by Congress and signed into law.

If the White House wants to delay or deny funds, it must first alert Congress.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, asked the GAO to assess Trump's decisions to freeze the Ukraine aid.

Van Hollen said he thought the report vindicated Congress' decision to impeach Trump.

""We now have a GAO decision stating conclusively that the Trump administration violated the law. We know the president ordered that violation of law. And it's just all the more important that Republican senators support a fair trial,"" Van Hollen told NPR. ""That means getting to the truth. And that means getting all the documents that are relevant to this case and all the relevant witnesses.""

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., opposes the introduction of fresh witnesses or evidence into a Senate trial, arguing the Senate's role is to assess the House's fact-finding, not to do new investigations on its own.

Senators are expected to vote on that question. It isn't clear whether there might be sufficient support from enough Republicans to bring in new evidence or witnesses.

After release of the GAO report, the OMB said it disagrees with the findings.

""OMB uses its apportionment authority to ensure taxpayer dollars are properly spent consistent with the president's priorities and with the law,"" said OMB spokeswoman Rachel Semmel.

In a letter to GAO in December, OMB lawyer Paoletta argued that the holdup of the Ukraine aid was a simply a ""programmatic delay"" and therefore did not require prior notice to Congress.

Paoletta also argued that the Defense Department's general counsel never told his office that it would have any problems spending the money before the funds expired at the end of the fiscal year in September.

However, national security online forum Just Security reported in early January that Defense Department emails showed repeated warnings from the department to OMB that the delays put its ability to distribute the aid at risk."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Updated at 3:45 p.m. ET

Ukraine's national police are investigating whether U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was under surveillance in Kyiv last spring — something implied in a series of WhatsApp messages between a little-known Republican political candidate and an associate of Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer.

""Ukraine cannot ignore such illegal activities on the territory of its own state,"" the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine said in a statement Thursday. The ministry says it's asking the FBI to assist in its inquiry.

The texts made public between Lev Parnas and Robert F. Hyde, a Trump supporter and retired Marine who is running for Congress in Connecticut, suggested Yovanovitch was being monitored both electronically and in person, in an apparent breach of diplomatic security.

""They are moving her tomorrow,"" Hyde wrote in one message. He added, ""The guys over they asked me what I would like to do and what is in it for them.""

Ukrainian authorities say the implication that an ambassador was ""under illegal surveillance and her electronic gadgets were interfered [with] by the private persons at the request of the US citizens"" suggests a possible violation of its own laws as well as the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which protects diplomats on foreign soil.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Screenshot by NPR Screenshot by NPR

The texts were part of a cache of documents released Tuesday night by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who said the messages were collected from Parnas' phone as Democrats compiled evidence to support Trump's impeachment on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

In one message, Hyde told Parnas that Yovanovitch had turned off her phone and computer and that his associates in Ukraine would send updates on the ambassador's movements. He added, ""They are willing to help if we/you would like a price ... Guess you can do anything in the Ukraine with money ... what I was told.""

Hyde did not provide details about where he was getting his information about Yovanovitch, other than citing ""my guy."" After the conversation became public, Hyde insisted he had been toying with Parnas, saying his comments were taken out of context.

Referring to House Democrats, Hyde wrote on social media: ""For them to take some texts my buddy's and I wrote back to some dweeb we were playing with that we met a few times while we had a few drinks is definitely laughable.""

Parnas has been indicted in New York for alleged campaign finance violations and has pleaded not guilty. He is a close associate of Giuliani, who sought a meeting with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last year, and who has said he was working on Trump's behalf in Ukraine.

On Wednesday night, Parnas sought to portray his exchanges with Hyde in a similar light. In an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, Parnas said he never took Hyde's texts seriously.

Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry says the national police ""has initiated criminal proceedings"" to investigate two potential crimes: violating the secrecy of telephone conversations and other communications, and the unlawful collection of confidential personal information, in a breach of privacy.

Ukraine says its minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov, has asked the FBI to take part in the investigation — and to share ""all the information and materials"" it has about people who may have broken the law. But Ukraine also noted that it's possible no illegal surveillance ever took place.

""Our goal is to investigate whether there actually was a violation of Ukrainian and International law, which could be the subject for proper reaction,"" the ministry noted. ""Or whether it is just a bravado and a fake information in the informal conversation between two US citizens.""

The investigation adds yet another wrinkle to a U.S.-Ukraine relationship that's become increasingly complicated since last summer, when Trump asked the Ukrainian president to help investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Trump and his supporters also repeatedly vilified Yovanovitch, who was abruptly recalled from her post roughly two months after Hyde discussed her movements with Parnas.

""Ukraine's position is not to interfere in the domestic affairs of the United States of America,"" the ministry said Thursday. It concluded its statement by saying, ""Ukraine expects the United States of America to respond promptly and looks forward to cooperation.""

In another development involving Ukraine, the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, said Thursday that the Trump administration broke the law when it withheld roughly $214 million in U.S. security assistance funds from Ukraine last summer.

""Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,"" the GAO said.

As NPR's Ayesha Rascoe reports, ""The White House has said previously that it believed Trump was acting within his legal authority.""

In his interview with MSNBC's Maddow, Parnas said he believes that withholding U.S. aid from Ukraine was Trump's idea. He also alleged that several high-profile figures in the Trump administration, including Vice President Pence, knew the president had made it a top priority for Zelenskiy to announce an investigation into the Bidens. When Pence visited Ukraine's president last September, Parnas said, Pence's mission was ""to get it straightened out, that Zelenskiy was supposed to make another announcement.""

When NPR's Tamara Keith asked the vice president's office for a response to Parnas' claim about his role, Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff, sent a statement saying, ""This is very simple: Lev Parnas is under a multi-count indictment and will say anything to anybody who will listen in hopes of staying out of prison. It's no surprise that only the liberal media is listening to him.""

President Trump had a similar response later Thursday, telling reporters that Parnas was ""trying to probably make a deal for himself.""

Trump also reiterated his previous statements that he doesn't recall having conversations with Parnas — who told Maddow that he has spoken to Trump and been around him on numerous occasions.

""I know nothing about him,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. He later added, ""I take thousands and thousands of pictures with people, all the time.""

Updated at 5:49 p.m. ET

President Trump has pardoned his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who spent years enmeshed in an often bizarre legal war with the government that sprang from the Russia investigation.

Trump announced the news Wednesday on Twitter as Americans prepared to observe the Thanksgiving holiday this week.

The pardon brings an end to a long-running legal odyssey for Flynn, who was the only member of the Trump administration to be charged as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador and then cooperated extensively with prosecutors. But he ultimately reversed course and accused the government of trying to frame him.

Flynn went so far as to withdraw his first plea of guilty and substitute a second plea of not guilty, even though he'd acknowledged the underlying conduct that was against the law and been close to receiving a sentence.

The pardon drew condemnations from critics who've said Trump's actions to help his friends interfere with the justice system. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for example, who helped prosecute Trump at his impeachment, called the president's actions obviously corrupt.

Flynn, about an hour and a half ahead of Trump's announcement, tweeted a Bible verse alluding to a holy rescue.

Trump's action on Wednesday may open the door to possible clemency for other former advisers who were indicted as part of the Russia investigation, including Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman.

Justice Department not consulted

The Justice Department was not consulted about the Flynn pardon in the way it often takes part in the preparation of presidential pardons, a department official said on Wednesday. The official described the situation on the condition that the person not be identified.

The Justice Department did get a ""heads-up"" on Wednesday, the official said, and the person said that ""this is obviously an appropriate use of the president's pardon power.""

Justice Department leaders would have preferred, however, for Flynn's case to have been resolved in court, where federal Judge Emmet Sullivan still had not ruled on the government's request to abandon its prosecution.

Justice Department leaders were ""confident in the likelihood of our success in the case,"" the official said Wednesday.

Longtime military spy boss

Flynn is a retired Army lieutenant general who once led the Defense Intelligence Agency.

He became a security and geopolitical consultant in private life and took tens of thousands of dollars in payments from Russian entities. In 2015, Russia's state-backed TV network RT paid him $45,000 to attend a dinner in Moscow, where he sat at the right arm of President Vladimir Putin.

Back in the United States, Flynn became a vocal supporter of Trump's outsider campaign in the 2016 presidential race. At the Republican National Convention that year, Flynn led the crowd in chants of ""lock her up"" about Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton.

When Trump took office in January 2017, Flynn was rewarded for his loyalty with the job of national security adviser, a post that put him in the White House at the president's side.

But questions already were swirling about Flynn's Russian contacts, including with Russia's then-ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. Flynn was forced to resign after less than a month on the job for allegedly misleading the vice president about his conversations with the Russian envoy.

Flynn was interviewed by the FBI in January 2017, just days after assuming his White House post.

Intelligence and law enforcement officials worried that the Russians' knowledge about the true facts of Flynn's discussion with Kislyak could open Flynn up to the prospect of coercion, given the contrast with his public statements at the time.

Flynn lied to the agents about his conversations with Kislyak, saying he didn't urge Moscow not to respond to sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Russia in retaliation for the Kremlin's election interference.

Legal odyssey

Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to making false statements to the FBI. He went on to cooperate extensively with Mueller's team, providing ""substantial assistance"" to the special counsel's investigation, according to court papers.

Before the Mueller investigation wrapped up, Flynn appeared in court in December 2018 for his sentencing. The Justice Department had said it would not object to Flynn receiving no prison time.

Flynn's defense team, however, tried to downplay his crimes despite his admissions and his guilty plea. That prompted sharp criticism from the presiding judge, Sullivan, who said it raised questions about whether Flynn truly accepted responsibility for his actions.

Sullivan postponed sentencing to allow Flynn to complete his cooperation, including testifying against his former business partner who was facing charges tied to foreign lobbying.

In the summer of 2019, Flynn dumped his legal team and brought on a new set of lawyers led by Sidney Powell, a Texas attorney and frequent critic on Fox News of the Mueller investigation.

After the shake-up, Flynn took a combative approach with the government. In one court filing after another, Flynn's counsel asserted his innocence and accused the government of misconduct, withholding exculpatory evidence and other wrongdoing.

Sullivan considered Flynn's claims and then, in a 92-page ruling, rejected them all.

Then, in January, Flynn filed to withdraw his guilty plea because of what he called ""the government's bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement.""

Prosecutors, meanwhile, repeatedly pointed out in their filings that Flynn twice pleaded guilty before the court to his offense. They also rejected his allegations of violating his plea agreement or misconduct.

But Flynn's allegations of government misconduct found a sympathetic audience in Trump, who along with his conservative allies declared Flynn a victim of an FBI gone rogue.

Those allegations dovetailed, of course, with the president's own claims that the Russia probe was a ""witch hunt"" and a ""hoax"" designed to delegitimize his presidency.

Ultimately, Attorney General William Barr ordered a review of Flynn's case, and the Justice Department moved in May to drop its prosecution of Flynn.

The White House alluded to its and Flynn's latter day framing of his case in a statement on Wednesday filled with overtones about the ostensible conspiracy within officialdom that Trump and allies argue was responsible for the Russia investigation.

The statement also included another personal message to Flynn and his family, wishing them a happy Thanksgiving.

Sullivan had declined to grant the Justice Department's request immediately to drop the case. Instead, the judge set up a process to examine the department's stated reasons.

Flynn's attorneys challenged Sullivan's actions to try to force him to dismiss the case.

Ironically, that effort may ultimately have drawn out the process so long that the only way to ensure Flynn was out of legal peril before Joe Biden's inauguration was to prompt Trump to pardon him.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

If confirmed, Alejandro Mayorkas would be the first Latino and the first immigrant to become secretary of Homeland Security. The Biden transition team announced his nomination today. He'd be taking on a big job, leading a sprawling department that's charged with protecting the president, airport screening and cybersecurity. But the biggest change is likely to be how the department handles immigration and border security. NPR's Joel Rose covers immigration. He joins us now.

Joel, what else can you tell us about his background?

JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Well, he's a veteran of the Obama administration, a former deputy secretary at DHS, also a former federal prosecutor in California, where he grew up. As you said, he is an immigrant - born in Cuba. His parents fled the communist regime to the U.S. when he was very young. Here is Mayorkas a few years ago talking about how that shaped his life.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: I'm a political refugee, and my identity as a political refugee was extraordinarily important to my upbringing. And my parents were very focused on instilling in me a deep sense of what it means and what it meant to be an individual displaced from one's home.

ROSE: So this nomination already marks a symbolic shift away from the Trump administration, which drastically cut the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. and regularly portrayed refugees and asylum-seekers as a burden and threat.

CORNISH: Does this reflect in any way the Biden administration's priorities for DHS?

ROSE: Well, Mayorkas will be the one tasked with undoing many of President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration policies, as Biden has promised to do. I talked to Shev Dalal-Dheini about him. She worked with Mayorkas at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and is now with the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

SHEV DALAL-DHEINI: It sends a signal that the Biden administration is serious about reforming all the wrongs that have happened to our immigration system in the past four years because by selecting someone who has deep immigration expertise as secretary, it signals that this will be a big priority.

ROSE: Immigrant advocates seem very happy with this choice. Mayorkas also served as director of the agency in charge of legal immigration, and he was one of the original architects of DACA, the program that shields immigrants brought to the country illegally as children from deportation. And they think his experience will help him deliver on Biden's promises to quickly reinstate DACA in full, for example, also to get rid of the Trump administration's travel ban.

CORNISH: Can you talk about some of the challenges that he's likely to face?

ROSE: Well, one big problem is morale. On the one hand, the agency that handles visas and legal immigration has been plagued by financial problems. He'll have to address that. On the other hand, people at enforcement agencies inside DHS, like the Border Patrol, welcomed many of the Trump administration's policies, including the border wall. And they will not be happy to see those policies go away. And some of President Trump's policies will not be so easy to undo, particularly at the southern border. Biden has pledged to restore protections for asylum-seekers, but the trick will be to do that in a way that does not also invite a new surge of migrants seeking entry at the border. And that's going to be a difficult balancing act.

CORNISH: Finally, his chances at confirmation.

ROSE: Well, a lot will depend, probably, on who controls the Senate. I should note that Mayorkas did win Senate confirmation for his previous post at DHS, although that was not without some controversy. At the time, he was criticized by the department's inspector general, who accused Mayorkas of creating an appearance of favoritism in how visas were awarded to some wealthy investors who had ties to powerful Democrats. Mayorkas denies any wrongdoing, but those old allegations are getting a lot of attention today from immigration hard-liners. And we will see whether this turns into a big deal at his confirmation hearing this time around.

CORNISH: NPR's Joel Rose.

Enlarge this image toggle caption House Television via AP House Television via AP

The House of Representatives approved decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level on Friday in the first time Congress has acted on the issue.

The vote was largely along party lines – 228-164. Five Republicans and the lone independent member joined Democrats to pass the bill, and six Democrats voted no.

Branded as the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, or MORE Act, the bill removes cannabis from the list of federally controlled substances and facilitates canceling low-level federal convictions and arrests related to marijuana.

The legislation is not expected to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate.

The bill is a way for Democrats to send a message about their outlook on drugs in a nation where more cities and states already have become more accepting. It creates an excise tax on cannabis sales and directs the money to be targeted to communities adversely affected by the so-called war on drugs.

The bill specifically adds incentives for minority-owned businesses to help them enter the cannabis market, which has exploded in recent years given the relaxation in controls in some places within the United States.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who sponsored the bill, said he thought Washington shouldn't stay so far behind parts of the nation.

""Federal action on this issue would follow the growing recognition in the states that the status quo is unacceptable. Despite the federal government's continuing criminalization of marijuana, 36 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical cannabis. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use.""

Many other House Democrats who have advocated for federal action also said it was long overdue. They maintain the federal prohibition on research on marijuana and current sentencing laws related to many marijuana possession arrests have unintended consequences — largely felt in poor and minority communities.

Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., donning a mask with the ""good trouble"" motto of the late Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights icon, framed the bill as ""an important racial justice measure.""

Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., tweeted that ""people of color are 4X more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession than White people despite equal usage. They're also more likely to receive longer & harsher sentences.""

GOP opposition

Republicans strongly denounced the measure, saying criminals should not be released early.

Some opponents also said federal decriminalization would contribute to more death and injury from impaired drivers using marijuana. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, noted that the American Medical Association has released a letter opposing the legislation.

And Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., who noted he worked as a prosecutor focused on alcohol and drug-related cases, said he thought what the nation needs is to ""have a serious discussion on this — and not a mishmash of ideas and hopes instead of data-driven science.""

Democrats argue that many citizens already have accepted new policies involving pot and that work in Congress only would catch up with what's now normal for millions of people.

""More than half of all Americans live in states where cannabis is legal,"" said Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif. He also pushed for an amendment to legalize cannabis for medical treatment of veterans and noted the importance of more research on the issue.

""Lives can be ruined by selective enforcement of these laws,"" said Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., a longtime advocate of decriminalization. He also noted that former House Speaker John Boehner, a lifelong Republican from a conservative area outside Cincinnati, is now a spokesman for the marijuana industry.

Priorities on the Hill

But the broader argument many Republicans made was that Democrats are wasting time debating an issue that is not likely to become law instead of enacting coronavirus relief legislation.

""Come on man — families are losing their livelihoods, people are hurting,"" said Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn. The majority is focused on the wrong agenda, he said, either because it involves measures such as the pot bill that Democrats know won't become law or what Stauber called silly distractions.

Referring to a vote a day earlier banning private ownership of large cats, Stauber said: ""Our priorities should not be legalizing drugs or banning tigers.""

Democrats reject the charge they're not serious.

Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has been working on getting coronavirus relief bill for months and talks were showing new movement. She also said the marijuana bill would save lives.

""The imbalance against people of color has been a tragedy,"" Jackson Lee said.

With time running out on the current session of Congress and the GOP-controlled Senate not planning to take up the bill, Friday's vote was mostly symbolic. Democratic leaders had initially scheduled a vote on the bill before the election. But in the weeks leading up to the election and little movement on a coronavirus bill, they postponed the vote to avoid political attacks on members in competitive districts.

Jordan noted that voting on the issue now was also out of step with public opinion.

""Maybe that's why they lost 27 out of 27 toss-up seats,"" he said about the Democrats. Jordan grouped the marijuana bill with what he called Democratic leaders' focus on ""defunding the police"" — an attack line that many moderates say cost them their races this year.

Most Democrats said explicitly they did not want to strip away money for law enforcement and the police reform bill they passed in the summer did not include any language that would do so. But according to some commentators and members of Congress, the bumper sticker ""defund the police"" was enough to convince some voters that Democrats were radicals.

Views about that differ within the party — the most liberal members reject this thesis — and it isn't clear yet whether voters might punish members of Congress in a future election for the marijuana vote in the same way they were perceived as doing around ""defund the police.""

Although the marijuana bill is expected to die this year in the Senate, Democrats could vote on a similar bill in the next session of Congress.

President-elect Joe Biden does support decriminalization. But control of the Senate is still unclear, depending on two runoff races that will determine the majority in January."

Updated on 2/14/2013 @ 5:20 pm

Thursday brought the latest twist in the saga of Chuck Hagel's nomination to be President Obama's second-term defense secretary.

Hagel's nomination came two Senate votes short of the required 60 that would have allowed it to proceed to a final vote. The vote, largely along party lines, was 58 to 40 with one senator voting present.

Four Republicans voted with Democrats to end debate and proceed to a final vote. They were Mike Johanns of Nebraska, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

""Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, it gets worse"" said Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., the majority leader. Reid said he planned to schedule another procedural vote for the week after next to try to advance Hagel's nomination to a final vote.

Reid and other Democrats insisted that the Republicans had filibustered the Hagel nomination, the first time a defense secretary has had his nominations stalled in such a way.

Republicans insisted they hadn't filibustered the nomination. ""This is not an attempt to kill this nomination,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the Senate minority whip. ""It's not a filibuster."" Cornyn said some Republicans were merely seeking more time to have additional questions answered.

Although Hagel had drawn immediate early opposition, it had looked for many weeks that while many Republicans would vote against Hagel's confirmation, no one would actively try to block it.

Among the Republican senators reportedly open to at least allowing Hagel's nomination to receive an up-or-down final vote — so long as it comes after the recess — are Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. In a final post-filibuster floor vote, Hagel would need only 51 votes to be confirmed.

Senate Republicans have argued that before a floor vote on his nomination happens, Hagel needs to answer more questions about speeches he has given since leaving the Senate in 2009, including to an Arab-American group. They've also raised questions about his financial dealings, queries which Senate Democrats say are unjustified.

Meanwhile, Senate Republicans have expanded the questions they want answered before they allow a vote on Hagel. Some questions for the administration center on an issue unrelated to Hagel: the Sept. 11, 2012, Benghazi attack on the U.S. Consulate and its aftermath. The attack led to the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

-- original post below --

For President Obama's choice to become defense secretary, first came the flaying, then the filibustering.

It wasn't that much of a surprise that Senate Republicans on Wednesday refused to end debate on Chuck Hagel's nomination, forcing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to try to find 60 votes to move the nomination forward to a final vote.

Some Senate Republicans, after all, have been telegraphing that a filibuster was a very real possibility. That was after they pummeled Hagel, a Nebraskan who once counted himself among their number, during a grueling confirmation hearing.

They were displeased with Hagel for any number of reasons: He had gone from supporting to opposing the Iraq War and surge during the George W. Bush administration. He was too soft on Iran and too hard on Israel, they said. And Hagel didn't help himself at the hearing when he often came across as unfocused.

Hagel's nomination made it out of the Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday on a straight party line vote, another ominous sign.

Then on Wednesday afternoon, Reid announced he was filing a cloture motion, Senate-speak for an attempt to end a filibuster. He couldn't reach agreement with Sen. James Inhofe, the Oklahoman who is the top Republican on the Armed Services panel, to end debate.

Among Inhofe's stated concerns about Hagel, he has said, is that the Iranian Foreign Ministry supports his nomination. Sen. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is the committee's chairman, has suggested that perhaps the Iranians are being bomb throwers and trying to cause mischief in American policy circles.

In any event, Reid has scheduled the vote to end the debate for Friday unless an agreement is reached beforehand.

""This is the first time in the history of our country that a presidential nominee for secretary of defense has been filibustered,"" Reid said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""What a shame. But that's the way it is.""

The Democrats who control the Senate have 55 votes they can count on, a number that includes the Senate's two independents. And two Republicans have said they will vote for Hagel, Mike Johanns of Nebraska and Thad Cochran of Mississippi. But that still leaves Reid three votes short of the 60 needed to end a filibuster. And it's unclear where the other three votes come from.

Even Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the closest thing to a moderate in the Senate Republican caucus, said on Wednesday that she would be voting against Hagel.

This keeps alive the possibility that Hagel might not be confirmed.

If the Hagel nomination goes down, that would leave the president with two options. He could find a nominee more pleasing to Senate Republicans than the former Senate Republican now before them.

Or he could go the John Paul Jones route, tell Senate Republicans he has not yet begun to fight, and send them another nominee who would get their hackles up."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mike Groll/AP Mike Groll/AP

So maybe the Great Recession really is over.

After more than five years of recession and painfully slow recovery, President Obama has sent a powerful signal that he thinks the U.S. economy is now in much better shape — good enough, at least, to provide workers with raises.

In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Obama called upon Congress to boost the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour by 2015, up from the current $7.25. The wage would rise in steps, and after hitting the maximum in two years, would thereafter be indexed to inflation.

In the president's first term, the unemployment rate was very high, peaking at 10 percent in October 2009. And during those four years, Obama never seriously pushed Congress for legislation to force employers to pay more.

Tuesday night, he changed direction, saying in his State of the Union speech that he wants Congress to drive up wages for millions of workers by forcing up the benchmark minimum wage. Even though only a relatively small percentage of workers make $7.25 an hour, that pay level serves as a wage floor for all workers. When it moves higher, other wages ratchet up too.

In other words, if Congress were to boost the minimum hourly wage, then a person currently making $9 likely could move up to $10 or even $11 an hour as employers adjusted pay scales to higher levels to compete for the better low-wage workers.

'Honest Wages'

The White House says 15 million workers would benefit directly from a higher minimum wage, but many economists say that millions more would gain too after taking into account the ripple effect as the whole wage scale moves up.

""We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day's work with honest wages,"" Obama said. ""But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year.""

He said that's not enough money to keep a family above the poverty line. ""Let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour. This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families.""

The president's focus on the minimum wage came as something of a surprise, even to longtime supporters of a pay increase. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in an interview Wednesday morning that while she agrees with the president, ""I didn't know he would bring it up.""

Given that the wage push was unexpected, she said she did not know how Democratic lawmakers might put together their strategy for getting the legislation passed. For many years, it had been Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy who led congressional battles for higher wages. But with his death in August 2009 — one month after the last minimum wage hike took effect — supporters will need a new champion in Congress to marshal the troops.

Opponents already are gearing up for the fight. At a press conference this morning, House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, made it clear he would work against minimum-wage legislation.

""When you raise the price of employment, guess what happens? You get less of it,"" Boehner said. ""At a time when the American people are still asking the question, 'Where are the jobs?' why would we want to make it harder for small employers to hire people?""

Congress last passed a bill establishing a series of minimum wage increases in 2007 — before the Great Recession began. The last of those increases took the pay up to $7.25, where it has remained frozen.

Higher Existing Minimums

Nineteen states plus the District of Columbia have minimum wages above $7.25. For example, in Washington state, the pay is now up to $9.19 an hour — the highest minimum in the country. If the federal level were to rise, many of those 19 states would most likely pass new legislation to exceed it.

If the past is any indicator, business groups — particularly the National Restaurant Association — will put up a fierce fight to block any federal minimum wage increase.

Another group backed by the restaurant and hotel industries says an increase in the minimum wage can hurt the economy. ""The President's minimum wage hike ignores both simple economic logic as well as the overwhelming scholarly consensus on minimum wage hikes,"" Michael Saltsman, research director of the Employment Policies Institute, said in a statement. The institute says research ""points to a loss of job opportunities following a minimum wage hike.""

But many economists point to studies that show a higher minimum wage does little to hurt job creation. Instead, these economists argue that a higher wage reduces income inequality and puts more money into the hands of the consumers who can spend it. So, the argument goes, while a pizza-shop owner might have to spend more on his payroll under new wage legislation, he also would see a boost in revenues as customers find themselves enjoying bigger paydays.

A Hot-Button Issue

The minimum wage has been a hot-button issue with business groups since its introduction in 1938. They argue that a federal minimum wage is inflationary and represents an unnecessary government intervention in the labor market. They say labor supply and demand alone should set wages, not lawmakers.

Supporters disagree. They say inflation is very low, while income inequality is growing. Working people lack of spending power, and that's what is inhibiting economic growth, the argument goes.

""We applaud the president for expressing support for raising the minimum wage and tying it to the cost of living,"" Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, said in a statement on behalf of the labor organization. He said the economy is not suffering from high wages but rather from ""wage stagnation and growing inequality.""

Between 2000 and 2010, U.S. median income fell 7 percent after adjusting for inflation, according to census data. Over the past year, the unemployment rate has hovered at or just below 8 percent."

Updated at 8:30 a.m. ET

President-elect Joe Biden told Stephen Colbert he is ""not concerned"" about accusations against his son Hunter Biden amid the investigation by federal prosecutors into his son's tax affairs.

Colbert asked Biden about people in Washington who ""are going to try to use your adult son as a cudgel against you,"" during The Late Show With Stephen Colbert that aired Thursday night.

""We have great confidence in our son,"" said Biden, who appeared alongside his wife, Jill Biden. ""I am not concerned about any accusations that have been made against him. It's used to get to me. I think it's kind of foul play, but look, it is what it is.""

Colbert asked Biden if he'd be able to work with Republicans who use the issue as political ammunition: ""In terms of your job as president, can you reach across the aisle to people who'll be using this as an attack on you when it is such a personal attack because it's about family?""

Biden answered: ""If it benefits the country, yes. I really mean it.""

Critics of Biden have often used Biden's son as fodder against his campaign. Hunter Biden, 50, revealed last week he is under a federal investigation over his taxes.

""I take this matter very seriously,"" the president-elect's son said in a statement. ""But I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately.""

During the interview, the president-elect also addressed the coronavirus pandemic and said he believed that by next Christmas the situation in the U.S. will be back to normal or ""awfully close.""

During the show, Jill Biden directly addressed a recent op-ed that targeted her doctorate and use of the prefix ""Dr."" in her name.

The op-ed, published by The Wall Street Journal and written by former magazine editor Joseph Epstein, was decried as misogynistic by many for its tone and content.

""That was such a surprise,"" Jill Biden told Colbert, remarking on the biting tone of the piece. ""You know, he called me 'kiddo.' One of the things that I'm most proud of is my doctorate. I mean, I worked so hard for it."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Tami Chappell/AFP via Getty Images Tami Chappell/AFP via Getty Images

Updated at 12:10 p.m. ET

Since news of the SolarWinds hack surfaced nearly a week ago, high-ranking Trump administration officials had remained largely silent about the cyberattack that involved at least half a dozen federal agencies. On Friday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo broke that silence, becoming the most prominent administration official to blame Russia for the attack.

""This was a very significant effort,"" Pompeo told the The Mark Levin Show, ""and I think it's the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity.""

""We're still unpacking precisely what it is, and I'm sure some of it will remain classified,"" Pompeo said. ""But suffice it to say, there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems and, it now appears, the systems of private companies and governments across the world, as well.""

Pompeo's comments represented the farthest the Trump administration has been willing to go so far in publicly attributing the hack to Russia.

President Trump, who went nearly a week without mentioning the suspected attack, appeared to suggest Saturday that Russia may not be the culprit. He tweeted that the attack is ""far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality.""

""I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control. Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of ... discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!),"" Trump said.

And he repeated his baseless assertion that electoral fraud cost him the presidential election — a claim that he has not backed up with evidence, and that multiple members of his own administration have outright dismissed.

SolarWinds, the IT company whose product was targeted in the hack, said that nearly 18,000 of its customers received a software update tainted with malware, beginning in March. The malicious code operated as a kind of Trojan horse, enabling hackers to stealthily access the systems of the affected agencies and companies.

The cyberattack operated undetected for months and reportedly hit multiple government agencies, including the State Department, the Pentagon, the Treasury Department and the Department of Homeland Security.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Thursday acknowledged that the hack ""poses a grave risk"" to federal, state and local governments across the country — but refrained from directly attributing blame.

Unlike Trump, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have made it clear that they believe the Kremlin is behind what they are calling a ""significant, sophisticated, and ongoing cybersecurity intrusion.""

Russia, for its part, has denied playing a role in the operation.

In a joint statement on Thursday, the two highest-ranking members of the Senate Armed Services Committee said the attack ""has the hallmarks of a Russian intelligence operation."" In their statement, Sens. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., and Jack Reed, D-R.I., called upon the U.S. government to ""do everything possible to counter it"" — something several other lawmakers have criticized the Trump administration for not doing.

""An incident of this magnitude and lasting impact requires an engaged and public response by the U.S. government, led by a President who understands the significance of this intrusion and who is actively marshaling a domestic remediation strategy and an international response,"" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice-chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement released Friday.

""It is extremely troubling that the President does not appear to be acknowledging, much less acting upon, the gravity of this situation,"" he added.

The criticism has come not just from Democrats, but from members of Trump's own party, as well. One day before Warner's statement, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah also called out what he called ""inexcusable silence and inaction from the White House.""

""The cyber hack,"" he said, ""is like Russian bombers have been repeatedly flying undetected over our entire country.""

Asked about the criticism, Pompeo suggested that Trump had maintained his silence so as not to interfere with investigations into the incident.

""I saw this in my time running the world's premier espionage service at the CIA.

For more than 100 years, two statues representing Virginia have stood at the U.S. Capitol: one of George Washington and another of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

But early Monday, the Lee statue was removed from the National Statuary Hall's collection. It's expected to be replaced by a statue honoring civil rights activist Barbara Johns.

""This is a historic and long-overdue moment for our Commonwealth,"" U.S. Reps. Donald McEachin and Jennifer Wexton, both Democrats from Virginia, said in a statement. ""The Robert E. Lee statue honors a legacy of division, oppression, and racism — a dark period in the history of our Commonwealth and our country.""

""We are proud to have led the effort in the House of Representatives to replace Lee's statue,"" they added. A commission established by the Virginia General Assembly recently selected Johns to replace Lee. The state's General Assembly is expected to vote on the pick during the legislative session next year.

Many statues of controversial historical figures have recently been taken down across the U.S., as the country grapples with its long history of racial injustice.

The Statuary Hall collection is made up of two statues from each state, displayed throughout the Capitol. Virginia contributed the Washington and Lee statues in 1909 – some 44 years after the end of the Civil War, as Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam noted.

""The Confederacy is a symbol of Virginia's racist and divisive history, and it is past time we tell our story with images of perseverance, diversity, and inclusion,"" Northam said in a statement.

Johns was an important figure fighting school segregation. In 1951, when she was 16, she led a walk-out protesting inferior conditions at Robert Russa Moton High School, an all-Black school in Farmville, Va.

""Before the sit-ins in Greensboro, before the Montgomery bus boycott, there was the student strike here in 1951, led by Barbara Johns,"" Cameron Patterson, who heads a museum on the grounds of the former school, recently told NPR. ""When the students saw what was being provided to white students in this community at Farmville High School, there was certainly a recognition that our community was not meeting the needs of the students here.""

The strike caught the attention of the NAACP, which sued in a case that was later part of the landmark anti-segregation Supreme Court case, Brown v. Board of Education.

The Lee statue will be moved to the Virginia Museum of History and Culture in Richmond, according to the governor's office."

Updated at 7:43 p.m. ET

President-elect Joe Biden plans to nominate Miguel Cardona, the head of Connecticut's public schools, to be his secretary of education.

In a statement Tuesday evening, Biden called Cardona a ""lifelong champion of public education.""

Cardona makes true on an early Biden promise to pick an education secretary who was a teacher: ""A teacher. Promise,"" Biden told the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union, back in July 2019.

Cardona became the top education official in Connecticut in 2019 after being an assistant superintendent in the school district in Meriden, Conn., which serves nearly 9,000 students. It's the district Cardona grew up and went to school in, and also where he started his career in education as an elementary school teacher. He was a principal there for 10 years and was named the state's principal of the year in 2012.

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus put its support behind Cardona in a letter to Biden last week.

Cardona's parents are from Puerto Rico and lived in public housing when they moved to Connecticut. Biden has said he plans to establish ""the most diverse Cabinet in history.""

Much of Cardona's recent tenure has focused on reopening the state's schools during the pandemic. According to The Connecticut Mirror, a local newspaper, about one-third of the state's public school students currently are able to attend school in person full time. Like many state and district leaders across the country, Cardona has been balancing demands from teachers unions and parents amid budget constraints.

""Yes, we're in a health pandemic, but this is also an education emergency,"" he told The Mirror in August. ""We have to accelerate our efforts because COVID accelerated disparities. We have to really double down and put our heads together to do what's best for kids and for the community. And that includes making sure that health and safety stay at the top of the conversation.""

This experience is attractive for a Biden administration that faces major challenges in getting America's children back to school amid the pandemic. Nevertheless, Biden has said this will be a main focus: pledging to get the ""majority"" of schools open in the first 100 days of his administration.

Increasing school funding will also be a top goal of the Biden administration. The U.S. Education Department controls only around 10% of the dollars spent on K-12 public education in this country. A lot of that comes through the $16 billion Title I program, which goes to schools serving the most high-poverty students. Biden has proposed tripling that funding. On higher education, he has proposed forgiving student loan debt and making community colleges tuition-free.

With those priorities in mind, the next education secretary will inherit a litany of challenges and tight deadlines. Here are five things that could top the next secretary's to-do list:

1. COVID-19 school reopening plans

Just as current Secretary Betsy DeVos had little power to push schools into reopening, her successor will also have limited leverage to back Biden as he, too, tries to encourage a return to in-person learning. After all, federal funding for schools flows through Congress.

Perhaps the most important role Biden's new education secretary can play is a symbolic one: using the department's bully pulpit — as DeVos did to advocate for school choice — to speak to the needs of the nation's public schools and the more than 50 million children who depend on them.

It's worth noting that, the new secretary will help shape — and defend — the Biden administration's first education budget proposal. This may be the first, best opportunity to secure new funding to help schools that have been wracked by pandemic-driven budget cuts, especially in historically underfunded districts where low-income students and students of color have been hit hard and lost months of learning.

""The Secretary of Education must use his or her platform to lead a nationwide conversation about education through a racial equity lens,"" John B. King Jr., DeVos' predecessor, and Marc Morial, head of the National Urban League, wrote in a recent op-ed. ""That conversation must center on the needs of students from marginalized communities, clearly illuminate the impacts of the pandemic, and demonstrate how those impacts interact with and exacerbate hundreds of years of systemic racism.""

Districts are already considering efforts to mitigate learning loss, including extending the school year and hiring tutors. But they'll need help paying for those efforts, and a persuasive champion in the Education Department who can make the case to Congress and the American people.

2. To test or not to test

In the spring, as school districts across the country grappled with the challenges of remote learning, DeVos waived the federal requirement that students take the usual, year-end standardized tests. She has so far refused to issue a new waiver for 2021, but the next secretary certainly can. The question is will the next secretary? Or should the official?

The issue of testing has created a rift between traditional education allies — with teachers unions generally opposed to testing, and many civil rights groups arguing these tests are necessary to understand who has fallen behind, and how far have they fallen, since schools first closed in March.

3. Pandemic relief for student borrowers

Much has been made of whether, or how, the Biden administration would try to erase the debts of millions of student borrowers, but the more pressing question for his education secretary will be whether to extend the current moratorium on repayment for the more than 40 million borrowers with federal student loans.

Consider This from NPR Student Debt Is Weighing Americans Down. Here's How Biden May Address It Student Debt Is Weighing Americans Down. Here's How Biden May Address It Listen · 12:38 12:38

DeVos pushed the deadline to Jan. 31, but it seems likely, with the economy still struggling, that the Biden administration will want to give borrowers at least a few more months of breathing room. The next secretary will also have to grapple with the risks of such an extension, says Clare McCann, who studies higher education policy at New America, a liberal-leaning think tank.

""The further you get from people making payments, the harder it's going to be to reengage with those borrowers and to get them back into the habit of making payments and kind of get back in touch with them,"" McCann says.

4. Restore Obama-era guidance

One of the easiest things for an incoming administration to do is to scuttle guidance issued by its predecessor. DeVos used her authority to rescind Obama-era guidance that encouraged school desegregation efforts, allowed students to use facilities consistent with their gender identity and protected students of color from ""discriminatory discipline.""

The discipline guidance threatened schools with a federal investigation if suspension and expulsion rates revealed significant racial disparities. Fatima Goss Graves, head of the National Women's Law Center, said in August that ""racist school discipline policies continue to limit the learning opportunities and compromise the safety of Black, Latina and Native girls in this country. Schools — in whatever form they exist in this year, and beyond — should commit to changing these inequities and creating environments that are inclusive and supportive.""

The incoming secretary could not only reissue this guidance but could also strengthen it and issue new guidance.

5. Relief for defrauded borrowers

The rule known as borrower defense presents the next secretary with the policy equivalent of a Rubik's Cube. The decades-old rule was rewritten by the Obama administration in 2016 to help refund borrowers who had been defrauded by for-profit colleges and universities, including Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute. DeVos considered it too generous and undertook a rigorous rewrite, but that 2019 version was considered so extreme that a bipartisan Congress voted to block it, forcing President Trump to use a rare veto.

The next secretary will inherit an unpopular rule that is currently being contested in court but could be difficult to replace quickly as well as a backlog of tens of thousands of borrower claims. Much of that backlog should fall under the previous iterations of the rule and can likely be processed, but the department will also have to ramp up investigations into the many other schools, beyond Corinthian and ITT Technical Institute, that borrowers claim misled them."

Mary Lopez, a retired forensic accountant from California, is a longtime home-necessities gifting proponent, and her family has been giving pandemic-themed gifts all year.

For her daughter's birthday, Lopez assembled a basket of lockdown-survival aids, including Clorox cleaning spray, some money on a gift card, two candy-filled wine glasses and a bottle of wine. Her daughter replicated this basket for her friends for the holidays, adding also toilet paper and jigsaw puzzles.

Gifts of sanitation tend to be an add-on to other items people are exchanging this year — a dose of pandemic reality on top of regular gifts. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, categories selling particularly well are electronics, home furnishings and athleisure clothes.

On a recent run to Costco just outside Washington, D.C., banking analyst Ritesh Ranjan spotted a 2020 unicorn: a five pack of Clorox wipes. He remembered friends mentioning they had trouble finding them. ""Hopefully it'll remind them of the conversation we have had about it, and hopefully it helps,"" Ranjan said.

But later he felt a bit guilty for snatching those wipes that are so rare these days: ""Did [I] steer the product away from someone who would need it much more urgently?"" he pondered. ""After I bought this one, I decided I'm not going to buy any more of these for gifts.""

Kathleen Murray, a teacher from Virginia Beach, Va., also never expected to be gifting cleaning products for the holidays. But she came across some holiday-themed hand sanitizers, with scents like vanilla and Christmas cookies, and couldn't resist.

""It at least cheers you up,"" she said. ""You have to use it regardless. But if it smells like gingerbread, I'd rather use that.""

The sanitizers went into her Advent calendars for family members, as little daily gifts alongside candy, festive face masks and other pandemic essentials. Asked if all these sanitation-themed gifts felt just a little bit sad, she laughed.

""I guess a bit sad,"" Murray said. ""But also like — if you could give anyone a gift, you want to give them safety. I would love to be able to give them all the vaccine, but you obviously can't do that. It's the closest thing to safety that you can give them."""

Updated Friday at 2:49 p.m. ET

Saddled with delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic and last-minute changes by the Trump administration, the first set of 2020 census results were not ready for release by Thursday's year-end deadline for numbers that determine representation in Congress and the Electoral College for the next decade.

A Census Bureau employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation in the workplace, confirmed to NPR that the bureau is still trying to fix irregularities uncovered in this year's census records.

The employee told NPR that career officials at the agency are working toward Jan. 9 as an internal target date for completing the current stage of processing records before assessing when to begin the final steps in producing new state population counts used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives and electoral votes among the states.

""If we miss Jan. 9, it's hard to envision that we would get apportionment done before inauguration,"" the employee said.

Shortly after NPR published this report, the Census Bureau released a statement announcing plans to ""deliver a complete and accurate state population count for apportionment in early 2021, as close to the statutory deadline as possible.""

""The schedule for reporting this data is not static. Projected dates are fluid,"" the bureau said in the announcement. The Associated Press first reported the bureau's plans to announce a delay.

Under federal law, the commerce secretary, who oversees the bureau, is required to report to the president the latest state population totals within nine months of Census Day, which was April 1.

Since the Dec. 31 deadline was put in place by Congress in 1976, the bureau has never failed in delivering the first set of census numbers by the end of a census year. Before the bureau was established, the federal government did miss similar reporting deadlines in the 1800s, and Congress extended them afterward.

The final timing of the 2020 census results' release could undermine President Trump's efforts to make an unprecedented change to who is counted in key census numbers before leaving office. This month, the Supreme Court ruled it was too early for courts to weigh in on whether Trump can exclude unauthorized immigrants from numbers that the Constitution says must include the ""whole number of persons in each state.""

If the first census results are not ready until after Trump's term ends on Jan. 20, it would be President-elect Joe Biden, not Trump, who would get control of the numbers, which are ultimately handed off to Congress for certification.

Back in April, the Trump administration publicly acknowledged that because of COVID-19, there was a need for four-month extensions to the legal deadlines for census results, including the demographic data due to states by March 31, 2021 for the redrawing of voting districts.

But the administration made an about-face and stopped asking Congress for those extensions in July, right around the time Trump issued a presidential memorandum calling for unauthorized immigrants to be left out of census apportionment counts.

Now, lawmakers will likely have to deal with the fallout of the missed census deadline after the new Congress is in session beginning Jan. 3.

Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii who co-sponsored a bipartisan Senate bill in September to extend census deadlines, is planning to re-introduce the legislation in 2021, Schatz's communication director, Mike Inacay, tells NPR.

While the delay was long expected in a tumultuous year and there is no penalty specified by federal law for not reporting the first set of numbers on time, the moment is remarkable for the Census Bureau, which had been planning and working towards Dec. 31 for close to a decade.

""I can tell you that nowhere have I seen a greater adherence to statutorily mandated deadlines,"" says Edgar Chen, a former attorney in the Commerce Department's Office of the General Counsel who has also worked at the Justice and Treasury Departments.



Barry Robinson, a former chief counsel for economic affairs at the Commerce Department, recalls advising Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during an internal meeting in 2017 about the legal obligation to adhere to the provided timelines for the census. But Robinson says, especially in light of the pandemic, the government cannot prioritize meeting deadlines over the importance of producing a complete and accurate count.

""I'm the first to say that what I'm looking at now with the delays caused by the disruption of COVID-19, I think there is a very plausible and justifiable argument for a reasonable extension of time to allow the Census Bureau to fully complete its functions,"" Robinson says.

U.S. census historian Margo Anderson notes that until shortly before the 1930 census, the federal government did not have legal deadlines for reporting results to the president or Congress, although census workers were instructed to turn in paper reports by set dates.

""This used to take months to get paper sent around the country so that a lot of times the deadlines would be missed simply because of more localized incidents of a natural disaster,"" says Anderson, author of The American Census: A Social History.

Anderson warns that the full implications of the bureau missing the first reporting deadline for the 2020 census may not be clear until later.

""We won't know whether the census is sort of up to snuff until the data start rolling out,"" Anderson says. ""And then we may look back, realizing what was going on was much more significant. But we don't know yet."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images

The House voted on Monday to overturn President Trump's veto of the gargantuan annual defense authorization bill.

The vote, 322-87, was a highly unusual response to a highly unusual move by a president in rejecting the legislation, which sets policies and establishes other priorities every year for the military services.

The Senate's next moves on the matter are still uncertain, but senators were set to return to Washington on Tuesday.

The political popularity of the military typically means the National Defense Authorization Act has a high likelihood of passage and becomes one of the last vehicles of the year for compromise and enactment.

Trump, however, opposes aspects of the bill that would rename military bases named for Confederate figures, and he also was angry that Democrats in Congress didn't agree to a bargain in which they'd lift some legal protections for tech companies.

Trump says U.S. military facilities should continue to carry the names of men such as Confederate Gens. Robert E. Lee and Braxton Bragg. Separately, the president and some supporters claim Big Tech platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are biased against conservatives.

A few Republicans in Congress have joined with Trump, but many leaders said they intended to support the override of his veto. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., meanwhile, had called Trump's veto ""an act of staggering recklessness.""

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., called on his colleagues to vote in favor of the legislation again in debate Monday afternoon.

""It is enormously important we pass this bill. We did it once. Let's just do it one more time, and then we can all go home for the year,"" he said.

Smith concluded his remarks by noting that the Armed Services Committee ""is the most bipartisan committee in Congress.""

""That's not an easy thing to achieve. We have a lot of things we passionately disagree about in this body, and we should. But on the armed services bill, we manage to come together. It's not always easy, but we get it done. I think it is enormously important we let the country know that that process hasn't died."""

""It was hard to motivate myself to draw,"" Maggie said. ""And so getting on these FaceTime calls with Harry served not only the purpose of reconnecting with my brother, but also making me do this activity that I hadn't done in years and really actually found out that I missed.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ben Gray/AP Ben Gray/AP

Updated at 11:40 a.m. ET Tuesday

The political world has trained its focus on Georgia's two U.S. Senate races, which will settle the kind of Senate that President-elect Joe Biden will be dealing with.

The races, taking place Tuesday — the day before Biden is slated to be certified by Congress as the winner of the 2020 presidential election — are expected to be close. Consider that Biden won the rapidly changing but previously traditionally Republican state by fewer than 12,000 votes.

Two wins for Democrats, and they will control the Senate, along with the White House and the House, in a few weeks — a stark turnabout from the beginning of the Trump presidency four years earlier, when Republicans had full control.

But one Republican win, and it's split government, with the GOP likely able to block most of Biden's legislative agenda. That's why, between the candidates and outside groups, almost $500 million has been spent on ads for the races in just about two months.

It's notable that these contests are the first since the 2020 presidential election and that the usual metrics to measure races are mostly being cast aside. Polling was off in measuring Republican support for President Trump in the 2020 election, so polls are being looked at skeptically. And money didn't matter everywhere in 2020 — some candidates raised more money and lost badly, while others won.

Trump has also thrown a big variable into the elections with his mixed messages on voting. On the one hand, he's casting doubt on voting by baselessly claiming elections are rigged — and blaming Georgia's secretary of state for reducing GOP enthusiasm. On the other, he's encouraging Republicans to turn out and vote.

Everyone is flying a little blind heading into Tuesday, but here's what you need to know:

Who's running?

One contest pits incumbent Republican Sen. David Perdue against Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff. Perdue was first elected in 2014 and is seeking reelection.

The other race features incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler against Democrat Raphael Warnock, senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. Loeffler was appointed to her seat in 2019 after former Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson retired because of health reasons.

Why are these elections so important?

In determining control of the Senate, the results will put one party or the other in charge of the legislative agenda. A Democratic sweep would result in a 50-50 Senate with soon-to-be Vice President Kamala Harris being the tiebreaking vote in the chamber.

While there still is a 60-vote threshold to get legislation through, it would be much easier to confirm Biden's Cabinet picks and judicial appointments than if Democrats were in the minority.

Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who would be presumed to be Senate majority leader if Democrats took control of the chamber, would be in charge of what goes to the floor, including, if it came to it, items like doing away with the filibuster entirely or adding justices to the Supreme Court.

If Republicans won, though, GOP leader Mitch McConnell would be able to largely thwart much of Biden's agenda.

Why are the elections taking place now?

These are runoffs. Georgia does things a little differently than most other states. Back in November, if one of the Senate candidates had gotten 50% plus one vote, that candidate would have won the election outright and the state would have avoided a runoff in that race. But that didn't happen in either contest.

Perdue came closest — he won 49.7% of the vote to Ossoff's 47.9%. Calculated another way, out of almost 5 million votes cast, Perdue missed avoiding a runoff by a little over 13,000 votes.

The Loeffler-Warnock race had another hurdle. Because it was a special election, there weren't primaries and everyone ran on the same ballot together at once.

In a field of 20 candidates, including a prominent Republican challenger, Loeffler got just over a quarter of the vote.

Warnock actually finished ahead of her, with about a third of the vote. But when the votes were combined by party in that race, Republicans were narrowly ahead of Democrats, 49.4% to 48.4%.

Interest is high, given not just the money spent, but the high early-vote turnout, which began Dec. 14 and continued through Friday.

What does the early voting tell us?

It's always a little tricky to interpret early-voting data and ascribe real meaning to it, but Democrats see some hopeful signs.

Three million people cast ballots early. That's a record already for total votes cast in a Georgia runoff election. And who is voting is what's giving Democrats optimism: Black voters are making up a higher percentage of voters than they did for the Senate races in November, and turnout in Democratic congressional districts is higher than in GOP-held ones.

Of course, Democrats saw hope in early-voting numbers in Texas before Nov. 3, and Trump wound up winning that state by 6 points, a wider margin than the polls had predicted.

How much money has been spent on the races?

Almost $500 million has been spent on advertising between the two races in just the two months since the presidential election, according to the latest numbers provided to NPR by AdImpact, a political ad-tracking firm. The figures measure ad reservations between Nov. 4 and Jan. 5.

With outside groups included, Republicans have outspent Democrats $271 million to $218 million.

Ossoff's and Warnock's campaigns have both outspent Perdue's and Loeffler's by a combined $160.1 million to $99.8 million. Ossoff's campaign has spent the most of the campaigns, at $87.6 million, followed by Warnock at $72.5 million, Perdue at $50 million and Loeffler at $49.8 million.

But Republican outside groups have more than made up the difference, outspending Democrats almost 3-to-1, $171.2 million to $58 million.

One Republican hardly spending on Georgia, however: Trump. Despite desperate fundraising pleas (""I need YOU to secure a WIN in Georgia,"" and ""Help us WIN both Senate races in Georgia & STOP Socialist Dems""), most of the money raised from those pitches is being pocketed by Trump's PAC, Save America.

Facebook on Wednesday removed a video message by President Trump, citing ""the risk of ongoing violence.""

Facebook executive Guy Rosen called the pro-Trump mob swarming the Capitol an ""emergency situation,"" suggesting the president's video message had the potential of worsening the chaos.

""We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence,"" Rosen tweeted.

YouTube soon followed suit, although it cited other reasons. In a statement, the company pointed to a policy against content that alleges widespread fraud or errors accounted for President-elect Joe Biden's victory over Trump in November.

Twitter also had the video removed, along with two other tweets from the president egging on the mob and baselessly questioning the result of the election.

In the video, Trump told his supporters who have stormed the U.S. Capitol to ""go home now,"" but the president also baselessly claimed the election was stolen and told his angry backers: ""We love you. You're very special.""

Twitter initially only restricted the reach of the video over concerns of ""a risk of violence.""

Twitter restricted engagement on the tweet, blocking retweets, likes and comments on the platform. But Twitter still allowed the video message to be quote-tweeted. Many users did just that, allowing the material to spread around the social network. In the hour after Trump posted it, the video was viewed more than 11 million times on Twitter.

Critics called on Twitter to do more, even suspending Trump's account for repeatedly stoking violence over his unfounded claims over his election loss. Some demanded that the president's accounts on both sites be permanently banned.

""There have been good arguments for private companies to not silence elected officials, but all those arguments are predicated on the protection of constitutional governance,"" tweeted Alex Stamos, a former top security official at Facebook. ""Twitter and Facebook have to cut him off. There are no legitimate equities left and labeling won't do it.""

Soon after Facebook and YouTube announced their policies, the video and another of the president's tweets were covered with gray labels saying they were ""no longer available.""

Trump's short video address followed hours in which the president remained silent as a melee ensued on the Capitol. His supporters violently entered the building, causing lawmakers to be rushed out to safety and law enforcement to draw their guns."

Updated at 4 a.m. ET

Congress certified President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' victory early on Thursday, the end of a long day and night marked by chaos and violence in Washington, D.C. Extremists emboldened by President Trump had sought to thwart the peaceful transfer of power that has been a hallmark of modern American history by staging a violent insurrection inside the U.S. Capitol.

""To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today, you did not win,"" Vice President Pence said once lawmakers reconvened after many spent hours in lockdown. ""Violence never wins. Freedom wins, and this is still the people's house.""

Biden and Harris finished with 306 electoral votes, while Trump and Pence had 232. It takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.

In a statement released just after the certification was finalized, Trump at long last acknowledged his election loss. He said that even though he disagrees with the outcome, ""there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.""

""I have always said we would continue our ... fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!""

Dozens of Republican House lawmakers, along with some Republican senators supportive of Trump, had planned to object Wednesday to the electoral votes of as many as six states that backed Biden.

But late Wednesday night, some Senate Republicans withdrew their objections. Each objection requires the backing of a member of both the House and the Senate to be considered. Sens. Steve Daines of Montana, Mike Braun of Indiana and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia all said that they would stand down.

""I cannot now, in good conscience, object to the certification of these electors,"" Loeffler said Wednesday, drawing applause from some of her colleagues. Loeffler was one of two Republicans who lost their races on Tuesday, giving Democrats control of the U.S. Senate.

Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who took up Trump's call that lawmakers object to the results of the election, said Wednesday night that the Senate should consider his objections, but that they should be debated ""without violence, without attacks, without bullets.""

Senate lawmakers voted late Wednesday to reject the challenge to Biden's victory in the state of Arizona, and the House followed suit, but with many Republicans in favor of overturning the state's results. A similar result played out for the state of Pennsylvania, with both chambers voting to reject the challenge to Biden's victory there.

Republican House lawmakers also objected to the electoral votes in Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, but no senator would join in those objections.

""In that case, the objection cannot be entertained,"" Pence said repeatedly, chairing the proceedings in his role as president of the Senate.

So the count continued, state by state, with Vermont's three electoral votes putting Biden and Harris over the 270 mark, until finally Wyoming's three electoral votes were tallied for Trump and Pence.

How the chaos unfolded

The process to affirm Biden's victory began in the early afternoon. The typically ceremonial affair, an affirmation of the democratic process, was expected to be a bitter, hours-long endeavor because of objections planned by Trump's congressional allies, despite the fact that they were certain to be met with bipartisan defeat.

But as the process began, a mob of pro-Trump extremists stormed the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon, bringing the counting of the electoral votes to a halt.

Lawmakers were evacuated from the building as the violent, chaotic scene played out, prompting a citywide curfew. One woman was killed by a Capitol Police officer in the Capitol. Wednesday night, D.C. police said three other people died from medical emergencies in the surrounding area.

Around 8 p.m. ET, hours after the Capitol was breached, lawmakers were cleared to return to finish debate and tally the Electoral College votes. In separate speeches in their respective chambers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to press ahead with the business at hand.

""We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation. We are back at our posts,"" McConnell said, adding, ""and we're going to do it tonight.""

Trump's pressure

The scene that unfolded at the Capitol on Wednesday was the culmination of months of efforts by Trump and his allies, publicly and privately, to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Some of those efforts were based on unproven claims of fraudulent vote counts, while others were founded on baseless conspiracy theories.

Trump had been particularly focused on Pence's role, publicly ratcheting up pressure on his vice president in recent days — including as he addressed supporters on Wednesday — to back his efforts to reverse the 2020 election results. Pence, though, said Wednesday that he did not have the power to change the outcome of the election or to unilaterally delay the certification of Biden's victory.

And the insurrectionists that disrupted the certification of the Electoral College votes did so after Trump spoke to them, demanding that they fight to ""stop the steal"" of the election — a false claim — and descend on the Capitol.

""After this, we're going to walk down — and I'll be there with you — we're going to walk down, we're going to walk down to the Capitol,"" Trump said earlier Wednesday, ""and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.""

As the mob drew down on the Capitol, Trump remained largely silent and did not make widespread remarks condemning the violence, or attempts to quell it. At one point, he tweeted a short video in which he repeated claims — without evidence — regarding voter fraud and a stolen election, while saying ""we love you"" to the mob that had descended on Washington and urging them to go home.

Later Wednesday, he tweeted that ""these are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long.""

Twitter later demanded that the tweet and video be removed, and the platform temporarily locked the president's account, threatening to permanently suspend it.

Condemnation of the president

For his part, Biden called on the president to direct his supporters to end what he described as an ""unprecedented assault"" on democracy that ""borders on sedition.""

""I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege,"" Biden said in brief remarks. The president-elect also suggested that Trump was to blame for the violence, saying that ""at the best, the words of a president can inspire. At their worst, they can incite.""

As the chaos unfolded, some House Democrats have called for impeaching the president again during his final two weeks in office.

Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota wrote on Twitter that she was drawing up articles of impeachment. ""We can't allow him to remain in office, it's a matter of preserving our republic,"" she wrote. Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline faulted the president for the violence that consumed the Capitol and said, ""We should impeach and convict him tomorrow.""

Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark, D-Mass. called the president ""a traitor to our country and our Constitution"" and called for him to be removed from office ""and prevented from further endangering our country and our people.""

Trump also faced critics within his own party for his role in egging on the mob.

""What happened today was nothing short of a coup attempt. The President of the United States has been lying to his supporters with false information and false expectations,"" Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick said in a tweet. ""He lit the flame of incitement and owns responsibility for this.""

And Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said that it's ""past time"" for Trump to ""accept his defeat, quit misleading the people, and repudiate mob violence."""

Updated at 11:29 p.m. ET

The House of Representatives approved a symbolic resolution urging Vice President Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment against President Trump, after the president's No. 2 has expressed that he would not exercise that option. The move comes nearly a week after violent pro-Trump extremists breached the U.S. Capitol.

The vote was mostly along party lines, 223-205, with just one Republican, Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, joining Democrats to vote for the measure.

Loading...

Pence made his intention clear in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Tuesday evening, as the House was taking up a resolution calling on Pence to invoke the amendment, convene the Cabinet, declare Trump unfit for office, and assume the powers and responsibilities of acting president.

""I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with our Constitution,"" Pence writes. He says the amendment is ""not a means of punishment or usurpation,"" and that invoking it would ""set a terrible precedent.""

He says the Trump administration is committed to ensuring an orderly transition in its final days and that ""now is the time to heal.""

Still, the resolution passed the Democratic-controlled House, as had been expected.

Trump ""widely advertised and broadly encouraged"" the protests that led to last week's violence, the resolution argues, and then ignored calls to condemn his supporters' actions swiftly. It also cites his repeated efforts to delegitimize the presidential election results with false claims of widespread voter fraud.

The motion's approval comes as Democrats in the House have also filed an impeachment resolution charging Trump with fomenting the insurrection.

With Pence's response to the 25th Amendment resolution, the House plans to move forward with impeachment proceedings. Trump is just the third U.S. president to have been impeached. He would be the only one to have been impeached twice.

Democrats, emboldened by bipartisan outrage over last week's siege of the Capitol, are resolved in their efforts to seek Trump's dismissal even before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.

Speaking Tuesday in Texas, Trump said that ""the 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration.""

Earlier Tuesday, Trump called the move to impeach him again ""ridiculous.""

""For [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi and [Senate Democratic leader] Chuck Schumer to continue on this path, I think it's causing tremendous danger to our country and it's causing tremendous anger,"" he told reporters.

Some Republican supporters of Trump were pressed Tuesday on their role in encouraging his baseless election fraud claims, and in pushing events that led to the violent insurrection at the Capitol.

""Those of us who spoke against the unconstitutional way several states conducted their election were following the process,"" Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said in response to criticism. ""And we did nothing different than Democrats have done every time a Republican's been elected this century.""

In a news conference Tuesday, Schumer said he's asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to call the Senate back into session immediately to begin a likely impeachment trial.

""We could come back ASAP and vote to convict Donald Trump and get him out of office now before any further damage is done,"" Schumer said."

Eight days from the end of his presidency, President Trump expressed no regret for his comments last week ahead of a riot and mob violence at the U.S. Capitol that resulted in the deaths of at least five people and multiple injuries.

""People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,"" Trump said Tuesday when asked about his role in the siege, despite many at the highest levels of government — Republicans and Democrats — saying otherwise, three of his Cabinet members having resigned and a second impeachment effort now underway.

Trump continued by deflecting reporters' questions and shifting focus.

""And if you look at what other people have said, politicians at a high level, about the riots during the summer, the horrible riots in Portland and Seattle and various other places, that was a real problem — what they said,"" Trump claimed, referring to protests over racial inequality and police brutality.

He went on to say of his own speech that ""everybody — to the T — thought it was totally appropriate."" He later added, ""You have to always avoid violence.""

Trump made the comments to reporters on his way to Texas for a visit to one of his signature campaign promises — the border wall.

What Trump — and his son Donald Trump Jr. and his attorney Rudy Giuliani — said last Wednesday at a rally on the Ellipse outside the White House has been roundly criticized by various members of Congress from both political parties, who were in direct danger.

Cabinet secretaries reportedly discussed enacting the 25th Amendment to remove him from office, and past officials, including two former chiefs of staff to the president, have been critical.

Trump put out two videos in response to the violence at the Capitol. The first sympathized with his supporters but told them to ""go home.""

Another highly scripted one said he was focused on an ""orderly and seamless transition of power.""

This week, Congress is moving toward a second impeachment of this president. If the effort is successful — and it appears there are enough votes in the House for it to pass — Trump will go down in history as the only president to be impeached twice.

While some Republicans back the effort, not many appear ready to sign on. Some have called on him to resign; others just hope he doesn't cause any other violence with so few days left in his presidency.

But Trump's Twitter account was permanently suspended after he said he would not attend Biden's inauguration. Twitter said that and other comments were being interpreted by various right-wing militia groups as a green light for violence. There have reportedly been other attacks planned for this weekend.

The Capitol complex — and U.S. Supreme Court across the street — will not be as easily accessible this time, however. They are now surrounded with non-scalable, 7-foot-high steel fencing with troops stationed inside the fencing every few hundred feet."

Updated at 1:55 p.m. ET

The day before Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th president of the United States, five of his Cabinet nominees will answer questions from Senate panels handling their confirmations. The busy committee calendar is ramping up at the same time an impeachment trial is expected to start, posing a split-screen challenge for the Senate, which is still reeling from an attack less than two weeks ago.

The process of vetting the top officials in the new administration comes as the Senate is still in a period of transition. Democrats are due to take the majority after winning a pair of runoff elections in Georgia earlier this month.

Since Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, the newly elected Democrats from Georgia, have not been sworn in yet, Republicans currently have the majority in the Senate, and GOP chairs will preside over the five confirmation hearings on Tuesday. Warnock and Ossoff's elections were certified on Tuesday by the Georgia secretary of state. They could be sworn in as early as Wednesday to officially begin their Senate work. In addition, Alex Padilla, appointed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to take the seat of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, is expected to sworn in as early as Wednesday. But the organization of the 50-50 Senate could take some time to sort out. Harris will serve as the tiebreaking vote since the vice president also serves as president of the Senate.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were meeting Tuesday to work out a power-sharing agreement that is expected to cover how committee assignments will work and how legislation will be considered on the Senate floor.

(See who has been named to the Biden administration so far).

Unlike previous administrations, President-elect Biden will not have top national security Cabinet officials confirmed as he takes office. But his transition team said the incoming president plans to appoint acting agency heads from career civil service ranks as the Senate considers and votes on his nominees to lead the departments.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is expected to transmit the article of impeachment that the House approved last week soon. But until she does, the timeline for a trial and the rules that would govern how long it would last or whether witnesses will be called are still unclear. Biden has made it clear he believes the Senate can balance both the trial, confirmation votes and consideration of his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.

Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar downplayed the multitasking challenge in an interview on CNN on Monday. ""We can do three things at once in the Senate,"" Klobuchar said. ""Moms are juggling their toddlers on their knees and their laptops on their desks right now.""

The fallout from the violent attack by pro-Trump extremists on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 is still reverberating among lawmakers as more arrests continue to reveal details about the siege and motivations of those involved. Some of the committees involved in confirmations are likely to also take up reviews of their own.

The first five hearings on Tuesday include nominees who are already signaling sharp departures from the policies enacted under President Trump. They also showcase the diversity that Biden has vowed to be a hallmark of his Cabinet, and more broadly of his approach to his presidency.

Defense

Up to 25,000 National Guard troops have been activated to help patrol Washington, D.C., due to concerns over increased domestic terrorism threats around Wednesday's inauguration. Questions about the military's role are likely to come up at retired four-star Gen. Lloyd Austin's confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services committee. Austin would be the first African American defense secretary if confirmed by the Senate. He will need a waiver approved by both the House and Senate to take the position because he has not been out of uniform for the required seven years.

Austin will likely face questions about the plans for U.S. troops in Afghanistan, after President Trump reduced the military footprint there. He will also be peppered with questions about his views on the posture for the military with regard to threats from Iran, Russia and China.

Homeland Security

The insurrection at the Capitol was a central topic at the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's hearing with Alejandro Mayorkas, the incoming administration's nominee to be secretary of homeland security.

Mayorkas vowed to do everything in his power to prevent another such attack from happening again.

The department has had a lot of turnover at the top under President Trump and faced controversy over implementing controversial immigration policies. Mayorkas, a Cuban American, would become the first Latino at the top of the agency.

Ron Klain, the incoming White House chief of staff, has already indicated that the administration will take executive action on its first day in power to roll back the travel ban instituted by the Trump administration restricting immigration from some Muslim countries.

State

Antony Blinken, Biden's nominee to be the next secretary of state, is a familiar face to many on Capitol Hill. He served as deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration and was a longtime top aide to Biden.

Appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, he promised ""humility and confidence."" Texas GOP Rep. Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, urged Senate Republicans on the panel to ""dig deep into the many foreign policy areas where we have heard very little from the incoming administration.""

Klain also said the administration will move immediately to rejoin the Paris climate accords, a topic that could come up on Tuesday. But after President Trump's ""America First"" mantra, Blinken has vowed to restore America's credibility on the global stage. He will also face questions about how he will approach strained relationships with key allies and handle rising threats from Iran, North Korea, Russia and China.

Intelligence

The Senate Intelligence Committee heard from Avril Haines, Biden's pick to serve as director of national intelligence, on Tuesday. She said trust and confidence need to be restored in the intelligence community, where ""there is simply no place for politics, ever.""

If confirmed, Haines would be the first woman to hold the post. Many Democratic lawmakers over the past four years have complained about the politicization of intelligence and the lack of briefings for members around key events. Many warned that the U.S. needs to be more vigilant about the threats from Russia and China.

The hack of several federal agencies in December, which many believe was orchestrated by Russia's intelligence arm, is one issue that Congress is still investigating, and lawmakers will want details on how the Biden administration plans to respond.

Treasury

Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, Biden's nominee to lead the Treasury Department, answered questions before the Senate Finance Committee and urged Congress to ""act big."" She would make history as the first female Treasury secretary if confirmed. Since she was nominated, she appears to have some bipartisan support because many are already familiar with her reputation over her tenure in government.

Last week, Biden rolled out a massive $1.9 trillion COVID-19 proposal to help juice the struggling economy. The plan includes $1,400 direct payments to many Americans, but one key Democrat — West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin — is already saying he thinks any additional checks need to be targeted. The move to add a proposal to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour is already a non-starter for many in the GOP and could also be problematic for some centrist Democrats. Both of those issues, as well as additional support for small businesses, are likely to come up during the hearing.

It's unclear how quickly votes on these five nominees will move to the full Senate if they receive committee approval. But as Democrats take control of the chamber, they are expected to move swiftly and have the votes to install Cabinet nominees absent any new vetting issues."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP

Almost exactly one year after the first case of the coronavirus was detected in the United States, the country has now reached 25 million confirmed infections. As it has for months, the U.S. remains by far the most coronavirus-riddled country in the world.

Data from Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center showed the U.S. passing the tragic marker as of Sunday morning. The true number of cases, however, is likely far higher: Many people become infected but never get tested, so they aren't reflected in the count.

The U.S. has more than twice as many confirmed cases as the nation with the second highest count — India, a country with 10 million cases and a population that is four times larger.

Nearly 420,000 people in the U.S. have now died from the virus. That's almost double the number of the next highest country, Brazil, which is closing in on 220,000 deaths.

The existence of a more infectious variant of the virus could make matters worse, top health officials say. The variant has swept through large parts of the U.K. in recent weeks and was identified for the first time in the U.S. in late December with a case in Colorado.

Although U.K. scientists originally said the new variant is no more deadly, new data appear to suggest a more worrisome picture.

Americans ""need to assume now that what has been circulating dominantly in the U.K. does have a certain degree increase in what we call virulence: namely, the power of the virus to cause more damage, including death,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease specialist, told CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday.

While former President Donald Trump repeatedly downplayed the virus — proclaiming, for instance, that it would disappear with the changing weather — President Biden has focused much of his first week in office warning of the severity of the virus and introducing new measures intended to bring the pandemic under control. The president has promised 100 million vaccine doses in his first 100 days, and on Thursday he signed 10 executive orders and directives that the White House says will boost testing, vaccinations, supplies and treatments.

Still, experts caution that it will take several months before the pandemic is under control, and Biden himself has acknowledged that the situation will get worse before it gets better.

""A lot of America is hurting. The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000,"" Biden said Friday. ""Families are going hungry. People are at risk of being evicted. Job losses are mounting again. We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act."""

Updated at 7:55 p.m. ET

At about 7 p.m. ET Monday, House impeachment managers delivered to the Senate an article of impeachment against former President Donald Trump, a move that prompts preparations for a historic trial.

The formal step comes just over a year after the House last transmitted an impeachment measure against Trump to the upper chamber. The latest rebuke alleges that the former president incited the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.

On Tuesday, U.S. senators, who act as jurors in an impeachment trial, will be sworn in.

The trial itself will begin on Feb. 9, giving the nine House impeachment managers and Trump's defense team two weeks to file briefs and finalize their legal preparations.

An aide to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the delay will ensure Trump has due process.

The two-week period also allows for other Senate business to continue, like the confirmation of President Biden's Cabinet nominees.

""There are three essential items on our plate: the trial of President Trump now that the House has impeached him; bold, strong COVID relief; and approving the president's Cabinet,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters on Sunday. ""The Senate must advance all three in the next few weeks, and we will. The stakes are too high to delay any of them.""

The New York Democrat added: ""[The trial] will be fair, but it will move at a relatively fast pace.""

The House impeached Trump on Jan. 13 for an unprecedented second time, charging him with inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

Some Republican senators have said they believe it's unconstitutional to hold an impeachment trial for a president who's already out of office. Others have decried what they view is a partisan exercise.

""I think the trial is stupid. I think it's counterproductive,"" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said on Fox News Sunday. ""We already have a flaming fire in this country and it's like taking a bunch of gasoline and pouring it on top of the fire.""

Added Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""It's a moot point. There are other things that we'd rather be working on instead.""

But Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., who is serving as one of the impeachment managers, said she's heartened by the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump.

""Ten was a historically high number. That was a bipartisan impeachment,"" she said on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. ""Take a look at the words of [Wyoming Rep.] Liz Cheney, who said [Trump] assembled the mob, he incited the mob, and he lit the flame. ... I take heart in that. I hope, over the course of the remaining days, as we nine prepare this trial, more and more elected officials will pay attention to their oath and see the egregious high crimes and misdemeanors that this president was so desperate and capable of in the last weeks of his term in office.""

For her part, Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, is now fending off attacks from her own party stemming from her decision to support Trump's impeachment.

Another impeachment manager, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, says he thinks the case for convicting Trump in the Senate trial will become stronger in the days ahead.

""As the days go on, more and more evidence comes out about the president's involvement in the incitement of this insurrection, the incitement of this riot, and also his dereliction of duty once it was going on,"" he told NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro.

Castro said he's ""confident"" the case will be strong enough to convince GOP senators who haven't yet indicated how they'll vote on a conviction.

""I would hope that, first of all, they keep their powder dry, that they listen to all the evidence and wait for the case to be presented,"" he said. ""But most of all, at the end of the day, what we need is for people to put country over person, in other words, over Donald Trump and also country over party, Republican or Democrat."""

By now, it's widely accepted that indiscriminate spending cuts in defense and domestic programs due to start March 1 are likely to occur owing to the failure of President Obama and the Republican-led House to reach an agreement to avoid the budgetary cleaver.

So now, the contest boils down to each side scampering for the higher ground of moral indignation.

For weeks, the president has alleged that the ideological extremism of congressional Republicans is to blame for the impasse. A fresh example of that came Tuesday at a White House photo op at which the president, with men and women in uniform as his backdrop, warned that such first responders would be affected if the cuts — $1.2 trillion over 10 years — were allowed to happen:

""So now Republicans in Congress face a simple choice: Are they willing to compromise to protect vital investments in education and health care and national security and all the jobs that depend on them? Or would they rather put hundreds of thousands of jobs and our entire economy at risk just to protect a few special interest tax loopholes that benefit only the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations? That's the choice.""

Meanwhile, Republicans have tried steadily to pin the looming spending cuts on the White House.There was this example Tuesday in House Speaker John Boehner's response to Obama's photo op:

""Washington Democrats' newfound concern about the president's sequester is appreciated, but words alone won't avert it. Replacing the president's sequester will require a plan to cut spending that will put us on the path to a budget that is balanced in 10 years. To keep these first responders on the job, what other spending is the president willing to cut?""

If the sequester does happen, it's a given that the public will look for someone to blame while waiting in longer security lines at the airport. So whom are voters likely to punish?

It is true that sequestration was the Obama administration's idea. White House officials proposed it as part of the agreement that resolved the 2011 debt ceiling fight. It was meant to act as a spur to make a bipartisan supercommittee reach an agreement on a package of spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the national debt over time.

For fiscal policymakers, it was the equivalent of the Cold War's mutually assured destruction, or MAD, concept. The specter of fearsome damage to both sides kept the U.S. and the Soviet Union from launching nuclear war on each other. Likewise, the terrible prospect of the sequester was supposed to make wiser heads prevail. Of course, that presumed there were enough wiser heads for that strategy to work

Though Obama proposed the idea, it's unlike Obamacare — which received no GOP House votes. Indeed, 174 House Republicans, a majority of the majority, joined 95 Democrats to pass the plan in that body. So Republicans arguably own the sequester as much as Obama, if not more so, since Obama never wanted to link spending cuts to the debt ceiling.

But all of that is the kind of Washington process story that most voters most likely won't care about.

So, again, who is likeliest to get the blame if the sequester actually happens?

It's not clear.

Back in 2011 when fiscal policy disagreement between the White House and congressional Republicans threatened a partial federal government shutdown, the public appeared truly split, according to polling over which party would be at fault.

That was a far different situation than the mid-1990s, when the public blamed congressional Republicans more than then-President Bill Clinton for the government shutdowns of that era.

Obama would appear to have some advantages over congressional Republicans, however.

Unlike those in Congress, he's not running for re-election. Arguably, he can be relatively more fearless and take more risks when it comes to the public reaction than Republicans can.

Of course, congressional Democrats, especially in the Senate where the Democrats' majority is narrow and thus vulnerable, do face re-election. So for them, the longer this can stay a sequester fight largely between the president and Republicans, the better.

As the president showed again Tuesday, he also has the power of the bully pulpit. Because of the power of the presidency, he tends to draw more attention in Washington or when he takes his message on the road than Boehner and other congressional Republicans.

Also, for his entire presidency, Republicans have tried to define Obama as an evangelist for government (and its spending) and define themselves as against spending. So if the spending ax falls on March 1, many voters may find it easier to blame Republicans than Obama since the resulting spending reductions — especially in areas like education, research and infrastructure — will be more in line with GOP priorities than Obama's.

Of course, Republicans have argued that Obama is willing to accept those cuts because he also gets reduced defense spending. But Obama's constant warning against automatic cuts done with an ax and not a scalpel, as well as past Republican efforts to paint him as a big-spending liberal, could help inoculate him against such accusations.

While it's hard to say for sure which side the majority of Americans will ultimately come down on (many are clueless about the sequester, a recent poll found) many voters are likely to agree with Erskine Bowles about the unwise nature of the cuts, regardless of who gets the blame.

Bowles, the former Clinton White House chief of staff who, along with former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson, headed a famous commission whose 2010 deficit proposal went nowhere, was back in Washington Tuesday for the release of another proposal likely to meet a similar fate.

Speaking of the potential spending cuts from the sequester, Bowles said:"

Updated at 2:30 p.m. ET

In an effort to slow the nation's contribution to climate change, President Biden has signed an executive order to begin halting oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters.

The much-anticipated move is one of several executive actions the president took on Wednesday to address the worsening climate crisis and the broader decline of the natural world, but it won't come without pushback.

""Today is Climate Day at the White House, which means it's Jobs Day at the White House,"" Biden said at the top of his remarks, also citing the health and national security impact of climate change, which Biden called a ""maximum threat.""

The president said there is increased bipartisan concern about climate change, though many Republicans have criticized Biden's actions, claiming they will eliminate jobs. Biden emphasized work in agriculture and manufacturing to advance energy conservation. He also promised 1 million new jobs in the auto industry as federal agencies aim to lead on a transition to electric vehicles.

""We're not going to lose jobs in these areas; we're going to create jobs,"" he said.

On fossil fuel extraction, Biden addressed the pause in oil and gas leasing on federal lands. He also said, ""We're not going to ban fracking,"" which was a charge leveled at Biden by President Trump during the 2020 campaign.

Biden pledged that the plan will focus on disproportionate health, environmental and economic impact on communities of color and that 40% of federal benefits for clean air and water infrastructure will go to communities disproportionately affected by climate change.

""These aren't pie-in-the-sky dreams. These are concrete, actionable solutions,"" Biden said at a signing ceremony for the executive orders.

""It's not time for small measures. We need to be bold.""

According to White House officials, Biden is ordering the Department of the Interior to ""pause"" new oil and gas leasing on public land and offshore water ""to the extent possible"" and to review existing leasing and permitting practices ""related to fossil fuel development"" on the properties.

Oil and gas drilling on tribal land would not be barred by Biden's order.

National climate adviser Gina McCarthy and special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry addressed reporters to discuss the executive actions earlier in the afternoon, describing the threat of climate change as an ""existential"" threat to the globe.

McCarthy reiterated Biden's commitment to address climate change as one of four major interrelated crises that include COVID-19, the economic downturn and racial inequity.

""It is the policy of this administration that climate considerations shall be an essential element of U.S. foreign policy and national security,"" McCarthy said, quoting text Biden signed later, noting that Kerry will take the lead on climate in foreign policy and that she will lead domestic efforts with a new office established in the White House.

She and Kerry also addressed the economic impact at length, saying the administration is focused on creating jobs as part of the plan. McCarthy also said environmental justice and scientific integrity are priorities for the administration in these efforts.

Kerry spoke to the threats from climate change, noting that Biden rejoined the Paris climate agreement to address the issue as a global crisis, but also said that agreement is not enough. Kerry said the administration is pursuing a more aggressive target than was set in Paris ahead of a follow-up summit planned for Glasgow, Scotland, in November. This will be in addition to an April summit the United States is hosting.

The oil and gas industry, hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic, is expected to challenge the move, as are fossil-fuel rich Western states whose economies are closely linked to extractive industry on public lands.

Anticipating the move, Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, which represents oil and gas companies in many Western states, said: ""We'll be in court shortly thereafter.""

Fossil fuel extraction on federal lands generates billions of dollars in royalties and revenues for local and state economies. But it's also responsible for nearly a quarter of the country's total greenhouse gas emissions, and the Biden administration appears to be serious about cutting the country's outsized contribution to global warming.

During his first day in office, Biden recommitted the U.S. to the Paris climate agreement and revoked a permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would move crude oil from Canada to the U.S. He also ordered reviews of more than 100 of the Trump administration's environmental rollbacks.

""The climate and wildlife extinction crises demand this kind of bold, urgent action,"" said Kierán Suckling, executive director at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement.

The halt on new federal leasing is one of several executive actions Biden took Wednesday. The orders formally begin the process of implementing steps that Biden promised throughout his campaign for the White House.

In addition to the leasing order, Biden directed the Department of the Interior to conserve 30% of the nation's land and waters by the 2030 and to identify ways to double offshore wind production by that same deadline.

Biden has repeatedly framed climate change as one of the top threats facing the U.S. An order that the director of national intelligence produce reports on the security risks of changing weather patterns and temperatures will further formalize that view.

Biden also ordered federal agencies to examine how they can purchase zero-emission vehicles and electricity, and announced the date of a long-promised global summit meant to underscore that the United States has returned to the fold of nations working together to lower carbon emissions: April 22, which is Earth Day.

And Biden is also beginning the process of launching another major campaign promise: a Civilian Climate Corps, modeled after the New Deal's iconic national conservation project, that would work to sequester carbon emissions in the agricultural sector and create more green spaces across the country.

The shift in attitude toward climate change and its causes is among the starkest differences between the Biden administration and its predecessor. Over the last four years, the Trump administration minimized the role of climate change, shrinking protections for undeveloped landscapes and endangered species, while rolling back regulations on fossil fuel extraction. The administration opened up broad swaths of the country's roughly 640 million acres of public lands to development as part of its ""energy dominance"" agenda. The moves could cast a long shadow on Biden's climate goals.

An analysis by The Associated Press found that oil companies stockpiled leases and pushed through drilling permit applications on public lands in the waning months of the Trump administration, giving the industry a large inventory to work with.

Biden's halt on new oil and gas leasing also does nothing to affect activities on private or state lands, where roughly 90% of the country's oil and gas development occurs.

""The industry has a lot of leases in production, a lot of leases that have been issued, so it won't have an immediate impact. But it will give an immediate opportunity for the administration to think about how we move forward,"" said Nada Culver, the vice president of public lands at the National Audubon Society.

The law governing fossil fuel and mineral development on public lands is the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, Culver added. ""It's definitely time for more than a few tweaks,"" she said.

Last month, more than 500 environmental groups sent a letter to Biden's transition team with a draft executive order, asking the then president-elect to make good on his campaign promises and permanently ban new oil and gas leasing and permitting on federal lands and waters.

Last week, acting Interior Secretary Scott de la Vega signed an order to temporarily do just that for the next 60 days. Legal experts question whether a permanent ban would hold up in court.

""Ending permitting would be extremely difficult,"" said Rebecca Watson, who served as assistant secretary for lands and minerals management at the Department of the Interior under President George W. Bush. ""You have sold a property right, a lease, so you've paid for a lease and then you can't develop it. I think there would be lawsuits and, rightly so, over a move like that.""

A permanent leasing ban would also be subject to lawsuits, she said. Under the Mineral Leasing Act, the government is required to hold quarterly lease sales. The Biden administration could make fewer or all lands unavailable for leasing, but Watson thinks a court might find that illegal.

Mark Squillace, a law professor at the University of Colorado who worked at Interior under the Clinton and Carter administrations, agrees that a permanent ban would run into more problems than a temporary pause. But he thinks the administration can make a big statement with its immediate actions.

What the Biden administration does on public lands could be an example for states that have a lot of oil and gas development on private lands and depend on that development, he said.

""I'd really like to see an orderly ramping down of oil and gas development on public lands, recognizing that in 20 or 30 years we want to be in a really different place,"" he said.

Squillace points to the quick decline of the coal industry over the past decade as an example of what not to do. As energy companies moved more toward cheaper renewable energy sources and natural gas, coal-dependent communities in Appalachia and some Western towns saw their economic base deteriorate almost overnight.

Careful planning, he said, could avoid the same fate for places like Wyoming and New Mexico that have a similar dependence on oil and gas.

That approach would also mean a more gradual decline in climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, but the science is clear that sharp reductions need to happen immediately to avoid the most catastrophic climate change scenarios."
1503,1503,http://www.npr.org/2013/02/20/172485828/how-should-the-u-s-respond-to-chinese-hacking,1,"How Could The U.S. Respond To Chinese Hacking?

Enlarge this image toggle caption Carlos Barria/Reuters/Landov Carlos Barria/Reuters/Landov

If the Chinese military is regularly hacking into the computers of U.S. organizations, as an American security firm says, it raises all sorts of questions about how the U.S. should respond.

Is this a job for the military or the intelligence agencies? What role should diplomats and trade officials be playing?

The report issued this week by the IT security consultancy Mandiant says it has traced the hacking activity to the People's Liberation Army's Unit 61398, which has ""systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations.""

As NPR's Frank Langfitt reported, Unit 61398 is headquartered in a nondescript neighborhood in Shanghai's sprawling Pudong district.

The Chinese government has strongly denied the report, but in the U.S., there's been a widespread belief for years that the Chinese have been deeply involved in computer hacking.

Speaking to The Associated Press, Shawn Henry, who now heads security firm CrowdStrike, used a military analogy to describe the current situation.

""If the Chinese government flew planes into our airspace, our planes would escort them away,"" he said. ""If it happened two, three or four times, the president would be on the phone and there would be threats of retaliation.""

Mounting Evidence

Martin Libicki, a researcher at the RAND Corp., says while there's still no smoking gun, Beijing's denials have reached the level of ""implausible deniability."" Even so, he says the hacking can be viewed as essentially an illegal technology transfer.

""How damaging that is to the United States depends on how much the problem is costing us,"" he says. ""It's a policy decision on where you draw the line and why you want to draw the line,"" Libicki says.

It's difficult to estimate the cost to the U.S. Broad figures have been tossed around, ranging from as much as a trillion dollars, which would be ""huge,"" Libicki says, to maybe a billion dollars, which would put it ""very low on the list of issues between the United States and China.""

The allegation that the Chinese military may be playing a key role is a vestige of China's evolving economic system in which the government still has a central role promoting industry, he says.

""It may also be that a lot of the same techniques that it takes to steal secrets from Coca-Cola are the same techniques it takes to steal secrets from Lockheed,"" says Libicki. ""And Lockheed, of course, builds military equipment, the nature of which is probably of keen interest to the Chinese.""

A Well-Organized Operation

Richard Bejtlich, chief security officer at Mandiant, says the evidence in its report leaves little question about who is behind the spying.

""It's clear that this is not just a few people working in some basement, some patriotic hackers,"" he says. ""This is a military operation with defined goals, with schedules, with tasking. This is a whole new level of activity.""

Bejtlich says the U.S. government is ""well aware"" of the activity, but partly because of concerns about exposing intelligence resources and other secrecy concerns, has been reluctant to talk about it.

Christopher Johnson, who holds the Freeman chair in China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that while the Mandiant report may spur the Obama administration to action, the White House has been heading in that direction for some time.

""It's becoming so pervasive that there's a sense that it's time to do something about it,"" he says. ""One way or another, this [Mandiant report] puts tremendous salience on the issue and pressure on the U.S. government to do something about it.""

President And Pentagon Address Concerns

Mandiant's Bejtlich says at least some of the information China has garnered through its cybersleuthing program has military utility, and the report comes less than a month after the Pentagon announced it would dramatically expand its Cyber Command to defend against attacks and, if necessary, wage offensive operations.

And last week, the president issued an executive order to improve cybersecurity for critical infrastructure. He also even mentioned cybersecurity concerns in his State of the Union address last week.

Media reports in this country have linked the U.S. government to at least one high-profile cyberattack, the 2010 Stuxnet computer virus that hit networks associated with Iran's nuclear facilities.

So far, there's no evidence that China has done more than snoop, Bejtlich says. But he says it appears to be in a position to do much more.

""By virtue of having access they could just as easily delete information,"" he says. ""So this is an espionage problem now, but if they so decided to hold our assets at risk, they could choose to start destroying data, as we saw in Saudi Aramco last year.""

Some analysts say there is a key difference between the Cold War cloak-and-dagger between Washington and Moscow, and the current situation with Chinese spying.

""In the Cold War, the United States had a distinct advantage in the Soviet Union doing worse, and they had a distinct advantage in the United States doing worse,"" Libicki says. ""This is not true with the U.S. and China — we both have an interest in each other's economy doing better.""

Although the U.S. has offensive cyberwarfare capabilities, Libicki doesn't see the Pentagon and the U.S. intelligence community engaging in economic espionage on behalf of U.S. companies.

""If, for instance, we were able to take in information on Chery automobiles, a Chinese car company, who do we give it to? It turns out that to give it to GM and not Ford would not only look bad, but would probably set us up for lawsuits,"" he says.

And, as Johnson of the Center for Strategic and International Studies points out, there is an implied red line between economic espionage against U.S. companies and a cyberattack aimed at larger economic interests.

""In areas like key infrastructure, such as pipelines and power grids, I think even probing is out of bounds,"" he says. ""That's a message that we have been sending and presumably will continue to be sending to the Chinese and other governments."""

A global study of nearly 44,000 found that the COVID-19 vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson is 66% effective in preventing moderate to severe disease.

The study was conducted in the U.S., Latin America and South Africa. The vaccine did better at preventing disease in the U.S. – 72% — and less well in South Africa – 57% efficacy. The efficacy seen in Latin America was 66%.

The South African results are troubling because of the coronavirus variant spreading there that has now been detected in the U.S., raising concerns that the vaccines developed so far might not work as well against it.

The vaccine did demonstrate complete protection against COVID-19 serious enough to require hospitalization, according to a news release from the company. The vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe forms of the disease.

The company says it plans to apply to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization to distribute the vaccine.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is given as a single shot, unlike the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer that require two shots given weeks apart. Also, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine doesn't require ultracold storage.

""These topline results with a single-shot COVID-19 vaccine candidate represent a promising moment,"" said a statement by Dr. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer at Johnson & Johnson. ""A one-shot vaccine is considered by the World Health Organization to be the best option in pandemic settings, enhancing access, distribution and compliance."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Updated at 8:23 p.m. ET on Monday

A group of Republican senators met with President Biden on Monday evening to detail a smaller counterproposal to his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, an alternative they believe could be approved ""quickly by Congress with bipartisan support.""

Republican lawmakers reported an ""excellent"" discussion, while the White House said the president ""will not settle"" for a package that would ""leave the nation short of its pressing needs.""

The meeting lasted approximately two hours, after which Sen. Susan Collins of Maine reported a ""very productive"" and ""cordial"" conversation. She said there was no agreement reached, but that she is hopeful Congress can pass another relief package.

""What we did agree to do is to follow up and talk further at the staff level and amongst ourselves and with the president and vice president on how we can continue to work together on this very important issue,"" she told reporters at the White House. ""All of us are concerned about struggling families, teetering small businesses and overwhelmed health care system, getting vaccines out and into people's arms and strengthening our economy and addressing the public health crisis that we face.""

In a statement, the White House also called the meeting ""productive,"" but also said the president ""reiterated his view that Congress must respond boldly and urgently, and noted many areas which the Republican senators' proposal does not address.""

The president ""will not slow down work on this urgent crisis response, and will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment,"" the statement read.

The White House had said the meeting would focus on how Biden's plan ""will deliver urgently needed relief to working families and small businesses, and speed up vaccinations and the reopening of schools.""

""We appreciate the President's quick response to our letter, and we are pleased to accept his invitation to the White House ... to discuss the path forward for the sixth bipartisan COVID-19 relief package,"" the 10 senators said in a statement.

The outreach from more moderate GOP lawmakers came as many Democrats look to a process called budget reconciliation, which would potentially enable Democrats to approve the president's plan without any Republican support.

""We recognize your calls for unity and want to work in good faith with your Administration to meet the health, economic, and societal challenges of the COVID crisis,"" the GOP senators wrote in the original letter, dated Sunday.

Republicans have balked at the price tag of Biden's $1.9 trillion package, especially coming weeks after then-President Donald Trump signed a $900 billion relief measure into law. The proposal from the 10 lawmakers is estimated to cost $618 billion.

That 10 Republicans signed on is notable because that's the number that would be needed to combine with Senate Democrats' 50-person caucus to reach the 60-vote, filibuster-proof threshold to pass legislation under regular Senate rules.

""We're certainly open to input from anywhere where we can find a constructive idea to make this package as effective as possible, but the president is uncompromising when it comes to the speed that we need to act at to address this crisis,"" Brian Deese, Biden's top economic adviser, told CNN's State of the Union on Sunday.

On Friday, Biden himself told reporters at the White House: ""I support passing COVID relief with support from Republicans if we can get it. But the COVID relief has to pass.""

In the letter Sunday, the senators note that earlier COVID-19 relief packages passed with bipartisan support and that their proposal includes some elements similar to those in Biden's plan, including allocating $160 billion for vaccine development and distribution, testing and tracing, and personal protective equipment.

""Our proposal also includes economic relief for those Americans with the greatest need, providing more targeted assistance than in the Administration's plan,"" the letter reads. ""We propose an additional round of economic impact payments for those families who need assistance the most, including their dependent children and adults.""

Their plan calls for $220 billion for a new round of direct payments, with $1,000 sent to individuals making under $40,000 a year and $500 for dependent adults and children. Individuals making over $50,000 and couples making over $100,000 would be ineligible for direct payments.

The plan also calls for $132 billion for unemployment benefits, with $300 per week through the end of June, as opposed to Biden's plan to continue the benefit through September.

Notably, it does not mention state and local aid, which was a key sticking point in past rounds of relief negotiations. Biden's package includes $350 billion in emergency funding for state and local governments.

The letter was also signed by Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Todd Young of Indiana, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Rob Portman of Ohio, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Mitt Romney of Utah, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia.

Democrats prepare for budget reconciliation

On Monday, the same day House Democrats also introduced resolution that will lay the groundwork for going through a reconciliation process.

""By the end of the week, we will be finished with the budget resolution, which will be about reconciliation, if needed,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters last week. ""I hope we don't need it. But if we need it, we will have it.""

Separately, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on Thursday that Democrats' ""preference"" is for the relief efforts to be bipartisan.

""But if our Republican colleagues decide to oppose this urgent and necessary legislation,"" Schumer said, ""we will have to move forward without them.""

He added that ""we must not repeat the same mistake"" of 12 years ago when Democrats agreed to a stimulus many considered too small in order to gain Republican support.

""The dangers of undershooting our response are far greater than overshooting it,"" Schumer said. ""We should have learned the lesson, from 2008 and 2009, when Congress was too timid and constrained in its response to the global financial crisis and it took years — years — for the economy to get out of recession.""

With the thinnest possible majority in the Senate, Democrats have essentially two options to try to pass Biden's coronavirus relief package without bipartisan support.

The first would be to kill the legislative filibuster, but at least two Democratic senators have pledged to oppose such a move to blow up the rules of the upper chamber.

The second option for Democrats is to use reconciliation, a process that has been used for the Affordable Care Act and the GOP tax cuts Trump signed into law. The process can be lengthy — and complicated — but would allow Senate Democrats to pass legislation with a simple majority vote without eliminating the filibuster.

But Senate Republicans have warned that using this process to avoid needing to garner their votes could be damaging.

Portman, who signed the letter to the White House, recently cautioned the Biden administration and congressional Democrats against moving forward on the new round of relief legislation without GOP support, saying doing so ""poisons the well.""

""My hope is that we won't go down this path of trying to circumvent the supermajority and just jam something through,"" Portman told NPR's Susan Davis. ""I think that would set the tone for the administration that would be really problematic for the country and, frankly, bad for the Biden administration.""

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has warned that the automatic spending cuts due to hit the Pentagon and other branches of government next week will damage U.S. national security.

In a letter to Congress, he said those cuts would put the military on a path toward a ""hollow force."" But the warnings don't appear to be moving the needle with lawmakers or the American public.

The automatic spending cuts don't officially take effect until March 1, but they are already being felt. As President Obama noted this week, the Navy has decided not to send one of its aircraft carriers on a scheduled deployment to the Persian Gulf.

""As our military leaders have made clear, changes like this — not well-thought through, not phased in properly — changes like this affect our ability to respond to threats in unstable parts of the world,"" he said.

No Agreed-Upon Path

At one time, idling an aircraft carrier to save money would have been unthinkable. The White House thought that prospect would be so alarming to congressional Republicans that they'd never allow the automatic spending cuts to take effect.

Some Republicans are alarmed. House Speaker John Boehner calls the military cuts ""devastating."" But Congressional expert Sarah Binder of the Brookings Institution says the GOP is no longer united when it comes to protecting the Pentagon.

""There's a defense wing of defense hawks, and they've been pretty vocal about the impact on the Defense Department and national security, generally,"" she said. ""And we know there's a hard-core group as well that's opposed to any and all revenue increases.

""And between the two of those, there's no agreed-upon path of what to do, and so it looks like they may prefer the sequester to any alternative — certainly the alternatives the Democrats are offering up.""

Public Unmoved

Obama is trying to enlist the public's help. He did a series of local TV interviews Wednesday, and he's planning to visit a military community outside Washington, D.C., next week. White House spokesman Jay Carney says the idea is to ramp up pressure on lawmakers to suspend the automatic cuts.

""The fact of the matter is, congressional Republicans are going to listen to the American people,"" Carney said.

But the American people aren't necessarily convinced that cutting the Pentagon budget is a bad idea.

Last year, the Stimson Center in Washington, along with the Center for Public Integrity and the Program for Public Consultation, asked people how they'd like to address the federal deficit: by raising taxes, reducing defense spending or cutting other parts of the government.

The more that Americans learn about their defense budget, the more aware they become that not everything is equal. When you have a chance to really grapple with the material on your own, you perhaps feel more comfortable in saying, 'I'm prepared to prioritize this issue and accept more risk over here.'

Matt Leatherman of the Stimson Center says nearly two-thirds opted for defense cuts.

""Defense spending was an area that respondents seemed to feel especially comfortable with reductions,"" he said. ""There were some partisan splits, but I would point out that both Republicans and Democrats were comfortable reducing the defense budget.""

Threat Of Sequestration

Other polls by Gallup, Harris and the Pew Research Center produced similar findings. The Stimson Center survey was unusual in that people taking the poll were given information about the workings of the Pentagon budget.

""The more that Americans learn about their defense budget, the more aware they become that not everything is equal,"" Leatherman says. ""When you have a chance to really grapple with the material on your own, you perhaps feel more comfortable in saying, 'I'm prepared to prioritize this issue and accept more risk over here.' ""

Leatherman says that doesn't mean Americans are comfortable with the kind of indiscriminate cuts to defense spending set to take effect next week. But it does suggest the Pentagon is far from a sacred cow.

That could be put to the test if lawmakers can't make a deal to avoid across-the-board cuts. Congressional scholar Binder notes that those cuts were agreed to in 2011 as a way to postpone the pain of political gridlock. Nineteen months later, the gridlock hasn't gone away.

""They set up the can, they kind of set it up to explode, and sure enough, this looks like one of the few times it's actually going to go off,"" she says."

Comprehensive immigration reform seems to top everyone's legislative wish list this year, and bills are already taking shape in the White House and the Democratic-led Senate.

A bipartisan group of senators recently laid out a path to citizenship for millions living in the country unlawfully. Less clear is where the Republican-led House is headed on immigration.

The man charged with drafting the House immigration bill is Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia.

Goodlatte's district is home to Roanoke, Va., a tidy city of nearly 100,000 between the Allegheny and Blue Ridge mountains. In recent years, immigrants from more than 70 nations have settled there and elsewhere in the Shenandoah Valley — some working in apple orchards, many others in poultry-processing plants and still others in construction or the restaurant business.

Diverging Views

At a gathering this week in downtown Roanoke, local business people offer varied views when asked what should happen with the millions of immigrants who are in the country unlawfully.

""We use Mexicans in our work,"" says building contractor Ed Toomey, ""and, you know, they're fine people. But there has to be a law. They have to abide by the rules, like everybody else.""

Realtor Cindy Sanchez says it's not for her ""to judge them.""

""The people that I come across, I know they're here because they want a better life for their family,"" she says.

Mike Sutton, a real estate agent who favors some form of amnesty, calls it ""a tough issue.""

""But I would like to see ways that we could figure out how to get them — go through some steps to make them legal,"" he says.

During the gathering, the business people are joined by another local — Goodlatte, who is well-known, having represented this district for more than two decades.

Closing The Door On A Path To Citizenship

When the Republican conservative and former immigration lawyer sits down for an interview to discuss the bill he aims to produce, he makes one thing clear: He is against a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants.

""This is a broken immigration system; it's had problems for a long time,"" he says. ""And work needs to be done, both in terms of reforming legal immigration programs and in terms of enforcing our immigration laws and addressing what happens to the 10 million or more people who are not lawfully in the United States.""

Goodlatte says this is a nation of immigrants, but it is also a nation of laws.

""People have a pathway to citizenship right now: It's to abide by the immigration laws, and if they have a family relationship, if they have a job skill that allows them to do that, they can obtain citizenship,"" Goodlatte says. ""But simply someone who broke the law, came here, [to] say, 'I'll give you citizenship now,' that I don't think is going to happen.""

It annoys Goodlatte that President Obama has been weighing in on the immigration debate.

""I think the president should calm down, back off and let the Congress do its work,"" he says.

What's really required to get an immigration bill, he says, is bipartisan cooperation.

""If people start prescribing or prejudging how we're going to find that common ground in the middle, he's going to simply not have a bill,"" Goodlatte says.

One Priority: Guest Workers

A top objective for Goodlatte is to expand a guest-worker program for immigrant-labor-dependent U.S. agriculture, should millions already here illegally be allowed to stay.

""You're going to have to have a program that assures those farms and those processing plants that there will be workers,"" he says. ""Because if you give them legal status, they can work anywhere in the United States — they're not going to necessarily work at the hardest, toughest, dirtiest jobs.""

Those who have watched Goodlatte over the years say he should have considerable political leeway at home for drafting an immigration bill.

""I don't think immigration is a real core issue in this district,"" says Harry Wilson, a political scientist at Roanoke College, ""so I don't think it's a do-or-die issue for him. [It] may be one of some importance, but it's not one where he's likely to lose the next election based on what he does.""

But it would appear that even in Goodlatte's mostly rural, mountain-bound district, people do want him to do something about an immigration system that all agree is broken."

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

Updated at 4:58 p.m. ET

A deeply divided Supreme Court doubled down on religious rights late Friday, ruling that California can no longer continue with a ban on indoor church services put in place to fight to the coronavirus pandemic. But the court said that the state, for now, can keep in place restrictions on singing and chanting inside.

The two cases at the center of Friday's ruling marked a test of how far states can go to safeguard public health before running afoul of constitutional protections for the free exercise of religion. In response to suits brought by the South Bay United Pentecostal Church in Chula Vista and the Harvest Rock Church in Pasadena, the court said California cannot bar in-person services altogether, but can limit attendance to 25% of capacity.

Last year the high court, by a 5-to-4 vote, upheld such bans in California and elsewhere. But with the arrival of new Justice Amy Coney Barrett in place of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the balance of power on the question switched, and this latest order is fresh evidence of the court's willingness to second-guess both epidemiologists and elected officials who are fighting a once-in-a-century pandemic when it comes to questions of religious liberty.

The churches argued that California violated their religious rights when the state moved last year to place limits on attendance at in-person worship services based on COVID-19 infection rates. In the hardest-hit areas of the state, in-person services were put on hold completely. So too was singing and chanting inside, given that the coronavirus is not only more transmissible in enclosed spaces, but that singing releases tiny droplets that carry the virus through the air.

Though the conservative wing of the court prevailed decisively in the case Friday night, it was sharply split, with the conservative justices filing four separate opinions. In a concurring opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that federal courts owe ""significant deference"" to state officials when it comes to matters of public health, but he said such deference can only go so far.

""The State has concluded, for example, that singing indoors poses a heightened risk of transmitting COVID–19. I see no basis in this record for overriding that aspect of the state public health framework,"" wrote Roberts. ""At the same time, the State's present determination — that the maximum number of adherents who can safely worship in the most cavernous cathedral is zero — appears to reflect not expertise or discretion, but instead insufficient appreciation or consideration of the interests at stake.""

The chief justice's opinion marked a middle ground of sorts among the court's conservatives. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas said they would have lifted California's restrictions in full. While acknowledging that the state has a ""compelling interest"" in reducing the spread of COVID-19, they said California had effectively given preferential treatment to ""lucrative industries"" such as the film industry, adding that the state had ""openly imposed more stringent regulations on religious institutions than on many businesses.""

""If Hollywood may host a studio audience or film a singing competition while not a single soul may enter California's churches, synagogues, and mosques, something has gone seriously awry,"" they wrote in an opinion that was joined by Justice Samuel Alito.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in her first signed opinion since joining the court in October, focused on the state's restrictions on singing and chanting. In an opinion joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Barrett said that it was up to churches to demonstrate that they were entitled to relief from the singing ban, but that in this case, they had not. Still, she said, it remains unsettled as to whether the ban applies evenly across the board in California or if it favors certain sectors.

""Of course, if a chorister can sing in a Hollywood studio but not in her church, California's regulations cannot be viewed as neutral,"" Barrett said.

Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan said they would have left California's restrictions in place. In a stinging dissent for the three, Kagan noted that none of the justices is a scientist, and she accused the majority of substituting its own judgment for the epidemiologists and elected officials who are ""desperately trying to slow the spread of a deadly disease."" Kagan disputed the notion that the state is somehow treating religious institutions worse than secular entities. The only secular conduct the state treats better, she said, ""is the kind that its experts have found does not imperil"" the battle against the pandemic.

""I cannot imagine that any of us [on the court] has delved into the scientific research on how COVID spreads, or studied the strategies for containing it,"" she said. ""So it is alarming that the court second guesses the judgments of expert officials and displaces their conclusions with its own. ... In the worst public health crisis in a century, this foray into armchair epidemiology cannot end well.""

Friday's orders appeared to further cement the shift in the court's view on the issue following the death of Justice Ginsburg. Twice before Ginsburg's death in September, the court voted to allow similar restrictions on attendance at church services put in place by California and Nevada, with Chief Justice Roberts joining the court's liberal members in the majority. In November, with Barrett on the court, the justices ruled 5-4 to block New York from enforcing strict limits on attendance limits on places of worship in coronavirus hot spots."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Senate TV via AP Senate TV via AP

Updated at 2:31 p.m. ET

The House quickly approved a budget resolution intended to speed the drafting of President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.

The Senate approved the same budget resolution early Friday morning. With the Senate evenly divided, Vice President Harris cast the tiebreaking vote.

Democrats are planning to use a feature of the budget process called reconciliation to pass the legislation with a simple majority in the Senate, meaning it could be approved entirely along party lines. The process is expected to last weeks and key components face calls for changes, including how to distribute another round of direct payments.

On Friday, Biden said he does not think congressional Republicans were prepared to deal quickly enough with his economic proposal and said he and Democrats would move quickly to deliver the aid.

""They're just not willing to go as far as I think we need to go,"" Biden said, noting that he had wanted to work with Republicans on the package but was not willing to delay. He said that GOP lawmakers have ""suddenly rediscovered"" fiscal restraint and concerns about the deficit and that too many are opposed to any spending or won't agree to a big enough package.

The next step is for House and Senate committees to begin drafting legislation using Biden's proposal as a framework. Biden is calling for spending to include money for vaccine distribution, upgrades to hospitals and schools, $1,400 stimulus checks for most Americans and expanded pandemic unemployment aid.

The process of writing the legislative text may take weeks and will require Senate Democrats to find unanimous agreement on every element. They have a slim majority in the House, but the even split in the Senate provides a significant challenge.

While Democrats generally agree on many of the principles in Biden's proposal, they have yet to confront internal disagreements about some of the details. Not all Democrats have embraced Biden's call for a $15 federal minimum wage. Democrats also disagree on elements of other policies, like a plan to forgive some federal student loan debt and efforts to tie federal unemployment benefits to the average national unemployment rate.

The Senate process took several days — Harris arrived to break the tie on the resolution shortly after 5:30 a.m. following an all-night ""vote-a-rama,"" which brought hours of votes on dozens of amendments, many intended to force legislators to take a public stand on unrelated controversial issues.

Some amendments that passed overnight in the Senate expressed support for policies or provided specific allowances and suggestions that committees address hot-button issues. For example, there was unanimous support for allowing committees to prevent tax hikes on small businesses during a public health emergency. Other bipartisan amendments allowed committees to consider tighter income requirements for future stimulus checks and suggested establishing grants for bars and restaurants.

These amendments are mostly nonbinding and simply send a message of priorities to the committees that will write the final legislation.

The amendments also give a glimpse of the ways GOP lawmakers will campaign against any final legislation — and also some lines of attack for the 2022 midterm elections. Republicans oppose the size of Biden's proposal and have offered a smaller alternative. The president said he ""will not settle"" on his pandemic relief bill.

""I'm going to act. I'm going to act fast,"" Biden reiterated on Friday. If forced to choose between acting quickly or finding bipartisan compromise, Biden said: ""That's an easy choice – I'm going to help the American people who are hurting – now.""

Biden made his remarks after a ""good but very long meeting"" with House Democrats. Joined by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, he said the January jobs numbers showed the U.S. economy ""is still in trouble"" and said coronavirus caseloads showed ""we're still in the teeth of this pandemic.""

""I see enormous pain in this country, a lot of folks out of work,"" he said. ""A lot of folks are losing hope.""

Reconciliation can be controversial though both parties have used the process to pass major legislation. In 2017, Republicans used it to enact a massive tax bill. In 2009, Democrats used it to pass part of the health care law. There have also been bipartisan reconciliation packages.

The process does not guarantee success. Republicans failed in 2017 to use reconciliation to repeal the Affordable Care Act after internal differences split the party.

The final package will also be subject to complex Senate budgetary restrictions, called the Byrd Rule. That requires that all elements of a reconciliation package be budgetary in nature. It also cannot make changes to Social Security.

The House and Senate must pass identical bills before they send it to Biden.

Democrats want to complete this process by March 14, when current enhanced unemployment assistance benefits expire.

Updated on Saturday at 6:20 p.m. ET: The video for this event has ended.

Donald Trump's historic second impeachment trial came to a close on Saturday, with Democrats falling short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict the former president.

The final vote was 57 to 43. Seven Republicans joined with all of the chamber's Democrats and independents to vote to convict.

Trump faced a single impeachment charge, incitement of an insurrection, for his role in urging a mob to attack the Capitol complex on Jan. 6.

The Senate began the trial Tuesday, a little more than a month after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. Senators voted 56-44 that the trial was in fact constitutional, even though Trump has already left office.

The House of Representatives voted on Jan. 13 to impeach Trump for incitement of insurrection with just a week left in his term, charging that he caused the riot that endangered hundreds of lawmakers and left five people dead, including a police officer. Two more police officers killed themselves in the days following the riot.

Trump has denied responsibility for stoking the mob on Jan. 6. His lawyers claim that he did not encourage unlawful acts and that his comments to supporters that day are protected by the First Amendment. They also argue that he should not be on trial at all, as he is no longer president — though many constitutional experts disagree.

As Congress began counting the Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, Trump called for his supporters to walk to the Capitol in protest of the election results. Trump falsely claimed the election had been ""stolen,"" despite his clear loss to now-President Biden.

""You'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated,"" he said. ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.""

Hours later, multiple people were dead, the Capitol building was in a state of chaos, and still, Biden's election victory was certified by Congress.

House impeachment managers dissected those remarks and others made by Trump in the months prior to argue that his false election claims laid the groundwork for the violence far before that particular rally.

The reviews are coming in for the bipartisan budget deal crafted by Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray and as the Los Angeles Times says, the package seems to have ""something for everyone to dislike.""

""It won't cut federal spending or shrink the national debt, so conservative Republicans don't like it,"" the Times says, and ""it won't restore much money for domestic programs or extend unemployment insurance, so Democrats don't like it either. Its main virtue is that it will spare members of Congress from worrying about a government shutdown during their long Christmas break.""

On 'Morning Edition': NPR's Tamara Keith reports on the budget deal Listen

On 'Morning Edition': Sen. Patty Murray speaks with Steve Inskeep Listen · 5:01 5:01

Basically, adds The Washington Post, ""the deal denies both Republicans and Democrats what they want most. Republicans didn't get any changes to Medicare and Social Security — much less any structural ones. Democrats didn't get any new taxes.""

On Morning Edition, NPR's Tamara Keith summed up the agreement this way:

""The deal ... would set the federal budget at just about $1 trillion this year and next. It would replace a big chunk of the sequester cuts with other trims and increased fees. And that's pretty much it.""

In other words, Tamara said, Murray and Ryan went ""small"" instead of going for a ""grand bargain.""

Of course, if one side had come out of the Ryan-Murray negotiations claiming victory, that might have doomed the plan's chances for passage by both the Republican-controlled House and Democratic-led Senate. On the question of whether the agreement will be OK'd by both chambers, The National Journal writes that ""Ryan may face the most immediate challenge, meeting behind closed doors Wednesday morning to explain the agreement to skeptical House conservatives.""

It adds, though, that:

""Ryan, whom conservatives describe as the most highly respected member of the House GOP when it comes to fiscal matters, seems up to the task of selling the deal. He repeatedly framed the agreement as 'conservative' on Tuesday, emphasizing at the outset: 'It reduces the deficit without raising taxes.' ... ""At one point, Ryan seemed to speak directly to his House GOP colleagues, perhaps previewing the pitch he'll make to them at Wednesday morning's conference meeting. "" 'As a conservative, I think this is a step in the right direction,' Ryan said. 'What am I getting out of this? I'm getting more deficit reduction. The deficit will go down more by passing this than if we did nothing. That's point No. 1. Point No. 2 is, there are no tax increases here. Point No. 3: We're finally starting to deal with autopilot spending, that mandatory spending that has not been addressed by Congress for years.' ""

(This post was last updated at 9:27 a.m. ET.)

The skies were gray over Johannesburg this morning. And the rain was relentless.

Still, tens of thousands of South Africans and more than 90 world leaders gathered at the largest soccer stadium in South Africa to pay tribute to the country's emancipator and its former president, the late Nelson Mandela, who died on Thursday at age 95.

The speakers on the program spanned the globe and political ideology. As NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton told Morning Edition, while it was billed as a memorial service, the proceedings were ""clearly a celebration of life.""

""It was a memorial, but it was almost a thanksgiving as well,"" Ofeibea said. ""I think people are so grateful to what Nelson Mandela and his generation of freedom fighters did to liberate South Africa.""

Andrew Mlangeni, one of only three surviving defendants at the Rivonia treason trial that sent Mandela and his anti-apartheid colleagues to prison for 27 years, opened the service by recalling Mandela as an ""incomparable force of leadership"" who ""illuminated the way in our nation's darkest hour.""

""It would be in our collective wisdom ... to uphold the values of Nelson Mandela,"" Mlangeni said.

SABC's Live Coverage YouTube

President Obama delivered a well-received 20-minute eulogy that compared Mandela to Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln and America's founding fathers.

Mandela, Obama said, was the ""last great liberator of the 20th century."" He was not only a man of politics, but a pragmatist and a flawed human being who managed to discipline his anger to turn centuries of oppression into what Mandela liked to call a ""Rainbow Nation.""

""It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the jailer as well; to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion, generosity and truth,"" Obama said. ""He changed laws, but he changed also hearts.""

Obama attended the memorial along with President George W. Bush, President Bill Clinton, President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

In the stands at FNB Stadium and at venues across the country that set up big TV screens showing the service, there was much music and South Africans swayed and danced with their umbrellas.

NPR's Gregory Warner said while the mood was celebratory, the weather likely kept many people home.

Gregory spoke to one man, however, who said that seeing how Mandela spent 27 years in prison, he could afford to survive one day in the rain to celebrate Mandela's life.

As the four-hour memorial wrapped up, talk turned to the future.

Bishop Ivan Abrahams recalled the story of Elijah, who is recognized by the Christian, Muslim and Jewish faiths as a great prophet.

Facing the end of his time on Earth, Elijah approaches the river Jordan, according to scripture. He rolls up his mantle and strikes the water, which opens up and suddenly a chariot fire and horse appears and Elijah is lifted.

Then Elijah's mantle falls to the ground and is taken by a younger disciple called Elisha, who asked Elijah before his departure to inherit him a ""double portion of your spirit.""

""The mantle is passed on and it is in your hands,"" Abrahams told the gathering. We have to remember, he added, that ""people like Madiba do not die, rather they continue to live in people's heart.""

Mandela's body will lie in state at the seat of government in Pretoria from Wednesday through Friday. Mandela will be buried Sunday in Quno in the Eastern Cape.

We've embedded live coverage by SABC, South Africa's public broadcaster, at the side of this post.

We also live blogged the service so if you want a play-by-play keep reading. Our earlier updates follow.

Update at 9:06 a.m. ET. A Roaring Blessing:

Delivering a short, but roaring blessing, Cape Town's Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, exhorted South Africans to show the same kind of discipline that Mandela showed during his life.

""We promise God we're going to follow the example of Nelson Mandela,"" Tutu said to wrap up the service.

Update at 8:48 a.m. ET. The Mantle Is Passed On:

The program has started to wrap up with a sermon from Bishop Ivan Abrahams, who called Mandela ""a beacon of light, a lone star.""

Abrahams then turned to the future. He recalled the story of Elijah — which is recognized by the Christian, Muslim and Jewish faiths — who made a great effort to preach the worship of Yahweh over the Phoenician god Baal.

According to scripture, facing the end of his time on Earth, Elijah approaches the river Jordan. He rolls up his mantle and strikes the water, which opens up and suddenly a chariot fire appears and Elijah is lifted.

Just then Elijah's mantle falls to the ground and is taken by a younger disciple called Elisha, who before his departure asked Elijah to inherit him a ""double portion of your spirit.""

""The mantle is passed on and it is in your hands,"" Abrahams said.

We have to remember, said Abrahams, that ""people like Madiba do not die, rather they continue to live in people's heart.""

Update at 8:18 a.m. ET. A Foundation For Transformation:

""Beyond reconcilliation, Madiba laid a firm foundation for transformation,"" President Jacob Zuma said.

What he means is that Mandela accomplished something very concrete: The racist laws that were part of the Apartheid system were repealed. But Mandela did more than that — he set the stage for healing, Zuma said.

He used Mandela's 1995 Rugby World Cup appearance, which was dramatized in the 2009 film Invictus, as an example of how the late leader made reconciliation real.

Update at 7:57 a.m. ET. Zuma Booed Again:

As he was preparing to give his speech, President Jacob Zuma was booed very loudly.

Lydia Polgreen, The New York Times' Johannesburg bureau chief, tweets that the boos were so loud, organizers switched to music and put Mandela's image back on the screens.

Polgreen called it a ""wrenching moment.""

""I guess the strategy is to shame the crowd into silence with Mandela's image,"" Polgreen tweeted.

Zuma has now moved on to his speech, and the crowd seems to be listening.

Update at 7:51 a.m. ET. Unrelenting Rain:

NPR's Gregory Warner just checked in with Morning Edition from outside the stadium. He said the rain has been unrelenting.

While the mood has been celebratory, Gregory said, the weather has likely kept many people home.

Gregory did speak to one man who told him that Mandela has spent 27 years in prison, so he could do one day in the rain to celebrate his life.

Update at 7:41 a.m. ET. Obama's Full Speech:

We've added a separate post with full text and audio of Obama's eulogy.

Update at 6:51 a.m. ET. The Last Great Liberator:

President Obama remembered Nelson Mandela as the ""last great liberator of the 20th century.""

He talked about Mandela's legend and compared him to Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln and America's founding fathers.

But Obama also lingered on Mandela as a human and a pragmatist. Here's a particularly moving excerpt from his speech:

""Madiba disciplined his anger; and channeled his desire to fight into organization, and platforms, and strategies for action, so men and women could stand-up for their God-given dignity. Moreover, he accepted the consequences of his actions, knowing that standing up to powerful interests and injustice carries a price. ... ""Mandela taught us the power of action, but also ideas; the importance of reason and arguments; the need to study not only those you agree with, but those who you don't. He understood that ideas cannot be contained by prison walls, or extinguished by a sniper's bullet. He turned his trial into an indictment of apartheid because of his eloquence and passion, but also his training as an advocate. He used decades in prison to sharpen his arguments, but also to spread his thirst for knowledge to others in the movement. And he learned the language and customs of his oppressor so that one day he might better convey to them how their own freedom depend upon his. ""Mandela demonstrated that action and ideas are not enough; no matter how right, they must be chiseled into laws and institutions. He was practical, testing his beliefs against the hard surface of circumstance and history. On core principles he was unyielding, which is why he could rebuff offers of conditional release, reminding the Apartheid regime that, ""prisoners cannot enter into contracts."" But as he showed in painstaking negotiations to transfer power and draft new laws, he was not afraid to compromise for the sake of a larger goal. And because he was not only a leader of a movement, but a skillful politician, the Constitution that emerged was worthy of this multiracial democracy; true to his vision of laws that protect minority as well as majority rights, and the precious freedoms of every South African. ""Finally, Mandela understood the ties that bind the human spirit. There is a word in South Africa- Ubuntu - that describes his greatest gift: his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that can be invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us. We can never know how much of this was innate in him, or how much of was shaped and burnished in a dark, solitary cell. But we remember the gestures, large and small - introducing his jailors as honored guests at his inauguration; taking the pitch in a Springbok uniform; turning his family's heartbreak into a call to confront HIV/AIDS - that revealed the depth of his empathy and understanding. He not only embodied Ubuntu; he taught millions to find that truth within themselves. It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the jailor as well; to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion, generosity and truth. He changed laws, but he changed also hearts.""

Update at 6:32 a.m. ET. 'A Life Like No Other':

President Obama thanks the people of South Africa for sharing Mandela — who he says lived a ""life like no other"" with the world.

""His struggle was your struggle,"" Obama said. ""His triumph was your triumph. Your dignity and hope found expression in his life, and your freedom, your democracy, is his cherished legacy.""

Update at 6:31 a.m. ET. Obama Now Speaking:

Obama has now taken the podium and will deliver a eulogy.

Update at 6:17 a.m. ET. About The Boos:

NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports that many of the boos you may have heard directed at President Zuma are coming from people in one section of the stadium who are wearing red.

Ofeibea says they are the ""Economic Freedom Fighters,"" a group who broke from the ruling African National Congress, which was also Mandela's party.

On its website, the group bills itself as a ""radical and militant economic emancipation movement.""

Update at 6:07 a.m. ET. Influence Reached Across The Planet:

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said Mandela's influence extended a ""deep root that reached across the planet.""

There is no better testament to his influence and fight for equality, than this stadium today.

""We are here,"" he said. ""All are united.""

Ban said when South Africa held elections in 1994, the first time black South Africans were able to cast a ballot, it marked a ""triumph for the ideals of the United Nations"" and a ""victory for everyone who has faced the poison of prejudice.""

Congressional negotiators announced Tuesday that they'd reached a budget proposal to restore about $65 billion worth of sequestration cuts in exchange for cuts elsewhere and additional fees.

If approved by both the House and Senate, the plan — hammered out by Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington — would avoid another government shutdown on Jan. 15.

Speaking at a news conference Tuesday evening, Ryan said the budget plan doesn't raise taxes and that it's a ""step in the right direction.""

He said he sees the deal passing in the GOP-controlled House.

""What am I getting out of this? I'm getting more deficit reduction. So the deficit will go down more by passing this than if we did nothing,"" he said.

Murray said: ""We have broken through the partisanship and gridlock"" that could have caused another government shutdown.

President Obama called the proposal a ""good first step,"" but he urged Congress to extend federal unemployment benefits past their expiration at the end of the calendar year.

However, three powerful conservative lobby groups, FreedomWorks, Heritage Action and CATO, have all said recently that they don't approve of the emerging deal.

The Tea Party Express, which calls itself the nation's largest Tea Party political action committee, said the deal announced Tuesday was disappointing.

""If the Sequestration was a baby step forward, this is a baby step backward,"" Chairman Amy Kremer said in a statement. ""Americans deserve better than a compromise that continues excessive spending, adding fees in lieu of taxes.""

A statement from Murray's office says the two-year deal would ""set overall discretionary spending for the current fiscal year at $1.012 trillion—about halfway between the Senate budget level of $1.058 trillion and the House budget level of $967 billion.""

""The agreement would provide $63 billion in sequester relief over two years, split evenly between defense and non-defense programs. In fiscal year 2014, defense discretionary spending would be set at $520.5 billion, and non-defense discretionary spending would be set at $491.8 billion.""

The Associated Press writes:

""Officials said the increases would be offset by a variety of spending reductions and increased fees elsewhere in the budget totaling about $85 billion over a decade, enough for a largely symbolic cut of roughly $20 billion in the nation's $17 trillion debt.""

The Washington Post wrote earlier:

""Senior aides familiar with the talks have said the emerging agreement aims to raise agency spending to roughly $1.015 trillion in fiscal 2014 and 2015. That would bring agency budgets up to the target already in place for fiscal 2016. ""Republican leaders were also seeking additional savings [to] reduce deficits projected to exceed $6 trillion over the next decade. But the deal is not expected to trim the debt, which is now larger, as a percentage of the economy, than at any point in U.S. history except during World War II.""

According to the AP:

""The bipartisan push for a budget agreement stems from automatic cuts that are themselves the consequence of divided government's ability to complete a sweeping deficit reduction package in 2011."" ""If left in place, the reductions would carve $91 billion from the day-to-day budgets of the Pentagon and domestic agencies when compared with spending limits set by the hard-fought 2011 budget agreement."" ""Support for a deal to ease the reductions is strongest in Congress among defense hawks in both houses and both parties who fear the impact on military readiness from a looming $20 billion cut in Pentagon spending.""

FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe said in a statement before the news conference on Tuesday: ""It's disingenuous for Republicans to surrender the only real spending reforms [sequestration] accomplished under the Obama Administration, and call that a deal.

""Immediate spending and revenue hikes without long-term reforms to spending and entitlement programs isn't a deal, it's just another manufactured, govern-by-crisis shakedown."""

""For pulling the papacy out of the palace and into the streets, for committing the world's largest faith to confronting its deepest needs and for balancing judgment with mercy, Pope Francis is Time's 2013 Person of the Year.""

The magazine adds that:

""What makes this pope so important is the speed with which he has captured the imaginations of millions who had given up on hoping for the church at all. People weary of the endless parsing of sexual ethics, the buck-passing infighting over lines of authority when all the while (to borrow from Milton), 'the hungry Sheep look up, and are not fed.' In a matter of months, Francis has elevated the healing mission of the church—the church as servant and comforter of hurting people in an often harsh world—above the doctrinal police work so important to his recent predecessors. John Paul II and Benedict XVI were professors of theology. Francis is a former janitor, nightclub bouncer, chemical technician and literature teacher.""

Meanwhile, Time says this year's runner-up is ""NSA leaker"" Edward Snowden. He tells the magazine, in an interview done from Russia via emails, that the National Security Agency ""is surely not the Stasi"" (East Germany's once-feared security service).

""But we should always remember that the danger to ­societies from security services is not that they will spontaneously decide to embrace mustache twirling and jackboots to bear us bodily into dark places, but that the slowly shifting foundation of policy will make it such that mustaches and jackboots are discovered to prove an operational advantage toward a necessary purpose,"" Snowden says.

Others Time considered:

-- Edith Windsor, whose battle to have the rights of same-sex partners be recognized went all the way to the Supreme Court.

-- Syrian President Bashar Assad.

-- Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.

Francis became pope in March. He succeeded Pope Benedict XVI, who was the first leader of the Catholic Church in about 600 years to retire rather than serve until his death. Pope Francis turns 77 on Tuesday."

Older Two-Way readers will remember the monthly Golden Fleece Awards from former Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., who spotlighted ways the federal government was wasting money.

Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., has picked up that mantle in recent years with his annual Wastebook.

On Tuesday, Coburn released his 2013 edition, where he points to:

-- ""Obamacare [and] the failure of its $319 million website.""

-- The $2 billion or so ""to provide back pay to federal employees"" who were furloughed during the 16-day partial government shutdown.

-- The destruction of $7 billion worth of vehicles and other military equipment in Afghanistan.

-- A slew of smaller expenditures that he says appear to have been of dubious value. They include: $10 million spent by the Army National Guard on a ""soldier of steel"" promotional campaigned tied to this year's Superman movie; nearly $1 million shelled out by the National Endowment of the Humanities to ""explore the fascinating, often contradictory origins and influences of popular romance as told in novels, films, comics, advice books, songs and Internet fan fiction;"" and the grounding of a ""mega-blimp"" project after nearly $300 million was expended.

According to Coburn, his staff came up with ""examples of wasteful and low-priority spending totaling more than $28 billion.""

That is, for sure, a large number. But it's also about 0.7 percent of the $3.8 trillion the federal government spent for the year."

Enlarge this image toggle caption PISA PISA

American 15-year-olds continue to turn in flat results in a test that measures students' proficiency in reading, math and science worldwide, failing to crack the global top 20.

The Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, collects test results from 65 countries for its rankings, which come out every three years. The latest results, from 2012, show that U.S. students ranked below average in math among the world's most-developed countries. They were close to average in science and reading.

""In mathematics, 29 nations and other jurisdictions outperformed the United States by a statistically significant margin, up from 23 three years ago,"" reports Education Week. ""In science, 22 education systems scored above the U.S. average, up from 18 in 2009.""

In reading, 19 other locales scored higher than U.S. students — a jump from nine in 2009, when the last assessment was performed.

The top overall scores came from Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Macao and Japan, followed by Lichtenstein, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Estonia.

The math scores of students in Shanghai showed that they are ""the equivalent of over two years of formal schooling ahead of those observed in Massachusetts, itself a strong-performing U.S. state,"" according to the study.

The U.S. was slotted between the Slovak Republic and Lithuania in the overall results, two spots behind Russia. But the PISA assessment notes that there are few statistical differences between the scores of the U.S. and those countries.

American Education Secretary Arne Duncan called the PISA findings a ""picture of educational stagnation."" He told The Associated Press that America needs to ""invest in early education, raise academic standards, make college affordable, and do more to recruit and retain top-notch educators.""

From the PISA assessment:

""Students in the U.S. are largely satisfied with their school and view teacher-student relations positively. But they do not report strong motivation towards learning mathematics: only 50 percent [of] students agreed that they are interested in learning mathematics, slightly below the OECD average of 53 percent.""

Here's how NPR's Claudio Sanchez describes the situation for a report on Tuesday's Morning Edition:

""Remember the movie Groundhog Day, where the main character wakes up every morning and realizes nothing has changed? He's reliving the same day over and over again. Well that pretty much sums up the latest PISA results for 15-year-olds in the U.S. Their scores in reading, math and science have not changed since 2003.""

That means teenagers in places such as Vietnam have outpaced their American counterparts in their average scores in math and science. Students in Ireland and Poland did better than the U.S. in all three subjects measured.

Claudio talked to Harvard professor Jan Rivkin, who co-chairs a project on U.S. competitiveness.

""While our scores in reading are the same as 2009, scores from Belgium, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Poland and others have improved and now surpass ours,"" Rivkin says. ""Other countries that were behind us, like Italy and Portugal, are now catching up. We are in a race in the global economy. The problem is not that we're slowing down. The problem is that the other runners are getting faster.""

As for what might improve Americans' showing, the PISA assessment suggests there is no simple answer:

""While the U.S. spends more per student than most countries, this does not translate into better performance. For example, the Slovak Republic, which spends around USD 53,000 per student, performs at the same level as the United States, which spends over USD 115,000 per student.""

More than half a million students took part in the assessment, which uses a paper-based test that lasts two hours. Students between the ages of 15 years, 3 months and 16 years, 2 months take the tests.

If you'd like to try some test questions yourself, you can do that at the PISA site.

Update at 9:50 a.m. ET: More Perspective On The Rankings

As you'll notice from our report, the PISA rankings include large cities in China rather than the nation's overall educational system. That practice, which isn't new for 2012, has long been a subject of debate.

""Twelve provinces in China took the 2012 PISA test, the OECD confirmed, but only the results from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macao were publicly released,"" as Education Week reports.

The journal also cites the Brookings Institution's Tom Loveless, who wrote in October that ""journalists and pundits will focus on the results from one province, Shanghai, and those test scores will be depicted, in much of the public discussion that follows, as the results for China. That is wrong."""

This post was updated at 12:00 p.m. ET.

A three-month extension of federal unemployment benefits for 1.3 million jobless Americans won a key procedural vote in the Senate on Tuesday.

The 60-37 vote indicates there's enough Republican support to move the Emergency Unemployment Compensation, which expired on Dec. 28, forward to a full vote. As The Associated Press writes, the measure ""is the leading edge of a Democratic program that also includes raising the minimum wage and closing tax loopholes on the wealthy and corporations.""

The vote does not guarantee final passage in the Senate and the measure still must clear the Republican-controlled House.

As NPR's Craig Windham reported, GOP lawmakers opposed the bill because it does not include spending cuts to pay the cost of the extension.

The vote was originally scheduled for Monday evening, but it was abruptly delayed because, as Politico reports, supporters did not have the votes they needed.

On Monday, Politico wrote that Democrats needed five Republicans to join them to reach the needed 60-vote threshold, and at that time just two Republicans were in their column.

Speaking in the chamber just before the vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell lashed out at the Democrats and President Obama:

""Remember: These are the same folks who gave us the stimulus, who gave us tax increases, and who gave us Obamacare,"" he said. ""All of it was done in the name of helping the little guy — in the name of greater equality. And what's it given us? This mess.""

Federal unemployment benefits were signed into law in 2008 by President George W. Bush to provide an average of $300 a week to jobless Americans for an additional 28 weeks after their state benefits expired. It was meant as a stopgap measure during the recession, which saw the worst unemployment in decades. As the length and depth of the recession dragged on, the measure was extended more than 10 times.

Reuters says:

""The Democrat-led Senate plans to escalate the fight in coming weeks by bringing up for a vote a bill to increase the federal minimum wage, which has stood at $7.25 an hour since July 2009. Democrats want the minimum wage to rise over three years to $10.10 and then be indexed to inflation in the future.""

President Obama said Tuesday that the vote was ""good news"" and that unemployment insurance ""has been a vital lifeline for millions of people"" hurt by the recession.

""They are out there looking for jobs,"" he said.

""I can't remember a time where I met an American who would rather have an unemployment check than the pride of a real job,"" he said.

The president was introduced by Katerine Hackett, who has been out of work for the long term.

""Job loss is devastating and I am working very hard every day to find employment,"" she said.

Hackett said she had two sons in the military, one who had served in Afghanistan."

Balance Of Power At Stake In High Court Case Listen · 7:48 7:48

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP

The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments Monday in a big constitutional fight over the balance of power between the president and the Senate.

At issue is whether the president's power to make temporary appointments during the Senate recess can be curtailed by the use of pro forma Senate sessions during which no business is conducted.

During the holidays from mid-December 2011 to Jan. 20, 2012, the Senate did not meet as it usually does. Failing to get the Republican House to grant permission to recess, the Senate formally convened and adjourned multiple times. Indeed, each time the Senate adjourned, it stipulated that no business would be conducted when it reconvened three days later.

A typical pro forma session on Jan. 6, 2012, opened with a Senate clerk reading aloud a letter from the Senate's senior member appointing another senator, James Webb from nearby Virginia, to chair the day's business. Webb then immediately adjourned the Senate session.

That session lasted all of 30 inconsequential seconds. Pretty much the norm for that period. But the legality of those brief sessions is the heart of the dispute before the Supreme Court now.

The president contends that these sessions were, in essence, fakes — a legal pretense — when in fact the Senate was really in recess.

It was during one of these pro forma sessions that President Obama nominated three people to fill long-vacant seats on the National Labor Relations Board. The nominees would serve until the end of the following year or longer if confirmed.

Part of the reason Obama used the recess appointment mechanism was that Senate Republicans had dragged their feet on so many appointments that the board, charged with enforcing labor laws, did not have a quorum to do its job, and the Supreme Court in 2010 had said the board could not act without a quorum.

Once the recess appointees began their work hearing labor cases, a soda pop bottling company named Noel Canning challenged an adverse ruling, contending that the board's members were unconstitutionally appointed.

Noel Canning won in the U.S. Court of Appeals based in Washington, D.C. Now the company, backed by 44 Republican senators, is asking the Supreme Court to affirm its lower court win. The company will argue that the Senate makes its own rules, the Senate was not in recess at the time of the appointments, and that, therefore, the president had no power to make the recess appointments.

Article II of the Constitution states: ""The President shall have the power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate,"" and that the appointment shall automatically expire at the end of the next year if the nominee is not confirmed.

Texas A&M professor George Edwards points out that, at the time the Constitution was written, the only transportation available was by horse and carriage, not planes, trains or automobiles.

""There would be substantial periods when the Senate was not there to advise and consent on a presidential nomination,"" Edwards says. ""The Founding Fathers didn't want there to be gaps in the administration of policy, so they provided for recess appointments.""

Today, in contrast, senators can get to Washington quickly. The nature of government, however, is also dramatically different.

Edwards notes that the founders could not have conceived of government of the scale that we have today. ""The government is much larger now. There are many more people in appointed positions and so many more vacancies that occur,"" he says.

Edwards says that since the mid-1800s, there have been more than 600 recess appointments to civilian jobs, and hundreds, perhaps thousands more in the military. Even some Supreme Court justices were first recess-appointed. Chief Justice Earl Warren was recess-appointed after the sitting chief justice died in September 1953. Warren served in that capacity for six months before he was confirmed by the Senate in March 1954.

In modern times, three appeals courts have upheld the president's power to make midsession recess appointments. In this case, however, the Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion, siding with the Noel Canning company.

Noel Francisco, the company's lawyer, contends that the importance of these appointments proves his point: ""That's precisely why the recess appointments power was meant to be a narrow emergency power.""

White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler disagrees. In an interview with NPR, she said that the way Senate Republicans managed to keep the Senate in session without actually handling any formal business proves her point — that the Senate sessions were nothing more than a ""legal fiction.""

""[The Senate] was not conducting any business and did not intend to conduct any business during these pro forma sessions,"" Ruemmler said. ""It was solely employed, and members of the Senate have been quite clear about that, for the purpose of preventing the president from making recess appointments.

""It is not a bypass of the Senate confirmation process,"" she added. ""It is a way for the president ... by express authority in the Constitution, to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed."" That is something that she maintains cannot be done if many top federal agency positions are allowed to remain unfilled.

Ruemmler contends that if Senate Republicans prevail here, the recess appointment power will likely be dead for all practical purposes. The Senate, after all, could eat up every recess with pro forma sessions to prevent presidential appointments.

Noel Francisco readily concedes this point. ""The fact of the matter is that in today's day and age, the Senate is virtually never incapable of providing advice and consent given modern transportation and communications,"" he says. ""So, yes, the Senate can render itself perpetually available to provide advice and consent, and if it does so, the president is not empowered to make a recess appointment.""

A second question before the Supreme Court in this case asks when the vacancy must arise to trigger the president's recess appointment power.

The recess appointment clause says the president may make appointments for vacancies ""that may happen during the recess."" Those opposing Obama argue that the president may only make recess appointments for vacancies that occur during a recess, as opposed to vacancies that exist at the time of a recess.

The lower court agreed on this point, too, creating such a narrow time window as to make recess appointments practically impossible.

For now, it is President Obama who wants the ability to make these recess appointments, but the recess appointment power has been used by presidents from both sides of the aisle throughout the 20th century.

Edwards says presidents have used this power more often in recent times. ""Particularly since the 1980s,"" he says, ""when Ronald Reagan made a number of intra-session appointments.""

Edwards says that in a time of political polarization, the Senate and the president both are looking for political advantage and often resort to what seem to be arcane procedures.

Now the Supreme Court will weigh in on the question of recess appointments. On one side of the argument is the original intent of the founders. On the other is the pragmatic question of how to run a large modern government, and how that has been accomplished for the past century, and more."

The House is expected to vote Wednesday on a $1.1 trillion spending bill that would fund the federal government into October and bring to an end, for now at least, the bitter partisan battles that have led to one government shutdown and threatened to push the U.S. into defaulting on its bills.

According to The Associated Press, ""the GOP-led House is slated to pass the 1,582-page bill Wednesday, though many Tea Party conservatives are sure to oppose it."" A Senate vote is expected by week's end and that Democratic-led chamber is also expected to pass the plan.

NPR's Ailsa Chang tells our Newscast Desk that the bill ""fleshes out the broad outlines provided in last month's budget agreement on Capitol Hill.""

The budget, she says, authorizes spending ""for nearly every speck of government within the guidelines of last month's budget agreement. One notable difference between this bill and the December deal involves cuts to military pensions. The budget agreement announced last month reduced the annual cost-of-living increases for military retirees under 62 by one percent. This spending plan reverses that cut, but only for disabled veterans and relatives of deceased members of the military.""

Reuters adds that:

""The measure eases across-the-board spending cuts by providing an extra $45 billion for military and domestic discretionary programs for fiscal 2014, to a total of $1.012 trillion. It also provides an additional $85.2 billion for Afghanistan war funding that is typically handled off-budget.""

Bloomberg News notes that ""funding runs through Jan. 15 [Wednesday], so lawmakers also plan to pass a separate three-day stopgap bill at current funding levels to push the deadline to Jan. 18. That would give lawmakers enough time to enact the comprehensive legislation without risking a government shutdown. The House plans to vote on the three-day measure today.""

As for the politics of all this, The Hill says that:"

toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP

Henry Waxman's retirement means more than the loss of a legendary legislator on health care, energy and other regulatory issues. It also closes an era that began 40 years ago with the election of the ""Watergate babies.""

When Waxman departs, there will no longer be a House member who has been serving since that historic class of 75 Democrats was first elected in 1974. One classmate who had been, George Miller of California, announced his retirement several weeks earlier in January.

(Asterisk alert: Minnesota Democrat Rick Nolan first came to Congress with the '74 class but retired voluntarily in 1980, returning to be a ""freshman"" again in 2012.)

In the Senate, one member of the Democratic class of 1974 will remain after the November election: Pat Leahy of Vermont, who is now the most senior member of the chamber. That, too, says something about how long ago Watergate was.

They called the great surge of Democrats ""Watergate babies"" because of their youth (their average age was two decades below the previous party average) and because so many owed their election to the Watergate scandal. What had begun as a bungled burglary at the Democratic Party HQ in the Watergate Hotel in Washington had led to two years of investigations by journalists, the FBI and Congress. Ultimately, the burglary was traced to the campaign operation of President Richard M. Nixon, and the ensuing cover-up to the Oval Office itself.

Nixon resigned in August 1974 in the face of impending impeachment, and three months later his Republican Party suffered a severe drubbing in the midterm elections. The GOP also bore the brunt of high inflation and an oil embargo that sent gas prices to historic highs. The party was especially vulnerable to a wave election because it had captured many seats in Congress alongside Nixon's re-election in 1972, a 49-state landslide.

But it was not only the gargantuan size of the '74 class that made it historic. The members of the class of 1974 were young, relatively new to public office and remarkably certain they could remake Washington in their own image. Half were under the age of 40. Tom Downey of New York was just 25, the youngest member since the early 1800s.

This new generation of Democrats offered a new image for their party. They viewed Congress as ossified, beholden to powerful interests, unresponsive to the people and ripe for the taking.

Far more than their senior colleagues in the House, they understood the social trends and beliefs that had typified the previous 10 years. Most of them supported the Supreme Court decisions that had legalized abortion and outlawed prayer in schools. Most of them backed busing to achieve racial balance in the schools.

Few were true populists. They were college-educated and professionally credentialed. ""We were the children of Vietnam, not World War II,"" said Tim Wirth of Colorado. ""We were products of television, not of print. We were products of computer politics, not courthouse politics. And we were reflections of JFK as president, not FDR.""

They were more likely to have been part of the anti-war movement than of the organized labor movement, and few were creatures of the party establishment. One new member, from the suburbs of Philadelphia, was a 31-year-old Methodist minister named Bob Edgar who had begun his campaign by looking up ""Democratic"" in the phone book to find the local headquarters.

As a class they would come to represent a watershed in the politics of the House and of the Democratic Party — indeed in the politics of the nation as a whole.

Not all of the 75 House newbies were liberals, but most were. Moreover, their geographic distribution heavily favored the West, Midwest and Northeast — the regions where Republicans had previously enjoyed an edge. There weren't many Watergate babies from the South, where most of the seats were already held by traditional Dixie Democrats and were unaffected by the Watergate tide.

But once the election was over, the clash between the new arrivals and the ""old bulls"" was immediately manifest in Democratic caucus meetings. One elderly chairman, called to speak to the freshman class, addressed them as ""boys and girls."" He, and several of his cohort, soon found themselves without their gavels. (A recent rule change had made the chairmanships subject to a vote of the full caucus, not just the members of each committee.)

Waxman and Miller were typical of the new class. At 35 and 29, they were not far removed from their student days at UCLA and Berkeley, where they were supporters of the civil rights movement and opponents of the Vietnam War. They joined the activist Democratic Study Group and pushed the leadership to the left on a range of issues, even as they rose through seniority to chair major committees: Waxman at Energy and Commerce, Miller at Education and Labor.

Their generation, and sympatico members elected in subsequent cycles, gradually relocated the party's center of gravity, moving more to the left and from Southern to national. This trend accelerated in the 1980s and '90s as more women, African-Americans and Hispanics became members.

The House that had been Democratic from 1954 to 1974 with one prevailing culture remained Democratic for the next 20 years with an increasingly different Democratic cast.

All of this culminated in another wave election — a Republican one. It came in 1994 when Democrats were defending a large number of vacancies and defending a young president named Bill Clinton. New district lines in the South had concentrated minority voters and so empowered Republicans in surrounding, predominantly white districts.

Suddenly, the GOP had its first majority in the chamber in 40 years, and an upstart Georgia Republican named Newt Gingrich was the speaker. Known as the ""Contract with America"" class for its 10-point campaign program, the GOP surge of 1994 had 73 Republicans to just 13 Democrats.

The early phases of the two classes have much history in common. Both came to Washington full of rhetorical energy about the changes to be wrought in the social and economic structure of the nation. Both enjoyed the strength in numbers and the sense of shared purpose that would enable them to make a difference immediately on Capitol Hill — particularly on issues of internal reform.

Before their first term was over, a bitter leadership race further divided the class, dissipating much of what was left of their solidarity. The Watergate babies split badly over the competing ambitions of their mentors, leading reformer Richard Bolling of Missouri and passionate liberal crusader Phil Burton of California, both of whom were running for majority leader (neither won; the job went instead to Jim Wright of Texas).

The Watergate babies continued to hold class meetings, but their original sense of mission and cohesion drained away. They were divided by region, by issues and by their competing ambitions. ""Anyone who thought we would be doing anything together beyond the first month was mistaken,"" said class member David Evans of Indiana.

All but two class members who ran for re-election won in 1976, but thereafter the game got rougher in a hurry. Reaction to Watergate had run its course, and Democratic President Jimmy Carter was generating a reaction of his own: The GOP gained a net of nearly 50 seats in the elections of 1978 and 1980.

The era of President Ronald Reagan pushed the Watergate babies to the margins of national policymaking. After years of considering themselves the cutting edge of Congress, they found themselves fighting rear-guard battles instead.

By the 1990s, the Watergate babies had attenuated as a presence in the House. One ambitious subgroup had moved on to the Senate (Tsongas, Wirth, Max Baucus of Montana, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Paul Simon of Illinois). Just as many, however, had tried for the Senate and lost."

The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to pass a five-year farm bill.

The $100 billion-a-year measure included small cuts to the food stamps program, and preserved some farm subsidies. The vote in the House was 251-166.

The bill now heads to the Senate, which is expected to approve it. President Obama is expected to sign the measure into law.

Here's more from The Associated Press:

""The measure had solid backing from the House GOP leadership, even though it makes smaller cuts to food stamps than they would have liked. The bill would cut about $800 million a year from the $80 billion-a-year program, or around 1 percent. The House had sought a 5 percent cut. ""The legislation would continue to heavily subsidize major crops while eliminating some subsidies and shifting them toward more politically defensible insurance programs.""

As Morning Edition reported on Tuesday, lawmakers reached a deal this week on the measure after a two-year stall.

David Wallbank of Bloomberg News told NPR's Steve Inskeep that the divide over the issue pit Republicans, who wanted to see big changes to the food stamp program, against Democrats, who wanted to preserve it.

The compromise bill cuts $8 billion from the food stamps program — a 1 percent reduction.

The other big divide was over agriculture subsidies, which farm groups were trying to preserve even as, in Wallbank's words, ""we were eliminating direct payments to farmers.""

Wallbank described the new system that's been put into place for farmers."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Noah Berger/AP Noah Berger/AP

Attorney General Eric Holder has for the first time directed Justice Department employees to give same-sex married couples ""full and equal recognition, to the greatest extent under the law,"" a move with far-ranging consequences for how such couples are treated in federal courtrooms and proceedings.

The directive specifies that such couples can decline to give testimony in U.S. cases that might incriminate a spouse, known in the law as marital privilege. The guidance says the Justice Department won't object to that even if the state where the couple lives doesn't formally recognize the marriage.



It also means U.S. trustees will take the position that same-sex married couples should be able to file jointly for bankruptcy ""and that domestic support obligations should include debts, such as alimony, owed to a former same-sex spouse.""



And in federal prisons, same-sex married inmates will have visitation privileges, escorted trips to attend a spouse's funeral and compassionate release policies if their spouse suffers severe illness.



Holder is preparing to make the new policy public Saturday evening at a gala event for the Human Rights Campaign in New York.



""Just like during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, the stakes involved in this generation's struggle for LGBT equality couldn't be higher,"" Holder will say, according to a copy of his prepared remarks. ""As attorney general, I will not let this department be simply a bystander during this important moment in history.""



The new policy follows similar moves by the Department of Homeland Security and the IRS after the U.S. Supreme Court last year invalidated a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act which had defined the institution of marriage for federal purposes as limited to heterosexual couples.



Holder has previously spoken with NPR about his department's role in addressing the repercussions of the Supreme Court ruling.

Update at 2 p.m. ET:

Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, called the decision a ""landmark"" that would ""change the lives of countless committed gay and lesbian couples for the better.

""While the immediate effect of these policy decisions is that all married gay couples will be treated equally under the law, the long-term effects are more profound. Today, our nation moves closer toward its ideals of equality and fairness for all,"" Griffin says."

Note: This post was updated several times after the jobs report was released at 8:30 a.m. ET.

The nation's unemployment rate slipped to 6.6 percent in January from 6.7 percent a month before, but employers added only 113,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday morning.

The jobless rate figure was expected. The job growth number, however, was well below the 185,000 that economists expected.

What's more, BLS said it still believes job growth was even more disappointing in December. When it initially reported that only 74,000 jobs had been added to payrolls that month, it was hoped the figure might later be revised upward. But today's report showed almost no change: BLS now believes 75,000 jobs were added in December.

The news could add to concerns about a slowdown by the economy, and to some investors' worries that the Federal Reserve is moving too quickly to ""taper"" the amount of stimulus it is giving the economy.

Update at 10:30 a.m. ET. Stocks Rise:

The Dow Jones industrial average and other indices were up slightly after about one hour of trading in New York. Investors may have decided the jobs report isn't so bad. Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG LLC, tells Bloomberg News that ""beneath the headlines, stuff wasn't terrible. ... When you dig into the household survey, it's not that bad. The participation rate went up, the labor force went up, the level of employment went up.""

Update at 9:50 a.m. ET. White House Focuses On Growth In Past 4 Years:

""Today's report is another reminder of both the progress that has been made and the challenges that remain,"" White House economist Jason Furman writes. ""Businesses have now added 8.5 million jobs over the last 47 months and the unemployment rate ticked down to its lowest level in more than five years. But the economy is still healing from the Great Recession and steps are still needed to expand economic opportunity.""

Update at 9:25 a.m. ET. ""Where Are The Jobs?"" Boehner Asks:

""The American people continue to ask 'where are the jobs?,' and the president clearly has no answers,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, says in a statement sent to reporters by his office.

The White House usually puts its analysis on its blog. We'll add some of that when its available.

Update at 9:15 a.m. ET. Although Employers Said They Added Only 113,000 Jobs, 638,000 More People Said They Were Working:

As happens each month, the BLS report has some apparently contradictory data. The figure on job growth — 113,000 — is based on a survey of public and private employers. Another figure, though, appears to show more positive news: BLS estimates that 638,000 more people were employed in January than in December. That figure comes from a survey of households.

One explanation for the divergent views: 434,000 more people said they were working ""part-time for noneconomic reasons"" in January. Many also may have taken positions that employers added to their payrolls in previous months, but hadn't been filled until January.

Update at 9 a.m. ET. New Fed Chair Will Get ""Baptism Of Fire"":

""These numbers mean that Janet Yellen could get a baptism of fire when she gives her inaugural testimony to Congress next week,"" The Wall Street Journal says in its live blog about the employment report. It adds that:

""Ms. Yellen did a masterful job of getting senators to warm to her during her confirmation hearings. But now she's in the job, the questions could be tougher. If anything, the risk is that the soft data wiill nudge the generally dovish new Fed chair to emphasize the Fed's willingness to maintain monetary accommodation and that could stir up some of the Fed's more conservative critics on the Hill.""

Yellen is due to testify before the House Committee on Financial Services next Tuesday and before the Senate Banking Committee next Thursday.

Update at 8:55 a.m. ET. Did Bad Weather Skew The Jobs Figures?

Here's some analysis from Kathy Bostjancic, director of macroeconomic analysis at the Conference Board, a business research group. She points to some reasons not to be too pessimistic based on the data in today's report:

""A gain of only 113,000 new jobs in January, on the heels of the even slower gain in December, likely sparks uncertainty about the strength of the labor market and direction of the overall U.S. economy. ""Still, the three-month average of private payroll increase is holding up at 168,000. Also, the revisions for 2013 show an adjustment of 509,000 more jobs by December than previously counted. ""There is no doubt that inclement weather in December played a role, although construction jobs held up reasonably well in January. We expect that an eventual return to more normal weather conditions will allow job gains to rebound back towards their previous 180,000 – 200,000 trend pace.""

Update at 8:45 a.m. ET. Rate Is Lowest Since October 2008:

According to the historical records kept by BLS, the last time the unemployment rate was lower than 6.6 percent was in October 2008, when it stood at 6.5 percent.

The rate's recent peak was in October 2009, when it hit 10 percent.

Officially, the economy slid into recession in December 2007 and didn't emerge from that downturn until June 2009.

Our original post — 'Nervousness' About Economy Ahead Of Today's Jobs Report — previewed the report:

As we wait for this morning's much-anticipated report about job growth and unemployment in January, here's a preview that draws from the conversation NPR's John Ydstie had today with Morning Edition host Renee Montagne.

Economists expect to hear that job growth was stronger last month than in December, John said. Their prediction: The Bureau of Labor Statistics will say about 185,000 jobs were added to public and private payrolls in January.

In its initial report about December, BLS said just 74,000 jobs were added that month. That was far fewer than expected. It's important to bear in mind, though, that the figure could be revised in today's report.

If there were about 185,000 more jobs in January than in December, that would mean growth last month was about in line with the average pace over the last 12 months, John said.

But as he added, ""there's nervousness about where we are right now.""

Manufacturing may be ""losing steam"" in the U.S. and China, John said. There have been currency problems in emerging markets such as Turkey and Argentina. That has led some investors to pull their money out of those countries — places that in recent years had been helping to shore up economic growth around the world.

And financial markets have been worried lately about how the Federal Reserve's decision to begin scaling back the amount of stimulus it gives the economy will affect growth in coming months.

As we said Thursday, economists also expect to hear that the unemployment rate either stayed at 6.7 percent in January or perhaps ticked down to 6.6 percent. A dip might have been at least partly due to a large number of people leaving the labor force, either because they retired or because they gave up looking for work.

The report is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. We'll update with highlights and analyses."

What might have been a routine update on the state of the federal budget Tuesday instead became the newest front in the ongoing political war over President Obama's signature health care law.

At issue: a revised estimate about how many people would voluntarily leave the workforce because they can get health care without necessarily holding down a job.

The Congressional Budget Office originally predicted that the availability of subsidies for low-income Americans to buy health insurance would result in about 800,000 people leaving full-time work by 2023. The revised estimate increases that number to about 2.5 million.

Republicans pounced, pointing at the nonpartisan office's estimate as proof of the Affordable Care Act's damaging effects on the economy. In a statement, House Speaker John Boehner said: ""The middle class is getting squeezed in this economy, and this CBO report confirms that Obamacare is making it worse.""

Texas Republican John Cornyn took to the Senate floor with the same message. ""The president's own health care policy ... is killing full-time work, and putting people in part-time work,"" he said.

Obama's White House wasted little time responding, sending Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman to the daily press briefing. There, Furman turned Cornyn's charge on its head, arguing that if some people are able to work part time and spend more time with their children, or if others can leave a job to start a business of their own without fear of losing health insurance, then these are good things happening because of the Affordable Care Act.

""This is a choice on the part of workers,"" Furman said. ""I have no doubt that if, for example, we got rid of Social Security and Medicare, there are many 95-year-olds that would choose to work more. I don't think anyone would say that was a compelling argument to eliminate Social Security and Medicare,"" Furman said.

The White House also pointed out that on the topic of a longtime and separate Republican charge — that the law encourages businesses to lay off or reduce the hours of workers — the CBO found little evidence of this happening.

CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf also said during a news conference that the existence of employees who have the ability to choose not to work is proof that they will be better off.

""The Affordable Care Act is reducing the labor supply of lower-income people in our estimates partly because it is making them better off,"" he said. ""It is providing a valuable benefit to them.""

On the larger question of whether the health care law helps or hurts the budget picture, the CBO is sticking to its last analysis, done in 2012, that the law overall reduces federal deficits, Elmendorf said.

We're updating this post as the day continues.

In what could be a major move toward ending the violence in the streets of his capital, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and leaders of the anti-government opposition reached agreement Friday on a deal to hold new elections, form a unity government and restore a constitution drafted in 2004.

Some details have yet to be spelled out. But the BBC sums up the news this way:

""Yanukovych has agreed to an early presidential election as part of a deal to end the long-running crisis. He said he had also agreed to a national unity government, and to make constitutional changes reducing the power of the president. The compromise came after hours of talks with the opposition leaders. ""The opposition has not spoken about the deal and it remains unclear whether protesters will back it.""

NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, who is in Kiev, tells our Newscast Desk that along with the formation of a unity government and new elections by December, Yanukovych has agreed to ""constitutional changes to reduce the power of the presidency.""

THE LATEST -- 6:23 p.m. ET: President Obama spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. The Hill quotes a senior State Department official saying the talk was ""constructive."" ""They agreed the agreement reached today needed to be implemented quickly,"" the official said. -- 9:30 a.m. ET: German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who witnessed the deal's signing, issues a statement commending the parties ""for their courage and commitment to the agreement"" and calling for ""an immediate end to all violence and confrontation in Ukraine."" -- 9:10 a.m. ET: The deal has been signed by Yanukovych and three leaders of the opposition, according to reports from Reuters, the BBC and other news outlets. -- 8:35 a.m. ET: All opposition leaders are at the president's office and are ""poised to sign the agreement,"" Reuters reports.

President Viktor Yanukovych's statement: ""Dear compatriots! ""In these tragic days, when Ukraine suffered such heavy losses, when people died on both sides of the conflict, I consider it my duty to the bright memory of the deceased to declare that there is nothing more important than human life. There are no steps that we must not do together to restore peace in Ukraine. ""I declare steps that must be done to restore peace and avoid more victims of the confrontation. ""I declare that I initiate early presidential elections. ""I initiate the return of the Constitution of the year 2004 with redistribution of powers aside parliamentary republic. ""I call to begin the procedure of establishing the government of national trust. ""As Ukrainian President and Guarantor of the Constitution, I fulfill my duty to the people, to Ukraine and to God for the sake of preservation of state, for the sake of saving the life of people, for the sake of peace in our land.""

There's ""a great deal of skepticism"" among protesters about the deal, and it may not satisfy many of them, Soraya adds.

But by early afternoon in Kiev, opposition leader Vitali Klitschko was telling Germany's Bild that ""we will sign the deal."" Shortly after that, there was word from a Reuters correspondent who witnessed the event that Yanukovych and three opposition leaders had signed the deal.

Also on hand to watch the signing were two of the three European Union foreign ministers who had helped broker the deal, Reuters reported. One of those diplomats, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, issued a statement following the signing on behalf of himself and the ministers of France and Poland:

""The Foreign Ministers of France, Germany and Poland welcome the signing of the agreement on the Settlement of the crisis in Ukraine, commend the parties for their courage and commitment to the agreement and call for an immediate end to all violence and confrontation in Ukraine.""

The BBC reported that ""the three opposition leaders who signed the deal at the presidential palace are: Vitali Klitschko of the pro-EU Udar movement, Arseniy Yatsenyuk of the main opposition Fatherland and Oleh Tyahnybok of the far-right Svoboda.""

Soraya says it is ""amazing what has happened overnight"" in Kiev, where she's been reporting from this week. Just 24 hours earlier, as she had said Thursday, it was ""absolute chaos"" in the city's Independence Square. Clashes between security forces and protesters left dozens of people dead. More than 70 have been killed since violence erupted Tuesday.

By midday Friday in Kiev, as Soraya reported on Morning Edition, much of the ""debris and chaos had been swept up and swept away."" One dramatic moment: the arrival of police officers from the city of Lviv. They announced they were there to support the protesters, Soraya said.

The scene is ""180 degrees different,"" Soraya added.

As we've reported before, the anti-Yanukovych protests that have been raging for weeks were sparked in part by the president's rejection of a pending trade treaty with the European Union and his embrace of more aid from Russia. Protesters have also been drawn into the streets to demonstrate against government corruption."

Viktor Yanukovych, ousted Saturday from his post as president of Ukraine, is now wanted by authorities in his country on charges of mass murder, the acting interior minister says.

Authorities want Yanukovych and some of his aides to be tried for the deaths of scores of protesters in Kiev last week, acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov writes on his Facebook page.

First, though, officials have to find the 63-year-old Yanukovych — who has accused opponents of staging an illegal coup. He's missing. As Reuters reports:

""According to Avakov's account of events, Yanukovych, after hearing he had been officially replaced in his presidential duties, headed for the Belbek military airport in Crimea. He then went in another direction after learning that the new heads of the interior ministry and state security service were waiting for him there. ""At a private residence in the Balaclava region, he gathered his security guards together and gave them a choice either to stay with him or leave, relinquishing protection from state-appointed bodyguards, Avakov said. ""Some left him, taking with them official state-registered weapons to hand over to the authorities in Crimea.""

Then Yanukovych disappeared again.

Meanwhile, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton is due in Kiev today. She'll be talking with officials about steps — and money — that are needed to shore up Ukraine's economy. The BBC writes that ""the new interim Finance Minister, Yuriy Kolobov, has said Ukraine needs around $35 billion in urgent foreign aid and asked for an international donors' conference to be held.""

In Kiev's Independence Square, where the demonstrations and violence were centered, some protesters remain camped out. Flowers and other memorials are piling up in places to honor the dozens of people killed there.

As we've reported previously, the anti-Yanukovych protests were sparked in part by the president's rejection of a pending trade treaty with the European Union and his embrace of more aid from Russia. Protesters were also drawn into the streets to demonstrate against government corruption.

On Morning Edition Monday, NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reported from the estate that Yanukovych had built for himself. Its opulence has disgusted many Ukrainians.

Also on Morning Edition, Dmitri Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow Center spoke about why he hopes Russia has hit ""a pause button"" and will not try to intervene in Ukraine to support Yanukoyvch or anyone else with ties to Moscow.

""You watch more than you act"" is the right approach for Russia at this time, Trenin said."

President Obama made fun of himself at the White House Correspondents Association dinner on Saturday, the annual nerd-ball schmooze fest where Washington's media stars get comfy with a mix of political bigwigs and Hollywood beautiful people to celebrate a year of journalism.

Obama, known for his comic timing and delivery, didn't disappoint.

On a certain news network's favor for so-called ""birthers"": ""Let's face it, Fox: You will miss me when I'm gone. It will be harder to convince the American people that Hillary was born in Kenya.""

Of CNN's wall-to-wall coverage of the search for the missing Malaysian jet: ""Yes, I am happy to be here, even though I am a little jet-lagged from my trip to Malaysia. The lengths we have to go to to get CNN coverage these days! I think they are still searching for their table.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP

On MSNBC's sagging viewer numbers: ""I think they're a little overwhelmed. They've never seen an audience this big before.""

House Speaker John Boehner's tan got a quip: ""These days, the House Republicans actually give John Boehner a harder time than they give me. Which means orange really is the new black.""

Of his administration's flubbed rollout of HealthCare.gov, Obama observed that he replaced his campaign slogan ""Yes We Can"" with ""control-alt-delete."" Then, joking that Hollywood made a movie out of the Obamacare launch, he flashed a photo of Disney's Frozen.

The audience loved it.

The night was preceded by media criticism of its own event, with columnists like Emily Heil of the Washington Post slamming the dinner as too cozy, too incestuous, too lavish a mix of reporters and the people they are employed to report about.

Among the celebrity attendees were Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o, Elizabeth Chambers and Armie Hammer, Gloria and Emilio Estefan, Julianna Margulies and too many others to recount.

Jack Mirkinson of Huffington Post calls it the ""White House Correspondents' Dinner Self-Flagellation Tour.""

""It happens like clockwork: journalists and celebrities gather in Washington for the White House Correspondents' Dinner, they go to party after party, they have lavish brunches, they slap each other's backs and laugh at jokes — and they all spend a lot of time talking about how much they shouldn't be doing any of it and maybe they're letting journalism and their country down,"" Mirkinson writes.

The Independent, however, said the event lacked the star-wattage of previous dinners. The Hollywood Reporter speculates that celebs could be staying away after too many ""weird experiences.""

""A lot of the people who have gone say they'll never do it again,"" the Reporter quotes an anonymous source as saying. ""The room is so crowded. It's uncontrolled. There's no limit to the number of people trying to get photos and autographs — and there's no way to hide from it. It's like the stars are animals in a cage.""

Instead, Silicon Valley A-listers provided the glamour, writes the Independent. BuzzFeed and Facebook threw one of the most prominent parties Friday at a D.C. bar, and Yahoo! reserved six tables.

""It has ballooned into a long weekend of schmoozing, with nine pre-dinner parties taking place in Washington on Friday evening alone, including one thrown by Google and Netflix, attended by several actors from the hit political drama series House of Cards,"" says the British paper.

Comedian and Community star Joel McHale followed the president with a headline routine that drew laughs — some on the painful side. Among the groaners: ""I promise tonight will be amusing and over quickly, just like Chris Christie's presidential bid,"" and ""CNN is searching for something that's been missing for months: their dignity.""

Plus, the Obamacare website's debut was so bad, he said, ""I don't even have an analogy, because the website is now an analogy that people use to describe other bad things. 'Boy, that latest Johnny Depp movie really HealthCare.gov'd' at the box office.' """

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

As hopeful Republicans anticipate how their new select committee will get the Benghazi issue a full airing, and as Democrats gnash their teeth at what they're calling a political stunt, here's another possible scenario: It won't make much difference either way.

The new committee has subpoena power — just like the House Oversight Committee, which has already been investing Benghazi. The new committee will be able to look at classified material — just like the House Intelligence Committee, which has also been investigating Benghazi.

So while the newly minted committee has gotten headlines and will likely get some more at its first few hearings, it's hard to see how it will take the investigation of the 2012 attack on the diplomatic post and the death of four Americans there much further than it has already gone.

In that sense, it could be a rare political win-win-win.

For House Speaker John Boehner, the creation of the committee earns him points with the GOP's Tea Party wing, which had been clamoring for a select committee for months. Boehner, for his part, had been resisting for months.

Just five weeks ago, Boehner went on Fox News and said there was no need for a fifth House panel to look at Benghazi. ""At this point in time I see no reason to break up all the work that's been done and to take months and months and months to create some select committee,"" he said.

Yes, his change of heart came after a White House email that hadn't been given to congressional staff turned up in a Freedom of Information Act request. But it also came after Boehner earned himself some grief for mocking his caucus for not passing an immigration overhaul.

For the Tea Party wing, this is clearly a victory. While some Republicans privately see the whole issue as little more than red meat to fire up the base going into an election, many others honestly believe the Obama administration has conducted a cover-up. For them, the select committee is the long-awaited tool to prove it.

And for House Democrats, who see Benghazi as a tragedy but not a scandal, dealing with a single committee may well be preferable to having to prepare for hearings and testimony at four separate committees. Even though they complain of the committee's 7-5 partisan split in terms of membership, that's not terribly different from their proportion of seats on the other committees that have been probing Benghazi (42 percent on the select committee, compared with 45 percent on those existing committees).

Come to think of it, that point about keeping track of a single committee with a total of 12 members rather than four committees with a combined membership of 170 also applies to journalists covering the Benghazi investigation.

So make that a win-win-win-win.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP

Anybody found to have manipulated or falsified Veterans Affairs records ""will be held accountable,"" President Obama said Wednesday. The president condemned the reported widespread problems at the VA, defending Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki.

Obama spoke after he and Shinseki met in the Oval Office Wednesday morning with White House deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors, who since last week has been detailed to work with the VA. Neither of those men attended the president's news conference.

Speaking about reports of long wait times — and efforts to cover up the delays — Obama said that if they're proven true, the behavior is ""dishonorable"" and ""disgraceful.""

""I will not stand for it,"" Obama said. ""None of us should.""

The president said that Nabors is heading to Phoenix today to look into reports that a facility there had produced misleading statistics about veteran care.

Obama mentioned accountability several times in his prepared remarks; he also noted that some employees had already been put on administrative leave.

He said that his administration will continue ""bringing the VA into the 21st century – which is not an easy task.""

As the Two-Way has reported, Shinseki has told Congress he was ""mad as hell"" over reports of delayed treatments and preventable deaths at VA facilities.

After speaking about the VA's problems, the president took only two questions.

When asked why the situation had reached this point, Obama answered that there had been a delay in determining what was really going on. He noted that some of the alleged behavior, such as creating false reports, complicated that process.

The president noted that the VA faces two large challenges: an influx of new veterans from recent U.S. military conflicts, and an aging population of Baby Boomer veterans. He said that there are 85 million appointments scheduled over a year.

Obama also defended Shinseki, saying, ""No one cares more about our veterans.""

But Obama added that he told Shinseki today that he expects accountability and improvement in the full report on the VA's problems.

Earlier this month, Shinseki told NPR's Robert Siegel that he would ""take swift and appropriate action"" if reports that the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system kept two lists of veterans waiting for care – one for sharing with Washington and another showing wait times that sometimes reached beyond a year — were substantiated.

The VA is currently the subject of two main inquiries: an inspector general investigations of hospitals that were accused of fudging their reported statistics, and a broader audit ordered by Shinseki of all VA health centers. The findings of both of those inquiries are expected to be released this summer."

Five U.S. service members died in southern Afghanistan in a possible case of friendly fire. Afghan media are citing a local official who says the troops' air support mistakenly bombed their position. The attack is still under investigation.

Update at 2:45 p.m. ET: More From Pentagon

""We have reason to suspect that friendly fire was the cause here, specifically from the air,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said without elaborating.

""This is a tragic incident all around and our thoughts and prayers go out to the families,"" Kirby said.

Update at 10:30 a.m. ET: Pentagon Statement

""Five American troops were killed yesterday during a security operation in southern Afghanistan. Investigators are looking into the likelihood that friendly fire was the cause. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of these fallen,"" says Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby.

As CNN reminds us, there have been several incidents of friendly fire during the Afghanistan operation, including in 2007, when three British soldiers died after a U.S. jet bombed their position.

From Kabul, NPR's Sean Carberry reports:

""Afghan officials claim that the five American troops and one Afghan Army soldier were killed by a NATO airstrike in southern Zabul province. NATO would not provide outright confirmation but in a statement said that fratricide might have been involved and the incident is under investigation. ""Officials say the U.S. and Afghan forces were conducting a joint operation to clear out militants in advance of Saturday's presidential election. While returning to their base, the forces came under attack and called in the air support. ""Counting these deaths, there have now been 40 NATO service members killed in Afghanistan this year. More than 40 percent of them died as a result of non-battle-related injuries.""

The International Security Assistance Force released its statement about the deaths today.

The Pajhwok Afghan news agency cites an official in Zabul who ""said ISAF aircrafts mistakenly bombed international troops after they called in air support during an operation in Gizee area of Arghandab district.""

The agency adds that a Taliban spokesman says the troops had been in a gun battle with a Taliban force when the airstrike occurred."

Updated at 7:30 p.m. ET

The violence in Iraq has intensified today, with al-Qaida-linked Sunni militants moving into areas close to Baghdad after capturing the cities of Mosul and Tikrit.

NPR's Alice Fordham told Morning Edition that fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a group so extreme that al-Qaida disowned it, are entrenched in Mosul, one of Iraq's largest cities, and Tikrit, the hometown of former President Saddam Hussein. They also have a presence in Samarra, close to the capital, Baghdad, Alice says.

U.S. contractors in Iraq are being relocated by their companies due to security concerns, Reuters says.

Meanwhile, President Obama said today that he is not ruling out any options for a response to extremists' advance, although the White House later clarified that ""boots on the ground"" was not under consideration. Secretary of State John Kerry said the president is prepared ""to take key decisions in short order"" concerning Iraq.

""We are deeply concerned about what is happening in Iraq,"" Kerry said at the State Department. ""We are not concerned and waiting. We are providing assistance and are in direct touch with Prime Minister Maliki"" and other leaders, he said.

Amid this chaos, there's a new report that the U.S. rebuffed Iraqi requests last month to conduct airstrikes against the advancing militants, and that Kurdish fighters have taken territory in the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, a flashpoint for ethnic divisions in Iraq. The BBC reports that ISIS militants ""want to avoid tangling with Iraqi Kurds — a more cohesive fighting force.""

Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen each claim Kirkuk as their own.

Iraq's Parliament is discussing the declaration of a state of emergency, while Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is dispatching special forces to Tikrit. Al-Maliki has also said that he'll bolster the armed forces with volunteers, which, Alice says, ""many people worry means Shiite informal militias, which could deepen this sectarian problem.""

""But Mosul? I doubt he can take that back at the moment,"" she says.

The violence in Iraq raises the specter of long-simmering ethnic tensions among Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds. Under Saddam's rule, the Sunni minority controlled much of the state. Now, the tables have turned, and it's the Shiites who dominate. The cities that have fallen to ISIS are all Sunni-dominated, and there was little resistance to the takeovers.

""That doesn't mean people welcomed these militants who have really extreme views on Islamic law,"" Alice says. ""But it might mean there wasn't enough local opposition to put up a fight.""

Ever since Saddam's ouster, Sunnis have mounted protests against the state, saying under Maliki they are discriminated against, tortured and imprisoned unfairly.

""So in some ways the ground is set of alternative leadership to take over in these places,"" Alice says.

The fighting has also created a humanitarian crisis. As we've reported, an estimated 500,000 people have fled Mosul since the fighting began Saturday — and the fighting is just beginning.

The New York Times reports that the White House rejected a request from Maliki last month to carry out airstrikes against the advancing militants. The newspaper says the administration is reluctant to get involved in a conflict that it declared over in 2011 when it withdrew the last of its forces. And it adds:

""The Obama administration has carried out drone strikes against militants in Yemen and Pakistan, where it fears terrorists have been hatching plans to attack the United States. But despite the fact that Sunni militants have been making steady advances and may be carving out new havens from which they could carry out attacks against the West, administration spokesmen have insisted that the United States is not actively considering using warplanes or armed drones to strike them.""

But President Obama told reporters Thursday that he's looking at all options.

""I don't rule out anything,"" he said.

The president said it was clear that Iraq needed more help from the U.S. and the international community, adding militants must not be allowed to gain a foothold in the country or in neighboring Syria.

Later, White House press secretary Jay Carney clarified that the U.S. is not contemplating sending ground troops to Iraq and that the president was referring to not ruling out the possibility of airstrikes.

Obama's comments came as House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, accused the president of ""taking a nap"" while Iraqi cities were falling to militants."

A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday dealt a significant blow to the Affordable Care Act, when it threw out an IRS regulation that governs subsidies. But before the ink dried on that decision, another three-judge panel hearing a similar case issued a decision that was completely opposite.

In essence, the first decision by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down subsidies in the 36 states that did not set up their own insurance exchanges.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice said the Obama administration will ask the case to be heard by the full 11-judge panel.

""We believe that this decision is incorrect, inconsistent with Congressional intent, different from previous rulings, and at odds with the goal of the law: to make health care affordable no matter where people live,"" the spokeswoman, Emily Pierce, said in a statement. ""The government will therefore immediately seek further review of the court's decision. In the meantime, to be clear, people getting premium tax credits should know that nothing has changed, tax credits remain available.""

According to California Healthline, an industry digest, this decision has the potential to affect nearly 5 million — or most — Americans who signed up for Obamacare through federal exchanges.

""Losing the subsidies would mean that millions of U.S. residents could become uninsured, since health plans sold through the exchange might be unaffordable without the assistance,"" Healthline reports.

Both courts here were looking at some language of the Affordable Care Act. The courts were deciding whether Congress intended to provide subsidies for Americans who bought insurance through exchanges set up by states and the federal government on behalf of states.

In his concurring opinion, Senior Circuit Judge Raymond Randolph wraps up the panel's opinion succinctly:

""As Judge Griffith's majority opinion — which I fully join — demonstrates, an Exchange established by the federal government cannot possibly be 'an Exchange established by the State.' To hold otherwise would be to engage in distortion, not interpretation. Only further legislation could accomplish the expansion the government seeks.""

One of the three judges dissented, saying the majority failed to find ambiguity in the language, where there clearly was.

The three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled unanimously that the ambiguity in the statute's language means the subsidies can be given to both those who signed up using state exchanges and those who used federal exchanges.

It's possible that this dispute will ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

The House voted Wednesday to authorize a lawsuit against President Obama, claiming that he has overstepped the limits of his executive authority.

The vote to allow Speaker John Boehner to sue Obama was 225 to 201. Five Republicans voted no, while no Democrats voted in favor of pursuing the lawsuit.

Republicans say that Obama exceeded his constitutional authority by unilaterally deciding to delay the employer mandate for insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

Boehner said that Obama shouldn't be able to pick and choose which laws he will faithfully execute.

""By circumventing Congress, the president's actions have marginalized the role that the American people play in creating the laws that govern them,"" said Texas Republican Pete Sessions, who chairs the House Rules Committee. ""Specifically, the president has waived work requirements for welfare recipients, unilaterally changed immigration laws, released the Gitmo Five without properly notifying Congress — which is the law — and ignored the statutory requirements of the Affordable Care Act.""

Democrats decried the GOP's move. The lawsuits may serve to energize constituents of both major parties — or at least be useful for fundraising appeals, as NPR's S.V. Date reports.

Democrats have attempted to cast it as part of the broader partisan effort to undermine the president. ""The lawsuit is a drumbeat pushing members of the Republican Party to impeachment,"" said New York Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter.

Boehner denied his caucus has any plans to impeach the president.

Obama, as he has for weeks, dismissed the vote as a ""political stunt.

""The main vote that they've scheduled for today is whether or not they decide to sue me for doing my job,"" Obama said earlier Wednesday."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Dmitry Astakhov/AP Dmitry Astakhov/AP

Retaliating for sanctions placed on it by the West, Russia has announced that it is banning the import of some food from the United States and its allies.

As The Associated Press reports, the list is broad and shows that Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""no intention of bowing to Western pressure over Ukraine and will instead try to strike back at the West.""

The New York Times reports:

""Dmitri A. Medvedev, the prime minister, announced that Russia would ban all beef, pork, fruit, vegetables and dairy products from the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia and Norway for one year. "" 'We hoped until the very last that our foreign colleagues would realize that sanctions are a dead end and that nobody needs them,' Mr. Medvedev said. 'Things have turned out in such a way that we have to implement retaliatory measures.' ""Russia was still considering various measures involving aviation, including a ban on flights over Siberia, which would affect routes used by European and American airlines that fly to Asia, he told a cabinet meeting broadcast live on state-run satellite news channels.""

Remember, this whole conflict started after violent protests in Ukraine ended in the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. Seizing on the chaos, Russia annexed Crimea, and the government in Kiev and some of its international partners — including the U.S. — worry that Russia is poised for further incursion into Ukrainian territory. Of course, the downing of a Malaysia Airlines plane over a rebel-held area in Ukraine only inflamed tensions, which led to further sanctions from the United States and, more importantly, from the European Union.

According to the AP, this import ban is significant. The wire service reports:

""Russia depends heavily on imported foodstuffs — most of it from the West — particularly in the largest and most prosperous cities such as Moscow. In 2013 the EU's agricultural exports to Russia totaled 11.8 billion euros ($15.8 billion), while the U.S. Department of Agriculture says food and agricultural imports from the U.S. amounted to $1.3 billion. ""Medvedev argued that the ban would give Russian farmers, who have struggled to compete with Western products, a good chance to increase their market share. ""But experts said that local producers will find it hard to fill the gap left by the ban, as the nation's agricultural sector has continued to suffer from poor efficiency and shortage of funds.""

This sanctions battle, The Wall Street Journal reports, has already taken its toll on trade between the U.S. and Russia.

U.S. exports to Russia plummeted 34 percent in June to the ""lowest level since January last year.""

""Imports from Russian firms, meanwhile, fell nearly 10 percent, the third consecutive month of declines in U.S. purchases,"" the Journal reports. ""That asymmetric fall between buying and selling pushed the trade gap with Russia up 25% to $1.13 billion.""

Reuters reports that the newly imposed ban issued by Russia does not impact its export of wheat. Russia is one of the world's largest wheat producers."

Ferguson, Mo., saw more protests last night — but instead of meeting demonstrators with tear gas and armored vehicles, police walked with them, and posed for photos. The shift came after days of clashes sparked by the police killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

From St. Louis Public Radio, Rachel Lippmann reports:

""There was no line of armored trucks or police in riot gear blocking traffic Thursday night. The few police officers spotted in the crowd were wearing regular uniforms.

""Gov. Jay Nixon placed Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson in charge on Thursday afternoon, instead of the St. Louis County police. The result was an atmosphere that felt more like a party.

""Protester Dante Kelly hoped the night was a tipping point.

"" 'But it's only a start,' he said. 'Captain Johnson is not going to be here forever, so, ain't no telling.'

""Other protesters shared Kelly's skepticism that the change would be permanent. And many expressed their frustration that the police had not yet released the name of the shooter.""

Update at 12 p.m. ET: No Arrests Made Thursday

The Missouri Highway Patrol, which has taken over security in Ferguson, says that no arrests of demonstrators were made Thursday, confirming reports of a peaceful protest. Capt. Ron Johnson said people, and the police, need to continue that trend.

""In our anger, we have to make sure we don't burn down our own house,"" Johnson said. He also said he welcomed the use of cameras to record police work, saying that they ""don't change our jobs.""

Johnson also acknowledged criticism of the way in which Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released the name of Darren Wilson, the officer who shot and killed Brown, 18. The chief did not take questions, and he added new information about last Saturday, including the news that Brown was suspected of stealing cigars from a convenience store about 10 minutes before he was stopped.

Our original post continues:

The investigation into Brown's death is continuing, and on several fronts. Soon after the shooting, Jackson asked the St. Louis County police to handle the inquiry; the FBI and Justice Department are also conducting their own investigation.

But the key difference in Ferguson on Thursday was that police had changed their approach to trying to prevent a repeat of the violence and property damage that occurred Sunday. Police were heavily criticized for using tear gas, deploying heavy weapons and arresting journalists.

""They made it look like they were over in Iraq, ready to attack us,"" protester Marquess Mull tells NPR's Cheryl Corley. But Thursday was different, he said: ""They're talking to people.""

The new commander, Johnson, is a Ferguson native who is also black. He and Jackson had both said police would change both their tactics and their appearance in an effort to avoid provoking protesters. The military-style gear and the gas masks would be stowed, they said.

""When we talk about boots on the ground,"" Johnson said at a news conference Thursday, ""my boots are going to be on the ground. And so we are going to have a different approach and have the approach that we are in this together.""

Johnson kept that promise last night, walking with demonstrators, hugging people, and representing authority in a way that's been absent this week. The community responded with a spirited demonstration that was marked by cheers and the honking horns of passing cars.

One woman told Johnson, ""Thank you so much for coming out here tonight,"" according to The Washington Post's Wesley Lowery.

""Thank you so much for coming out here tonight,"" woman says to Johnson, almost in tears pic.twitter.com/Q6kS96bCM4 — Wesley Lowery (@WesleyLowery) August 14, 2014

This week, scenes of grief and confrontation in Ferguson have further stoked racial tensions in the town that's two-thirds black, and the images and stories have resonated far beyond the town.

In a show of solidarity, thousands of protesters in New York, Washington and other cities held their own demonstrations last night, chanting the phrase that has rung through Ferguson's streets this week: ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" a reference to witnesses' claims that Brown had his hands up when he was fatally shot Saturday.

In Ferguson, the new tone was indicated most simply, and perhaps most adorably, by a Thomas the Train parade vehicle that plied the same streets where armored vehicles had recently roamed. It carried a group of smiling young men."

Texas Gov. Rick Perry has been indicted by an Austin grand jury in connection with a veto of funding for state public corruption prosecutors.

An ethics complaint was filed last summer. The Associated Press has this background on the case:

""The Republican governor is accused of abusing his official powers by publicly promising to veto $7.5 million for the state public integrity unit at the Travis County District Attorney's office. He was indicted by an Austin grand jury Friday. ""Perry said he'd veto the funding if the district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, didn't resign. Lehmberg had recently been convicted of drunken driving. The state's Public Integrity Unit operates out of her office. ""When Lehmberg refused, Perry carried out his veto, drawing an ethics complaint.""

NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports that Lehmberg's office was investigating one of Perry's favorite state projects at the time he was calling for her resignation.

""The governor would have been able to appoint the DA's successor had she stepped down,"" Goodwyn says.

The Texas Tribune notes that Perry does have the authority to veto budget items, but that ""his critics said that this was done expressly for political purposes and is a crime.""

The general counsel for Perry issued a written statement, saying the governor acted ""in accordance with the veto authority afforded to every governor under the Texas Constitution. We will continue to aggressively defend the governor's lawful and constitutional action, and believe we will ultimately prevail."""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's campaign manager has resigned, citing ""inaccurate press accounts"" about his role in past campaigns.

The scandal in question revolves around former Iowa state Sen. Kent Sorenson, who pleaded guilty Wednesday to hiding — and lying about — payments he received in 2012 to switch his endorsement from Rep. Michele Bachmann to then-Rep. Ron Paul.

Jesse Benton, who until Friday worked for McConnell, was Paul's campaign chairman at the time.

In a statement given to The Lexington Herald-Leader, which first reported Benton's resignation, Benton said ""there have been inaccurate press accounts and unsubstantiated media rumors about me and my role in past campaigns that are politically motivated, unfair and, most importantly, untrue.""

He added that the allegations could become a ""distraction"" to McConnell's re-election campaign.

There ""is no more important cause for both Kentucky, my new home I have come to love, and our country than electing Mitch McConnell Majority Leader of the United States Senate,"" Benton said.

Speaking in Estonia today, President Obama issued a warning to the extremist group that took responsibility for beheading two American journalists: ""We will not be intimidated,"" Obama said, according to Time. ""Those who make the mistake of harming Americans will learn that we will not forget, and that our reach is long, and that justice will be served.""

As we reported, the Islamic State released a video Tuesday that showed a militant beheading American journalist Steven Sotloff. Overnight, the U.S. intelligence community came to the conclusion that the video was, indeed, authentic.

Sotloff is the second journalist to be killed by the militant group in Syria. The group released a similar video showing the beheading of James Foley in August.

In his comments today, Obama also sought to clarify his much talked about statement that the U.S. had not formulated a strategy for dealing with the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL.

Obama said the U.S. strategy is not to eliminate the group, but to mitigate the risk it poses.

Time adds:

"" 'Our objective is to make sure that [ISIS] is not an ongoing threat to the region,' Obama said. 'And we can accomplish that.' ""The commander-in-chief added that it was unrealistic to expect that the entire organization can be dismantled. 'As we've seen with al Qaeda, there are always going to be remnants that can cause havoc,' he said.""

Obama added that his ""no strategy"" comment referred to Syria specifically, not to Iraq, where the U.S. has been conducting airstrikes against the Islamic State.

Of course, Obama is in Estonia in large part to deal with another crisis: the standoff between Ukraine and pro-Russian militants.

On that front, Obama said the U.S. had an ""unwavering commitment"" to NATO. His visit, the AP reports, is meant as a show of support for NATO allies ""anxious about Russia's aggression in Ukraine.""

The AP reports:

""Obama also announced the U.S. would send more Air Force units and aircraft to the Baltics, and called Estonia's Amari Air Base an ideal location to base those forces. Standing shoulder to shoulder with Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves, Obama ticked through a list of U.S. military resources already at work in the region, and said the U.S. has a duty under the NATO charter to the alliance's collective defense. "" 'It is unbreakable, it is unwavering, it is eternal. And Estonia will never stand alone,' Obama said in Tallinn, Estonia's port capital. ""Obama's firm words came as NATO nations were preparing to commit to a more robust rapid-response force for the region, in response to Russia's incursion in Ukraine. Moscow's moves have sparked fears among member states on NATO's eastern flank that they could be Russian President Vladimir Putin's next target.""

Update at 2:04 p.m. ET. To The 'Gates Of Hell':

Vice President Joe Biden used stronger words when he talked about the Islamic State.

""When people harm Americans, we don't retreat,"" Biden said during a speech at a Naval shipyard in New Hampshire. ""They should know we will follow them to the gates of hell until they're brought to justice, because hell is where they will reside."""

Citing a broad threat posed by the Islamic State, President Obama said Sunday that he'll deliver a national address Wednesday to discuss the U.S. approach to fighting the group that has beheaded two American journalists this summer.

""This is not going to be an announcement about U.S. ground troops,"" Obama tells Chuck Todd on NBC's Meet the Press. ""This is not the equivalent of the Iraq war. What this is, is similar to the kinds of counter-terrorist campaigns that we've been engaging in consistently over the last five, six, seven years.""

Obama stressed that U.S. agencies ""have not seen any immediate intelligence about threats to the homeland"" from the group. He also said the U.S. has built an international coalition to help deal with the extremist group.

The U.S. approach will include airstrikes and strategic advice in Iraq, Obama said, adding that the plan also has economic and political components.

""What I want people to understand, though,"" the president said, ""is that over the course of months, we are going to be able to not just blunt the momentum of ISIL – we are going to systematically degrade their capabilities, we're going to shrink the territory that they control, and ultimately we are going to defeat them."""

Hillary Clinton, who has a huge lead in many early presidential polls, returned to Iowa on Sunday. The woman who says she has not yet decided on a 2016 presidential run appeared along with former President Bill Clinton in a state she has not visited since she lost the 2008 Iowa caucuses to Barack Obama.

Her speech at the annual steak fry hosted by U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, a must-attend event for state Democratic activists, revealed little about her intentions — but also did nothing to dampen the widespread belief that she will indeed run.

Harkin has hosted his steak fry for 37 years. Sunday's was his last, because he'll leave office in January after five terms. The buzz in the crowd, however, was all about Hillary Clinton. The group Ready for Hillary — call it a pre-campaign organization — was everywhere with yard signs, bumper stickers and more.

Cindy Pollard, 57, wasn't looking for a new Hillary T-shirt — she was wearing the one she's had since Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign.

""I was a precinct captain for Hillary. I've been decided. These people are wearing these Ready for Hillary — I have been ready,"" Pollard said.

It was a gorgeous September Iowa day as the event took place on a huge open field in Indianola. The stage featured a giant American flag and bales of straw; in the background were rolling hills and corn fields.

After speeches by Iowa Democrats running in 2014 for U.S. Senate and House seats and for governor, Sen. Harkin spoke, and then he introduced Clinton.

He mentioned her new memoir: ""There are 25 chapters in the book. I'm here to tell you that there are many more chapters to be written in the amazing life of Hillary Clinton.""

As the crowd chanted her name, Clinton stepped up to the microphone: ""Hello, Iowa. I'm baaaack.""

""Now, when Tom Harkin called and asked me to come, I have to admit I wasn't sure what to say. I've got a few things on my mind these days,"" Clinton teased.

She noted that she and Bill are on grandchild watch, as daughter Chelsea is expecting this month. Then Clinton got to the big thing on this crowd's mind.

""And then, of course, there's that other thing,"" she said playfully as the crowd cheered.

""It is true I am thinking about it,"" but she added, ""for today that is not why I'm here."" The crowd groaned.

""I'm here for the steak,"" Clinton said.

Nobody expected her to announce anything here. Still, nobody in the crowd seemed to doubt she's running. And some were as coy as Clinton herself about their intentions as voters.

Linda Dedecker, who was wearing a Clinton button, is an accountant from Ames. ""I'm considering her,"" she said, but ""I don't know who else is going to run.""

Dedecker insisted that it's important for Clinton to really campaign in Iowa — meeting people face to face. There was a sense eight years ago that she and her advisers didn't fully appreciate the state's caucus system. Back then she was the front-runner in the race but stumbled to a third-place finish in the caucuses.

Karen Hill of Marshalltown — a potential supporter — offered this advice for 2016: ""Don't take anything for granted — come and hang out with us for a while.""

Also at the steak fry, there was a table set up on behalf of the push to get Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren into the race as what her backers call a progressive alternative to Clinton. One Warren supporter said it's important not to anoint Clinton so early — before anyone has officially declared that they are running."

Eric Holder's arrival in early February 2009 had all the hallmarks of a homecoming. Justice Department employees fatigued by scandals in President Bush's second term greeted Holder with sustained applause.

The Senate was receptive too, confirming him on a 75-21 vote and officially making him the first African-American attorney general in U.S. history.

But soon after he took the helm at Justice, Holder ran into headwinds — at times generated by his own words.

Republicans in Congress and cable TV networks pounced when Holder, in his first speech at the Justice Department after taking office, said the United States was ""a nation of cowards"" when it came to the topic of race. It would be years before the White House wanted Holder to speak openly about race again.

It wasn't the only backlash he faced in his tenure, but his years also were marked by big criminal prosecutions and significant shifts in Justice Department priorities.

Deepwater Horizon



After a massive explosion on an oil rig off Houston in April 2010 led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history, the Justice Department led the criminal investigation. It eventually reached a $4 billion settlement with BP, the company running the rig at the time of the accident.

""BP has agreed to plead guilty to all 14 criminal charges,"" Holder said in announcing the agreement, ""including responsibility for the deaths of 11 people and the events that led to an unprecedented environmental catastrophe.""

Prosecutions against individual executives at the oil giant BP — including two men who were on the Deepwater Horizon rig when it exploded in the Gulf of Mexico — are still moving through the courts.

Wall Street

But 2008's Wall Street crisis was the big one that got away for Holder, whose Justice Department never engineered a reckoning for any individuals responsible for the financial collapse.

That's still a source of anger for many — including former congressional aide Jeff Connaughton.

""Did the department ever organize a timely, purposeful, concerted investigation of Wall Street executives?"" Connaughton asks. ""The answer is no.""

Charles Ferguson, whose documentary on the mortgage meltdown won an Academy Award in 2011, used his turn at the awards ceremony to make this point.

""I must start by pointing out that three years after a horrific financial crisis caused by massive fraud, not a single financial executive has gone to jail,"" Ferguson said. ""And that's wrong.""

Eventually Holder started paying more attention — asking more questions — and demanding that the mortgage team meet every two weeks for updates.

The Department of Justice did rack up huge monetary settlements from major firms — including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup — but no individual executive got prison time.

But another prosecution that hasn't happened may bother Holder more.

Sept. 11 Trials

Holder pushed for full trials for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others accused of helping plan and pull off the Sept. 11 attacks. The defendants had been held at Guantanamo for years, but Holder said they'd face justice on U.S. soil.

""They will be brought to New York, to New York, to answer for their alleged crimes in a courthouse just blocks away from where the twin towers once stood,"" Holder said.

Within months, that plan fell apart. Families of some 9/11 victims protested, New York's police chief warned that security costs would spiral out of control, and senators from both political parties expressed alarm.

The attorney general withdrew indictments and announced he would send the cases to military tribunals — where they still linger today — but not without parting shots at his political critics.

""The reality is, though, I know this case in a way that members of Congress do not,"" Holder said. ""I've looked at the files. I've spoken to the prosecutors. I know the tactical concerns that have to go into this decision. So do I know better than them? Yes.""

It was a pointed disagreement, but relations with Congress would get worse. A lot worse.

'Fast And Furious'

Lawmakers accused Holder of personal involvement in a gun trafficking scandal on the Southwest border.

U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, sounded particularly unimpressed.

""A dead border patrol agent, hundreds of guns that are still unaccounted for, untold number of crimes that have been committed with these guns, and an attorney general whose best guess, whose best argument, is a plea of ignorance,"" Chaffetz said.

Republicans demanded that the Justice Department turn over documents related to Operation Fast and Furious; when the administration refused, the House voted 255-67 to hold Eric Holder in contempt, the first time that ever had happened to a Cabinet member.

Still, Holder stayed on the job — and started focusing more on the issues that were most important to him.

Same-Sex Marriage

As suits against various laws banning same-sex marriages advanced through courts across the nation, the Justice Department announced it no longer would defend the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Later partly struck down by the Supreme Court, the law barred the federal government from recognizing same-sex partnerships or granting them benefits similar to heterosexual marriages.

""This is a civil rights matter,"" Holder said after the ruling. ""In many ways, I think it's akin to the struggle that African-Americans went through in the '50s and the '60s to demand equal treatment, to be allowed to enjoy all the benefits that flow to a person who is nothing more than an American citizen.""

This year, Holder ordered the Justice Department to extend ""full and equal recognition, to the greatest extent under the law"" to married same-sex couples.

Voting Rights

Holder also spent time trying to shore up the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court threw out a key provision, ruling that the criteria the Justice Department used to determine when areas' voting laws needed oversight were obsolete.

After the ruling, North Carolina and Texas moved quickly to put restrictive new laws on the books, and the Justice Department has challenged them.

Drug Sentencing

The attorney general became a leading voice in pushing Congress to dial back long prison sentences for many drug crimes.

""I think there are too many people in jail for too long, and for not necessarily good reasons,"" he said.

He backed up his rhetoric by encouraging his own prosecutors to stop seeking mandatory minimums in some sentences.

""The war on drugs is now 30, 40 years old,"" he said. ""There have been a lot of unintended consequences. There has been kind of a decimation of certain communities, in particular communities of color.""

After sentencing laws were eased, Holder has tried to provide ways for those sentenced before the changes to get out of prison sooner.

Trayvon And Ferguson



Following the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, who was killed in a confrontation with a neighbor who had decided he looked suspicious, Holder opened up about his own experiences with racial profiling.

""When I was pulled over twice and my car searched on the New Jersey Turnpike when I'm sure I wasn't speeding,"" Holder said as an example in a speech to the NAACP. ""Or when I was stopped by a police officer while simply running to catch a movie at night in Georgetown, in Washington, D.C. I was, at the time of that last incident, a federal prosecutor.""

He also traveled to Ferguson, Mo., this past summer as a sort of proxy for President Obama. He pledged that the Justice Department would conduct an independent investigation into the death of an unarmed black man at the hands of a white police officer.

Enlarge this image toggle caption T.J. Kirkpatrick/Getty Images T.J. Kirkpatrick/Getty Images

A day after Attorney General Eric Holder announced his resignation, he made a long-planned visit to Scranton, Penn.

That's where he won his first big trial as a young public corruption prosecutor nearly 40 years ago. And he says coming to this federal courthouse now, returning to the site of his earliest legal success, makes sense.

""This, for me, was ... almost like completing a circle,"" he says. ""I came here as a young and inexperienced trial lawyer and I came back as the head of the agency that I had just joined back in 1978.""

After those early years, Holder reached nearly every goal he set for himself. He became the U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., and then the deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration. Finally, in February 2009, he became the first African-American attorney general.

The job, he says, is the best he'll ever have — one that shaped him as a lawyer and a person.

All that ran through his mind, Holder says, when he stood next to President Obama Thursday afternoon at the ceremony that announced his resignation.

""All of that was coming together, and made yesterday very emotional,"" he says. ""It made me very concerned I was not going to be able to get through my remarks.""

During that announcement, Holder looked down and bit his lip when Obama referenced his late father, an immigrant who raised the family in a modest home in Elmhurst, Queens.

He says his father was denied a seat in a whites-only train car while he was in military uniform.

""He was a guy who didn't finish high school, who always put a great value on education,"" Holder says. ""He tried to hide that from us. I didn't know that, actually, until I got to college.""

Holder talks about his mother, too. She lived long enough to see him become attorney general but grew sick and died before what Holder views as his most significant civil rights accomplishments.

He's sorry his parents couldn't be there to see him stand next to the president Thursday.

""I was talking to my brother last night about this and I said ... 'I would give five years of my life for them to spend five minutes at that ceremony, to see what their little boys had accomplished,' "" he says, choking up. ""That was emotional, also ... I was cognizant of the fact that she wasn't there.""

Then, the attorney general turns to the work he still wants to do before he leaves once his successor is nominated and confirmed by the Senate.

That list starts with an ongoing review of the death penalty — a practice Holder personally opposes, but one he's authorized several times over the past five years.

President Obama asked Holder to look at capital punishment after three states botched executions earlier in the year.

But the attorney general gives the impression his review is going to talk about much more than how many drugs states should use in lethal injections.

""You know I think we have to look at some of the empirical evidence we have and see how effective is the death penalty as a deterrent,"" he says, ""and what do we see from various states where the death penalty is used."" That includes the impact on violent crime rates.

When asked what he most regrets, Holder immediately mentions a grim visit to a crime scene in Newtown, Conn. — the school where a gunman killed 20 children almost two years ago.

""My regret is that coming out of the horror that we saw personally did not result in the formulation and passage of reasonable gun safety measures,"" he says.

If he stays at the Justice Department through December, Eric Holder will be the third-longest-serving attorney general in U.S. history.

""I want to continue to be involved, talking about criminal justice issues and civil rights issues, to somehow figure out a way to bridge the gap between communities of color and law enforcement,"" Holder says. ""My government service might be over, but I don't think my public life is."""

The Supreme Court's new term will not include any cases that might decide the issue of same-sex marriage in the U.S., a development that comes after many lower and appeals courts have ruled against states' bans on gay marriage. Advocates on both sides of the issue have been calling for the high court to review the issue and make an official ruling.

Supreme Court Won't Hear Gay Marriage Cases In New Term Listen · 4:21 4:21

The court's refusal of all the petitions related to bans on gay marriage means that the appeals courts' decisions allowing gay marriage can now take effect. They had been on hold pending a potential review by the Supreme Court.

As NPR's Nina Totenberg reported in her preview of the court's new term on today's Morning Edition:

""Right now, the only cases pending before the court are lower court decisions favoring the right of same-sex couples to marry. But a Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals panel, which heard arguments last August in Ohio, sounded as if it might go the other way. If it does, that would provide the kind of traditional conflict the Supreme Court looks to resolve.""

Update at 12 p.m. ET: Wide Effects Of Decision

The court denied petitions to review cases in states including Utah, Virginia, Indiana, Oklahoma and Wisconsin. But the effects are wider, as several federal appeals courts had taken up the question.

""For example, in Utah, there have been a whole bunch of marriages actually that were performed,"" Nina says. ""Those will now become legal. The same is true in Virginia and other states in the Fourth Circuit — for example, West Virginia.""

Nina notes that because several federal circuits had already overturned bans on same-sex marriage, the court's refusal to review those cases affects 19 states, including some that had already legalized gay marriage.

The court's refusal to review the issue means that same-sex marriage will now be legal in 11 states where it had been banned. On Morning Edition, Nina lists those states, grouping them by federal circuit:

Utah

Oklahoma

Kansas

Colorado

Wyoming

North Carolina

South Carolina

Virginia

West Virginia

Indiana

Wisconsin

Before the justices decided not to intervene, same-sex marriage was legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia and banned in 31 states. Today's development flips that ratio, making it 30 states (and D.C.) where the marriages are legal.

As for the high court's inner workings that may be behind the decision to avoid same-sex marriage cases, Nina tells our Newscast unit:

""One suspects that Justice Kennedy, who's likely the deciding vote in this case, either the conservatives and liberals [on the court] weren't sure how he would vote, or his view was, this should percolate and there should be more states where we know what the views of the country are before we want to take this on as a court.""

Update at 10:15 a.m. ET: SCOTUS Calendar And The 'Best Vehicle'

Today's news comes as a surprise to those who suspected the justices might review a same-sex marriage case during the court's new term in order to add more legal clarity to a contentious issue. But it was absent from the court's list of new cases that was issued last week, and it was also missing from additional orders released Monday morning.

The high court held its opening conference last Wednesday; today marks the start of its October term, which will run through June 2015.

On complicated and important issues such as gay marriage, the Supreme Court looks for cases that it sees as the ""best vehicle"" to decide the issue, an elusive standard whose requirements include strong and clear arguments on both sides of a particular case. As Nina reported this morning, the lawyers who have been touting their own same-sex marriage cases as the best vehicle for the court were said to have ""sounded more like car salesmen than Supreme Court advocates."""

Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy has temporarily blocked Tuesday's appeals court decision that struck down bans on same-sex marriage in Idaho and Nevada.

Officials in Idaho had filed a last-minute appeal to the Supreme Court following Tuesday's appeals court decision. In his order, Kennedy gave lawyers representing same-sex couples until 5 p.m. Thursday to respond to the appeal.

""The order means that gay and lesbian couples will not be able to obtain marriage licenses in that state in the meantime,"" Lyle Denniston of SCOTUSblog notes.

The Associated Press adds that the order also applies to Nevada.

As we reported Tuesday, the appeals court ruling itself came a day after the Supreme Court gave tacit approval to similar decisions by three other circuit courts. The Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of those rulings, thereby making same-sex marriage legal in 11 states. Gay marriage is now permitted in 30 U.S. states.

The AP adds that the delay in Idaho and Nevada could last just a few days, but if it were to last longer than the weekend the full court would very likely weigh in. ""That has been the justices' practice in other cases in which a single justice initially blocked a ruling from taking effect,"" the news service says.

Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teen who was attacked by Taliban militants for promoting education for girls, will share the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize with Kailash Satyarthi, an Indian campaigner against exploitation of children.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee says on Nobelprize.org:

""Showing great personal courage, Kailash Satyarthi, maintaining Gandhi's tradition, has headed various forms of protests and demonstrations, all peaceful, focusing on the grave exploitation of children for financial gain. He has also contributed to the development of important international conventions on children's rights. ""Despite her youth, Malala Yousafzai has already fought for several years for the right of girls to education, and has shown by example that children and young people, too, can contribute to improving their own situations. This she has done under the most dangerous circumstances. Through her heroic struggle she has become a leading spokesperson for girls' rights to education.""

Yousafzai, 17, defied the Taliban in her town of Mingora in Swat Valley, near the volatile western frontier dividing Pakistan and Afghanistan. In October 2012, Taliban militiamen boarded a school bus she was on, singled her out and shot her in the left side of the head. Two other girls were also wounded in the attack.

Left in critical condition, Yousafzai received an outpouring of international support and was moved to the U.K. for treatment.

""Malala battled for her life, and came back to become an international ambassador for the rights of girls to be educated,"" NPR's Julie McCarthy says.

In July 2013, Yousafzai addressed the United Nations, telling delegates that the Taliban ""thought that bullets would silence us, but they failed.

""The terrorists thought that they would change my aims and stop my ambitions,"" she said defiantly, ""but nothing changed in my life, except this: Weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born.""

She is a previous recipient of the Sakharov Prize and was first nominated for the Peace Prize last year. She now lives in Birmingham, England, but the Taliban have threatened to target her again.

Yousafzai is the youngest-ever Nobel laureate.

Speaking in Birmingham hours after the award was announced, Yousafzai said she was in chemistry class when her teacher informed her she'd won.

""I decided not to leave school,"" the education campaigner said. ""I treated it like a normal day.""

She called the Peace Prize a ""precious award"" and ""a great honor"" and said her co-recipient, Satyarthi, ""totally deserved"" the prize.

""This is not the end. This is really the beginning. I want to see every child going to school,"" she said.

Satyarthi, 60, is a longtime activist against child labor and for better education of children in South Asia. In his 20s, he gave up a career as an electrical engineer and ""dedicated his life to helping the millions of children in India who are forced into slavery by powerful and corrupt business- and landowners,"" PBS writes.

""His original idea was daring and dangerous. He decided to mount raids on factories — factories frequently manned by armed guards — where children and often entire families were held captive as bonded workers. ""After successfully freeing and rehabilitating thousands of children, he went on to build up a global movement against child labor. Today Kailash heads up the Global March Against Child Labor, a conglomeration of 2000 social-purpose organizations and trade unions in 140 countries.""

The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights calls Satyarthi ""India's lodestar for the abolition of child labor.""

Kailash has emancipated thousands of children from bonded labor, a form of slavery where a desperate family typically borrows needed funds from a lender (sums as little as $35) and is forced to hand over a child as surety until the funds can be repaid,"" the RFK Center says.

Speaking to NPR in 2011, Satyarthi decried the rise of female feticide — or so-called selective abortions — in India, explaining: ""The parents feel that the boy is a help for the future, where the girl is a liability.

""If we spend money on her, then we have to spend money on her marriage, dowry probably, and then if something goes wrong, then we are always sufferers. So better that that girl is not born,"" he said, explaining the reasoning of some parents in India."

Updated at 7:53 p.m. ET

Nina Pham, the 26-year-old nurse who became infected with Ebola after treating a patient with the disease at a Dallas hospital, will be transferred to a high-level containment facility at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in testimony before a House committee that Pham will be admitted to the NIH tonight.

There she will will be given ""state of the art care"" in a high-level containment facility, he says.

Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, where Pham is being treated and also where she contracted the disease, said transferring Pham was the ""right decision.""

""With many of the medical professionals who would normally staff the intensive care unit sidelined for continuous monitoring, it is in the best interest of the hospital employees, nurses, physicians and the community to give the hospital an opportunity to prepare for whatever comes next,"" the hospital said in a statement.

Officials have said Pham's condition is good. Another nurse, Amber Vinson, who also cared for index patient Thomas Eric Duncan has also contracted the disease. Duncan died from the disease last week.

Dr. Daniel Varga, a top official from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where Duncan was treated by both Pham and Vinson, acknowledged the facility's mishandling of the original diagnosis and subsequent handling of the situation.

""We made mistakes,"" Varga said in a video link with lawmakers.

Varga's testimony comes as President Obama, for a second day, canceled out-of-town trips to stay in Washington, D.C., and monitor the response to the outbreak. The president had planned to travel to Rhode Island and New York today.

By late afternoon, Obama announced he was meeting with his cabinet again and issued an order giving the Pentagon the power to call up reserve National guard troops if they were needed to help fight the outbreak in West Africa.

NPR's Scott Horsley said this did not indicate a mass mobilization, but was instead the authority to ""call up people with very specific skills-- e.g. engineering, communications and Chaplains.""

Duncan first sought treatment at the hospital on Sept. 26 but was sent home with antibiotics despite a high fever and having told a nurse of his recent travel to Liberia, an Ebola hot spot. Two days later, he returned to the hospital, was placed in isolation and subsequently diagnosed with Ebola. That's when officials believe Pham and Vinson, 29, became infected.

In his testimony, Varga acknowledges that the hospital did not correctly diagnose the disease on Duncan's first visit. ""We are deeply sorry,"" he says.

After treating Duncan but before she exhibited symptoms, Vinson traveled by commercial airliner to and from Cleveland. That has raised questions about why she was allowed to travel with the public and whether anyone in an official capacity cleared her to do so. Her reported temperature was below the threshold set by the agency, and she had no symptoms, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman David Daigle, who talked to The Associated Press. The CDC has said that the likelihood of her passing the virus to a fellow passenger is considered very low.

By Thursday afternoon, however, CDC officials in Ohio began to make contact with passengers on Frontier flight 1142, which Vinson took from Dallas-to-Cleveland.

According to NPR member station WKSU, Dr. Chris Braeden, the head of the CDC team in Ohio, said the widening investigation had to do with the CDC's evolving definition of symptoms.

In an interview with CNN, Dr. Marguerite Erme, the medical director for Summit County Public Health, explained that through interviews, the CDC found out that Vinson may not have been feeling well days before she tested positive for Ebola.

Vinson, Erme said, is believed to have presented with ""non-specific symptoms"" earlier than first thought, so the people on her flight to Cleveland and those who may have been in a bridal shop while she was there are now considered ""contacts.""

In a statement issued early Thursday from Texas Health Presbyterian, the hospital responded to allegations by National Nurses United that protocols and equipment were not up to the task of treating Duncan. The hospital says it followed CDC guidelines at the time.

Texas Health Presbyterian also said it would offer a special room ""to any of our impacted employees who would like to stay here to avoid even the remote possibility of any potential exposure to family, friends and the broader public,"" according to a statement late Wednesday, adding, ""We are doing this for our employees' peace of mind and comfort. This is not a medical recommendation.""

Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the CDC, is also expected to testify before the House subcommittee. In prepared remarks, he calls the current epidemic ""the biggest and most complex Ebola challenge the world has ever faced.""

Frieden confirmed that after Vinson cared for Duncan and while she was being monitored for symptoms, she called the CDC and asked for guidance on whether she should take a flight from Dallas and Cleveland.

""I have not seen the transcript of the conversation. My understanding is that she reported no symptoms to us,"" he said.

Obama has made ramping up efforts to respond to Ebola a priority and wants to make sure what happened in Dallas doesn't happen elsewhere across the country. He said efforts are being taken very seriously at the highest levels of the government.

""As soon as somebody is diagnosed with Ebola, we want a rapid response team, a SWAT team, essentially, from the CDC to be on the ground as quickly as possible — hopefully within 24 hours — so that they are taking the local hospital step by step through exactly what needs to be done and making sure that all the protocols are properly observed; that the use of protective equipment is done effectively; that disposal of that protective equipment is done properly,"" Obama said after Wednesday's Cabinet meeting."

Video inside the Parliament building. The Globe and Mail YouTube

A gunman opened fire at Canada's National War Memorial on Wednesday, killing one soldier, Ottawa police said in a statement.

Witnesses in the Canadian capital, Ottawa, say the gunman then ran into the main Parliament building, where dozens of shots were fired.

Ottawa Police say ""a male suspect has been confirmed deceased,"" but it's unclear how that suspect died or if he died at the Parliament building.

The incident comes after the country raised its terror threat level from low to medium and two days after two Canadian soldiers were run down — one of them killed — in Quebec by a man who reportedly had jihadist sympathies.

In a televised address to his country, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said over the next few days ""we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had.""

But this attack, as well as the one earlier this week, shows that ""Canada is not immune to the type of terrorist attacks we see elsewhere.""

Harper, however, said that this will not intimidate his country. Instead, Canada will redouble its efforts against terrorism, he said, and make sure terrorists find ""no safe haven.""

During a press conference, Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said this is still an ""ongoing investigation"" and asked ""people to stay away from [Ottawa's] downtown core.""

Bordeleau was asked if police were still looking for other suspects, but he would only say that authorities are sweeping Parliament Hill to make sure it is safe.

Bordeleau and an official for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is in charge of investigating what happened on Parliament Hill, said it was too early to assign a motive to the shooting incident.

Even after the sun set, Parliament remained locked down.

This is a breaking news story. We'll update once we know more. And as we always tell you when stories like this are developing, information may come in that later turns out to have been incorrect. We'll do our best to sort through what's out there and reliable and update as needed.

Update at 8:40 p.m. ET. Downtown Ottawa Cleared:

The CBC reported that Zehaf-Bibeau had ""a criminal record in Quebec dating back 10 years on some drug-related charges.""

NBC News reports that Zehaf-Bibeau changed his name and he used be called Michael Joseph Hall.

""Authorities told NBC News they believe Hall had a string of low-level criminal offenses in the past but that they had uncovered no links in the U.S. with anyone being watched in connection with terrorism investigations,"" NBC News reported.

In presidential elections, Democrats have been on the winning end of the gender gap — but that hasn't been true in midterms. Renee Montagne speaks with NPR's Mara Liasson about women in this election.

RENEE MONTAGNE, BYLINE: In this year's midterm elections, the women's vote could be decisive. In presidential elections, Democrats have been on the winning end of the gender gap. More women turn out than men, and they vote more Democratic. But that hasn't been true in midterms. Here to talk about the women's vote is NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning.

MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning.

MONTAGNE: So are there signs that Democrats are holding onto their traditional advantage among women?

LIASSON: In many races, Democrats are still leading with women, but their edge is much, much smaller than it was during the 2012 elections. And the polls look like - a lot like 2010, when the gender gap essentially disappeared and the women's vote split 49 to 49 percent. And don't forget that in 2012, Mitt Romney actually won the married women's vote by about seven points. Barack Obama won the single women's vote, the unmarried women's vote by 29 points, and that's how he won the overall women's vote. And the problem for Democrats is that single women tend to drop off in midterm elections. Their participation rate drops by about 20 points.

MONTAGNE: OK, but what about their efforts to target single women? Is it working insofar as there would be voting Democratic?

LIASSON: When single women turn out to vote, they do vote Democratic, and Democrats have been trying very, very hard to increase the participation of single women this year. They've basically dusted off their playbook from 2012 and 2010. They're running what we call a war-on-women campaign, accusing Republicans of waging a war on women. They've been attacking Republican candidates for supporting personhood amendments, which would give constitutional rights to embryos. In some states, though, like Colorado, Democrats have been criticized for running a campaign that's not about much more than women's reproductive rights. The Denver Post criticized a Democratic Senate candidate there, Mark Udall, for running a, quote, ""obnoxious one-issue campaign."" One of their report called Udall, Mark Uterus. So Democrats are struggling a bit with this, something that's worked for them in the past.

MONTAGNE: Well, what about Republicans, because in the last midterm election and the last presidential election, there were Republican candidates who alienated women - some pretty famous stories, comments about rape and pregnancy.

LIASSON: Well, that's one of the biggest changes this year. You see Republicans acting a lot differently. It's not just that Republicans are not making mistakes like the ones you mentioned; they are affirmatively going after the women's vote this year by changing their positions. For instance, in Colorado, Cory Gardner, the Republican has disavowed his support for a personhood amendment. He's also coming out in favor of over-the-counter birth control, and on that issue, he now agrees with Planned Parenthood. So Republicans aren't fighting the last war, and in some cases, they are really cutting into Democrats' support among women. And that's a real problem for Democrats. They need a big gender gap to win.

MONTAGNE: Well, let's talk about the guys because obviously a big part of the gender gap is the other gender. What's happening with the male vote?

LIASSON: The male vote continues to be a big advantage for Republicans. The latest Washington Post poll show that nationally Republicans have a double-digit advantage with men. Democrats only have a single-digit advantage with women. That's a real problem.

MONTAGNE: Mara, thanks very much.

LIASSON: Thank you.

Turkey says it is assisting Iraqi Kurdish fighters in crossing into Syria to aid their brethren in the embattled city of Kobani, where Kurds have fought a fierce defense action for weeks against besieging Islamic State militants.

""We are assisting peshmerga forces [Iraqi Kurds] to cross into Kobani,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters in Ankara. He added: ""We have no wish at all to see Kobani fall.""

Cavusoglu offered no details.

His remarks come after weeks in which Ankara appeared to dither over the situation just over its border, refusing to send in troops stationed on the border while also blocking its own Kurds from helping in the Syrian fight. It was unclear whether fighters of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, who have fought Turkey for decades to achieve greater autonomy, would also be allowed to cross the border.

The news also follows an announcement by the U.S. Central Command, which is overseeing operations against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, that American C-130 cargo planes had begun airdrops of small arms, ammunition and medical supplies to Kobani's defenders.

The BBC says: ""Turkey has come under pressure from its own Kurdish population, and more widely, to allow fighters in to help push IS out of the town, which has become highly symbolic of the wider battle against IS."""

President Obama is having lunch with congressional leaders at the White House on Friday. This sort of post-election sit-down after power shifts away from the president's party has become something of a Washington tradition. An awkward one.

""Hey Mitch, can you pass the biscuits?""

""And while you're at it, what about tax reform?""

Oh, who are we kidding? They probably don't serve buttery biscuits at this White House. And we may never find out exactly what President Obama and congressional Republicans discuss over lunch.

But if history is a guide, they'll come out and describe it using polite terms like other leaders have following similar post-election get-togethers:

""I thought it was a very positive meeting,"" former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich once said.

""We both extended the hand of friendship,"" said former speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Luke Frazza/AFP/Getty Images Luke Frazza/AFP/Getty Images

And, ""I would call it a very constructive and very friendly conversation,"" came from former President George W. Bush.

""Kumbaya with an edge,"" is what Sheila Burke calls it. She was chief of staff to Bob Dole when he became majority leader of the Senate in 1994 and had his own White House meeting with Gingrich and President Bill Clinton.

""There's no question that there's always some awkwardness when there's been opposition or bitterness. ... But these are folks who are professionals and people who you know, at the heart of it, want to legislate,"" she says.

These meetings happen behind closed doors. And, she says, they can be frank. The president doesn't want to wave a white flag and give up on his agenda. But the new majority has an agenda of its own and a mandate from voters.

Bob Dole spoke at the microphones in the White House driveway after his meeting with Clinton: ""I think the president understands that we're going to hit the ground running.""

It was contentious at first, but ultimately they did come together, most notably on welfare reform.

When Nancy Pelosi went to the White House in 2006, President Bush congratulated her on becoming the first female speaker of the House.

""The congresswoman's party won, but the challenges still remain,"" he said.

Pelosi told Bush to expect a raft of bills from the Democratic Congress, including one to raise the minimum wage. ""We've made history. Now we have to make progress,"" she said.

Bush signed those bills into law, cementing what John Lawrence says was a solid working relationship. Lawrence was Pelosi's chief of staff. He says the strength of that relationship was proven in 2008 during the financial crisis when at Bush's request Pelosi pushed through the financial industry rescue known as TARP.

""That level of trust and collaboration could not have been constructed if there had not been a harmonious working relationship, not withstanding policy differences,"" Lawrence says.

There are plenty of policy differences for Obama to discuss with the GOP leaders at lunch this afternoon, from Obamacare to immigration. But in an interview with NPR's All Things Considered, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough seemed optimistic.

""Judging from the conversations that he, the president, has been having and many of us have been having with our colleagues up on the Hill, I think it should be a productive conversation.""

No word on whether any biscuits or Kentucky bourbon are on the menu."

But nobody predicted that the first legislation Congress would take up would be the Mary Landrieu Preservation Act of 2014. Landrieu, a Democratic senator from Louisiana, is struggling to keep her seat in a runoff next month, and it doesn’t look good: Republican candidates got a combined 56 percent in last week’s election.

So in a last-gasp effort — a Hail Mary, as Capitol Hill reporters were calling it — Landrieu took to the Senate floor as soon as it opened Wednesday after the long fall recess and demanded passage of one of her home state’s pet causes: the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a Republican priority that Democrats have blocked for the last several years because of environmental objections. After taking the floor, she didn’t let it go for most of the next three hours.

“I want to say yes to new majority leader Mitch McConnell,” she proclaimed. “The time to start is now.”

Follow this author Dana Milbank 's opinions Follow

Landrieu made no attempt to hide her motive. “I’m going to do everything in my power here and at home on the campaign trail, where I’m still in a runoff, as you know, to get this project moving forward,” she said.

Republicans were thrilled. Just 40 minutes after Landrieu went to the Senate floor, House GOP leaders announced that they would pass the very same bill on Tuesday — and little surprise. The lead sponsor of the House version of the bill, Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), is Landrieu’s opponent in the runoff, and the move would guarantee that he would share credit (and perhaps get his name on the final bill instead of hers).

Suddenly, the full legislative force of the government has been marshaled to try to tilt the results of the Senate runoff in Louisiana. And voters thought lawmakers couldn’t get together to do what’s best for the nation?

Landrieu, upon hearing of the House’s move, exulted on the Senate floor. “They plan to pass it tomorrow! Let me just say, hallelujah! I’ll say it again: Hallelujah!”

But the exultant Landrieu had put her fellow Democrats in an awkward spot. Approval of the pipeline was likely to happen eventually, but Obama could have extracted significant concessions from the Republicans for it. Now they may be giving away that chit for nothing, to aide a colleague in a race she’s unlikely to win anyway. Even if she does, it’s the difference between a 54-to-46 Republican Senate majority and a 53-to-47 Republican Senate majority.

Republicans were ebullient, even before Landrieu's unilateral concession. McConnell rarely smiles, and when he does it often comes out a grimace, but he was beaming when he posed in his office with 10 newly elected Senate Republicans for a photo op. He used the occasion to condemn President Obama for the climate-change agreement Obama struck with China, and he continued to lecture the president when he appeared a couple of hours later on the Senate floor.

Harry Reid (D-Nev.), just dethroned as majority leader, made a resentful pledge to cooperate with the new majority. “I saw firsthand how a strategy of destruction is debilitating to our system,” he said, clearly referring to McConnell’s time in the minority. “I have no desire to engage in that manner.”

But if Reid was grudging, Landrieu was throwing herself at the Republicans, trying to save herself by pushing through the “Hoeven-Landrieu” bill she sponsored with Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.).

“It needs to get done right now. Not in January. Not in February. Not in March,” she said with the urgency of a woman facing a December runoff.

She scheduled a news conference in the Capitol basement, and three dozen reporters and cameramen came to capture the spectacle. “We will pass this in the lame duck,” she predicted.

NBC’s Kasie Hunt was skeptical. “Are you a lost cause?” she asked.

“I don’t believe I am,” Landrieu replied.

David Espo of the Associated Press asked if there’s any indication Obama would sign the bill.

“I do not have a commitment,” she acknowledged with a chuckle.

Because of Senate rules, any senator could have blocked a vote on the Keystone measure when Landrieu finally made her “unanimous consent” request Wednesday evening that the Senate vote on the bill Tuesday. Republicans, naturally, didn’t object.

What was more interesting was that Reid and leading liberals, including Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), were on the floor, but not a single Democrat objected. Apparently, if it takes a pipeline to transport Mary Landrieu back to the Senate, Democrats were willing to build it.

Enlarge this image toggle caption AFP/AFP/Getty Images AFP/AFP/Getty Images

After a nearly two-year investigation, the final report by the House Intelligence Committee concludes that the CIA ""ensured sufficient security for CIA facilities in Benghazi and ... bravely assisted the State Department"" on Sept. 11, 2012, during a deadly attack on U.S. facilities in Libya.

That's the first conclusion of the report, the result of thousands of hours of investigation into the events that led to the deaths of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

Many of the following conclusions echo a central theme, that ""there was no intelligence failure prior to the attacks,"" as the report states.

But the committee also found that the U.S. diplomats' Temporary Mission Facility ""was not well-protected,"" the AP reports, ""and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack.""

In addition, the panel said the Obama administration's ""initial public narrative"" about the reasons behind the attacks ""were not fully accurate.""

Citing ""a stream of contradictory and conflicting intelligence that came in after the attacks,"" the report states that while some early information had backed the CIA's initial belief that the violence stemmed from a protest in Benghazi, ""contrary intelligence"" showed that that was not the case.

""There was no protest,"" the report reads. ""The CIA only changed its initial assessment about a protest on September 24, 2012, when closed caption television footage became available on September 18, 2012 (two days after Ambassador Susan Rice spoke), and after the FBI began publishing its interviews with U.S. officials on the ground on September 22, 2012.""

The report also cites a ""flawed"" process that was used to create talking points that the House panel had asked for so that its members could discuss the attacks publicly. It notes that the same talking points were used in Rice's public statements.

In their summary of the 36-page report (which also has six appendixes), the report's authors — House committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a Republican, and ranking Democratic member C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger — say that their panel ""found no evidence that any officer was intimidated, wrongly forced to sign a nondisclosure agreement or otherwise kept from speaking to Congress, or polygraphed because of their presence in Benghazi.""

And in a statement that seems to take aim at a theory popularized by some media outlets, the report states, ""The CIA was not collecting and shipping arms from Libya to Syria.""

Earlier this year, a Senate Intelligence Committee report said that the attacks ""were likely preventable.""

But as the Two-Way reported back in January, that report also ""takes issue with lawmakers who have been using the Obama administration's initial statements about the attacks to make the case that the White House tried to downplay whether they were the work of terrorists.""

Noting that the report ""was released with little fanfare on the Friday before Thanksgiving week,"" the AP says, ""Many of its findings echo those of six previous investigations by various congressional committees and a State Department panel."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images

After sitting through hours of testimony and reading through thousands of pages of documents, a grand jury decided that there was not enough probable cause to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old.

Their decision, like the shooting that led up to all this, sparked violent protests overnight in Ferguson, Mo.

""The duty of the grand jury is to separate fact and fiction,"" the prosecuting attorney, Robert McCulloch, said in a televised address Monday night. After weighing the evidence, the grand jury decided that Wilson acted within the limits of the lethal-force law. To issue an indictment, the jury needed at least 9 members to vote for it.

In a rare move and in an attempt to allay concerns about bias, McCulloch made public the mountain of evidence presented to the grand jury. We're combing through the thousands of pages — including testimony from Wilson and many witnesses — and throughout the day, we'll update this post with the pieces that help explain how the jury reached its decision.

Last Updated at 11:14 a.m. ET. Witness Testimony:

Leading up to this decision, witness testimony has been hotly debated — so much so that the symbol of this story has become protesters raising their hands, symbolically telling police, ""Hands up, don't shoot.""

We have documents of dozens of witness interviews. If you listened to McCulloch last night, much of this jury's decision came down to whether Brown was charging Wilson or surrendering or running away.

As we've detailed in another post, it's really complicated. Some witnesses say Wilson started shooting after he got out of the car; some say he started shooting inside the car. Some say Brown was very clearly surrendering, others say it didn't look like he had been hit at all.

Perhaps the simplest way to explain all of this is to take a close look at Witness 14.

Without a doubt, Witness 14 is sympathetic to Brown and, in fact, had run into him at least once in the past.

""[Brown] was to me, and I'm going to say it, he was executed,"" the witness said. ""[Wilson] had made up his mind he was going to kill him.""

That was the witness' conclusion — that as Brown was shot, he was surrendering, he had his hands up.

That's what the witness told local authorities. But when the feds interviewed Witness 14 and drilled down on the details, the witness' assumptions became less clear.

Were Brown's hands a sign of surrender? Or was he checking his injuries? Were his palms facing the officer or facing Brown?

The witness eventually says: ""He was defenseless, hands up, he was trying to stay on his feet and you could see that his knees was beginning to buckle and he was going down.""

But the investigator eventually gets to a very important point. He leads the witness to say that Brown was moving toward Officer Wilson, who was screaming, ""Stop,"" as he fired his weapon:

Last Updated at 12:30 p.m. ET. Wilson Testimony:

Wilson's testimony to the grand jury presents the image of an officer who was scared for his life during the confrontation with the larger man who he says was physically assaulting him. One excerpt:

Wilson is 6 feet, 4 inches tall and weighs about 210 pounds. Brown was an inch taller and weighed about 290 pounds.

The officer said Brown and his associate, Dorian Johnson, were walking in the middle of the street, preventing normal traffic from passing. He said he told them to move to the sidewalk, and after a brief exchange Brown used a vulgarity at him. Wilson said he called for backup and tried open the door of his police car. Brown, he said, slammed the door shut. They struggled and Brown hit him in the face twice, Wilson said.

He said he thought, ""What do I do to not get beaten inside my car?""

Wilson said he had considered using Mace, his baton and his flashlight before drawing his gun and telling Brown, ""Get back or I'm going to shoot you."" Brown then grabbed his gun, Wilson said, and twisted it and dug it down into the officer's hip. The officer said he feared he would die if Brown got hold of the gun. He said he managed to raise the gun and fired twice. It just clicked. But the third time, the gun went off, startling both men.

That's when, Wilson said, Brown looked up at him ""and had the most intense aggressive face. The only way I can describe it, it looks like a demon, that's how angry he looked. He comes back towards me again with his hands up.""

Wilson said he tried firing again but nothing happened. When he tried once more, it went off. Brown then hit him again, he said.

The officer said that when he looked up, Brown was running away. Wilson said he got out of the car, called for backup and began chasing Brown. He said Brown then stopped and he did, too. He said he ordered Brown to get on the ground, but the 18-year-old did not. He said Brown made an ""aggravated sound"" and ran back toward him. He said he warned Brown repeatedly to get on the ground, but when he did not comply the officer fired ""a series of shots.""

""I don't know how many I shot, I just know I shot it,"" he said.

Wilson then proceeded to explain his rationale for why he chased Brown. He said he wanted to keep Brown ""contained"" until support arrived. He said he thought that if he could buy 30 seconds of time, until other officers arrived, they could ""make the arrest, nothing happens, we are all good.""

""And it didn't happen that way,"" Wilson said.

Last Updated at 3:47 p.m. ET. The Physical Evidence:

One really important part of this case is of course the physical evidence. We've gone into more details in a separate post.

There are two findings of major importance: First, the autopsy found that Michael Brown was never shot in the back, as some early witnesses claimed.

Second, they found Brown's blood inside the police car and on Wilson's gun. This implies that there was close-range contact as Wilson alleges.

We've also posted the photographs taken of Wilson on the day of the confrontation. Doctors diagnosed him with a bruise. That seems to cast some doubt on Wilson's testimony about the intensity of the confrontation.

Update at 2:45 p.m. ET

The mayor of Ferguson, Mo., says he plans to launch a number of initiatives to calm tensions in the the city in the wake of the fatal police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

James Knowles, speaking at a news conference today, said the city was creating a civilian review board that would provide input on police affairs. He also said the city would begin a scholarship program to recruit more black officers in the town where African-Americans make up more than half the population but only a handful of the police force.

The aim of the program, Knowles said, is to create a police force that is ""more reflective of the demographics of Ferguson."" He added that the city wants to be ""proactive with the next academy class"" because it would take time to get new minority recruits trained and on the streets.

Knowles said Ferguson would also increase a stipend to officers living in the city from $100 to $300 a month.

Earlier, Neil Bruntrager, an attorney for Darren Wilson, the officer who shot and killed Brown and whose resignation from the force became public yesterday, told The Associated Press that his client had decided to resign because ""the information we had was that there would be actions targeting the Ferguson (police) department or buildings in Ferguson related to the police department.""

But although Police Chief Thomas Jackson acknowledged that threats had been made, Knowles said he was unaware of any specific threat leading to Wilson's decision to step down.

Knowles said he had not asked for Wilson's resignation and that there had been ""no severance agreement"" involved.

""I think it's best that at this time we continue to move on as a community,"" the mayor told reporters.

Jackson said that he had no intention himself of resigning.

The news conference today follows a night in which a few hundred people protested in Ferguson over a grand jury's decision last week not to indict Wilson over the killing.

The St. Louis Post Dispatch says that ""outside the Ferguson police department, about 150 to 200 protesters gathered to chant and wave signs and flags. At about 8:45 p.m., they marched South on South Florissant Road."" The newspaper says one arrest was made after a man threw a bottle at police.

St. Louis Public Radio live blogged the evening's marches and protests here.

In Portland, Ore., police made 10 arrests in a demonstration related to events in Ferguson.

As we reported on Saturday, in his resignation letter, Wilson said his quitting the force ""will allow the community to heal.

""It was my hope to continue in police work, but the safety of other police officers and the community are of paramount importance to me,"" he wrote.

Wilson had been on administrative leave since the Aug. 9 shooting."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Cliff Owen/AP Cliff Owen/AP

""The report is full of crap.""

That's what former Vice President Dick Cheney told Fox News in an interview about a Senate investigation that found the Central Intelligence Agency used brutal techniques to interrogate terrorism suspects and then misled lawmakers, the White House and Congress about what they were doing.

Cheney was combative and unrepentant, saying both he and then-President George W. Bush knew full well the techniques being used on detainees. Bush, he said, was an ""integral part of the program"" and ""had to approve it before we went through with it.""

Fox's Bret Baier pressed Cheney with specific details about some of the horrible things some prisoners were subjected to, including rectal rehydration. Cheney said what the administration approved was not tantamount to torture, but he added:

--""I have no sympathy for them [the detainees].""

-- ""How nice do you want to be to the murderers of 3,000 Americans on 9/11?""

-- ""I'd do it again in a minute.""

-- The CIA did ""a hell of a job and they deserve our gratitude.""

-- The end ""absolutely"" justified the means.

2243,2243,http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/12/22/372531702/widespread-internet-outage-reported-in-north-korea,1,"Lengthy, Widespread Internet Outage Reported In North Korea

Update, 10 p.m. ET: After more than nine hours and 30 minutes, Internet service has been restored in North Korea, according to technology news service Dyn Research. Access is only partial, Reuters reports, but the country's main news service and newspaper both are back online.

Original post: North Korea's Internet is offline — days after President Obama pledged a ""proportional response"" to the communist country's alleged hacking of Sony Pictures, multiple news reports say.

Doug Madory, the director of Internet analysis at Dyn Research, told The New York Times and other news organizations that North Korea's Internet access became unstable late Friday. By Monday, it was offline, he said.

San Francisco-based CloudFlare, a network and security company that monitors global Web access, told The Times that North Korea's Internet access was ""toast.""

It's unclear what caused the outage, but State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said today: ""We aren't going to discuss publicly operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way except to say that as we implement our responses, some will be seen, some may not be seen.""

In an interview with NPR's Elise Hu, Matthew Prince, chief executive of CloudFlare, pointed to four possible scenarios: North Korea turned off its own Internet; China's upstream provider turned it off; the country's routers failed at an unfortunate time; or it was the result of a denial-of-service attack from either a hacking group or the U.S. Prince said he thinks it's unlikely the U.S. was behind the reported outage.

North Korea has one of the lowest Internet penetrations in the world — with access limited mostly to the country's elite. The U.S. has linked the recent hacking of Sony Pictures to North Korean hackers, though North Korea itself has denied it is responsible — even though it called the act righteous. There are computer security experts who question whether Pyongyang is behind the hack.

Last week, Sony canceled the planned Christmas Day release of The Interview, a comedy that centers on a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The decision followed threats against moviegoers and theaters that showed the film. The threats were attributed to the group that claimed responsibility for hacking Sony."
2273,2273,http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/01/02/374529943/watch-mario-cuomos-1984-speech-to-democratic-convention,1,"Thank you.

On behalf of the great Empire State and the whole family of New York, let me thank you for the great privilege of being able to address this convention. Please allow me to skip the stories and the poetry and the temptation to deal in nice but vague rhetoric. Let me instead use this valuable opportunity to deal immediately with the questions that should determine this election and that we all know are vital to the American people.

Ten days ago, President Reagan admitted that although some people in this country seemed to be doing well nowadays, others were unhappy, even worried, about themselves, their families, and their futures. The President said that he didn't understand that fear. He said, ""Why, this country is a shining city on a hill."" And the President is right. In many ways we are a shining city on a hill.

But the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and glory. A shining city is perhaps all the President sees from the portico of the White House and the veranda of his ranch, where everyone seems to be doing well. But there's another city; there's another part to the shining the city; the part where some people can't pay their mortgages, and most young people can't afford one; where students can't afford the education they need, and middle-class parents watch the dreams they hold for their children evaporate.

In this part of the city there are more poor than ever, more families in trouble, more and more people who need help but can't find it. Even worse: There are elderly people who tremble in the basements of the houses there. And there are people who sleep in the city streets, in the gutter, where the glitter doesn't show. There are ghettos where thousands of young people, without a job or an education, give their lives away to drug dealers every day. There is despair, Mr. President, in the faces that you don't see, in the places that you don't visit in your shining city.

In fact, Mr. President, this is a nation — Mr. President you ought to know that this nation is more a ""Tale of Two Cities"" than it is just a ""Shining City on a Hill.""

Maybe, maybe, Mr. President, if you visited some more places; maybe if you went to Appalachia where some people still live in sheds; maybe if you went to Lackawanna where thousands of unemployed steel workers wonder why we subsidized foreign steel. Maybe — Maybe, Mr. President, if you stopped in at a shelter in Chicago and spoke to the homeless there; maybe, Mr. President, if you asked a woman who had been denied the help she needed to feed her children because you said you needed the money for a tax break for a millionaire or for a missile we couldn't afford to use.

Maybe — Maybe, Mr. President. But I'm afraid not. Because the truth is, ladies and gentlemen, that this is how we were warned it would be. President Reagan told us from the very beginning that he believed in a kind of social Darwinism. Survival of the fittest. ""Government can't do everything,"" we were told, so it should settle for taking care of the strong and hope that economic ambition and charity will do the rest. Make the rich richer, and what falls from the table will be enough for the middle class and those who are trying desperately to work their way into the middle class.

You know, the Republicans called it ""trickle-down"" when Hoover tried it. Now they call it ""supply side."" But it's the same shining city for those relative few who are lucky enough to live in its good neighborhoods. But for the people who are excluded, for the people who are locked out, all they can do is stare from a distance at that city's glimmering towers.

It's an old story. It's as old as our history. The difference between Democrats and Republicans has always been measured in courage and confidence. The Republicans — The Republicans believe that the wagon train will not make it to the frontier unless some of the old, some of the young, some of the weak are left behind by the side of the trail. ""The strong"" — ""The strong,"" they tell us, ""will inherit the land.""

We Democrats believe in something else. We democrats believe that we can make it all the way with the whole family intact, and we have more than once. Ever since Franklin Roosevelt lifted himself from his wheelchair to lift this nation from its knees — wagon train after wagon train — to new frontiers of education, housing, peace; the whole family aboard, constantly reaching out to extend and enlarge that family; lifting them up into the wagon on the way; blacks and Hispanics, and people of every ethnic group, and native Americans — all those struggling to build their families and claim some small share of America. For nearly 50 years we carried them all to new levels of comfort, and security, and dignity, even affluence. And remember this, some of us in this room today are here only because this nation had that kind of confidence. And it would be wrong to forget that.

So, here we are at this convention to remind ourselves where we come from and to claim the future for ourselves and for our children. Today our great Democratic Party, which has saved this nation from depression, from fascism, from racism, from corruption, is called upon to do it again — this time to save the nation from confusion and division, from the threat of eventual fiscal disaster, and most of all from the fear of a nuclear holocaust.

That's not going to be easy. Mo Udall is exactly right — it won't be easy. And in order to succeed, we must answer our opponent's polished and appealing rhetoric with a more telling reasonableness and rationality.

We must win this case on the merits. We must get the American public to look past the glitter, beyond the showmanship to the reality, the hard substance of things. And we'll do it not so much with speeches that sound good as with speeches that are good and sound; not so much with speeches that will bring people to their feet as with speeches that will bring people to their senses. We must make — We must make the American people hear our ""Tale of Two Cities."" We must convince them that we don't have to settle for two cities, that we can have one city, indivisible, shining for all of its people.

Now, we will have no chance to do that if what comes out of this convention is a babel of arguing voices. If that's what's heard throughout the campaign, dissident sounds from all sides, we will have no chance to tell our message. To succeed we will have to surrender some small parts of our individual interests, to build a platform that we can all stand on, at once, and comfortably — proudly singing out. We need — We need a platform we can all agree to so that we can sing out the truth for the nation to hear, in chorus, its logic so clear and commanding that no slick Madison Avenue commercial, no amount of geniality, no martial music will be able to muffle the sound of the truth.

And we Democrats must unite. We Democrats must unite so that the entire nation can unite, because surely the Republicans won't bring this country together. Their policies divide the nation into the lucky and the left-out, into the royalty and the rabble. The Republicans are willing to treat that division as victory. They would cut this nation in half, into those temporarily better off and those worse off than before, and they would call that division recovery.

Now, we should not — we should not be embarrassed or dismayed or chagrined if the process of unifying is difficult, even wrenching at times. Remember that, unlike any other Party, we embrace men and women of every color, every creed, every orientation, every economic class. In our family are gathered everyone from the abject poor of Essex County in New York, to the enlightened affluent of the gold coasts at both ends of the nation. And in between is the heart of our constituency — the middle class, the people not rich enough to be worry-free, but not poor enough to be on welfare; the middle class — those people who work for a living because they have to, not because some psychiatrist told them it was a convenient way to fill the interval between birth and eternity. White collar and blue collar. Young professionals. Men and women in small business desperate for the capital and contracts that they need to prove their worth.

We speak for the minorities who have not yet entered the mainstream. We speak for ethnics who want to add their culture to the magnificent mosaic that is America. We speak — We speak for women who are indignant that this nation refuses to etch into its governmental commandments the simple rule ""thou shalt not sin against equality,"" a rule so simple --

I was going to say, and I perhaps dare not but I will. It's a commandment so simple it can be spelled in three letters: E.R.A.

We speak — We speak for young people demanding an education and a future. We speak for senior citizens. We speak for senior citizens who are terrorized by the idea that their only security, their Social Security, is being threatened. We speak for millions of reasoning people fighting to preserve our environment from greed and from stupidity. And we speak for reasonable people who are fighting to preserve our very existence from a macho intransigence that refuses to make intelligent attempts to discuss the possibility of nuclear holocaust with our enemy. They refuse. They refuse, because they believe we can pile missiles so high that they will pierce the clouds and the sight of them will frighten our enemies into submission.

Now we're proud of this diversity as Democrats. We're grateful for it. We don't have to manufacture it the way the Republicans will next month in Dallas, by propping up mannequin delegates on the convention floor. But we, while we're proud of this diversity, we pay a price for it. The different people that we represent have different points of view. And sometimes they compete and even debate, and even argue. That's what our primaries were all about. But now the primaries are over and it is time, when we pick our candidates and our platform here, to lock arms and move into this campaign together.

If you need any more inspiration to put some small part of your own difference aside to create this consensus, then all you need to do is to reflect on what the Republican policy of divide and cajole has done to this land since 1980. Now the President has asked the American people to judge him on whether or not he's fulfilled the promises he made four years ago. I believe, as Democrats, we ought to accept that challenge. And just for a moment let us consider what he has said and what he's done.

Inflation — Inflation is down since 1980, but not because of the supply-side miracle promised to us by the President. Inflation was reduced the old-fashioned way: with a recession, the worst since 1932. Now how did we — We could have brought inflation down that way. How did he do it? 55,000 bankruptcies; two years of massive unemployment; 200,000 farmers and ranchers forced off the land; more homeless — more homeless than at any time since the Great Depression in 1932; more hungry, in this world of enormous affluence, the United States of America, more hungry; more poor, most of them women. And — And he paid one other thing, a nearly 200 billion dollar deficit threatening our future.

Now, we must make the American people understand this deficit because they don't. The President's deficit is a direct and dramatic repudiation of his promise in 1980 to balance the budget by 1983. How large is it? The deficit is the largest in the history of the universe. It — President Carter's last budget had a deficit less than one-third of this deficit. It is a deficit that, according to the President's own fiscal adviser, may grow to as much 300 billion dollars a year for ""as far as the eye can see."" And, ladies and gentlemen, it is a debt so large — that is almost one-half of the money we collect from the personal income tax each year goes just to pay the interest. It is a mortgage on our children's future that can be paid only in pain and that could bring this nation to its knees.

Now don't take my word for it — I'm a Democrat. Ask the Republican investment bankers on Wall Street what they think the chances of this recovery being permanent are. You see, if they're not too embarrassed to tell you the truth, they'll say that they're appalled and frightened by the President's deficit. Ask them what they think of our economy, now that it's been driven by the distorted value of the dollar back to its colonial condition. Now we're exporting agricultural products and importing manufactured ones. Ask those Republican investment bankers what they expect the rate of interest to be a year from now. And ask them — if they dare tell you the truth — you'll learn from them, what they predict for the inflation rate a year from now, because of the deficit.

Now, how important is this question of the deficit. Think about it practically: What chance would the Republican candidate have had in 1980 if he had told the American people that he intended to pay for his so-called economic recovery with bankruptcies, unemployment, more homeless, more hungry, and the largest government debt known to humankind? If he had told the voters in 1980 that truth, would American voters have signed the loan certificate for him on Election Day? Of course not! That was an election won under false pretenses. It was won with smoke and mirrors and illusions. And that's the kind of recovery we have now as well.

But what about foreign policy? They said that they would make us and the whole world safer. They say they have. By creating the largest defense budget in history, one that even they now admit is excessive — by escalating to a frenzy the nuclear arms race; by incendiary rhetoric; by refusing to discuss peace with our enemies; by the loss of 279 young Americans in Lebanon in pursuit of a plan and a policy that no one can find or describe.

We give money to Latin American governments that murder nuns, and then we lie about it. We have been less than zealous in support of our only real friend — it seems to me, in the Middle East — the one democracy there, our flesh and blood ally, the state of Israel. Our — Our policy — Our foreign policy drifts with no real direction, other than an hysterical commitment to an arms race that leads nowhere — if we're lucky. And if we're not, it could lead us into bankruptcy or war.

Of course we must have a strong defense! Of course Democrats are for a strong defense. Of course Democrats believe that there are times that we must stand and fight. And we have. Thousands of us have paid for freedom with our lives. But always — when this country has been at its best — our purposes were clear. Now they're not. Now our allies are as confused as our enemies. Now we have no real commitment to our friends or to our ideals — not to human rights, not to the refuseniks, not to Sakharov, not to Bishop Tutu and the others struggling for freedom in South Africa.

We — We have in the last few years spent more than we can afford. We have pounded our chests and made bold speeches. But we lost 279 young Americans in Lebanon and we live behind sand bags in Washington. How can anyone say that we are safer, stronger, or better?

That — That is the Republican record. That its disastrous quality is not more fully understood by the American people I can only attribute to the President's amiability and the failure by some to separate the salesman from the product.

And, now — now — now it's up to us. Now it's up to you and to me to make the case to America. And to remind Americans that if they are not happy with all that the President has done so far, they should consider how much worse it will be if he is left to his radical proclivities for another four years unrestrained. Unrestrained.

Now, if — if July — if July brings back Ann Gorsuch Burford — what can we expect of December? Where would — Where would another four years take us? Where would four years more take us? How much larger will the deficit be? How much deeper the cuts in programs for the struggling middle class and the poor to limit that deficit? How high will the interest rates be? How much more acid rain killing our forests and fouling our lakes?

And, ladies and gentlemen, please think of this — the nation must think of this: What kind of Supreme Court will we have?

Please. [beckons audience to settle down]

We — We must ask ourselves what kind of court and country will be fashioned by the man who believes in having government mandate people's religion and morality; the man who believes that trees pollute the environment; the man that believes that — that the laws against discrimination against people go too far; a man who threatens Social Security and Medicaid and help for the disabled. How high will we pile the missiles? How much deeper will the gulf be between us and our enemies? And, ladies and gentlemen, will four years more make meaner the spirit of the American people? This election will measure the record of the past four years. But more than that, it will answer the question of what kind of people we want to be.

We Democrats still have a dream. We still believe in this nation's future. And this is our answer to the question. This is our credo:

We believe in only the government we need, but we insist on all the government we need.

We believe in a government that is characterized by fairness and reasonableness, a reasonableness that goes beyond labels, that doesn't distort or promise to do things that we know we can't do.

We believe in a government strong enough to use words like ""love"" and ""compassion"" and smart enough to convert our noblest aspirations into practical realities.

We believe in encouraging the talented, but we believe that while survival of the fittest may be a good working description of the process of evolution, a government of humans should elevate itself to a higher order.

We — Our — Our government — Our government should be able to rise to the level where it can fill the gaps that are left by chance or by a wisdom we don't fully understand. We would rather have laws written by the patron of this great city, the man called the ""world's most sincere Democrat,"" St. Francis of Assisi, than laws written by Darwin.

We believe — We believe as Democrats, that a society as blessed as ours, the most affluent democracy in the world's history, one that can spend trillions on instruments of destruction, ought to be able to help the middle class in its struggle, ought to be able to find work for all who can do it, room at the table, shelter for the homeless, care for the elderly and infirm, and hope for the destitute. And we proclaim as loudly as we can the utter insanity of nuclear proliferation and the need for a nuclear freeze, if only to affirm the simple truth that peace is better than war because life is better than death.

We believe in firm — We believe in firm but fair law and order.

We believe proudly in the union movement.

We believe in a — We believe — We believe in privacy for people, openness by government.

We believe in civil rights, and we believe in human rights.

We believe in a single — We believe in a single fundamental idea that describes better than most textbooks and any speech that I could write what a proper government should be: the idea of family, mutuality, the sharing of benefits and burdens for the good of all, feeling one another's pain, sharing one another's blessings — reasonably, honestly, fairly, without respect to race, or sex, or geography, or political affiliation.

We believe we must be the family of America, recognizing that at the heart of the matter we are bound one to another, that the problems of a retired school teacher in Duluth are our problems; that the future of the child — that the future of the child in Buffalo is our future; that the struggle of a disabled man in Boston to survive and live decently is our struggle; that the hunger of a woman in Little Rock is our hunger; that the failure anywhere to provide what reasonably we might, to avoid pain, is our failure.

Now for 50 years — for 50 years we Democrats created a better future for our children, using traditional Democratic principles as a fixed beacon, giving us direction and purpose, but constantly innovating, adapting to new realities: Roosevelt's alphabet programs; Truman's NATO and the GI Bill of Rights; Kennedy's intelligent tax incentives and the Alliance for Progress; Johnson's civil rights; Carter's human rights and the nearly miraculous Camp David Peace Accord.

Democrats did it — Democrats did it and Democrats can do it again. We can build a future that deals with our deficit. Remember this, that 50 years of progress under our principles never cost us what the last four years of stagnation have. And we can deal with the deficit intelligently, by shared sacrifice, with all parts of the nation's family contributing, building partnerships with the private sector, providing a sound defense without depriving ourselves of what we need to feed our children and care for our people. We can have a future that provides for all the young of the present, by marrying common sense and compassion.

We know we can, because we did it for nearly 50 years before 1980. And we can do it again, if we do not forget — if we do not forget that this entire nation has profited by these progressive principles; that they helped lift up generations to the middle class and higher; that they gave us a chance to work, to go to college, to raise a family, to own a house, to be secure in our old age and, before that, to reach heights that our own parents would not have dared dream of.

That struggle to live with dignity is the real story of the shining city. And it's a story, ladies and gentlemen, that I didn't read in a book, or learn in a classroom. I saw it and lived it, like many of you. I watched a small man with thick calluses on both his hands work 15 and 16 hours a day. I saw him once literally bleed from the bottoms of his feet, a man who came here uneducated, alone, unable to speak the language, who taught me all I needed to know about faith and hard work by the simple eloquence of his example. I learned about our kind of democracy from my father. And I learned about our obligation to each other from him and from my mother. They asked only for a chance to work and to make the world better for their children, and they — they asked to be protected in those moments when they would not be able to protect themselves. This nation and this nation's government did that for them.

And that they were able to build a family and live in dignity and see one of their children go from behind their little grocery store in South Jamaica on the other side of the tracks where he was born, to occupy the highest seat, in the greatest State, in the greatest nation, in the only world we would know, is an ineffably beautiful tribute to the democratic process.

And — And ladies and gentlemen, on January 20, 1985, it will happen again — only on a much, much grander scale. We will have a new President of the United States, a Democrat born not to the blood of kings but to the blood of pioneers and immigrants. And we will have America's first woman Vice President, the child of immigrants, and she — she — she will open with one magnificent stroke, a whole new frontier for the United States.

Now, it will happen. It will happen if we make it happen; if you and I make it happen. And I ask you now, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, for the good of all of us, for the love of this great nation, for the family of America, for the love of God: Please, make this nation remember how futures are built.

Thank you and God bless you."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Brennan Linsley/AP Brennan Linsley/AP

The U.S. has transferred five detainees from Guantanamo Bay — four to Oman and one to Estonia, the Defense Department says. The transfers bring to 122 the number of detainees who remain at the military prison.

The detainees sent to Oman are Al Khadr Abdallah Muhammad Al Yafi, Fadel Hussein Saleh Hentif, Abd Al-Rahman Abdullah Au Shabati and Mohammed Ahmed Salam; the lone detainee moved to Estonia is Akhmed Abdul Qadir. All of the men are Yemeni.

The transfers were announced late Wednesday and follow a review of the detainees' cases by the interagency Guantanamo Review Task Force.

""As a result of that review, which examined a number of factors, including security issues, [they were] ... approved for transfer by the six departments and agencies comprising the task force,"" the statements said, adding Congress was informed of the transfers.

The Miami Herald's Carol Rosenberg, who has been covering the story of the Guantanamo detainees from the beginning, reports:

""All five freed detainees got to Guantánamo in the prison camps' early days. None was ever charged with a crime and all had been cleared for transfer for years. But, as Yemenis, they could not go home because U.S. officials feared they would be lured to al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the terror group that Wednesday claimed responsibility for last week's attack on the French satire newspaper Charlie Hebdo.""

Indeed, the Paris attacks may have complicated President Obama's desire to close the prison — a desire he expressed while still a presidential candidate. This week, congressional Republicans said the Paris attacks showed that ""now is not the time to be emptying Guantanamo.""

GOP senators introduced legislation this week that would, according to The Associated Press, ""bar transfers to Yemen for two years, suspend the transfer of high- or medium-risk terror suspects for the same period and repeal current law that has allowed the administration to transfer prisoners to foreign countries and reduce the population at Guantanamo. The bill would prohibit transfers of terror suspects to foreign countries if there has been a confirmed case where an individual was transferred from Guantanamo and engaged in any terrorist activity.""

The lawmakers say the recidivism rate for freed detainees who have re-entered the battlefield is as high as 30 percent. But a State Department official disputed those figures.

A September 2014 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on recidivism by freed Guantanamo detainees found that before 2009 detainees ""confirmed of re-engaging"" was 19 percent while detainees ""suspected of re-engaging"" was 14.3 percent. After 2009, the report found, detainees ""confirmed of re-engaging"" was 6.8 percent while detainees ""suspected of re-engaging"" was 1.1 percent.

As we have been reporting, there have been several detainees released from the naval detention center. Prisoners have been transferred to Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Uruguay, Georgia and Slovakia.

The facility, which held 680 prisoners in 2003, holds detainees captured in the war on terrorism that followed the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Thursday revealed a bit more about his tax history, telling reporters: ""I never paid less than 13 percent"" in the past 10 years.

The Obama campaign's response: ""Prove it.""

Romney's statement came during an appearance in South Carolina and followed weeks of demands — mostly from Democrats, but also from some Republicans — that Romney release several years of his tax returns.

He has released his 2010 tax returns, which showed an effective federal tax rate of 13.9 percent, and has promised to release his 2011 returns before the election.

The Senate's top Democrat, Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, has claimed that an unnamed source told him Romney paid no taxes over the past decade.

""I did go back and look at my taxes and over the past 10 years I never paid less than 13 percent,"" said Romney, who was in South Carolina for a fundraiser. ""I think the most recent year is 13.6 or something like that. So I paid taxes every single year. Harry Reid's charge is totally false.""

Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith responded in a statement: ""Since there is substantial reason to doubt his claims, we have a simple message for him: prove it. ... Given Mitt Romney's secrecy about his returns ... he has forfeited the right to have us take him just at his word.""

Romney is under no legal requirement to release more tax records. But his wealth (which Forbes estimates at $230 million), the campaign's emphasis on economic issues and tax rates, and recent political history would indicate that the calls for Romney to release more tax records will continue.

Since 1980 (when Republican Ronald Reagan released just one year of returns) only one party nominee or presumptive nominee other than Romney has released fewer than six years of returns, according to PolitiFact. That was Republican John McCain, who released two years of returns in 2008.

""The fascination with taxes I paid I find to be very small-minded compared to the broad issues that we face,"" Romney said Thursday.

In an interview with NBC conducted during the Olympics but scheduled to air later on Thursday, Romney's wife, Ann, also addressed the issue: ""We have been very transparent to what's legally required of us,"" she told NBC. ""There's going to be no more tax releases given."""

It's morning meeting time. ""When Dr. King was little, he learned a golden rule,"" sings a class of 4- and 5-year-olds with their teacher, Carolyn Barnhardt.

John Eaton Elementary School, a public school in Washington, D.C., is unusual. It sits in one of the District's wealthiest neighborhoods, but the majority of students hail from different parts of the city, making it one of the most racially and economically diverse elementary schools in the nation's capital.

Barnhardt, who has been a prekindergarten teacher for 25 years, remembers a time when schools were not so diverse.

""I am part of the Dr. Martin Luther King era,"" she says, explaining how she grew up in the segregated South. ""I experienced the white-only water fountains, the colored section in the bus station. The lunch counters — I remember not being able to sit there to eat lunch. And I went to the colored-only schools, it was all — everything was segregated.

""I was 6 years old when the Rosa Parks episode happened, so I kinda sorta remember the beginning of the civil rights movement as a little girl,"" she says.

Today, Barnhardt teaches in a classroom she could have only dreamed about at that age, one where black, white, Asian and Arab children sit shoulder to shoulder.

Her kids are bursting to show off what they know about Rosa Parks and King.

""I know about Dr. King. He changed the laws, so everybody with that skin could go everywhere they want,"" Emil Timko says.

""He got shot,"" Kieran Dockett-Gilbert says, ""because people didn't like what he said.""

""When Dr. King was little, he learned a golden rule from how to treat another,"" Graciela Lang chimes in.

""When I tell them about some of the things that I'm teaching them about Dr. King, I let them know that I have experienced it myself,"" Barnhardt says. ""I think it's so easy for me to convey all this to these little people. I don't know if some people think that, 'Gosh, 4- and 5-year-olds?' But I think they understand.""

The lessons have resonated with 5-year-old Jonah Hack, who is African-American. He was taken in by his white mother, Andrea Hack, when he was only 2 weeks old. She eventually adopted Jonah, as both his biological parents were homeless.

""A few nights ago,"" Hack says, ""Jonah mentioned 'Martin Doctor Luther Junior King' and his 'dream that changed the world.' I asked him what he knew about Dr. King, and Jonah told me about his dream, which wasn't a dream you have when you sleep, but something you hope for.""

She says they have talked about skin color before, but until now it has been in simple terms.

For example, Jonah asked her what color his 6-month-old twin sisters would be. ""White,"" Hack answered.

In their conversations over the last two weeks, Hack says, Jonah has recognized he is a ""brown person.""

""A long, long time ago,"" he told his mother, ""brown people couldn't go to the park with the other people, but Dr. King's dream changed this.""

""This was the first time that I think Jonah has understood about racism,"" Hack says, ""and I know that now the genie's out of the bottle. It's never going back in.""

""This is my son,"" she says. ""I don't want him to have any hardships, but of course, he will."" Tears stream down her face. ""Unfortunately, the color of his skin — and that we have different colors of skin — is going to be a hardship. Whether it is minor or a major hardship is, you know, yet to be seen, but it's there.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Secret Service Secret Service

Updated at 3:20 p.m. ET

The Secret Service has identified a device that was found overnight on the White House grounds as a ""quad copter."" The agency says the person who had been operating the device reported that it crashed after they lost control.

In a statement released Monday afternoon, the Secret Service said an individual called around 9:30 this morning to ""self-report"" the crashed copter. The agency adds that the person has been cooperative, and that the incident seems to stem from ""recreational use of the device.""

The agency said an on-duty Secret Service officer saw and heard the 2-foot-wide commercial ""quad copter"" fly low onto the grounds of the executive mansion at about 3:08 a.m. ET. It crashed on the southeast side, the agency said in a statement.

""There was an immediate alert and lockdown of the complex until the device was examined and cleared,"" a spokesman said, adding that an investigation is under way.

Earlier, the White House said the device posed no threat to the first family.

President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama are in India; their daughters, Sasha and Malia, stayed behind in Washington with their grandmother, Marian Robinson.

""There is a device that has been recovered by the Secret Service at the White House,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest, who is with Obama in New Delhi. ""The early indications are that it does not pose any sort of ongoing threat to anybody at the White House.""

Drones, as we have previously reported, come in a variety of sizes, and are used in counterterrorism, surveillance, aerial photography and even as toys.

The incident follows a spate of security lapses at the White House for which the Secret Service has been widely criticized. As we previously reported:

""The Secret Service was criticized last year after several lapses, including one in which a knife-wielding man scaled the White House fence and made it inside the executive mansion's main level. The scandal resulted in the resignation of its then-director, Julia Pierson. ""In December, a panel appointed by the Department of Homeland Security recommended changes at the Secret Service, saying it was 'starved for leadership.' ""

Several top officials at the Secret Service were asked to leave earlier this month."

Republican presidential hopefuls are turning out this weekend for two big events, but just one of them, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, plans to be at both.

Cruz is among seven possible contenders who spoke Saturday at the Iowa Freedom Summit, co-sponsored by Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, and the group Citizens United. Sunday night, Cruz is scheduled to join two possible primary rivals, Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Rand Paul, R-Ky., at a semi-annual conference of the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce.

Freedom Partners is a central part of the powerful conservative network assembled by billionaires David and Charles Koch.

Cruz, Rubio and Paul are to appear Sunday in a ""national policy forum"" moderated by ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl. The discussion is to be live-streamed to news organizations, although not to the general public. The conference runs through the weekend, providing well-heeled donors in the Koch network a chance to get acquainted with likely candidates.

The live-streaming marks a break with barring reporters from covering the conferences. But in recent years, the conferences have been beset by leaked documents and surreptitious audio recordings. Last June, someone recorded Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, then running for re-election, saying the day the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law was signed was ""the worst day of my life."" Another audio clip, in which Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst praised the Koch network, was used in an attack ad in her Senate bid, which she won.

There are indications that the Koch network may engage in the GOP presidential primary — a step it's previously avoided taking. As a measure of the network's clout, the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political advertising, estimates that in the 2014 midterm elections, four Koch groups ran more than 12,000 TV ads, at a cost exceeding $25 million. The groups were the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the superPAC Freedom Partners Action Fund and the social welfare groups Americans for Prosperity and Concerned Veterans for America."

A new cease-fire is set to begin Sunday in eastern Ukraine, in a deal after 16 hours of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. The leaders of France and Germany helped broker the deal, which calls for a buffer zone free of heavy weapons. News of the temporary peace emerged along with a new international aid plan for Ukraine.

As has been the case in Ukraine's nearly yearlong conflict with separatists, the new arrangement established by Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko leaves some important issues unresolved.

NPR's Corey Flintoff brings us these details that emerged from the talks in Minsk:

""The immediate issues in these talks were stopping the fighting, establishing a security zone between the two sides, and pulling their heavy weapons out of each other's range. The long-term issues are whether Ukraine will officially recognize the areas where separatists have declared independence, and give those regions power in the central government.""

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande acknowledged that more work remains to be done, even as they celebrated the temporary peace deal.

""This is a relief for Europe and a fine example of what France and Germany can do for peace,"" Hollande said.

""We have now a glimmer of hope,"" Merkel said, adding, ""I have no illusions, we have no illusions.""

The cease-fire, which would begin after midnight Saturday night, does not resolve the status of a transport hub called Debaltseve, which sits between two cities controlled by the separatists.

After a recent burst of fighting, insurgents — and Russia — are calling for the Ukrainian troops in the city to surrender, saying they're surrounded. Ukraine doesn't see it that way.

The apparent breakthrough comes as Ukraine, faced with a Russian-backed insurgency and a deep recession, has agreed to preliminary terms on an aid package that would bring some $40 billion to bolster its economy. That effort was led by the International Monetary Fund, which will contribute nearly half of the money in what would be a four-year deal."

Following heavy shelling in what had been a Ukraine-controlled city, the central government's force is retreating from Debaltseve, a key railroad and transportation hub. Ukraine says it has now withdrawn 80 percent of its armed forces from the city.

""I can say now that the Ukrainian armed forces and the National Guard completed an operation on the planned and organized withdrawal of some units from Debaltseve this morning,"" Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko said, according to the Interfax news agency in Ukraine.

""Some 80 percent of the units have already been pulled out,"" he said before leaving to visit eastern Ukraine Wednesday. He added that two more columns of troops will be withdrawn from Debaltseve.

Poroshenko is seeking a ""tough reaction"" from international leaders who brokered the recent cease-fire with Russian-backed separatists. A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was instrumental in the peace talks, says the rebels are committing ""a massive violation"" of the temporary peace.

A conference call is scheduled for later today, in which Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany will discuss possible reactions, according to a French official.

From Moscow, NPR's Corey Flintoff reports:

""A cease-fire was officially supposed to have taken effect on Sunday, but relentless shelling kept up around Debaltseve, a railroad hub defended by hundreds of Ukrainian troops. ""The troops have been effectively surrounded by Russian-backed militias for days. ""Observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe say the separatist militias are preventing them from entering the area to monitor the cease fire.""

Corey says the separatists have insisted that the peace agreement doesn't apply to Debaltseve.

""One reason they're so determined to take that town,"" he says, ""is that it was part of a Ukrainian-controlled pocket that pokes deep into the separatist front lines."""

This Post Was Last Updated At 5:15 p.m. ET.

Two days before the first of President Obama's executive actions on immigration were to take effect, the new rules have been put on hold by a federal judge's ruling in South Texas. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen said the president overstepped his authority.

In more than 120 pages of court documents issued late Monday, Hanen halted both the new Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents as well as the expansions Obama had planned to make to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

If the executive actions providing legal status to millions of people were to take effect, Hanen wrote, ""The genie would be impossible to put back into the bottle.""

Speaking to reporters at the White House, President Obama said Justice Department will appeal this decision and he is confident that the executive action he took is ""well within my authority.""

""I strongly disagree with Judge Hanen's decision,"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson said. But he adds that because of the injunction, his agency ""will not begin accepting requests for the expansion of DACA tomorrow, February 18, as originally planned. Until further notice, we will also suspend the plan to accept requests for DAPA.""

Johnson also stated that the court's order ""does not affect the existing DACA,"" and that it will not change the enforcement priorities he outlined when President Obama set his plan in motion last November.

Federal Judge Blocks Obama's Executive Actions On Immigration Listen · 3:49 3:49

Obama also called on Congress to act. He said he had taken this action, because he would not ""stand by and do nothing.""

He said while he disagreed with Hanen's opinion, ""I respect the ruling.""

Our original post continues:

The Justice Department will appeal the judge's temporary injunction, the White House says.

""The district court's decision wrongly prevents these lawful, commonsense policies from taking effect and the Department of Justice has indicated that it will appeal that decision,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement released Tuesday morning.

The injunction gives 26 states more time to form legal arguments against the actions, which were expected to protect as many as 4 million people who are in the U.S. illegally from being deported. The plan also includes an option to apply for work permits.

The states had argued that the changes would cause ""dramatic and irreparable injuries,"" as NPR's Richard Gonzales reports on Morning Edition. ""For example, the state of Texas estimates that it was spending $1.3 million sending police to deal with border security during that surge of unaccompanied minors that crossed the border this past summer.""

On the other side of the issue, Gonzales says, ""there are 12 states, the District of Columbia and 33 mayors across the country who are supporting the Obama administration. They say the executive action would benefit them, because workers who are here illegally would come out of the shadows and work and pay taxes.""

Obama announced his plan weeks after last November's midterm elections, saying that he was taking action because Congress hadn't sent him a bill addressing the problems in America's immigration system. Before the ruling came out late Monday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency had been preparing to begin accepting applications under the new rules Wednesday.

As member-station KUT in Austin reports, the Texas lawsuit against the president's executive orders was initially filed in December by Gov. Greg Abbott, who was then the state's attorney general.

From the station and its partner, The Texas Tribune:

""[Abbott] accused the president of violating several provisions of the U.S. Constitution, including one that gives Congress jurisdiction over immigration laws. Abbott also argued that Texas would be irreparably harmed by the action. He cited as proof last summer's surge of undocumented immigrants from Central America who entered Texas illegally through the Rio Grande Valley.""

Welcoming the injunction, the current attorney general in Texas, Ken Paxton, called it ""a victory for the rule of law in America and a crucial first step in reining in President Obama's lawlessness.""

In his decision, Judge Hanen, an appointee of President George W. Bush who has been in his post since 2002, also noted that there has been a political and national debate over how to handle both legal and illegal immigration.

He added, ""To date, however, neither the President nor any member of Congress has proposed legislation capable of resolving these issues in a manner that could garner the necessary support to be passed into law."""

Looking to take back a city that has high strategic and symbolic value, the Iraqi military will launch an offensive against fighters from the self-proclaimed Islamic State in the coming months, a senior U.S. military official says.

NPR's Tom Bowman reports:

""A U.S. Central Command official told reporters at the Pentagon that the military operation to retake Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, will be in the April-May timeframe, and this operation will involve an estimated 20,000-25,000 Iraqi soldiers. ""And they say that in the city of Mosul, they estimate there are anywhere between 1,000 and 2,000 fighters for the Islamic State. ""They did say Mosul won't be easy — because Islamic State fighters have been dug in in that city since last June, when they took it over.""

Asked why the timetable for an assault on a fierce enemy would be publicized months before the operation's scheduled start time, Tom tells NPR's Morning Edition that the topic came up during Thursday's briefing.

""This might be psychological operations,"" he says. ""You try to unsettle your enemy, and also give civilians time to leave the area.""

NPR's Ari Shapiro, who visited the northern front line between Kurdish territory and Mosul this week, says Kurdish fighters are ready to help throw the Islamic State out of Mosul. All they're waiting for, they say, is for Iraqi forces to isolate the city from the south.

But the head of Kurdistan's security council tells Ari, ""I wish I could tell you the Iraqi army is ready for that, but it's not.""

The battle plan includes a main force of five Iraqi brigades and three Kurdish brigades, the U.S. official told reporters Thursday. And Tom says the U.S. military has ""pretty much cherry-picked"" the Iraqi force for the operation. He adds that the Iraqis would be backed by U.S. air power.

While the U.S. military also expects to provide logistical, tactical and surveillance support, it hasn't yet been decided whether American military advisers might join the ground force to coordinate air strikes.

The U.S. official said that the spring offensive would be timed to come before Ramadan and the heat of summer, saying ""it becomes problematic if it goes much later than that,"" according to military news outlet Stars and Stripes.

He added that if it's determined the Iraqi troops or preparations aren't ready, the operation would be pushed back."

The cold and snow that walloped Washington overnight didn't stop Ashton Carter from reporting for work Tuesday. Carter was sworn in as the 25th U.S. Secretary of Defense after starting his day with meetings at the Pentagon.

Sworn in by Vice President Biden at the White House Tuesday, Carter formally replaces Chuck Hagel, becoming President Obama's fourth defense chief in the past six years.

Carter's debut at the Pentagon this morning was briefly interrupted when his wife, Stephanie, ""slipped and fell on the icy pavement,"" the AP reports. ""She laughed it off, and officials indicated she was not injured.""

In taking the Pentagon's top job, Carter rounds out a career that has included several stints with the Department of Defense, from leading the acquisitions unit to being deputy defense secretary.

NPR's John Burnett gives an overview of Carter's biography:

""Ashton Carter is 60 years old; he's a Yale graduate and was a Rhodes Scholar in theoretical physics at Oxford. He never served in the military; he was a long-time faculty member of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and he's the author or co-author of 11 books.""

As Carter takes his post, he inherits a crowded list of important priorities for the Department of Defense:

The U.S. is seeking to ramp up efforts against extremist group ISIS and continue its work with military coalitions in the Middle East

NATO and the U.S. are watching developments in both Ukraine and Iran carefully

The U.S. hopes to help Afghanistan prevent the Taliban from retaking hard-won territory there

The Pentagon seeks to recoup recent budget cuts that can't easily be retracted in Washington's austere political environment

From the Military Times:

""Carter is expected to testify on Capitol Hill soon about the Defense Department's annual budget request that was released in early February. He'll be setting the stage for a big budget battle as the Pentagon seeks $534 billion for next year, significantly more than the $499 billion spending cap imposed by the law known as sequestration."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

The Department of Homeland Security runs out of money at midnight Friday. The Senate is on track to pass a bill to fully fund DHS with no strings attached. Meanwhile, the House will be voting Friday on a stopgap spending bill to fund the department for only three weeks. House Republicans say it's to give the two chambers more time to work out differences. But Senate Democrats say that's not going to happen.

For a few days now, most Senate Republicans have come to terms with how this story would end. The Department of Homeland Security would be fully funded because, as Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois says, the burden of the majority is the burden of governing.

""As a governing party, we got to fund DHS, and say to the House, 'Here's a straw, so you can suck it up,' "" said Kirk.

But the House isn't quite ready to suck it up. By Thursday evening, leaders had hatched a new plan: to fund DHS for just three weeks, so the two chambers could reconcile differences between a bill that sticks it to the president's executive action on immigration, and one that doesn't.

""When you have two competing bills from both houses, the bicameral way to do it is by conference,"" said Republican Rep. Richard Nugent of Florida. ""You know, no one's going to get everything they want. But it is an ability to sit down and discuss those issues.""

The Senate's top-ranking Democratic, Harry Reid, says there is nothing to discuss.

""It is a waste of time. We will not allow a conference to take place. It won't happen,"" Reid had said earlier Thursday.

Senate Republicans have not yet said when — or even if — they'll vote on what the House passes. So today, the two chambers will open on two separate tracks — with less than 24 hours to go.

House Speaker John Boehner says: What do you expect? The two houses are inherently different bodies.

""We have two different institutions that don't have the same body temperature everyday. And so we try to work to narrow the differences. But sometimes there are differences,"" said Boehner. ""You know, the House by nature and by design is a hell of a lot more rambunctious place than the Senate.""

But Democrats say it's hard to believe three weeks is going make the House any less rambunctious or any more reasonable."

As we reported late Friday, the House managed to approve a one-week extension of funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which President Obama signed. The passage capped a day of scrambling that saw a longer three-week stopgap shot down in the House.

But the thorny issue that has weighed on a longer-term funding bill — an insistence by Republicans that it include a push-back on the president's executive action on immigration — is still in the air. And the clock is ticking on the fresh deadline to resolve the impasse.

NPR's Ailsa Chang, speaking on Weekend Edition Saturday, says: ""[It] was very clear that [Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell] and House Speaker John Boehner were not in sync on their strategies. Which created a lot of tension between the two chambers. Many House Republicans resented being pressured by the Senate to pass a long-term funding bill — so that's one reason they pushed back with a shorter-term bill.""

Where might things go from here?

The Wall Street Journal reports:

""Republicans said they expected that next week the House would end up going along with the Senate's bill funding Homeland Security through September without immigration changes. 'I don't think there's any alternative,' said Rep. Charlie Dent (R., Pa.) 'When we're at the end of next week, what do we do?' ""An aide to House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) said the Republican leader had made no commitment, but House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said she expected the one-week measure would buy the time to pass a funding measure that would cover the remainder of the fiscal year.""

Politico adds:

""Boehner's allies are concerned after Friday's setback that his critics inside the Republican Conference may try to oust him as speaker if — as expected — he puts a long-term DHS funding bill on the House floor next week. While Boehner shrugs off such speculation, close friends believe such a move is a real possibility. ... ""Twenty-five Republicans voted against Boehner for speaker on the floor in early January, signaling his continued problems with his conservative hardliners. And Boehner's allies believe that the earlier DHS debacle on Friday, when 52 Republicans voted against the three-week plan, was in part aimed at toppling the speaker.""

Harry Reid, the wily Democratic Senate leader, was likely — once again — to be one of the most vulnerable incumbents up for re-election in 2016.

Few, though, would have bet the house against Reid — a sharp-elbowed campaigner — especially in a presidential year when demography will favor Democrats in a state where almost 3 in 10 people are Hispanic.

""Do you really want to go up against Harry Reid?"" said one national GOP operative, pointing out Reid's bare-knuckles style of campaigning.

But with Reid announcing Friday he will not run for re-election, it's a different story.

""Do you really want to go up against Harry Reid?""

""It's a totally different race with him out,"" the operative said, noting that with Reid in a race ""anything and everything is on the table"" — from land deals to pensions to personal finances.

Look at what he was able to pull off in 2010. In that Tea Party-wave year, in a midterm, when Democrats lost 63 House seats and six Senate seats, Reid defied gravity and won over Sharron Angle 50 percent to 45 percent.

Angle was, in many ways, her own worst enemy, committing a series of unforced errors. But even when Reid trailed in the polls, he turned up the heat.

And that can have a chilling effect on recruitment.

It's still early in the 2016 cycle, but no obvious serious Republican challenger had emerged yet to take on Reid. While Republicans would love for Gov. Brian Sandoval to jump in, he has so far shown no interest in running.

That could change, though, with Reid out of the way and this now being an open seat. Republicans aren't counting on it. They feel they have a strong bench of potential other candidates. In fact, every statewide elected official in Nevada is a Republican — from governor on down to controller.

Two possibilities if Sandoval can't be swayed are Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchinson and Rep. Joe Heck.

""With him out, there's no reason not to run,"" the operative said. ""It's different now.""

Democrats, however, argue they could be in a stronger position with Reid off the playing field — despite the thin, or nonexistent, statewide candidate bench. They say the race wouldn't cost them as much money, and Reid would be a stronger force behind the scenes with his Nevada machine for another candidate, who wouldn't start off with negative ratings that are so high.

Reid on Friday endorsed former state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto in characteristically blunt language.

""Brian Sandoval has done a very fine job as governor. I don't have anything negative to say about him,"" Reid told KNPR. But ""whoever runs against Catherine, I think, will be a loser.""

Polls in 2012, though, showed Sandoval holding big leads in hypothetical matchups with Cortez Masto and former Secretary of State Ross Miller.

""Don't give me any talk of polls,"" Reid said on KNPR, ""because I don't believe in them."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images

With Tuesday's deadline for an international deal on Iran's nuclear program approaching, foreign ministers from Iran and six world powers are trying to hash out an agreement. The debate currently centers on where Iran's nuclear fuel should be stored, and how — and when — economic sanctions should be lifted.

Other details, such as rules controlling enrichment, the length of the deal and how it would be enforced, also remain unsettled.

Late Sunday, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told state media that Iran won't agree to ship even part of its nuclear fuel stockpile out of the country. A U.S. State Department official tells NPR's Peter Kenyon that Araqchi's position isn't new.

Sticking Points In Iran Nuclear Talks: Sanctions And A Fuel Stockpile Listen · 3:34 3:34

From Lausanne, Switzerland, Peter reports for our Newscast unit:

""The U.S. and its allies want to reduce Iran's stockpile from more than 17,000 pounds down to a few hundred, and shipping some of it out has come up. But a senior State Department official says there are other ways of solving that problem. ""If the sides can agree on the major elements of a deal here, they'll have three months to hammer out the technical details of a final accord.""

As the deadline nears, Peter says, analysts believe that comments like Araqchi's could be an attempt to gain last-minute concessions in an agreement.

Iran is currently under economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the European Union and the United States. The question of whether an agreement would trigger removal of all those hindrances at once or whether they would be phased out is a key issue in the talks.

In Europe and the U.S., economic and political considerations could offer further complications to a potential deal.

As Bloomberg News reports, ""Trade between Europe and Iran has plunged to about $9 billion from almost $32 billion in 2005 when sanctions began to be tightened.""

And as we've reported, many U.S. Republicans oppose any potential easing of sanctions on Iran, even taking the extraordinary step of writing to the country's supreme leader about the nuclear talks.

Secretary of State John Kerry and his peers from Iran, Russia, China, Germany, France and Britain met for Monday's talks in Switzerland."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images

Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the newly chosen vice presidential running mate for Republican Mitt Romney, was in Ohio on Wednesday to speak at his alma mater.

Ryan graduated from Miami University of Ohio in 1992 with degrees in economics and political science. And his ascension to the GOP ticket thrills Rob Harrelson, a member of the school's College Republicans (as was Ryan, two decades earlier).

""He's young. He's energetic. He's popular. He's rising through the ranks of the Republican Party and in the House,"" says Harrelson. ""I think he's a great candidate. He's bringing a lot of energy to the campaign.""

At 42, Ryan is the nation's first vice presidential candidate from Generation X. Harrelson, 21, thinks Ryan's youth and ideas about the economy will pull more of today's college students to the right.

""I absolutely think that Ryan will appeal to the younger voters with his budget proposal,"" says Harrelson, speaking at Bagel and Deli in downtown Oxford, Ohio, packed with college students fresh off of summer vacation and parents helping them move into the dorms. ""It cuts government regulation. It cuts the red tape that's really crippling our economy, and I think that his plan will really resonate.""

If that's true, it would be very good news for Republicans who lost a lopsided battle for young voters in the 2008 election against President Obama. Only a third of voters under 30 voted for Sen. John McCain in 2008, which made for the largest disparity between young voters and other age groups since exit polling began in 1972.

""That voting age group, certainly in the last election, skewed to Obama. But they primarily skew toward not voting,"" says Patrick Haney, a professor of political science at Miami University in Ohio.

Of the students interviewed by NPR at Miami University, Xavier University and the University of Cincinnati, only a handful knew the name Paul Ryan, and even fewer knew of his budget plan.

Many said they were either uninterested in the race or planning to check in on it later.

Tyler Hawkins, a senior at Xavier in Cincinnati, put it this way: ""[I've] just been busy and, honestly, it's a little boring to me.""

According to census data, the youth turnout hit its third-highest rate ever in 2008 at 51 percent. Many expect that number to drop in 2012.

Haney, the political scientist, isn't sure picking Ryan will make much of a difference.

""So, you know, the question is — is a pick like that meant to have some impact on younger voters who ... I guess there was some evidence to suggest were tuning out of this election?"" says Haney. ""Maybe, but I tend to doubt that age had much to do with the pick.""

Haney suspects it has more to do with energizing the Republican base than bringing out the youth vote. Ryan's stances on social issues like abortion and gay marriage are more in line with traditional religious conservatives than with typical college students.

Haney adds that, like their elders, young voters usually do not focus on the lower half of the ticket."

The House Select Committee on Benghazi announced plans to call Hillary Clinton to testify next month, right around the time her campaign was reportedly going to shift into high gear with a mid-May campaign kickoff speech.

At the same time, a new book about the Clinton foundation is generating the kind of headlines and news coverage no presidential candidate wants to see.

""Bill Clinton Cashed In When Hillary Clinton Became Secretary of State,"" was how ABC News put it, referring to the former president's speaking fees shooting up after his wife joined the Obama administration.

""Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation as Russians Pressed for Control of Uranium Company,"" was from The New York Times.

The story also dominated cable news.

""She's now saying that they won't take foreign donations if she becomes president,"" said Jo Becker, the co-author of The New York Times piece, on NPR's All Things Considered Thursday. ""But what the story really underscores are the special challenges when you have a foundation that's raising money from foreign interests, that couldn't contribute to an American political campaign, by the way, but can contribute to these kinds of foundations.""

The Clinton campaign declined to comment, but a campaign spokesman published a five-point rebuttal to the Times article, which was based, in part, on the forthcoming book, Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich, which is due out May 5. The spokesman, Brian Fallon, charges that the facts in the Times' own reporting undermine the innuendo in the piece.

""Ironically, buried within the story is original reporting that debunks the allegation that then-Secretary Clinton played any role in the review of the sale,"" Fallon writes, adding, ""The facts drawn from the Times' own reporting undermine the innuendo in the Times story about Hillary Clinton's role in this matter.""

Earlier this week, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta offered a own pre-buttal to the book in an interview with Al Hunt on PBS's Charlie Rose show.

""It's a book that's written by a former Bush operative, who's a reporter for that august news institution Breitbart.com — or has been in the past,"" Podesta said of the book's author, Peter Schweizer, who worked for former President George W. Bush and was a foreign policy adviser to Sarah Palin in 2011.

YouTube

That is classic political rapid response — question the source, blame the opposition.

Schweizer also wrote the book on Congress and insider trading that helped lead to the STOCK Act of 2012, Throw Them All Out: How Politicians and Their Friends Get Rich off Insider Stock Tips, Land Deals, and Cronyism That Would Send the Rest of Us to Prison.

Schweizer also tells Bloomberg's Josh Green he is coming out with a similar book on Jeb Bush's finances to be published this summer.

Podesta, though, not only questions the author's motives, but, more importantly, his conclusions.

""He's cherry-picked information that's been disclosed and woven a bunch of conspiracy theories about it,"" Podesta said on PBS. ""The facts, there's nothing new about. The conspiracy theories, I guess we'll get to judge when we read the book.""

For Clinton, this is hardly a new experience. She and her husband have been at the middle of so many political firestorms over the years it's almost hard to keep track. On the Today Show in 1998, Clinton famously dismissed the attacks and accusations.

""The great story here for anybody willing to find it, and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day that he announced for president,"" she said.

As for the Benghazi committee, Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who heads it, seems to be trying hard to avoid having his effort portrayed as a partisan witch hunt. He insisted Wednesday that he wasn't slow-walking the investigation to overlap with the presidential campaign season.

""I want it done before 2016,"" he said on Fox, adding, ""We're trying to accelerate it, but I've got to have the documents.""

In a letter to Clinton's lawyer, Gowdy said he wants the former secretary of state to testify the week of May 18, which happens to be right around the time when Clinton's campaign has said she is going to make that bigger ""kickoff"" speech for her campaign.

That Benghazi committee hearing will deal mostly with her use of a private e-mail server for public business. Gowdy released 136 likely questions; eight of them are about Benghazi.

Once Gowdy is satisfied he has all the documents, he plans to call a second hearing where the committee can ask Clinton about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.

That means while Clinton tries to campaign for one job on Pennsylvania Avenue, she is going to be facing questions from the other side for quite some time."

With the fires out and much of the glass cleaned up in Baltimore, the ""soul searching"" as President Obama called it, has begun. For those hoping to become the next president of the United States, weighing in presents both an opportunity and a challenge.

Hillary Clinton told an audience in New York Wednesday, the criminal justice system is ""out of balance.""

She called for body cameras for every police department in America and the end of mass incarceration of low-level offenders.

""We have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in America,"" said Clinton in a keynote speech at the 18th Annual David N. Dinkins Leadership and Public Policy Forum at Columbia University.

""There is something wrong when a third of all black men face the prospect of prison during their lifetimes and an estimated 1.5 million black men are quote 'missing' from their families and communities because of incarceration and premature death.""

The evening before, one-time Baltimore mayor and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley returned to that city and visited with people near where the rioting had taken place. Jason Horowitz of the New York Times was along for the ride:

""And so Mr. O'Malley, a potential challenger to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries, stepped out of a Chevy Suburban and onto Pennsylvania Avenue. Filling the intersection of Pennsylvania and North Avenues was a drum circle and people lifting signs that read, 'Broken Windows are not worse than Broken Bones.'""

As mayor, O'Malley subscribed to the ""broken windows"" theory of policing, which was very much in vogue at the time. As Horowitz tells it, O'Malley wasn't universally welcomed to the city he once led, but he also seemed undeterred.

""'Did you see all those boarded-up houses on your way out?' shouted a man who greeted him in front of the Arch Social Club ('Please Pardon Our Dust'), where volunteers made turkey sandwiches, handed out water and watched 'Bonanza.' 'I actually did,' Mr. O'Malley said. 'You plan on doing anything about that?' 'I got elevated to the same rank as you, I'm a citizen now,' Mr. O'Malley said, with a grin that he often wears as a shield. 'You made a lot of promises,' the man shouted. 'And I did the best that I could,' the former mayor said. 'In what community? Not in the black community!' A few seconds later and a couple yards closer to the intersection, a young man named Chris Dickens read to Mr. O'Malley a list of young black men who he said had been victims of police brutality. 'I've heard of them all,' Mr. O'Malley said. 'I think it's tragic and I think we all need to search for a deeper and better understanding. I'm getting crushed with cameras.'""

His not-yet-official campaign team put out a fact sheet outlining his work on matters of policing and criminal justice reform and proudly linked to the Times article as if to imply O'Malley wasn't afraid to mix it up with real people who might not tell him what he wants to hear.

Another potential presidential candidate, Ben Carson, lived in Baltimore for 30 years. He was a world-renowned neurosurgeon who worked at Johns Hopkins University. He wrote on Facebook that he urged ""parents, grandparents and guardians to please take control of your children and do not allow them to be exposed to the dangers of uncontrolled agitators on the streets.""

As a former resident of the city of Baltimore, it is very sad and unfortunate to see the destruction taking place by... Posted by Dr. Ben Carson on Tuesday, April 28, 2015

And Tuesday, he penned an op-ed for Time.

""When rioting and looting occurs in instances like this, I cannot help but think how important it is to get police involved early on in the community so that the first encounter a young person has with a police officer is not a hostile encounter. That is the type of thing that will make a huge difference in this country. The police have to acknowledge any shortcomings, and if there is unfairness, we need to look at it and improve upon that. Objectivity is the real answer. In order to get there, we have to be able to sit down at a table and have an intelligent conversation rather than getting to our respective corners and demonizing each other. We need to create relationships. Relationships are key to resolutions of problems.""

For Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Libertarian-leaning Republican, the situation in Baltimore presented an opportunity to highlight his bipartisan work on sentencing reform in the Senate. But a call to a conservative talk show host took the topic in a different direction.

""It's depressing. It's sad. It's scary,"" Paul told Laura Ingraham on her show Tuesday.

He joked that he was on a train that went through Baltimore on Monday evening, saying he was glad it didn't stop.

He then turned to the potential causes.

""The breakdown of the family structure. The lack of fathers,"" Paul told Ingraham. ""The lack of sort of a moral code in our society. And this isn't just a racial thing. It goes across racial boundaries. But we do have problems in our country. And you see this and you see that we are close to the tipping point and closer than many think.""

Sen. Ted Cruz on Tuesday called on the government ""ensure domestic security.""

""Today families are scared,"" Cruz wrote. ""Our government must perform its central functions and purposes: to preserve the peace, protect the people, and serve justice.""

An open question remains how long politicians will continue talking about these issues once the conflict recedes in Baltimore and the cable news cameras pack up and go home. President Obama, Tuesday, said more conflicts between police and the people they are supposed to protect, even more riots, would be inevitable without sustained attention and soul searching.

""If we really want to solve the problem, if our society really wanted to solve the problem, we could, it's just it would require everybody saying 'this is important, this is significant,'"" Obama said. ""And that we don't just pay attention to these communities when a CVS burns."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP

The death of Freddie Gray was a homicide, and six Baltimore police officers now face criminal charges that include second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, Baltimore chief prosecutor Marilyn J. Mosby says.

Mosby announced the charges Friday morning, citing her office's ""thorough and independent"" investigation and the medical examiner's report on Gray's death. She said warrants were issued Friday for the officers' arrest.

The city's recently elected state's attorney, Mosby detailed a range of charges against the officers, with offenses ranging from one count of second-degree murder and four counts of involuntary manslaughter to assault and misconduct in office.

The most severe charges are leveled against Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr., identified as the driver of the van that transported Gray to a police station. The charges against Goodson include second-degree depraved heart murder, which carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison.

The investigation by the prosecutor's office found there had been no reason to detain Gray — and that his arrest was in itself illegal, Mosby said. She said the knife that police officers found on Gray turned out to be legal.

After announcing the charges, Mosby noted her own ties to the police community — including her mother, father and grandfather, who were police officers. She thanked officers who are committed to serving the community.

We'll have more details from the announcement and any documents released by the prosecutor's office.

Update at 5:28 p.m. ET. Family Is Satisfied With Charges:

Saying they represented an ""important step in getting justice for Freddie,"" Richard Shipley, Gray's stepfather, said that the family was ""satisfied"" with the charges filed today.

Shipley went on to plea for peace and for the city to get back to work.

""You all know that without justice there is not peace,"" he said. ""But let us have peace in the pursuit of justice.""

Update at 4:10 p.m. ET: A Rush To Judgement:

In a press conference, police union attorney Michael Davey said that Freddie Gray's injuries were not caused by either any action or inaction of any of the police officers charged today.

He said that the prosecutors in this case have rushed to judgement.

""The publicity in this case is leading the prosecution to move so quickly in this case,"" he said.

He added that the officers will take the case to court and let a jury or a judge make a final determination.

Update at 12:38 p.m. ET: Obama Reacts To News

""What I think the people of Baltimore want more than anything else is the truth. That's what people around the country expect."" — President Obama, shortly after the prosecutor's announcement.

Citing the requirements of due process, Obama said the Department of Justice is in contact with Baltimore officials, ""to make sure that any assistance we can provide on the investigation is provided.""

The president spoke to reporters briefly, urging non-violent demonstrations and promising federal agencies will assist Baltimore investigators ""to the extent that it's appropriate.""

Update at 11:15 a.m. ET: Four Officers Face Manslaughter Charges

According to a release from the prosecutor's office, four officers are facing manslaughter charges and one faces an additional count of ""second degree depraved heart murder.""

That murder charge carries a possible penalty of 30 years in prison; the manslaughter and assault offenses carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.

From the release:

Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr.: Second degree depraved heart murder; involuntary manslaughter; second degree assault; manslaughter by vehicle (gross negligence); manslaughter by vehicle (criminal negligence); misconduct in office

Officer William G. Porter: Involuntary manslaughter; second degree assault; misconduct in office

Update at 10:51 a.m. ET: Recounting Details Of Gray's Arrest

Running down an exhaustive account of Gray's arrest and treatment while in custody, Baltimore's chief prosecutor is listing at least five instances during the transport in which officers had opportunities to properly restrain Gray in the police van. She says the officers failed to do so.

Mosby said that ""Mr. Gray suffered a severe and critical neck injury as a result of being handcuffed, shackled by his feet, and unrestrained inside of the BPD wagon.""

Update at 10:48 a.m. ET: Gray's Death A Homicide, Prosecutor Says

Mosby said she has assured Gray's family that ""no one is above the law,"" also cited her oath of office, in which she promised ""uphold justice.""

She said that her review of the case found there had been no reason to detain Gray, and that his arrest was illegal.

The leading prosecutor in Baltimore spoke at a 10:30 a.m. ET news conference held in downtown Baltimore. The occasion brought a large show of force from both police and National Guard personnel who have been called on to secure the area since violence and vandalism broke out Monday night.

Earlier today, the local chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police says it has sent a letter to Mosby, asking her to appoint a special independent prosecutor in the case. The chapter's president alleged that she had ""many conflicts of interest"" in the case. This morning, Mosby said she would be handling the case herself, adding that the people of Baltimore had elected her.

Mosby spoke one day after receiving the Baltimore Police Department's report on Gray's death. The findings aren't public, and police revealed only a few new details when they announced the transition in the case Thursday.

NPR and other news organizations have asked Baltimore's police department to release its report on the arrest and death of Freddie Gray, as well as for related documents and materials such as tapes of 911 calls made when Gray was taken into custody.

Our original post continues:

Gray died on April 19, one week after being taken into custody. Police have said that during his transport, Gray wasn't buckled in properly and did not receive timely medical care. Six police officers remain suspended over the case.

As the Two-Way has reported, when police turned over the documents to State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby in Baltimore, they announced that ""the van transporting Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old black man who suffered a serious spine injury while in police custody and later died, made one more stop than previously thought.""

The roughly 40 minutes that Gray spent in the van have emerged as the focal point in the inquiry over how he sustained the injury.

That extra stop was discovered through a review of recordings made by security and private cameras, Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said. He added that another detainee who was riding in the van told police that Gray was ""still moving around ... kicking and making noises"" until the van reached the police station.

That second detainee rode in the police van on the other side of a metal partition that divides its cargo space. When he was picked up, Gray was already in the van.

Local news WJZ-TV reports that Donta Allen, 22, was that second man — and that he came forward Thursday out of concern over how his comments were being portrayed by both the police and the media.

""When I was in the back of that van it did not stop or nothing. All it did was go straight to the station, but I heard a little banging, like he was banging his head,"" Allen said. "" I didn't even know he was in the van until we got to the station.""

Saying his words have been distorted by recent reports and that he doesn't think Gray hurt himself intentionally, Allen also told a WJZ reporter, ""The only reason I'm doing this is because they put my name in a bad state.""

Allen, who was reportedly taken into custody for a minor offense and was not charged with a crime, also spoke to WBAL TV. He told the station that when he got into the van, he didn't know Gray was already there. He said he heard ""a little banging for like four seconds.""

WBAL aired surveillance camera footage that shows officers looking into Gray's side of the van during the stop that also picked up Allen.

When the van arrived at the police station, Allen said he heard the officers say that Gray didn't have a pulse and was unresponsive — and that another officer later said, ""He's got vitals now, he must've come back.""

The sequence of events has led to wide-ranging questions over what happened: Was the van driven in a way that caused Gray's injury? When did Gray become unresponsive? Were the sounds Allen heard caused by a seizure experienced by a gravely wounded man?

The Baltimore Sun reports: ""Maryland's chief medical examiner, Dr. David R. Fowler, said his office has not completed an autopsy or turned any documents over to police or prosecutors. He said homicide detectives had observed the examination, a routine practice.""

When it's complete, Fowler's report will go straight to the state's attorney's office, the newspaper says.

NPR and other news organizations have asked Baltimore's police department to release its report on the arrest and death of Freddie Gray, as well as for related documents and materials such as tapes of 911 calls made when Gray was taken into custody.

Protesters have been calling on police to reveal more information about the case.

Thursday was the third night of Baltimore's 10 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew. Ahead of the deadline, crowds of demonstrators marched downtown amid a large police presence. Baltimore's curfew is expected to remain in effect through this weekend.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jim Cole/AP Jim Cole/AP

This post was updated at 8:10 a.m. E.T. Monday

Carly Fiorina declared her candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination Monday morning on Good Morning America and in a tweet. Fiorina is perhaps best known as the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company. She was ousted after a boardroom struggle in 2005.

She served as a surrogate in John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, and in 2010 ran for the U.S. Senate from California, losing to Democratic incumbent Barbara Boxer.

Here are five things you may not know or remember about Fiorina:

1. She's a law school dropout

After she got her undergraduate degree from Stanford (in medieval history and philosophy), Fiorina's father, a federal appeals court judge, suggested his daughter go to law school. Fiorina did, but said studying law gave her ""blinding headaches every day"" so she dropped out after a semester. Not to worry, she does have graduate business degrees from Maryland and MIT.

2. She started her career as a Kelly girl

Fiorina says one of her first jobs was with temporary agency Kelly Services, whose workers, mostly women, were dubbed ""Kelly girls."" She also worked secretarial positions while in college, including a stint filing and typing for Hewlett-Packard, the tech company she would eventually lead.

3. She is a cancer survivor

Fiorina was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 and underwent a double mastectomy. At campaign appearances, women often come up to her to say they, too, are cancer survivors. ""It's a sisterhood,"" she says.

4. Her husband was a tow truck driver

Much like Fiorina, her husband, Frank Fiorina, started off small, driving a tow truck for a family-owned body shop. He eventually became an executive at AT&T.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKWlOxhSIKk YouTube

5. She ran one of the most (in)famous campaign ads ever

In 2010, while running for the U.S. Senate, Fiorina ran an ad that showed a flock of sheep grazing peacefully in a pasture, when suddenly one is shown with scary red eyes. The narrator says Fiorina's opponent, Tom Campbell, was not a true conservative — ""a wolf in sheep's clothing."" The spot came to be known as the demon sheep ad."

According to SITE, a company that monitors jihadi groups, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in the latest edition of its al-Bayan news bulletin. The group identified the two suspects as ""two soldiers from the soldiers of the Caliphate.""

The Associated Press reports that the Sunni extremist group goes on to warn the United States that more attacks are coming. The wire service adds:

""The statement did not provide details and it was unclear whether the group was opportunistically claiming the attack as its own. It was the first time the Islamic State, which frequently calls for attacks against the West, had claimed responsibility for one in the United States.""

Police say two men who have been named as Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi came out of a car firing assault rifles at the Garland event on Sunday.

One officer fired back and killed the men. As we reported, Simpson had been in trouble with the law in the past. In 2011, he was convicted of lying to the FBI, which was investigating whether he had planned a trip to fight in Somalia.

According to multiple reports, Soofi was Simpson's roommate.

This post was updated at 11:40 a.m. ET.

Meet Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor. Forget about Mike Huckabee, Fox News host.

That's the message the GOP presidential hopeful is already conveying as he makes another bid for the presidency.

""We need the kind of change that really could get America from Hope to higher ground,"" he said, officially launching his campaign Tuesday in Hope, Ark.

To recapture the magic that propelled him to second place in 2008, he needs to re-embrace his roots and downplay the political celebrity he has created in the past eight years.

""What he's got to do is draw a contrast that shows, 'I'm not just a talk show host and I'm not just a Baptist minister, but I governed for over a decade and we achieved results in a very Democratic environment,' "" said Iowa conservative activist Bob Vander Plaats, who chaired Huckabee's winning 2008 campaign in the first caucus state. He is so far undecided this go-around.

That message was also evidenced in the video that Huckabee rolled out last week.

YouTube

The video was vintage Huckabee, harking back to how he took on the Clinton machine of the 1990s in what was then a very Democratic state. That's a valuable weapon he has now that he didn't eight years ago, with other Republican candidates now arguing they're best equipped to take on Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee.

Huckabee boasted of his populist record, touting his work raising family income and cutting taxes during his decade-long tenure as governor.

There were no clips of his eponymous talk show or his 2008 stump speeches except for the address he made to the GOP convention that year.

""I'm not a Republican because I grew up rich,"" he declared at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul. ""I'm a Republican because I didn't want to spend the rest of my life poor, waiting for the government to rescue me.""

His runner-up slot enabled him to dig out of his humble beginnings. A Fox News contract and radio show soon followed, and Huckabee and his wife were able to build a 8,224 square-foot Florida beachfront home worth $3 million.

""Janet and I, neither of us grew up thinking we'd see salt water in person,"" Huckabee told the Northwest Florida Daily News last year of the mansion he and his wife called home. ""We both grew up dirt poor in Southern Arkansas ... For us, growing up, the thought that we would ever put our feet in salt water, no that would never happen.""

The newfound financial freedom was reportedly one reason Huckabee passed on a 2012 bid, despite his rumored disdain for the eventual nominee, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. In order to do so, he would have had to sever his media ties, which were his main source of income.

That's why it surprised many when he announced, without much warning, in January of this year that he would be stepping down from his Fox News Saturday evening show, Huckabee. But it was also a clear signal to those skeptical he would leave the lucrative private sector to re-enter the political arena that he was serious this time.

Huckabee was underestimated early on in 2008 in Iowa, too. He didn't even begin registering in polling there until the summer of 2007 and never surged into the lead until December of that year. He ended up winning the caucuses by 9 points.

He starts off the 2016 cycle not having to go from Pizza Ranch to Pizza Ranch praying supporters will show up, as Vander Plaats once recalled their team had to do, but with a sure buzz and a reservoir of good feelings once he heads to the state this week. He still trails Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in the latest surveys, but there's no clear front-runner yet.

That's both good and bad news for Huckabee. There are higher expectations this time around, both on fundraising and the crowds he will draw and the poll numbers he can expect as he becomes a candidate yet again.

""While people still genuinely like Gov. Huckabee and they trust Gov. Huckabee,"" Vander Plaats said, ""there's still a certain flirtation with the new car smell of new candidates."""

A magnitude-7.3 earthquake struck Nepal on Tuesday, just over two weeks after a massive magnitude-7.8 quake killed more than 8,000 people.

The United States Geological Survey puts today's quake as close to the capital, Kathmandu, as the one two weeks ago.

From Kathmandu, Cindy Stein, the director of global programs for Real Medicine Foundation, sent this update late Tuesday:

""I'm in a very communal tent in a parking lot right now, The city is in a cryogenic freeze. Nobody is going anywhere and most everything is closed. We set up a camp, there's 100s of people and no electricity. I had purchased tarps for distribution yesterday so we set up communal areas. The city is a wreck. Saw many buildings just crushed. Many aftershocks. Nobody will go indoors and like 1000 wild dogs barking.""

The epicenter of the quake was near the Chinese border, about 50 miles from Kathmandu. Estimates of the death toll range from dozens to 61. More than 1,000 people were injured. News footage showed crowds of residents standing in the middle of the streets in Kathmandu after evacuating.

The Nepali Times posted pictures of buildings and homes that had collapsed.

Nepali media said the toll from Tuesday's quake has reached 61. The BBC says the number is 48. The Associated Press says dozens are dead.

India's Home Ministry says at least 16 people in the country were killed by the quake as roofs or walls fell on them. In China, one person died in Tibet, local media said.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jim Cole/AP Jim Cole/AP

There is always a tension between the press and the candidates they cover. Journalists want access, and want to ask questions. Campaigns want to control the message. Over time, that has especially been true with Hillary Clinton.

It has been more than three weeks since she answered a question from reporters. Since announcing her candidacy in a Web video, there have been no press conferences and no sit-down interviews. It has been a month, and the candidate has answered just 13 reporter questions (at least that we've been able to find, building on the work of National Journal). And you can quibble about whether some of the answers were really answers.

Last week in Nevada, as Clinton posed for pictures, we in the press corps attempted to get her attention. All we saw was the back of her head, as she walked out of the room to applause from a small hand-selected group of participants and observers.

Clinton's campaign describes this as the ramp-up phase, where she listens to voters. Questions about when there will be interviews, or when she will make herself available to questions from reporters, are deflected with something along the lines of: all in good time.

Now, this isn't to say the candidate hasn't answered any questions. She's answered plenty. But they've been generally friendly questions on comfortable topics from people invited to participate in roundtable discussions with her.

Her campaign spokesman, Nick Merrill, responds in an email:

The focus of our ramp-up period is to hear from voters about the issues they care about. She's enjoyed engaging in hours of public question and answers sessions and, as the campaign progresses, looks forward to more engagement with voters and the press as well.

Until then, here are the 13 reporter questions Clinton has answered:

1. Strategy in Iowa

NBC's Kristen Welker caught up with Clinton outside her very first campaign stop at an Iowa coffee shop:

""You lost Iowa in 2008. How do you win this time? What's your strategy?"" Welker asked.

Clinton's reply, as she walked toward an open van door: ""I'm having a great time. Can't look forward any more than I am.""

2. Liking Iowa

The 13 Questions Hillary Clinton Has Answered From The Press 0:09

AP got in a question as Clinton walked into the Iowa State Capitol building to meet with lawmakers: ""How are you liking Iowa?""

""I'm having a great time,"" Clinton answered.

3. Why are you running?

ABC's Cecilia Vega got a question in during Clinton's visit to a community college in Iowa. ""What would you say to Americans who want to know why you are running?"" she asked.

""I'm running to be the champion to Americans and their families, so that we can not just worry about treading water, but you can get ahead and you can stay ahead,"" Clinton answered.

4.-6. More liking Iowa, and lessons learned

Clinton answered three other questions from reporters at the community college in Iowa.

One was, ""Is it good to be back out here again?""

Her response was: ""Welcome. It is, it's fabulous. We're having the best time.""

She was also asked what she learned during her visit, to which she responded, in part: ""So much good information, so much great exchange about what works, what can work not just here in Iowa, but I think across the country.""

She was also asked a question not caught in recordings of the event, and in response spoke about the start of the campaign and her visit to Iowa. ""We're off and running, and I had a great drive across the country. One of the highlights was seeing spring, finally, once I got to Iowa, which I thought was a good sign. I saw daffodils and tulips and flowering trees. It was so beautiful. Just glad to be here,"" she said.

7.-8. Campaign finance plan

A pair of Washington Post reporters spotted her outside an unannounced event and asked about campaign finance reform. The answers weren't substantive.

According to the Post, she said, ""We do have a plan. We have a plan for my plan.""

9. Importance of Iowa

Brent Roske, the host of the Iowa television show Roske on Politics, worked his sources to figure out where the candidate would be.

""I found myself basically the sixth car in the motorcade pulling into Mount Vernon, Iowa,"" he said.

He was in the right place at the right time and was able to ask a question.

""Secretary Clinton, what do you think the importance of the Iowa caucus will be in the upcoming election?"" Roske asked.

Clinton answered: ""I think it's important because it's the first contest and I look forward to getting prepared for it next February.""

Roske admits it was a softball question. But it's a question he asks all of the candidates he interviews, to get the conversation going. And Roske has interviewed a ton of candidates. His Clinton interview in the middle of the street as she headed into a closed-door event has to go down as one of his shortest.

""Was hoping to get a minute or two with her and just got a very short exchange,"" he said. ""I was hoping it would spark a bit more of a conversation. I didn't know at the time that she wasn't necessarily taking press questions on this tour.""

10. Position on trade deal

In New Hampshire, Clinton answered four reporter questions. One was about trade. NBC's Andrea Mitchell asked Clinton about the trade deal, and whether that will hurt American competitiveness.

The 13 Questions Hillary Clinton Has Answered From The Press 1:14

Clinton didn't answer immediately or directly. Instead she talked about an Intellitech machine assembled in Manchester. And then about 30 seconds later, she talked more broadly about trade deals. ""Well, any trade deal has to produce jobs, and raise wages, and increase prosperity and protect our security. And we have to do our part in making sure we have the capabilities and the skills to be competitive,"" Clinton said.

11. Response to Clinton Cash book

ABC's Vega asked Clinton for her response to the Clinton Cash book, specifically:

""Did foreign entities receive any special treatment for making any kind of donations to the foundation or your husband?""

""Well, we're back into the political season and therefore we will be subjected to all kinds of distraction and attacks. And I'm ready for that. I know that that comes, unfortunately, with the territory,"" Clinton answered. She went on to say she didn't know what the Republicans would talk about ""if I weren't in the race.""

12.-13. Criticism of a staged campaign

And then a reporter from WMUR asked her to respond to criticism that the campaign is too staged.

""This is exactly what I want to do. I want to hear from people in New Hampshire about what's on their minds,"" she said.

And the follow-up:

""Are you planning to answer reporter questions about some of the things that are coming up regarding the play-for-pay allegations in the latest book, emails back in 2012?"" the reporter asked.

""Those issues are in my view distractions from what this campaign should be about. What I'm going to make this campaign about,"" Clinton responded.

But does avoiding questions or not answering them directly hurt her with voters?

""The premise of your question presupposes that the way that Hillary Clinton needs to reach voters is through the national media, and that's simply not the case anymore,"" said Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who was a senior adviser on John McCain's Straight Talk Express campaign back in 2000.

He argues a campaign as sophisticated Clinton's can bypass the media filter and target voters directly.

""The notion that real voters worried about real issues care one whit about how often a presidential candidate talks to their traveling press corps or answers questions from them is just ludicrous. It's not the case,"" he said.

You can argue other candidates have to answer reporter questions. They need the free media. Clinton doesn't. And with minimal primary competition, she'd be happy to have much less media attention.

GOP candidate Carly Fiorina's campaign is keeping a running tally of all the questions she has answered. Since the last time Hillary Clinton answered a reporter's question, Fiorina has answered 328."

The Senate worked late into the night Friday and early Saturday, but still failed to agree on extending government surveillance programs under the USA Patriot Act before the Memorial Day holiday.

Lawmakers blocked votes on both a House-passed bill and a short-term extension of the Patriot Act provisions that allow government surveillance programs.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says lawmakers will try again on May 31, the day before the provisions expire.

The Senate first took up the House bill, which would end the National Security Agency's bulk collection of domestic phone records. That bill, passed overwhelmingly by the House and supported by the Obama administration, required a 60-vote majority to proceed. It fell three votes short.

The Senate then failed to advance a two-month extension of the expiring Patriot Act provision that would extend the NSA phone records program. That vote was seven short of the required 69 votes, reports NPR Washington desk senior editor Shirley Henry.

Sen. Majority Leader McConnell tried to secure unanimous consent agreements on a number of measures aimed at preventing the program from lapsing on June 1, when the Patriot Act provision expires, Henry reports.

McConnell first proposed a measure to extend the act to June 8. But Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican presidential contender, objected, saying he wants two amendments debated and voted on.

""Our forefathers would be aghast,"" Paul said.

Henry reports that McConnell then tried for an extension to June 5, but there was an objection. His proposal for June 3 met another objection; then Paul objected to a June 2 extension, Henry says.

Unable to get agreement on any extension, McConnell said the Senate will come back at 4 p.m. on May 31 to try again, beginning with a vote on the House bill. That gives lawmakers only a few hours to prevent the Patriot Act provisions from expiring.

The majority leader stressed that it's a dangerous time to allow the law to expire, given the threats overseas and attempted attacks here, and urged the Senate to act ""responsibly"" to protect the country, Henry reports.

The Justice Department has said the NSA would begin winding down collection of domestic phone records this week if the Senate failed to act, according to the Associated Press."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jesse Costa/WBUR Jesse Costa/WBUR

NPR — along with seven public radio stations around the country — is chronicling the lives of America's troops where they live. We're calling the project ""Back at Base.""

Walk through a town square this Memorial Day and you might just see a marker or monument commemorating sacrifice in war. On it: The name of an American who died in combat.

In some parts of the city of Boston, there are markers on nearly every corner.

One of those markers is at the intersection of Commonwealth Avenue and Colborne Road in the Allston-Brighton section of Boston. On one corner — near the trolley line — is a small sign with two American flags. It reads: ""Staff Sgt. John H. McCarthy Square.""

He lived just up the street, but never returned home after his second tour of duty to Vietnam.

""He loved the country and he thought that we're at war and that he wanted to fight for his country. He thought that was the right thing to do and that's what he did,"" says Richie McCarthy, who still gets emotional when talking about his big brother, Jack.

The two brothers, born about two years apart were close growing up in Allston-Brighton. The boys' father died when they were toddlers. As a child, Jack developed a talent. He liked to paint. He was a perfectionist.

""A lot of times he did these paintings and he'd do it and I'd say it's a beautiful painting, and the next thing I know, he'd have painted over it so he could paint again,"" says Richie.

By 1960, Jack developed an interest in the military, and on his 17th birthday enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps.

""He was like a tall, good lookin' kid. And he looked like a Marine,"" says Dan Daley, one of Jack's childhood friends. ""He was probably like 6'1"", maybe 215, muscular type of kid. When you saw him in his uniform, it was impressive. I mean he could be a poster boy for the Marines.""

By all accounts, Jack McCarthy thrived in the Marine Corps. In 1962, he was chosen for a training exercise observed by President John F. Kennedy. Later that year, he was assigned to a ship deployed during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was sent to Vietnam for the first time in 1965.

He was assigned to work with local South Vietnamese villagers, and root out the Viet Cong. He wrote home about it in November 1965:

Dear Mom, I will really miss some of the people in this village. All the kids call me by my name, and most of the older people to [sic]. We have had a few more brushes with the V.C. in our area but we are getting smarter than them because we have been killing them. And they haven't hurt us for a long time. Your loving son, Jackie.

After 13 months in Vietnam, Jack returned stateside. But by late 1967, his brother remembers, he was called again, to return to Vietnam.

""We had conversations before he went back the second time, and he told me that he thought something could happen,"" says Richie.

And something did happen. On the morning of Feb.18, 1968, Jack McCarthy stepped on an enemy explosive device, and was severely wounded. He was evacuated to a Naval field hospital in Danang, and was able to send some letters home:

Dear Mom, Sorry not to have written before but I'm feeling better now and am going to be okay. I'm lucky it wasn't any worse but I've lost my right leg, and the sight of my right eye. Don't worry about it. Please. Your loving son, John.

He was eventually transferred to an Army hospital in Japan. But despite the efforts of surgeons, he died on the morning of March 25, 1968. He was 24 years old.

""When I think of him, I just think what a shame it is he couldn't really live his life,"" Dan Daley says. ""You know, when I'd see his name on the wall like I was in D.C. recently, that's all I think of, what a shame, poor kid, he was so young. He never really had children or he didn't really have a life, he was just starting out, and snuffed out. It was sad, he had a lot of potential, it just wasn't realized.""

Not realized, but not forgotten."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP Charlie Neibergall/AP

This post has been updated to reflect that Pataki is officially running.

George Pataki announced his presidential candidacy in Exeter, N.H., on Thursday. He's the eighth official Republican entrant in the 2016 race for the White House. The field is expected to double over the next couple of months. Pataki has made numerous visits and a few friends in recent months in the Granite State, home of the first primary in 2016. Still, the mention of his name in most of the country might prompt questions of, ""Who?"" and possibly, ""Why?""

That is remarkable, considering that Pataki served three four-year terms as governor of New York, which at the time of his election was still the second-most populous state in the nation. And while he has been out of office since 2007, he is the last Republican to win a major statewide election in New York in more than 20 years.

Pataki may have had more momentum had he entered the presidential sweepstakes of 2008, when he had just completed a dozen years as governor and was better known. But the 2008 field also included Rudolph Giuliani, whose time as mayor of New York City had largely coincided with Pataki's tenure in Albany. At the time, Giuliani was regarded as formidable, perhaps even the front-runner. And though he ultimately won no primaries, he consigned Pataki to second place in the hearts of New York funders and in the lenses of the New York-based media.

This time around, Pataki hopes to break out of the pack in New Hampshire, where his political action committee has already been running ads. This is a purple state, where Republicans may value his record as a fiscal conservative and accept his relatively liberal positions on abortion, gun control and environmental protection. These latter views will not be espoused by Pataki's rivals in the GOP primaries, but he is counting on finding a market for them among GOP primary voters.

He's a long shot, but here are five things to know about George Pataki:

1. He defeated the liberal icon Mario Cuomo to win the governorship in 1994.

It was a big midterm sweep for the GOP that fall, with the House going Republican for the first time in 40 years and bringing the Senate along on the tide. But just as stunning were the outcomes in the states, where many incumbent Democratic governors went down. Pataki bagged the biggest prize that day, shocking the political world by defeating three-term incumbent Mario Cuomo, the man who had symbolized liberal resistance to Ronald Reagan's conservatism. Pataki piled up 2-1 margins in the Upstate counties and won enough in New York City's outer boroughs and suburbs to prevail by 4 percentage points. Cuomo, once a leading Democratic prospect for president, never ran for office again, although his son, Andrew, was elected governor in 2010 and re-elected in 2014.

2. He was governor during the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

The nation's shock and anger over the destruction of the World Trade Center's twin towers by al-Qaida terrorists afforded many moments of political opportunity, but most of these benefited President George W. Bush and Mayor Giuliani. Pataki was on the scene and involved in much of the difficult aftermath. But he never cut the sort of media figure his fellow Republicans did, and neither did he receive the same boost in national renown.

3. His background combines mainly elements of New York's historic and political mix.

Pataki's father was a Hungarian immigrant and his mother a mix of Italian and Irish stock, a combination typical in New York City's always changing demographics. But the Patakis settled in Peekskill, an hour north of the megalopolis of New York City up the Hudson River. There, they started as farmers, and it gave the young Pataki a touch of Upstate in his upbringing. A promising student, the young Pataki went to Yale, then Columbia Law School. After a stint on Wall Street, he went back up the Hudson Valley to practice law in the suburbs and then to run for office.

4. He has never lost an election for public office.

In his late 30s, Pataki ran for mayor of Peekskill on a reform platform and won. Two years later, in 1984, he took on an incumbent Democratic state legislator and won. (It was the last presidential year in which New York went Republican.) In 1992, he challenged an incumbent state senator in the Republican primary and won. Then he made the huge leap from first-termer in the state Senate to GOP nominee for governor, and then, despite Giuliani endorsing his opponent and despite the third-party presence of a conservative businessman, Pataki ousted Cuomo in 1994. He was re-elected in 1998 and 2002 and has not run since.

5. He's the oldest of the presidential prospects on the Republican side and the only one of the major contenders who is older than Hillary Clinton. If elected, he would be the oldest person to take the oath as president.

The former governor of New York was born in June of 1945, so he will be 71 on Election Day 2016. It is rare for American politicians to make a first bid for the presidency in their 70s (although Independent Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders is four years Pataki's senior and prospective candidate Jim Webb is 69). Ronald Reagan was the oldest president to assume office, two weeks shy of his 70th birthday. The rest of the 2016 White House field is younger, although some are in their 60s. Hillary Clinton was born in October 1947, so she would still be 69 on Election Day 2016. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry would be 66, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson 65, Ohio Gov. John Kasich 64, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush 63, former CEO Carly Fiorina 62, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Sen. Lindsey Graham would be 61."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jim Urquhart/AP Jim Urquhart/AP

The Department of Defense says an attempt to ship inactive anthrax samples resulted in live samples being sent to labs in nine U.S. states and to a U.S. Air Force base in South Korea.

Fears of exposure to the potentially deadly disease prompted officials to advise four civilian workers to get preventive care; more than 20 military personnel are also being monitored. The samples were sent via commercial shipping companies, but the Pentagon says there is ""no known risk to the general public.""

The spores were supposed to have been killed by being irradiated. But at least one lab, in Maryland, reported receiving spores that were still alive. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating the accidental shipment.

From NPR's Science Desk, Geoff Brumfiel reports:

""The anthrax came from the Army's Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, which conducts biosecurity research. The samples were apparently sent to labs in nine states as part of ongoing efforts to develop field tests for anthrax. ""Tests are usually conducted with dead samples of anthrax, and an investigation is now under way to learn why live samples were sent instead. Anthrax are highly infectious bacteria that can travel through the air and infect people. ""So far, the Pentagon says it appears nobody has become sick from the mistake. It has suspended all shipments of biological agents from its labs until an investigation is completed.""

The military says 22 personnel were potentially exposed to the live sample at a U.S. base in South Korea.

From Seoul, NPR's Elise Hu reports:

""The military destroyed the anthrax on Wednesday after the sample, which was thought to be inactive, was suspected of being live. None of the personnel in contact showed signs of exposure. But they were given exams, antibiotics, and in some cases, vaccinations. ""The military stresses there was no risk to the public. The exposure happened in a contained lab environment on the Osan Air Base, which is 65 miles south of Seoul. It's one of a number of bases that houses the estimated 28,000 American military personnel based in South Korea.""

According to the CDC's fact page on anthrax, it's caused by ""rod-shaped bacteria known as Bacillus anthracis,"" is found naturally in soil, and affects domestic and wild animals around the world.

Anthrax can cause severe illness, the CDC says — the agency adds that while the disease can spread through spores, ""anthrax is not contagious, which means you can't catch it like the cold or flu."""

Arrest and search warrants have been executed against senior FIFA officials and several executives for what the Justice Department says was a corrupt scheme that gleaned ""well over $150 million in bribes and kickbacks"" over the course of 24 years.

The department announced that it has indicted 14 people from the U.S. and South America — including nine senior officials with FIFA, soccer's international governing body. Seven of the FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland early Wednesday.

""This really is the World Cup of fraud,"" says Richard Weber, chief of the IRS' Criminal Investigation unit, ""and today we are issuing FIFA a red card.""

Acting upon a U.S. request, Swiss police apprehended the seven FIFA officials at the Baur au Lac, a luxury hotel on Lake Zurich where they had gathered ahead of FIFA's pending presidential election.

Of the nine officials who were indicted, two of them are FIFA vice presidents. Charges in the 47-count indictment include bribery, racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud. Five corporate executives were also indicted.

FIFA says it has provisionally banned those who were named in the charges.

Nearly all of the charges center on tournaments and other activities that took place in the U.S. and South America. The bribes allegedly influenced the awarding of media and marketing rights to international tournaments.

U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch also says U.S. investigators linked both the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and the 2011 FIFA presidential election to corruption.

A sponsorship deal between Brazil's national soccer team and ""a major U.S. sportswear company"" was also tied to bribery, the attorney general says.

Also Wednesday morning, Swiss federal prosecutors said they had opened an investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar, respectively. But FIFA is reiterating that it would not consider moving those tournaments.

Update at 2:50 p.m. ET: Blatter: 'We Understand The Disappointment'

Breaking a silence that had drawn speculation and criticism as it lingered, FIFA President Sepp Blatter says that while the events are ""unfortunate,"" FIFA is taking steps to root out corruption, and ""we welcome the actions and the investigations by the U.S. and Swiss authorities.""

He added: ""such misconduct has no place in football and we will ensure that those who engage in it are put out of the game. Following the events of today, the independent Ethics Committee... took swift action to provisionally ban those individuals named by the authorities from any football-related activities at the national and international level.""

Calling it a difficult time for soccer, Blatter said, ""We understand the disappointment that many have expressed.""

Update at 10:50 a.m. ET: U.S. Details Charges

Announcing the charges, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch says the accused officials ""corrupted the business of worldwide soccer"" to enrich themselves.

At a mid-morning news conference in New York, Lynch said that ""beginning in 1991, two generations of soccer officials"" in the U.S. and South America used positions of trust to obtain money in return for help in securing marketing and media rights and other favors.

Lynch said federal agents are executing search warrants at CONCACAF offices in Miami today. And she said the federal investigation found that the Copa America tournament, which is set to be played in the United States next year for the first time, was also the center of bribes.

She stated that the money involved was found to be ""$110 million — nearly a third of the legitimate costs"" for several years' worth of rights to the tournament.

Lynch noted that a former CONCACAF president who ostensibly served without pay actually received some $10 million in bribes.

Our original post continues:

""Jeffrey Webb and Jack Warner — the current and former presidents of CONCACAF, the continental confederation under FIFA headquartered in the United States — are among the soccer officials charged with racketeering and bribery offenses,"" the U.S. Justice Department said earlier today.

[See the full list of those indicted at the bottom of this post.]

The seven people arrested today are among nine senior FIFA officials — including two of the group's current vice presidents — the U.S. has indicted. Charges in the 47-count indictment include bribery, racketeering, money laundering, and wire fraud. Five U.S. and South American corporate executives were also indicted.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch says:

""It spans at least two generations of soccer officials who, as alleged, have abused their positions of trust to acquire millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks. And it has profoundly harmed a multitude of victims, from the youth leagues and developing countries that should benefit from the revenue generated by the commercial rights these organizations hold, to the fans at home and throughout the world whose support for the game makes those rights valuable.""

The U.S. attorney's charges were first reported by The New York Times.

At a news conference today, FIFA spokesman Walter De Gregorio said the organization's president, Sepp Blatter of Switzerland, was not a target of the investigations and that Friday's election for FIFA president would go ahead as scheduled. Blatter is being challenged by Jordanian Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein.

The U.S. is requesting the extradition of the seven officials. Swiss authorities said the detainees will be questioned Wednesday and have the right to contest their extradition.

In addition to the 14 people indicted in the U.S. case, an additional four individuals and two corporations had earlier pleaded guilty under seal. In those arrangements, at least three people each forfeited more than $1 million — including one, Brazilian sports executive José Hawilla, who agreed to hand over $151 million.

According to the Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police, the U.S. says others are accused of bribing the officials:

""The bribery suspects — representatives of sports media and sports promotion firms — are alleged to have been involved in schemes to make payments to the soccer functionaries — delegates of FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) and other functionaries of FIFA sub-organizations — totaling more than USD 100 million. In return, it is believed that they received media, marketing, and sponsorship rights in connection with soccer tournaments in Latin America. According to the US request, these crimes were agreed and prepared in the US, and payments were carried out via US banks.""

In the investigation concerning Russia and Qatar, Swiss authorities raided FIFA's headquarters early this morning, seizing electronic data and documents. Swiss prosecutors said they will interview 10 FIFA executive committee members who took part in the votes to award the World Cup to Russia and Qatar.

FIFA spokesman De Gregorio said FIFA had gone to Swiss authorities in November with concerns that the bidding process was corrupt.

""This is the consequences of what we initiated,"" said De Gregorio. ""So it's a surprise that it happened today, but it's not a surprise that it happened.

""We cannot investigate as the police can or a general prosecutor can. So that's the reason why we did it and that's the reason why we fully cooperate.""

FIFA governs the world's most popular sport. The multibillion-dollar organization has been accused of bribery and corruption for decades.

Update at 12:20 p.m. ET. Up To 450 More Troops:

President Obama has authorized the Pentagon to send up to 450 additional troops to Iraq in an effort to beef up the training of local security forces in their fight against the self-proclaimed Islamic State.

In a statement, press secretary Josh Earnest said the military personnel will ""train, advise, and assist Iraqi Security Forces at Taqaddum military base in eastern Anbar province.""

He added: ""The President made this decision after a request from Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi and upon the recommendation of Secretary Carter and Chairman Dempsey, and with the unanimous support of his national security team.""

The U.S. already has 3,100 troops in the country. They're deployed at four established training sites. The additional troops will be deployed to Anbar province, an area just west of Baghdad that is reportedly now under Islamic State control.

Our original post continues:

The Obama administration is considering sending hundreds more troops into Iraq to help train local forces to fight against the self-proclaimed Islamic State.

NPR's Tom Bowman reports the move comes after Islamic State militants reportedly took over the provincial capital city of Ramadi in the Sunni heartland.

He filed this report for our Newscast unit:

""U.S. trainers now in Iraq have focused mostly on the Shiite-dominated Army. Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren told reporters that the U.S. would like to see more Sunnis come into the pipeline for training. ""Officials say hundreds more American trainers could be sent to Anbar province, the Sunni enclave just west of Baghdad that is now largely under the control of Islamic State fighters. ""Sunni tribal leaders have long complained of mistreatment by the Shiite-dominated government. ""The Pentagon is now working up added training options for the White House. There are already some 3,000 American troops in Iraq, either training and advising Iraqi troops or providing security.""

President Obama addressed this issue during a press conference earlier this week. Obama said he was still waiting on a finalized plan from the Pentagon.

""We don't yet have a complete strategy because it requires commitments on the part of the Iraqis as well about how recruitment takes place, how that training takes place,"" Obama said. ""And so the details of that are not yet worked out.""

Fox News reports that the Pentagon also plans to open another training base in Anbar province. The network quotes Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, saying it's still unclear whether more troops will be needed for that base."

Updated at 11:10 a.m. EST

The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., today is holding its first Sunday service following a horrific shooting that killed nine members of a Bible study group there.

Dylann Roof, 21 — who has apparently expressed strong racist and white supremacist views — is charged in the Wednesday night killings, in which nine members of a Bible study group at the historic black church were shot dead. Emanuel AME's pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pickney, was among those killed.

As parishioners and visitors fanned themselves against the heat of the first day of summer, the service opened at 9:30 a.m. EDT to filled pews. Hundreds more gathered outside the church.

The service opened with the hymns ""Praise God, From Whom All Blessings Flow"" and ""Blessed Assurance.""

The Rev. Norvel Goff said: ""we still believe prayer changes things. ... prayer not only changes things, it changes us.""

""Many hearts are broken and tears being shed,"" he said. ""Through it all we are reminded that we serve a God who still cares.""

Delivering the sermon later, he acknowledged ""it has been tough. It has been rough. Some of us have been downright angry.""

But, he said, ""We have shown the world how we as a group of people can come together and pray and work out things that need to be worked out, to make a better state and place to live.""

He thanked Gov. Nikki Haley for making sure ""the perpetrator that committed that heinous act was pursued and captured and brought back to South Carolina.""

He also thanked Charleston Mayor Joseph Ripley and law enforcement.

""I have no problem with doing it,"" he said to loud applause.

""Respect gets respect,"" Goff said.

""We have difficulties ahead, but the only way evil can triumph is for good folks to sit down and do nothing,"" he said.

Earlier, the Rev. John H. Gillison prayed that ""in life there are ups and downs. There are dark days, but there are also bright days.""

He called on God to ""guide and strengthen those families who were victimized,"" and referring to Wednesday's tragedy said ""the devil tried to take charge.""

""But the devil cannot take control of your people and cannot take control of your church,"" Gillison said.

NPR's Debbie Elliott, reporting from the church, says: ""It's a very emotional day for the city of Charleston. People are gathering, bringing flowers, weeping, praying, and preparing for this very difficult morning.""

Debbie adds: ""This is all happening at the same time that police officers and their dogs are doing searches of the parking lot and preparing the church to be a safe place for people to come and remember this morning.""

The Rev. Randolph Miller, pastor of Nichols Chapel AME Church in Charleston, tells CNN: ""We must continue to preach [forgiveness] and drive it home. It won't happen overnight, but we must not stop preaching forgiveness.""

""Hopefully one day it will sink in and bring a change,"" he said."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Rainier Ehrhardt/AP Rainier Ehrhardt/AP

This story was updated at 12:45 p.m. ET

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal announced Wednesday he is running for president, becoming the 13th major Republican candidate to enter the race.

Once seen as a rising star in the GOP, the 44-year-old Indian-American politician now faces long odds in a crowded primary. He's mired at the bottom of most polls, a situation that threatens to keep him off the main debate stage in the first GOP presidential primary debates in August.

That wasn't always the outlook for the former congressman. Seen as a policy wunderkind, who quickly moved up the ranks from state and federal administrations to lead his state, he was mentioned as a 2012 presidential candidate, but eventually passed on the race. Though his approval ratings in the Bayou State have dropped dramatically amid budget fights, he has still tried to keep a high national profile by hitting the cattle-call circuit to build up his White House chances.

Jindal's best shot at catching fire in 2016 is to appeal to religious conservatives, especially in the early states of Iowa and South Carolina. But that's a crowded space this time around. Though he's a Roman Catholic, he has said he considers himself an ""evangelical Catholic."" At last week's Faith and Freedom Coalition gathering in Washington, he got a good reception from the crowd as he shared his personal journey to Christianity, and Iowa GOP observers have also said he's gotten positive marks on the trail there, too.

Here are five things to know about Bobby Jindal:

1. Bobby isn't his real name; it's a nickname inspired by The Brady Bunch.

Jindal was born Piyush Jindal in Baton Rouge in 1971 to parents who had emigrated just months earlier from India. When he was 4 years old, he asked to be called Bobby after one of the brothers on the popular family sitcom.

Raised Hindu, Jindal converted to Christianity in high school after a friend shared his faith with him. Jindal would read his Bible with a flashlight in his closet, hiding his conversion from his parents.

""I read the words of Jesus Christ, and I realized that they were true,"" Jindal said in a 2014 commencement address at Liberty University. ""I used to think that I had found God, but I believe it is more accurate to say that He found me.""

2. He's a Rhodes scholar — and had a young start in government and public policy.

Jindal graduated at just 20 years old from Brown University with degrees in both biology and public policy. He was admitted to both Harvard Medical School and Yale Law School, but he turned down both to attend Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar.

There, he studied health policy and eventually returned to his native state to serve as secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals — all at the young age of 24. Four years later, at just 28, he was appointed the youngest-ever president of the University of Louisiana system.

In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed him to be assistant secretary for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, acting as the chief policy adviser to the director of HHS.

3. Jindal lost his first run for elective office, but has won every one since.

Jindal left his role with HHS in 2003 to run for governor. Louisiana has an open primary system in which all candidates are on the ballot regardless of party. In that first vote, Jindal topped the field, easily besting the second-place finisher, Democratic Lt. Gov. Kathleen Blanco. But in that November's runoff election, Blanco narrowly prevailed, despite the fact that Jindal earned some Democratic support, including an endorsement from then-New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin. Some believed racism was to blame for his close loss.

Jindal went on to be elected to Congress the following year, though, and was re-elected in 2006. Under fire for her handling of the recovery from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Blanco decided not to run for re-election. Jindal ran again and, this time, he easily beat state Sen. Walter Boasso, who had switched from the GOP just that April to run for governor. In 2011, Jindal won outright without a runoff, winning with more than 65 percent of the vote.

4. One of Jindal's biggest moments instead drew comparison to Kenneth the page.

In 2009, the young Louisiana governor was tapped to deliver the GOP response to newly elected President Obama's first address to a joint session of Congress. The plum post was supposed to launch him onto the national stage and buttress a Republican Party badly in need of diversity.

YouTube

But Jindal, normally a fast talker, looked halting and timid, as he awkwardly delivered an attempt at a folksy speech. Both Republicans and Democrats panned the address, and many unflatteringly compared him to 30 Rock's bumpkin character, Kenneth the page.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press

5. He has the Duck Dynasty seal of approval.

One TV comparison Jindal is happy to feed is his relationship with the Robertson family, stars of the popular A&E series Duck Dynasty. The show chronicles the camo-clad, bearded family that runs a booming duck-call business. It is popular among conservatives and those in the Bible Belt; the Robertson family are seen praying each episode and talking openly about their faith.

But Jindal's connection to the show hasn't been without controversy. The family patriarch, Phil, came under fire for comments he made about people who are gay; Jindal, though, stood behind him and criticized Robertson's suspension from the network. When Jindal began to explore a White House run, the Robertson family had his back as well.

""I'm the kind of guy who really likes smart people ... and that guy's one of the smartest people I've ever met in my life,"" son Willie Robertson said on Fox News earlier this year, throwing his support behind Jindal. ""He's young, but he's got the values; he's got the intelligence to do it."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images

This post was updated at 12:15 p.m. ET to reflect the Supreme Court's ruling.

The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that state-based subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are legal. A different decision could have affected the health care of millions of Americans. In King v. Burwell, the court chose to allow the exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare, to many) to continue operating as-is. It could have ended the subsidies in most states allowing many lower-income Americans to afford the insurance offered through those sites.

At issue in the case was a phrase in the law stating that the government will subsidize patients in exchanges ""established by the state."" In King v. Burwell, the question was whether those subsidies should then go to people participating in the exchanges in the 34 states that didn't set up their own — that is, in states where the exchanges are federally run to some degree.

There are two broad paths the Supreme court could have taken here, but within those, there is a lot of room for variation:

1. A ruling for Burwell

Everything stays the way it is — people keep getting their subsidies in all states, regardless of whether the government, the state, or a mix of the two, runs their exchanges.

2. A ruling for King

Obamacare customers in states using federal exchanges would have likely lost their subsidies altogether. That means an estimated 6.4 million people could have lost the tax credits that helped them pay for their insurance through the exchanges.

But there were other potential, more mixed outcomes in which fewer people would have lost their subsidies. Because there were different configurations of federal-state cooperation, residents of some states could have kept their subsidies, while others could have lost them. For example, five states have state-run marketplaces using federal websites — it was possible that the court could have decided either way on those states, as they use federal resources, even while operating their own state marketplaces.

So what could have ended up mattering here was the question of what a state-run exchange is. It was possible the court could have defined that, but it could have also sent it to the administration. And depending on how the administration set the bar on what makes a state-run exchange, this path could have led to still more litigation from Obamacare opponents, challenging how the administration set that definition, explains Linda Blumberg at the Urban Institute.

More Uninsured, Higher Premiums Possible

In the 16 states (plus the District of Columbia) with state-run exchanges, nothing would have changed with this outcome. But the effects in the other 34 states could have gone beyond just more expensive health care. One study from the Urban Institute estimated that 8.2 million more people would have joined the ranks of the uninsured in this case. Not only that, but because so many healthy individuals would have exited the exchanges, premiums would have gone up by an estimated 35 percent for people remaining on the exchanges in the states that lost their subsidies.

Florida, by far, leads the pack in having the most people who were at risk of losing their credits. There, a staggering 1.3 million people could have lost subsidized health insurance, missing out on an average subsidy of $294 per month, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. In Alaska, fewer than 17,000 people could have been affected, but their price tags could have grown in a huge way — by $536 per month on average.

Updated at 1 p.m. ET

The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday handed the Obama administration a major victory on health care, ruling 6-3 that nationwide subsidies called for in the Affordable Care Act are legal.

""Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" the court's majority said in the opinion, which was written by Chief Justice John Roberts. But they acknowledged that ""petitioners' arguments about the plain meaning ... are strong.""

The majority opinion cited the law's ""more than a few examples of inartful drafting,"" but added, ""the context and structure of the Act compel us to depart from what would otherwise be the most natural reading of the pertinent statutory phrase.""

Roberts was joined by the court's liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, as well as by Anthony Kennedy.

In his dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said: ""We should start calling this law SCOTUScare,"" an apparent reference to the fact the Supreme Court has now saved the Affordable Care Act twice. Scalia called the majority's reading of the text ""quite absurd, and the court's 21 pages of explanation make it no less so.""

As NPR's Nina Totenberg reported in March, opponents of the law contended ""that the text of the law does not authorize subsidies to make mandated insurance affordable in 34 states.""

At issue were six words in one section of the law. As Nina pointed out: ""Those words stipulate that for people who cannot afford health coverage, subsidies are available through 'an exchange established by the state.' "" She added:

""The government [contended] that those words refer to any exchange, whether it is set up by the state itself or an exchange run for the state by the federal government in accordance with individual state insurance laws and regulations. The challengers [said] the statute means what it says and no more.""

The court agreed Thursday with the government's position.

The decision comes three years after a bitterly divided high court upheld the Affordable Care Act as constitutional by a 5-4 vote.

President Obama made a statement on the ruling late Thursday morning, saying the Affordable Care Act ""is here to stay.""

Today's case was King v. Burwell."

One person has been killed and at least 12 others injured in an attack on a gas factory in a small town in southeastern France. Officials say it was a terrorist attack: A flag of the self-declared Islamic State was reportedly found at the factory southeast of Lyon.

One suspect has been arrested over the attack, which also included an explosion at the facility operated by Air Products, an American company whose headquarters are in Pennsylvania. It's not yet certain whether he was acting alone.

""The terrorist nature of this act are without doubt,"" says French President Francois Hollande, who will return home today from a European Union economic summit in Brussels.

Update at 8:25 p.m. ET: Details On Victim, Vehicle

The person who was killed was the manager of a transport company who was making a delivery, according to local newspaper Le Dauphine Libere. The newspaper adds that the prefect of Isere, John Paul Bonnetain, says the attacking vehicle was authorized to enter the factory — giving support to the theory that the vehicle belonged to a contractor or supplier.

Le Dauphine Libere also reports that a second arrest has been made — of a person whose vehicle was seen repeatedly passing in front of the factory Friday morning — but that no direct link has been established between the events.

Update at 7:25 p.m. ET: Suspect Had Been Monitored

Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve says that the suspect in the case, who is believed to have lived near Lyon, had no prior criminal record. He also said that the man had been monitored by authorities as far back as 2006, but he was found not to be in communication with terrorist groups.

Cazeneuve also stated that the suspect had been detained by a local firefighter who was among the first responders at the scene.

""I salute this courage,"" he said.

Our original post continues:

From Calais, NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports:

""One or maybe two men rammed the gates of a gas factory in the small industrial town. An explosion followed. The man killed was beheaded, and his head was placed at the front of the factory along with a flag of the so-called Islamic State. ""Residents of the small town of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier interviewed on television expressed shock that such an attack could take place in their tiny town.""

According to its website, Air Products specializes in producing industrial and medical gases, listing oxygen, nitrogen, argon, helium and hydrogen as its chief products.

France's interior minister has ordered increased security at other potential targets around the country.

Speaking about the attack, Hollande said, ""Our answer is prevention, deterrence and thus the necessity of embracing values and not giving in to fear, ever."""

Democrats are on the path to including an endorsement of same-sex marriage for the first time in their official party platform.

NPR's Ari Shapiro reported Monday that the proposal has made it through an important Democratic committee.

The 15 Democrats who serve on the party's platform drafting committee voted unanimously to endorse same-sex marriage in the party's official agenda, says Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who serves on the committee.

Frank recently married his partner.

The effort to include gay marriage picked up steam after President Obama expressed his personal support for the cause in May.

Ohio could very well be the state where what's expected to be a very close presidential race gets decided.

And every indication is that the economy will be the issue that drives the majority of voters to either President Obama or Mitt Romney.

Which explains why on Thursday both the Democratic president and the all-but-official Republican nominee were, again, in Ohio to argue why he and not his opponent should be president starting January 20, 2013.

Each rehearsed his economic arguments in campaign appearances in his respective Buckeye State stronghold. Obama was in heavily Democratic Cleveland on the state's northern edge. Romney was in the Republican bastion of Cincinnati along the state's southern rim bordering Kentucky.

Their appearances in their Ohio electoral sweet spots had symbolic significance: Success or failure for each depends on whose campaign is best at turning out the most voters in the reddest and bluest parts of the state.

The specific venues for their speeches also held additional meaning. Obama spoke at Cuyahoga Community College, a reminder of his pledge to ""invest"" in domestic priorities, including higher education, and a reflection of his strength with younger voters.

Romney spoke at a small business, a maker of manufacturing equipment. It was a site chosen to underscore his message that he is the better candidate for American business and thus the economy.

As for the speeches themselves, both men mainly repeated themes voters have heard many times before.

Obama again reminded voters how the economy had been in free fall when he became president, how his policies helped stabilize it and by some measures brought real progress, and then he provided his vision of a better economic future for middle-class Americans.

Also, because Obama's best hope for re-election is to frame the contest as a choice between two radically different views of the future depending on who wins, the president hammered repeatedly at his argument against the GOP challenger.

He said a Romney presidency — with more tax cuts for the wealthy and presidential hostility to spending on middle class priorities — would be a third term for George W. Bush, or even worse, though he never mentioned his predecessor by name.

Romney, for his part, continued to make his case that Obama had failed to turn around the economy in his 3 1/2 years in office and had even made it worse. Obama broke his promises, Romney said. And he reminded voters that Obama himself said early in his presidency that his administration would be a ""one-term proposition"" if the economy didn't significantly improve.

It was all a part of Romney's effort to make sure voters go to the polls in November seeing their vote as a referendum on Obama, instead of a choice between the candidates.

Not that Romney didn't have his own economic vision. He offered what he said were ""three big ideas"" for increasing the lift under the U.S. economy — more domestic energy production, repealing ""Obamacare"" and attacking federal deficits.

In an appeal to middle-class voters, Romney said he didn't care about ""job creators,"" meaning the most financially successful Americans, for their own sake; rather he cared about them because of the need for jobs.

Thursday's speeches were watched closely by observers of American politics for the any nuances that could indicate a new theme or direction.

It's important to remember, however, that these are still early days in the presidential race. It's only June and most voters really aren't paying attention to the daily messaging of the campaigns and won't be until the fall, if ever.

Still, for some interested observers like Jason Fichtner, an expert in Social Security and federal tax and budget policy, the dueling speeches underscored a continuing frustration with the realities of the campaign trail.

""The problem I'm having with campaign speeches in general, is they are long on rhetoric and short on substance,"" said Fichtner, senior research fellow at George Mason University's Libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center where Charles Koch, a founder, serves on the board. ""Voters, and me, as a policy analyst, want them to say, 'Here is a plan,' and not blame someone else for our problems.' ""

""Is the economy in better shape than four years ago? Yes,"" says Fichtner, who served as a top official in the Social Security Administration during the Bush administration and into Obama's term, ""but could it be better?""

He characterized the differences between the visions put forth by Obama and Romney like this: Obama's view is that the private sector should alleviate the burdens of the public sector, and vice versa for Romney.

Bruce Bartlett, a columnist and blogger on fiscal issues who once worked for congressional Republicans, and in the Reagan and first Bush administrations, but who is now an independent who voted for Obama, said it's up to the president to effectively point out the flaws in Romney's campaign statements, something the president took pains to do Thursday in a 53-minute speech.

""Every single person who runs for president implies there are going to be radical changes the day they're elected,"" he said. ""It seems to me that Romney has gone beyond the norm in this area... And it's up to Obama to draw him out. 'Tell me specifically what taxes are you going to raise? What programs are you going to cut? That's his job. And the job of his campaign."""

Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney called it an ""outrageous charge"" and said called on President Obama to ""take your campaign of division and anger and hate back to Chicago.""

The Obama campaign defended Biden and said his words were meant to counter Republican promises to ""unshackle"" the economy from regulations. Biden himself later said he had intended to use the word ""unshackle,"" and that ""it's their policies and the effects of their policies on middle class America"" that is ""outrageous.""

A day after a gunman opened fire at two military centers in Chattanooga, Tenn., and killed four Marines, authorities are trying to answer the big question: Why?

At a late-night press conference, authorities said they had yet to pin down a motive. But earlier, officials identified the shooter as 24-year-old Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, who died during the course of the attack.

Enlarge this image toggle caption AP AP

So, who is he? Here's what we know so far:

-- NPR's Dina Temple-Raston reports that Adbulazeez was a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Kuwait. His parents are Jordanian.

-- FBI Special Agent in Charge Ed Reinhold said there is nothing that ""directly ties [the gunman] to an international terrorist organization.""

-- Law enforcement sources tell Dina that Abdulazeez's father was investigated for ties to terrorism a couple of years ago. The Washington Post reports he was added and later removed from a terrorism watch list.

-- Dina reports: ""Investigators were digging into his online activity last night. He doesn't have much of an online presence and they have found no connection to terrorist groups so far. (The lack of online presence is meaningful, AQ and ISIS cases typically have a lot of online presence and griping beforehand. That didn't happen in this case.)""

-- People who knew Adbulazeez told news media that they were surprised that he would do a thing like this.

-- The Times Free Press in Chattanooga reports:

""No one seems to have seen it coming. FBI officials said they had no warning of a pending attack. And his family and friends are baffled. "" 'They're nice people, you know?' said Elijah Wilkerson, a neighbor whose wife went on walks with Abdulazeez. 'He must have just snapped.' "" 'I never thought in a million years that it would be this guy,' said Kagan Wagner, one of his high school classmates. 'He was friendly, funny, kind.' ""

-- CNN reports that Abdulazeez was a wrestler and also a devout Muslim:

""He at times interrupted training sessions with fighting coach [Scott] Schraeder to pray. "" 'I wouldn't call it overly religious,' Schraeder said. 'He followed his religion; he would pray at six o'clock. He'd go into our office and pray.' But he would skip prayers at times, he said. ""Schraeder does not believe he was an extremist. "" 'His favorite training partner to grapple with — not striking, but actually submission grapple with, when you're actually on the ground in close proximity contact with — was a Russian Jew, hardly what you would see as someone who would be a radical Islamist,' Schraeder said.""

-- The Washington Post reports that after graduating from high school, Abdulazeez earned an engineering degree from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 2012.

""His family was rooted in the community of Hixson, a Chattanooga suburb,"" the paper reports. ""His father, Youssef, was employed by Chattanooga's Public Works Department.""

-- The Times Free Press reports that Abdulazeez had one previous run-in with police: He was arrested in April for driving under the influence.

The paper adds:

""The arresting officer noted the smell of alcohol and marijuana, and said Abdulazeez had a white powdery substance around his nose, according to the arrest report. ""Abdulazeez told police he had been around friends that night who'd been drinking and smoking. But he failed a sobriety test, was arrested and released on a $2,000 bond.""

-- The New York Times relays much the same account about Abdulazeez: a young man who was living a fairly ordinary suburban life in the United States.

But recently, the paper reports, Abdulazeez may have been changing.

The Times points to a blog that the SITE Intelligence Group, an organization that tracks international terrorist groups, says was kept by Abdulazeez.

The Times reports:

""A July 13 post stated that 'life is short and bitter' and that Muslims should not let 'the opportunity to submit to Allah ... pass you by.' ""Photographs posted on family Facebook pages show the once-clean-cut student recently grew a beard. ""In the last two or three months, Mr. Abdulazeez had begun showing up rather regularly at Friday Prayer at the Islamic Society of Greater Chattanooga, a large mosque and cultural center, said Dr. Azhar S. Sheikh, a founding member of the center's board. ""Dr. Sheikh said that he showed no signs of extremism. He said the family regularly worshiped at the mosque. He thought the young man had stopped attending services because he had moved away, and he assumed that Mr. Abdulazeez was attending again because he was back in town and staying with his parents.""

Note that we are spelling Abdulazeez's name differently from other news outlets. We have adopted the spelling used by FBI officials."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Seth Wenig/AP Seth Wenig/AP

Donald Trump began his bid for president saying Mexican immigrants were ""rapists,"" bringing drugs, and ""some, I assume, are good people.""

And, Sunday he made headlines again talking about immigrants. He rolled out his first detailed policy position, and it was on immigration reform.

His central premise is that immigrants are bad for the U.S. economy, and he ticked off a series of ways to fix both legal and illegal immigration.

The full plan is outlined on his website, but here are the key nuggets:

Build a wall across the southern border paid for by Mexico

across the southern border paid for by Mexico Seize all remittance payments ""derived from illegal wages"" until Mexico agrees to pay for the wall

""derived from illegal wages"" until Mexico agrees to pay for the wall Implement a nationwide e-verify system and defund sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with the federal law

system and defund sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with the federal law End birthright citizenship (currently enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution)

(currently enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution) Crack down on H-1B visas , which are designated for high-skilled STEM employees, by requiring companies to hire from the pool of unemployed domestic workers first

, which are designated for high-skilled STEM employees, by requiring companies to hire from the pool of unemployed domestic workers first Create criminal penalties for people who overstay a visa

In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday, Trump went further, suggesting he would rescind President Obama's executive order and deport all illegal immigrants from the country. Here's an excerpt of the conversation with Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd:

TODD: You're going to split up families. You're going to deport children? TRUMP: Chuck — no, no. No, we're going to keep the families together. We have to keep the families together. TODD: But, you're going to keep them together out -- TRUMP: But, they have to go. But, they have to go. TODD: What if if they have no place to go? TRUMP: We will work with them. They have to go. Chuck, we either have a country or we don't have a country ...

Trump's hard-line immigration policy could prove risky for a Republican Party desperately trying to court — or at least not offend — Latino voters.

The GOP's own autopsy in the wake of the 2012 election said:

""... We must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.""

A Gallup Poll released in July found that 65 percent of Americans favor some sort of path to citizenship compared to 19 percent who prefer deportation.

Perhaps more important politically, Trump's policy could force his GOP rivals to clarify their own immigration proposals.

Both Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush have previously suggested they could support some type of legalization for immigrants who entered the country illegally but are now working as law-abiding members of society.

And, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was part of the Senate's ""Gang of Eight,"" the bipartisan group of senators that led the effort on immigration reform in 2013, but he's been noticeably quiet on immigration since announcing a bid for president.

As for Trump, he leads most polls, and that popularity suggests some GOP candidates are hesitant to criticize him. Earlier this morning, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker told Fox News that although he hasn't yet dug into all the details of Trump's plan, he believes it's ""similar"" to his own:

""Earlier in the year, I was on Fox News Sunday and laid out what I thought we should do, which is to secure the border, which means build the wall, have the technology, have the personnel to make sure it's safe and secure, enforce the law ... and I said no amnesty, I don't believe in amnesty.""

The question now is how the Trump factor forces the rest of the GOP field to respond."

GOP presidential candidates are falling over themselves to get on record with tough immigration plans. A string of them — Rand Paul, Chris Christie, Lindsey Graham, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal and Rick Santorum — have spoken out in some form against birthright citizenship. That's the idea that being born on U.S. soil, regardless of your parents' legal status, automatically makes you a U.S. citizen.

Ben Carson went even further, saying he wants to secure the border — where he claims there are caves in which immigrants can hide — by using drones.

""You look at some of these caves and things out there, one drone strike, boom, and they're gone,"" Carson said.

When it comes to the issue of birthright citizenship, while some conservatives disagree, a lot of legal scholars believe it is settled law, enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and that it therefore would be fantastically difficult to overturn.

The flurry of tough positions on birthright citizenship is yet another sign of the power front-runner Donald Trump, with his inflammatory immigration rhetoric, has in the 2016 GOP race. The question for other Republicans is how to take tough — but still palatable for a general election — stances on the issue.

Both Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush have defended birthright citizenship, but they have said more needs to be done about women who might come into the U.S. expressly to have children. It's unclear exactly what they would — or could — actually do.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Darren McCollester/Getty Images Darren McCollester/Getty Images

""If there's abuse, if people are bringing, pregnant women are coming in to have babies simply because they can do it, then there ought to be greater enforcement,"" Bush told conservative radio host Bill Bennett this week, as reported by Politico. ""That's [the] legitimate side of this. Better enforcement so that you don't have these, you know, 'anchor babies,' as they're described, coming into the country.""

When pressed on his use of the phrase ""anchor babies,"" Bush defended it. ""If there's another term that I come up with, I'm happy to hear it,"" he said Thursday. (Hillary Clinton jumped at the opportunity, tweeting, ""They're called babies."")

Rubio told voters in Iowa this week, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, ""I'm open to doing things that prevent people who deliberately come to the U.S. for purposes of taking advantage of the 14th Amendment, but I'm not in favor of repealing it.""

The problem is that it's not certain exactly what the government could do to stop this from happening. (Neither the Bush nor the Rubio campaign has responded to requests for comment from NPR.)

What the U.S. could do to prevent (the few) ""birth tourists""

The closest thing to a law that could slow foreign women from having babies in the U.S. is that you can't lie about why you want a visa to the U.S., said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute's office at New York University.

""If you're a Chinese woman coming to the U.S. as a tourist, you are making a representation to the U.S. government that I am coming to be a tourist,"" Chishti said. ""If it is established by a consular officer that the woman is not really coming for tourism, but is coming to deliver a baby, you can deny the visa. There's no doubt about that.""

But that's tough to enforce under current regulations, says Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that tends to advocate tighter immigration policies.

""It's not illegal [for a foreign tourist to have a baby in the U.S.], though the State Department could put through regulation if they wanted to try to stop it,"" he says, for example, by more pointedly asking pregnant women if they're coming simply to have a baby in the U.S.

This phenomenon of having a child on a tourist visa has come to be known as ""birth tourism,"" and many of the stories about it in the past few years have tended to center around women coming from China, where families are restricted in the number of children they can have.

In addition to asking more questions of pregnant women entering the country on tourist visas, likewise, Chishti said the government could crack down more on the clinics — or ""maternity hotels,"" as they are called — where these women routinely go to give birth.

Of course, that only applies to those who go through the visa process. The number of ""birth tourists"" may indeed be very small. Earlier this year, the Center on Immigration Studies, which favors more tightly monitoring ""birth tourism,"" estimated that there are 36,000 such women annually.

Stopping other immigrants from having children is a different story



But there are millions of people who entered the country illegally. Because the law didn't detect many of them when they came in, trying to stop them from having children is difficult, to say the least.

Likewise, millions of people came in legally but have overstayed their visas. Improving the entry-exit monitoring system could do a lot to bring down the number of people who are in the country illegally, Chishti said. But that doesn't mean anything about their children.

""To be sure, this recommendation applies to reducing the pool of unauthorized in general,"" he said, but ""does not specifically address the 'anchor babies' phenomenon, because most likely mothers would deliver babies during their periods of authorized stay.""

It's also possible that trying to crack down on the birthright phenomenon simply means tightening existing laws and enforcement. Krikorian says that would have been a smarter answer to the birthright question for Bush and Rubio.

""A better-thought-out, more humane response would have been, when we enforce immigration laws better, in general, there will be fewer people here to give birth who are not citizens or green card holders,"" he says. But as it stands, he adds, simply calling for better enforcement against these so-called ""anchor babies"" is, to him, a non-answer.

""It's their way of seeming responsive without supporting a change in our citizenship practices,"" he says.

So, how many children are born to illegal immigrants every year?

There are no exact counts on the number of U.S. children with parents who are in the U.S. illegally, but some organizations have tried to count.

The Pew Research Center found in a 2012 report that around 5.5 percent of all K-12 students were U.S.-born citizens who also had at least one parent who was not authorized to be in the U.S. Still, many of those children may have one parent who is here legally.

The center also estimated in 2008 that 340,000 of the 4.3 million children born in the U.S. — not quite 8 percent — were born to immigrants who were in the U.S. illegally.

Those are rough estimates, but they suggest that while the so-called ""anchor baby"" population is relatively small, the practice of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally having babies in the U.S. is a very real phenomenon.

And that puts candidates in the tough spot not only of deciding whether they think that's a problem, but also if and how they could fix it."

Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski announced Wednesday that she will support the Iran nuclear agreement, giving the White House the final vote needed to protect the accord from a Republican-led effort to defeat the measure.

With her endorsement, Mikulski became the crucial 34th vote needed to sustain President Obama's expected veto should Congress pass a measure to block the agreement.

In a statement, Mikulski says:

""No deal is perfect, especially one negotiated with the Iranian regime. I have concluded that this [agreement] is the best option available to block Iran from having a nuclear bomb. For these reasons, I will vote in favor of this deal. However, Congress must also reaffirm our commitment to the safety and security of Israel.""

Congress is set to vote on a resolution of disapproval when it returns from the summer recess later this month.

Mikulski's support comes a day after two other Democratic holdouts, Sens. Chris Coons of Delaware and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, announced they were backing the measure.

With thousands of Syrian refugees and other migrants finally reaching havens in Germany and other European countries — and thousands more arriving daily — the Obama administration says it's ""actively considering"" ways to help, including allowing more refugees into the U.S.

The migrant crisis has placed stress on infrastructure in Greece, Macedonia and Hungary. It has also highlighted divisions between European Union countries.

While Germany's vice chancellor said Tuesday that his country could accept at least 500,000 migrants annually, he also called for other European countries to do more. But in Hungary, where a bottleneck had trapped thousands of migrants in large camps before neighboring borders were opened, the prime minister is urging the completion of a 13-foot fence at its border with Serbia before the end of this year.

""Hungary says the migrants are mostly fleeing bad economic conditions, and don't need asylum status to protect their lives,"" NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports. ""Hungarian police are hindering migrants in their trek through southeast Europe toward the West. Romania says migrant quotas are not the solution; the EU says countries must come together in solidarity if Europe is to surmount the crisis.""

On Monday, both France and Britain pledged to accept thousands of migrants, but the numbers — 24,000 for France and 20,000 for Britain — are vastly different from the pace set by Germany, which over this past weekend welcomed at least 20,000 migrants. Chancellor Angela Merkel also said that Germany is devoting $6.7 billion to cope with the crisis.

As for what steps the U.S. might take, the White House says it is looking at ""a range of approaches to be more responsive to the global refugee crisis, including with regard to refugee resettlement.""

The administration adds that with the U.S. having provided over $4 billion in humanitarian assistance since the Syrian crisis began, and over $1 billion in assistance this year, ""The U.S. is the single largest donor to the Syrian crisis.""

So far in 2015, more than 367,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea to seek safety and better prospects in Europe, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency. Of that number, more than 244,000 made their landing in Greece; at least 121,000 reached Italy.

The U.N. agency says the number of migrants rose sharply in August, to nearly 130,000."

Thousands of migrants flooded into a train station in the Hungarian capital Thursday after police lifted a two-day blockade, but some who boarded a train they thought was going to Germany ended up instead at a refugee camp just miles from Budapest.

The Associated Press reports that ""excited migrants piled into a newly arrived train at the Keleti station in Hungary's capital despite announcements in Hungarian and English that all services from the station to Western Europe had been canceled. A statement on the main departures board said no more trains to Austria or Germany would depart 'due to safety reasons until further notice!'

""Many migrants, who couldn't understand either language and were receiving no advice from Hungarian officials, scrambled aboard in a standing-room-only crush and hoped for the best,"" the AP said.

Scuffles broke out when police ordered the passengers off the train at Bicske, according to the BBC.

Meanwhile, Hungary's prime minister says his country is doing all it can to manage a growing migrant crisis, even as European officials said they will meet this month in Brussels to discuss an effort to ""strengthen the European response"" to the situation.

Viktor Orban said the influx of refugees into his country is really ""a German problem"" because that is the intended destination for most of them. Hungarians, along with other Europeans, are ""full of fear"" he says, because ""they see that the European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation.""

""If we would create an image ... just come because we are ready to accept everybody, that would be a moral failure, because that is not the case,"" Orban said after a meeting with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, according to The Washington Post. ""The moral human thing is to make clear, please don't come. Why do you have to go from Turkey to Europe? Turkey is a safe country. Stay there. It's risky to come.""

The BBC reports:

""His comments came as Hungarian authorities opened the main rail station in Budapest to hundreds of migrants after a two-day stand-off. ""One train left, but then stopped near a migrant reception centre. ""Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan resisted efforts by police to get them off the train at Bicske, about 40km (25 miles) west of Budapest. Some were banging on the windows and shouting 'Germany, Germany.'""

Meanwhile, Voice of America reports that British, French and German officials have called for urgent action and plan to hold talks on Sept. 14 in Brussels to address the crisis.

Updated at 11:20 a.m. ET

In a new development that could change the dynamic of Syria's civil war, Russian military began carrying out airstrikes in Syria on Wednesday. Russia says it will target ISIS fighters as part of a plan to fight terrorism.

U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby says a Russian official informed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad about the missions and also requested that American military aircraft avoid Syrian airspace during Russian operations.

While Russia said the airstrikes would aim at ISIS elements, Syria's state news agency says many of the targets hit today were in western Syria, north of the city of Homs — an area known for anti-government sentiment that's also miles away from ISIS strongholds such as Raqqa or Palmyra.

Some towns that were hit today have large opposition contingents — including Talbisah, which Radio Free Europe calls ""a stronghold of anti-Assad militants and the Free Syrian Army.""

RFE adds that opposition sources in Syria claim that Talbisah suffered ""tens of casualties, including to children and infants, and heavy damage.""

The Islamic State's Areas of Influence, August 2014 to August 2015 ISIS has been forced out of parts of northern Syria and Iraq but still controls a wide swath of land, stretching from just outside Aleppo in Syria to Fallujah in Iraq and north to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. The group also seized two provincial capitals this year: Ramadi in Iraq and Palmyra in Syria. Russia has deployed dozens of warplanes, tanks and armored vehicles to a new base in Syria's Latakia province. But the Russian base is far from any ISIS-controlled areas. On Sept. 29, Russia launched its first airstrikes in Syria. Russian drones with a radius of about 75 miles have started flying reconnaissance missions in Idlib and Hamah provinces, where a mix of non-ISIS rebels are operating, including the al-Qaida affiliate Nusra Front. Other rebels include Free Syrian Army units that are allied with the U.S. There are also a number of Central Asian jihadi elements, including some from Chechnya, a particular foe of Russia. The fear among U.S. officials is that Russia will not discriminate and will bomb all rebel groups — including those with ties to the U.S. — to keep Syrian President Bashar Assad in power.

The Russian military involvement follows a request from President Bashar Assad to President Vladimir Putin, according to Syria's state news agency, which reports that Assad asked for Russia's intervention in a letter that cited Russia's efforts to fight terrorism.

A Department of Defense official tells NPR:

""The U.S.-led coalition will continue to fly missions over Iraq and Syria as planned and in support of our international mission to degrade and destroy ISIL.



""While we would welcome a constructive role by Russia in this effort, today's demarche hardly seems indicative of that sort or role and will in no way alter our operations.""

Russia says it will provide only ""aviation support"" to Syria's army, according to the Tass news agency. Russia's Federation Council, the upper parliamentary house, gave Putin the authority to send a military force to Syria on Wednesday.

""A buildup of Russian air power began in Syria earlier this month,"" NPR's Alice Fordham reports. ""Assad said in a previous speech that his forces are overstretched and has long counted on Russian support.""

Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko says Russia chose to involve itself in Syria after receiving a request from ""legitimate Syrian authorities,"" according to Tass.

Matviyenko added, ""In this situation, we could not refuse Syrian President Bashar Assad and continue watching how people die, how women and children die, how historical and cultural sites are being destroyed."""

Russia says it has carried out at least 20 airstrikes in Syria. But many of those attacks hit areas miles from the ISIS strongholds that were initially named as targets. Syria's opposition says Russian forces are hitting any opponents of President Bashar Assad — and that civilians are paying a price.

""We want clear condemnation for the Russian brutality, and we want protection for the civilians,"" Khaled Khoja, leader of the anti-Assad Syrian National Council, said at a news conference in New York.

Criticism that Russia is targeting rebel groups in Syria began soon after the airstrikes started Wednesday.

From Moscow, NPR's Corey Flintoff reports, ""Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the targets of Wednesday's airstrikes were chosen in coordination with the Syrian government.""

Corey adds, ""Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that they should rely on Russia's defense ministry for information about the strikes, and not on the Pentagon.""

For U.S. leaders, the airstrikes have stoked concerns that the Russian airstrikes would be used against not only ISIS, but also against moderate rebel groups — including ones that have received U.S.-backed training and support.

The Islamic State's Areas of Influence, August 2014 to August 2015 ISIS has been forced out of parts of northern Syria and Iraq but still controls a wide swath of land, stretching from just outside Aleppo in Syria to Fallujah in Iraq and north to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. The group also seized two provincial capitals this year: Ramadi in Iraq and Palmyra in Syria. Russia has deployed dozens of warplanes, tanks and armored vehicles to a new base in Syria's Latakia province. But the Russian base is far from any ISIS-controlled areas. On Sept. 29, Russia launched its first airstrikes in Syria. Russian drones with a radius of about 75 miles have started flying reconnaissance missions in Idlib and Hamah provinces, where a mix of non-ISIS rebels are operating, including the al-Qaida affiliate Nusra Front. Other rebels include Free Syrian Army units that are allied with the U.S. There are also a number of Central Asian jihadi elements, including some from Chechnya, a particular foe of Russia. The fear among U.S. officials is that Russia will not discriminate and will bomb all rebel groups — including those with ties to the U.S. — to keep Syrian President Bashar Assad in power.

From Matthew Henman, head of IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center:

""While at least two of the strikes targeted areas of Homs close to where the Islamic State is trying to expand westwards ... the remainder of the strikes targeted a pocket of anti-government militant control to the north of the city of Homs and on key front-line positions. These positions are where militants, including the militant Islamist coalition Jaish al-Fatah, are attempting to expand and advance from Idlib governorate into the Latakia coastal region — the bedrock of the government's support base.""

The airstrikes began Wednesday, only one hour after a Russian official alerted the U.S. military that warplanes would begin flying missions in Syria. U.S. and Russian officials say they'll open communications between their military groups in the region to avoid accidents or potential clashes.

In launching the airstrikes, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he wants to prevent ISIS from increasing its influence in Russia. According to Richard Barrett, the former director of global counter-terrorism operations at British MI6 intelligence service, more than 2,400 Russians have gone to fight for ISIS in Syria — and the violent group has established itself in the northern Caucuses.

Syrian Opposition Says Russian Airstrikes Aren't Targeting ISIS Listen · 4:30 4:30

But Putin also has a broader goal, Barrett tells NPR's Morning Edition: ""to sort of confirm his foothold in the Middle East — and his only foothold in the Middle East at the moment is Syria, and try and extend Russian influence into an area which up until now has really been the preserve of the United States.""

Putin's plan ""doesn't make very much sense,"" Barrett says, ""because it's easy to get into these things, but it's difficult to get out. Maybe he doesn't want to get out. But the point is, though, I think Russia ... realizes that Assad's government is on the skids. It's not going to survive, and certainly, there's absolutely no hope of it regaining control over the whole of Syria.""

Russia says it has more than 50 aircraft in the air group taking part in the strikes, and that the base they're using in Syria is being guarded by a battalion of marines. The Russian operation is relying on drones and satellite data, reports the state-run Tass news agency.

A summary of the airstrikes that was released by Syria's state news agency listed many targets near the city of Homs in western Syria, an area known for anti-government sentiment that is far from ISIS strongholds such as Raqqa or Palmyra.

In Syria's new report of its military action released Thursday, the country says its forces hit ""Takfiri terrorist organizations"" — using the Arabic term for extremist Sunnis — in areas such as Quneitra province (in Syria's southwest corner below Damascus) and Aleppo province. The bulletin says many of the attacks targeted Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaida affiliate in Syria."

Updated 7:30 p.m. ET

A vigil was held in Roseburg, Ore., last night, hours after a man killed nine people at the local community college. Investigators say the man behind Thursday's shooting is also dead — and the county sheriff says he'll never say that man's name in public. Nine people were also wounded in the attack and treated in the hospital, according to authorities, who initially reported seven injured.

""I will not give him the credit he probably sought, prior to this horrific and cowardly act,"" Sheriff John Hanlin said in a briefing about the shooting at Umpqua Community College.

The alleged gunman was Chris Harper Mercer, 26, who lived in a town near Roseburg, which is a logging community with around 22,000 residents. Oregon State Police said Friday that he was a student at Umpqua Community College and that he was enrolled in the class where the shooting occurred. But at last night's vigil, Douglas County Commissioner Chris Boice told the crowd not to give the gunman any attention, as Northwest News Network's Chris Lehman reports for today's Morning Edition.

""I challenge you all to never utter his name,"" Boice said. ""This is about the families, this is about the victims, this is about our community, and this is about the tragic loss that we all suffered today. This is not about the shooter.""

Investigators recovered 13 weapons – including six at the school and seven at the gunman's home, according to ATF Assistant Special Agent Celinez Nunez, who spoke at a news conference roughly 24 hours after the attack.

The sheriff said that his deputies won't be using the gunman's name. Instead, they wanted to focus on the nine victims, who were named in a Friday afternoon news conference.

""Again, you will not hear anyone from this law enforcement operation use his name,"" Hanlin said, adding that he believes it ""would only inspire future shootings.""

The attack occurred in midmorning on the fourth day of classes in Umpqua Community College's fall semester. The gunman opened fire in a classroom. He was reportedly armed with several weapons and was wearing body armor.

""It is too early to determine a motive,"" NPR's Dina Temple-Raston reports. ""But he did engage with early victims. Some were asked about their religion before he shot them. But as the attack went on there was less engagement between the shooter and his victims and he appeared to be trying to kill as many people as possible.""

One survivor of the attack says the gunman tried to coax students out of a locked classroom. According to another account, the gunman asked his victims if they were Christians.

Student Sarah Cobb, 17, was in her Writing 121 class when she heard a loud noise, looked out the window — and saw people running. She then realized gunshots were ringing out from the next-door classroom — and she ran, too.

""My parents have always told me: stay alert, be aware of your surroundings,"" Cobb says. ""Once that noise happened, I looked around to see what's going on, and that's probably what saved my life.""

NPR's Tom Goldman reports that the father of a young woman who was wounded (and who is apparently OK after surgery) ""said the shooter asked people if they were Christian. And then if they said yes, he said good, because you're going to see God in about a second.""

Hannah Miles, 19, tells the AP that she was also in the writing class — and that after they locked the classroom door, she and her classmates heard a man walk to the door and say, ""Come on out, come on out.""

The students didn't open the door until later, when they were convinced the police were outside.

Freshman Evan Hocker tells Northwest News' Lehman, ""I heard gunshots and then someone, one of my teachers, said there was a shooting, and then we all just went into a closet with a group of people and locked the whole place down.""

Hocker, who's studying computer science, says the violence was shocking, particularly in Roseburg, where ""nothing really bad happens at all. Everything's small and everything's perfectly fine, usually.""

The college's interim president, Rita Cavin, said, ""Our hearts and prayers go out to the families, and to the staff and students who witnessed this atrocity. This is a real crisis situation.""

Roseburg is about three hours' drive south of Portland, west of the Deschutes National Forest. Discussing the community, Tom Goldman says the area is coping with a sharp decline in the local timber industry.

""Douglas County has one of the higher unemployment rates in the state,"" Tom says. ""And this is the importance of Umpqua Community College — it's the only college in Roseburg and the county. The average student age is the late 30s, and this is where many go to reinvent themselves and find new careers.""

In the wake of Thursday's shooting, it has also emerged that Sheriff Hanlin is an opponent of gun control efforts. Earlier this year, he told state lawmakers that background checks wouldn't keep criminals from getting guns. And back in 2013, the sheriff wrote a letter to Vice President Joe Biden to say that his deputies wouldn't enforce any law that infringed on the constitutional right to bear arms.

That letter was sent after the Newtown, Conn., shootings prompted a new push for gun-control legislation — something President Obama sought back in 2013 and that he asked for again after the Oregon killings.

Last night, the president said:

""This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction."""

In his first known international trip since civil war began in Syria, President Bashar Assad has just returned from a quick visit in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Assad reportedly briefed Putin on Syria's current and future military operations.

Assad's trip was kept secret until after Tuesday's meeting — and after the Syrian leader's safe return home.

The Kremlin's official account of the meeting includes a quote from Assad, saying, ""I want to thank the Russian people once more for the help you are giving Syria and express the hope that we will vanquish terrorism.""

Announcing the visit, state media in Syria and Russia say the two leaders discussed how to fight terrorism, and that the sessions — several meetings and a working dinner — also included foreign and defense officials from both countries.

From Beirut, NPR's Alison Meuse reports for our Newscast unit:

""Putin promised he'd work with world powers to find a political solution to the conflict, now in its fifth year. Assad said that terrorism is the main obstacle to peace, and that Russia's air campaign — now in its fourth week — has halted the spread of terror. ""Washington and its regional allies say Assad is part of the problem. But in recent weeks, some of Assad's staunchest critics, including Turkey, say he could be part of a political transition.""

The Moscow trip was also intended to show Assad is safer after Russian warplanes and ships began carrying out airstrikes in Syria, NPR's Corey Flintoff reports from Moscow. Putin and Assad met on the same day the U.S. and Russia agreed on a system to avoid potential clashes and accidents between their aircraft in Syria.

On today's Morning Edition, Corey also discussed news reports that three Russians were killed in Syria on Tuesday:

""The Russian Embassy in Damascus denies that any Russians were killed, either Russian servicemen or volunteer fighters. As you know, it's recently become illegal in Russia to report on casualties of Russian servicemen. So I think it's unlikely that we'll get any clear acknowledgement from Russia's defense ministry that any Russians have been killed or wounded.""

And as for the news that leaders in Iraq's government are prodding their prime minister to ask Russia to carry out airstrikes on ISIS militants, Corey says, ""Russia would like nothing better than an invitation from Iraq.""

He adds, ""It would be a big embarrassment for the United States if Iraq asked Russia to step in. The way the Russian air campaign [in Syria] is being presented here in Russia is that President Putin basically had to step in because the Americans have been so ineffective there."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption John Locher/AP John Locher/AP

Both of the leading Democrats probably helped themselves in their party's first debate of the 2016 presidential campaign, held in Las Vegas and carried by CNN. But Hillary Clinton, the candidate with the most to lose, may have come away having gained the most.

The longtime front-runner has been beset by controversy, falling poll numbers and a brittle relationship with the media. A bad performance before this season's first national audience would have deepened doubts about her candidacy.

At a minimum, Clinton needed to hold her own and provide as little fresh ammunition as possible to her critics. She met this standard and far exceeded it, performing more ably than in any major media appearance since her best debates and speeches in 2008. Her answers were substantive, measured and confident. But even more important, her demeanor was both relaxed and energetic. At times, she even seemed to be enjoying herself.

Her main challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, also had a good night. His strong views on the left bank of the American mainstream found a receptive audience in the partisan crowd. He even got applause for saying he could and would defend his philosophy by ""explaining what Democratic socialism is."" Questioned about his distaste for capitalism, he turned the issue to income inequality and banks ""too big to fail.""

Several of the ""focus group"" interviews conducted by news organizations found their participants liking Sanders the best of the group.

But Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland who has been running a distant third to Clinton and Sanders, also had his moments of connection with the crowd. He made several appeals to environmentalists, especially on climate change. And he told a moving story of parents from Colorado who lost a child in the Aurora theater shooting and then were denied a day in court suing the gun dealer who sold 4,000 rounds of military ammunition to the shooter.

Less successful on balance were the debate's lesser-known entrants, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Sen. and Gov. Lincoln Chafee. The latter, a former Republican turned independent turned Democrat, had trouble finding an angle of attack against his former Senate colleagues.

In fact, the entire proceeding was notable for its tone of collegiality. While the candidates disagreed about guns, trade legislation, the use of coal and the use of U.S. military power abroad, they did so in a manner that was more than civil. Whether intentional or not, their behavior contrasted with the rancor and personal confrontations that studded the first two presidential debates on the Republican side."

Just days before the election of a new speaker of the House, lame-duck Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, made good on one last promise — that he'd try to ""clear the barn"" for his successor.

In one fell swoop, two thorny issues were crossed off the to-do list: raising the debt ceiling by next Tuesday and coming up with a budget agreement.

Shortly before midnight, the 144-page budget resolution was submitted to the House Rules Committee. The tentative agreement raises federal spending by $80 billion over the next two years, evenly splitting that increase between defense and domestic programs. Some of that is paid for by cuts to Medicare and Social Security disability benefits. Negotiators also agreed to lift the debt ceiling until March 2017.

""This is one of those moments when it's important that leadership step in and take the ball and run with it,"" said Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., in support of the deal.

But as soon as details leaked, many hard-line conservatives objected to being excluded from the negotiations. The deal was reportedly reached in talks that involved only five parties: the top two Republicans in Congress, the top two Democrats and the White House.

""This is what we've been going through for five years,"" said Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., ""where the leadership team negotiate a deal without speaking to any members of the [Republican] conference — apparently not even the committee chairmen who are in key positions — and then expect all of us to vote for it.""

While Boehner hopes ""clearing the barn"" will make his successor's job easier, some members of the Republican caucus point out his presumptive heir — Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin — will inherit a deal many Republicans are already grousing about. They say Ryan should have been involved in the negotiations.

But Rep. Bill Flores, R-Texas, said it's better that Ryan's fingerprints are missing from this budget deal.

""I think this somewhat insulates Paul [Ryan],"" said Flores. ""But I still believe if there's somebody that doesn't like this and they're passionate about it, that they'll take out their feelings on Paul.""

The House could vote on this budget agreement as soon as Wednesday — the same day Republicans are expected to officially nominate Ryan as the next speaker."

It starts with seemingly benign questions: Who are you voting for? Did you see that exposé about candidate X on Facebook? Before long, somebody is storming off to the basement or slamming the mashed potatoes on the table. And playing Adele's new song ""Hello"" won't make every family instantly get along (a la SNL's Thanksgiving Miracle).

We asked NPR listeners for their best and worst experiences talking politics over turkey. Maybe not surprisingly (surveys show one thing most Americans actually unite over is a disdain for politicians), most of the stories we received were not exactly heartwarming — from asking the atheist in the family to please say grace and a refusal to go to church to racist epithets thrown around.

Occasionally, as Stephanie Brown wrote in, duking it out over turkey can actually help clear the air and improve a family dynamic — and there is something to be said for listening to and learning from some one else's point of view.

But most people find talking about children and sports and shutting people up with a duck quacker way more fun — so NPR's politics team, and our listeners are serving up some advice to help get you through.

First, the stories:

Saying grace:

""A couple of years ago, at dinner, my father-in-law, who had recently re-devoted himself to the Mormon religion of his youth, decided that I should say grace at the table, when he knew quite well I was (and am) an atheist. I said, 'That's OK. Someone else can do it.' He asked why and I replied that any prayer I said would be insincere and thus disrespectful to the people at the table who were religious. This immediately started a diatribe about how I was going to hell and corrupting his daughter. This eventually turned into a shouting match between him and my sister-in-law, as it was her house."" -Aaron Harmon

Unresolved angst:

""What started out as an innocent conversation about me not wanting to go to church that weekend ... turned into a hotly contested political debate which then turned into a series of heated character attacks. After one emotional blow too many I started to pack up my car to head back to my empty college campus. My sister took over yelling at my dad, and my usually stoic little brother left the house for a walk around the park. I made it as far as the town grocery store before I received a call from my mom asking me to come back home. After much cajoling on her part, I drove back. Our family sat around the dinner table and had our first ever conversation on how we had been hurting each other over the years. Neither side had truly been innocent in the fight, but we realized that this fight wasn't really over 2012 election results. Talking about the results had brought up some unresolved anger that unfortunately came to a head on Thanksgiving night. Subsequent years have been better, and we've all been more respectful of each other's politics throughout the year. Mostly :)"" -Stephanie Brown

'This was my last Thanksgiving at home':

""I think my worst Thanksgiving was when politics ruined more than the meal. We had just seated ourselves around the table and started passing food when someone claimed that Abraham Lincoln should be ashamed for having emancipated the slaves. There was mutual agreement around the table, and even some N words thrown in, and laughter. But, it wasn't a joke. My girlfriend at the time was horrified, and I was offended and utterly humiliated. I wish I could say I got up and stormed out of the room or challenged them or something, but I just remember being mortified and shocked at the conversation. I couldn't believe this was happening. I decided in that moment that this was my last Thanksgiving at home. It was, and it was also the last conversation I ever had with my family. Thanksgiving, 1999."" -Jeremy Brown

And the advice:

Duck quacker:

""We have both very liberal and ultra conservatives in the family so we decided to nip it in the bud. Discussion of politics and religion are out when we are all together. My sister-in-law got a great ""duck quacker"" (yellow plastic, looks like a duck's bill and quacks when you blow in it). The instant someone forgets and launches in to one of those subjects, we blow the quacker and it's over. It has worked great for several years. Of course, you need the buy-in from everyone to abide by the quacker."" -Sally Carleton

Children ... or pets ... or sports:

""Focus on what you're there for — each other and the celebration. Talk about the food, and the kids. Small children are an excellent distraction because they are, well, distracting — and everyone in the family can generally agree that they are beautiful and are benefiting from a fantastic gene pool and/or a brilliant collection of relatives. If there are no kids, pets are a good stand-in, as are sports."" -NPR's Sarah McCammon

Practice humility:

""We can love people with whom we disagree, even those by whom we are offended. Humility is intrinsic in love, and it means putting the other person (not their views) before yourself. Instead what I so often hear is condescending remarks and gross generalizations of both sides."" -Luke Aldridge

Passively argue about the food instead of politics:

""Everyone's there for the food anyway, so make food that causes conversation — even arguments, if you have to. Put something new into the stuffing (in the Midwest, this list includes exotic items like pecans, apples, or literally any spice at all) or introduce a totally out-of-left-field side dish (What? Mozzarella sticks aren't Thanksgiving food? They are now.). An argument over what ""belongs"" on the Thanksgiving table is infinitely less uncomfortable than an argument about politics."" -NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben

Ground rules aka behave or eat on the porch:

""My mother has set ground rules for dinner talk that involve politics. If you want to talk about politics you need to respect the other parties opinion (or fake it). If you don't you can sit on the back porch and finish dinner in chilly New York weather."" -Brad Heil

And our last plea (actually, a shameless plug), if you're going to talk politics, go in informed. NPR Politics and our new podcast can help."

Turkey says that after issuing 10 warnings in five minutes, two of its F-16s shot down a Russian warplane that Turkey claims violated its airspace.

On Twitter, Russia's Defense Ministry said its Sukhoi SU-24 was flying ""only within the borders of Syrian territory."" Its pilots, the Russians said, appear to have ejected.

Later in the day, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the action a ""stab in the back by the terrorists' accomplices.""

According to The Associated Press, Putin went on to say that there would be ""significant consequences.""

""We will never tolerate such atrocities as happened today and we hope that the international community will find the strength to join forces and fight this evil,"" Putin said.

The AP published video that appears to show a damaged warplane crash into a hillside. The video, shot from Turkey's Hatay province, then appears to show the pilots parachuting down:

YouTube

The Washington Post reports that Russia initially disputed Turkey's version of events, saying the plane was likely downed ""due to shelling from the ground.""

Update at 3 p.m. ET: Body Of One Pilot Found

A spokesman for a Syrian rebel group called the 10th Coastal Brigade told NPR's Alison Meuse that it had the body of one of the Russian pilots and also released a video showing the body. The group said the pilot was dead when it found him. He could have been killed in the shoot-down of his jet, when he came under fire during his parachute descent or in a barrage of fire that the rebels laid down to prevent the pilots from heading to a regime-held area nearby.

The spokesman said the group does not know the condition or whereabouts of the second pilot. He may have run to regime-held areas.

Update at 3:10 p.m. ET: Rebels Say They Downed Copter

Another Syrian rebel group, the First Coastal Division, tells NPR that it destroyed a Russian helicopter that had landed about 7 km from the area where the Russian jet was downed.

The helicopter was shot down by a TOW missile provided by a covert U.S. program to support Syrian rebels, according to the media director for the group, which is part of the Free Syrian Army coalition.

The media director did not have information on the Russian crew of the helicopter. The group has released a video purporting to show the attack on the helicopter, showing it engulfed in a huge explosion.

Update at 3:15 PM: NATO Statement

NATO officials held an extraordinary meeting to discuss the incident. Afterward, NATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg released a statement saying, ""We stand in solidarity with Turkey and support the territorial integrity of our NATO ally, Turkey"":

""I have previously expressed my concern about the implications of the military actions of the Russian Federation close to NATO's borders. This highlights the importance of having and respecting arrangements to avoid such incidents in the future.""

The downing of the warplane figured into today's White House meeting between President Obama and French President Francois Hollande, who is trying to shore up support following the recent attacks in Paris.

Obama said Turkey had the right to defend its territory. But he also said both sides need to find out what happened and to ""discourage any kind of escalation."" The president added:"

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP

""I actually think we're going to solve this thing.""

That's what President Obama said in a news conference just before he left a United Nations summit on climate change.

""Climate change is a massive problem,"" Obama said. ""It is a generational problem. It's a problem that by definition is just about the hardest thing for a political system to absorb, because the effects are gradual, they're diffused. And yet despite all that ... I'm optimistic. I think we're going to solve it.""

Just a few years ago, Obama said, nobody would have predicted that more than 150 leaders would come to Paris holding plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

""All of this will be hard,"" Obama said. ""Getting 200 nations to agree on anything is hard ... but I'm convinced that we're going to get big things done here.""

Obama leaves the conference, but his deputies will remain in Paris in an effort to craft a global, legally binding agreement intended to curb climate change. The big goal: to keep the global temperature from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius.

At the moment, if you add up all the commitments on the table at the summit and assume that they would be met, the temperature would still rise by 2.7 degrees, Obama said.

""That's too high,"" Obama said. But ""what we expect is that we'll hit these targets faster than expected and ... we could pick up the pace.""

Obama said that is not just ""foolish optimism"" but an expectation based on past experience. The United States, for example, was able to meet its goals faster than expected.

""The key here is to set up the structure so we're sending signals all around the world that says this is happening and we're not turning around,"" Obama said.

Obama touched on a whole host of other issues during the conference. Here are a couple of highlights:

-- Obama says that the fact that the peace process for Syria is progressing in Vienna is a sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""realizes there is not going to be a military solution to the situation in Syria.""

Eventually, Obama said, he expects the Russians to shift their focus in Syria from trying to prop up the regime of Bashar Assad to fighting the Islamic State.

""I think Mr. Putin understands that for him to get bogged down in an inconclusive and paralyzing civil conflict is not the outcome that he is looking for,"" Obama said.

In other words, Obama said, both the U.S. and Russia agree that the only lasting solution in Syria will be political.

""Where we continue to have an ongoing difference is not in the need for a political settlement; it's whether Assad can continue to serve as president as that transition goes on,"" Obama said.

Russia believes Assad should play a role, and Obama believes that ""it is impossible for Mr. Assad to bring that country together.""

-- On the shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, Obama said Congress should act. Just as the country takes huge, costly steps to fight terrorism, it has to take steps to reduce gun homicides.

""At the end of the day, Congress, states, local governments are going to have to act in order to make sure that we are preventing people who are deranged or have violent tendencies"" from getting weapons that magnify the damage that they can do, Obama said.

Earlier in the day, President Obama urged Turkey and Russia to ease tensions by focusing on a common enemy: the Islamic State.

The relationship between the two countries has been frayed since Turkey downed a Russian jet in November. Turkey has refused to apologize, saying the Russian warplane crossed over into Turkish airspace. Russia has implemented a series of sanctions.

Reuters reports that Obama said the United States supported Turkey's right to defend its airspace, but he also urged the two countries to ""de-escalate tensions.""

""We all have a common enemy. That is ISIL,"" Obama said using an acronym for the Islamic State, according to the AP. ""I want to make sure that we focus on that threat."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eric Gay/AP Eric Gay/AP

The United States is planning an operation to deport recently arrived Central American families who have ignored removal orders from immigration judges, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the plan.

The operation would at least in part affect Central Americans who fled violence in their home countries but were denied asylum in the United States.

Details of the operation were first reported by the Washington Post, which says the raids could begin as early as January and will target the more than 100,000 families with both adults and children who have crossed the border illegally since last year.

In an email to NPR, Gillian Christensen, press secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, did not dispute the Post's reporting. She said that as part of a new strategy announced in November 2014, ICE has prioritized its deportations to people who ""pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security.""

That priority, Christensen added, includes recent border crossers.

""As Secretary Johnson has consistently said, our border is not open to illegal immigration, and if individuals come here illegally, do not qualify for asylum or other relief, and have final orders of removal, they will be sent back consistent with our laws and our values,"" Christensen said.

The Post reports:

""The proposed deportations have been controversial inside the Obama administration, which has been discussing them for several months. DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson has been pushing for the moves, according to those with knowledge of the debate, in part because of a new spike in the number of illegal immigrants in recent months. Experts say that the violence that was a key factor in driving people to flee Central America last year has surged again, with the homicide rate in El Salvador reaching its highest level in a generation. A drought in the region has also prompted departures. ... ""Although Johnson has signaled publicly for months that Central American families not granted asylum would face deportation, the plan is likely to trigger renewed backlash from Latino groups and immigrant advocates, who have long accused the administration of overly harsh detention policies even as Republicans deride President Obama as soft on border security.""

As we've reported, the Obama administration has been scorned by both sides of the aisle when it comes to its efforts on immigration. Republicans say President Obama can't be trusted to secure the border, while the National Council of La Raza famously dubbed Obama the nation's ""deporter-in-chief.""

Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for immigrants and their families, told the Wall Street Journal that this was ""the last thing we expected from the administration.""

""It is time that [the] administration acknowledge once and for all that these mothers and children are refugees just like Syrians,"" Hincapié said.

The Department of Homeland Security released new numbers Wednesday showing that deportations had dropped to their lowest level since 2006.

The department also noted that it was seeing a demographic shift among migrants along the border, with a significant increase in the number of Central Americans apprehended.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehended more than 134,000 migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in fiscal year 2015."

Iowa and New Hampshire get a lot of attention, but their records in picking presidents, let alone nominees, is spotty (as you can see from the chart above). But that doesn't mean the states don't matter. They have been effective at weeding the field of candidates, and they're about momentum for those later states.

Plus, in the last 40 years, just one person has gone on to win the presidency after losing both Iowa and New Hampshire — Bill Clinton.

Here's how the predictability of the states breaks down by party:

Republicans

New Hampshire has been better at picking nominees for Republicans. Since 1976:

-- Five eventual nominees won the Granite State ...

-- Two became president: Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

Iowa, on the other hand, has picked:

-- Three eventual GOP nominees, but ...

-- Just one president: George W. Bush

Here's the thing, though: No Republican has become the nominee in the last 40 years without winning either Iowa or New Hampshire.

Democrats

toggle caption Rick Bowmer/AP

Iowa has been slightly better than New Hampshire at picking nominees on Democratic side. In fact, since 1976:

-- A whopping six eventual nominees have won Iowa, including the last three (Barack Obama, John Kerry and Al Gore).

-- Two Iowa Democratic winners have become president — Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama.

New Hampshire has picked:

-- Five nominees over that same time ...

-- Just one became president — Carter.

Fun facts

-- Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan all lost Iowa but went on to win the presidency.

-- Bill Clinton didn't win either Iowa or New Hampshire in 1992, but was still declared ""The Comeback Kid"" after his second-place finish in the New Hampshire.

-- The person who led the longest in Iowa in the crowded Republican field in 2015, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls, was ... Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. He led for six months, from February to August, before dropping out of the race after a series of missteps.

-- If Donald Trump wins both Iowa and New Hampshire, it would be the first time a non-incumbent Republican has done so in 40 years."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Matt Rourke/AP Matt Rourke/AP

New Hampshire voters go to the polls Tuesday, and they will resolve a lot of questions. Here are four things the first-in-the-nation primary will tell us:

1. How much damage did the last debate do to Marco Rubio?

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Rubio came into New Hampshire with a head of steam. He quickly moved into second place in the polls, and there was even some hope he could overtake Donald Trump in the Granite State. But then, the needle got stuck on his talking points in the ABC debate on Saturday, earning him the worst reviews of his — until now — charmed presidential run.

Eager to dispel the perception that he's ""a broken record in an empty suit,"" Rubio's campaign has been denying the debate was a disaster — and lowering expectations. In an interview with NBC on Monday, Rubio seemed to be giving up on his hope of becoming the clear establishment alternative to Trump and Cruz after New Hampshire, saying the race was going to go for a while longer. Few tracking polls were in the field after Saturday's debate, so it's hard to measure whether Rubio's shaky performance hurt him with voters. We'll find out tonight.

2. Does Donald trump need a ground game?

Enlarge this image toggle caption Charles Krupa/AP Charles Krupa/AP

He certainly did in Iowa, where his lead disappeared at the end. Trump has said he wasn't even familiar with the term ""ground game,"" but has now invested more in get-out-the-vote infrastructure in New Hampshire. Still, he is relying most on his own popularity — he's called himself ""the product"" — and his commanding lead in the polls. No poll has shown Trump's big lead in New Hampshire sliding, but New Hampshire voters are famous for making fools of pollsters — and front-runners.

3. How badly wounded is Hillary Clinton?

Clinton expects to lose to Bernie Sanders. Tomorrow's results will tell us by how much. Margins matter. Her minuscule victory in Iowa gave her no momentum at all in New Hampshire. So a big, double-digit win for Sanders would give him a huge boost heading into next week's Nevada caucuses, where the Clinton campaign is hoping its union-based ""firewall"" is still strong.

Enlarge this image toggle caption John Minchillo/AP John Minchillo/AP

If she can close the gap in New Hampshire — even by a little — and hold Sanders' lead to single digits, she will be able to boast that she pulled off a little bit of yet another Clinton comeback.

4. How much (or how little) will the GOP field shrink?

Before Saturday's debate, many people were expecting the GOP field post-New Hampshire to be a three-man race — Trump, Ted Cruz and Rubio. But if one or more of the governors place in the top three, or even four, they may refuse to drop out until after South Carolina.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey's Chris Christie all say they are going on to South Carolina, but if they don't place in the top tier, their fundraising will evaporate, and there will be tremendous pressure on them to get out. New Hampshire voters could decide how big the GOP field is going forward."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP

Within hours of Justice Antonin Scalia's death, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell aimed to squash any expectation that President Obama will get to name his successor.

""The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,"" he said in a statement. ""Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.""

McConnell wants to make sure the next president is a Republican. But even more than that, McConnell wants to make sure that Republicans retain control of the U.S. Senate.

Last month at the annual Republican retreat, McConnell made clear that it was his intention to steer the Senate this year to protect his incumbents. Until Scalia's death, that meant keeping to a modest legislative agenda, passing necessary spending bills and allowing senators plenty of time back home to campaign this year.

A potentially nasty Senate fight over replacing Scalia was not part of McConnell's 2016 road map.

Now, the open question is whether Republicans' refusal to consider a Supreme Court nominee will blow back on those same incumbents McConnell is trying to protect.

The 2016 presidential contest has sucked up the nation's political oxygen, but beneath that marquee race is a broader fight for control of the Senate, the outcome of which will be hugely consequential for the next president. And that battle for control runs directly through the presidential battleground states — which means Republicans' ability to hold the Senate depends on incumbents winning re-election in states Barack Obama carried in 2008 and 2012.

Republicans control the Senate 54-46. (There are two independent senators who caucus with Democrats.) Democrats need to win five seats outright, or four seats and the White House, to take control away from the GOP.

This task should be easier than it has been in recent election years, because the 2016 electoral landscape tilts in Democrats' favor from the start. The party is defending fewer competitive seats, and Democratic voters are more likely to show up in presidential election years.

Republicans are defending seven seats, in Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. President Obama won all but North Carolina in 2012, though he did win the state in 2008.

Only two of those GOP senators, Florida's Marco Rubio and New Hampshire's Kelly Ayotte, have so far embraced McConnell's call to postpone the nomination process. And Rubio is running for president and not for Senate re-election.

Meanwhile, in so-called red states, blocking Obama is good politics. The conservative base reviles the thought of a Democratic president picking the successor of a conservative justice.

Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby said Saturday he will ""adamantly oppose"" any effort by Obama to fill the seat. But Shelby faces only a March 1 primary challenge from the right. If he wins his primary, his re-election in November is not in question.

But Ayotte, Ohio's Rob Portman and Pennsylvania's Pat Toomey, for instance, have a trickier path to re-election. They are running in states that tilt Democratic in presidential election years, and they're facing voters increasingly tired of Washington incumbents, obstructionists and partisans.

These GOP senators have worked hard to cultivate common-sense reputations back home. That strategy was on track until an iconic conservative Supreme Court justice died, injecting a flashpoint into the 2016 races that may pit Republicans between their party's base and the voters they need to win re-election.

How this plays out depends on whom Obama picks to enter this nomination fight. He pledged Saturday evening to announce a nominee ""in due time"" and challenged GOP assertions that the country should wait over a year to fill the vacancy.

""These are responsibilities that I take seriously, as should everyone. They're bigger than any one party. They are about our democracy,"" Obama said.

It's a safe bet that the president will name a qualified nominee, then use his bully pulpit to try to shame the GOP-controlled Senate for obstruction. The fight will only intensify if the nominee is a woman or a minority, or both.

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., is ready for it. Reid is retiring, but Democrats need to hold his seat if they stand a chance at winning the Senate.

""Failing to fill this vacancy would be a shameful abdication of one of the Senate's most essential constitutional responsibilities,"" Reid said Saturday.

Scalia's death did not fundamentally change the Senate landscape, but it has shifted the attention to races that had, until now, been unfolding backstage to the presidential race."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

The most recent Republican presidential nominee is taking shots at Donald Trump's fitness to be president.

And he's not mincing his words.

Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, called the current GOP front-runner ""a phony, a fraud"" in a speech Thursday morning in Salt Lake City. And he didn't stop there.

Romney described Trump as ""a con artist"" whose demeanor is ""recklessness in the extreme."" As for Trump's record as a ""huge business success""? ""No, he isn't."" And when it comes to Trump's prescriptions to bring back jobs from China and Japan? ""Flimsy at best.""

Trump quickly hit back at Romney during a rally Thursday afternoon, again calling him a ""choke artist"" and saying he was disappointed by his 2012 campaign. ""The guy ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of politics,"" Trump said.

Trump added that Romney ""chickened out"" from running in 2016 because of Trump's candidacy.

Romney spoke for 20 minutes at the Hinckley Institute at the University of Utah and got specific, digging into aspects of Trump's record as a businessman.

""His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's playing the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat,"" Romney said, referring to a real estate seminar Trump launched in 2005 that was forced to change its name because it wasn't a real university. It is now the subject of multiple lawsuits alleging fraudulent behavior.

Romney then added to the list of failed business ventures: ""There's Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks, and Trump Mortgage?"" Romney concluded, ""A business genius he is not.""

Then came the attacks on Trump as a human being.

""After all, this is an individual who mocked a disabled reporter, who attributed a reporter's questions to her menstrual cycle, who mocked a brilliant rival who happened to be a woman due to her appearance, who bragged about his marital affairs, and who laces his public speeches with vulgarity.""

Romney remarks are unprecedented in the way he — the party's most recent presidential nominee — attacks the man who seems on track to secure this year's GOP nomination.

Romney began the speech by saying he is not declaring his own candidacy, adding, ""I am not going to endorse a candidate today.""

He said one of three others still in the race — Sens. Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio, or Gov. John Kasich — should be the nominee. Then, without saying so specifically, he seemed to endorse a strategy to bring about a brokered GOP convention this summer.

""Given the current delegate selection process, this means that I would vote for Marco Rubio in Florida, for John Kasich in Ohio, and for Ted Cruz or whichever one of the other two contenders has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump in a given state,"" said Romney.

The goal would be to deny Trump the 1,237 delegates he needs to win the nomination on the convention's first ballot in July.

After reports surfaced that Romney was planning to speak out against Trump on Thursday, the billionaire was quick to fire back at Romney on Twitter.

Will Romney's blunt words have any impact? It's not likely Trump supporters will be moved by the critique of a man they see as the ultimate establishment insider — who failed in attempts to win the presidency.

In the past year, Trump has hardly needed excuses to lay into Romney. In stump speeches, he regularly calls Romney a ""loser"" who blew the chance to defeat President Obama in 2012.

In an interview Thursday morning with the Today show, Trump called Romney a ""stiff.""

But it wasn't always so contentious between these two wealthy Republican businessmen. Trump endorsed Romney's 2012 White House bid, and Romney eagerly reciprocated the love.

""I spent my life in the private sector — not quite as successful as this guy,"" Romney said at the time, turning and gesturing toward a gushing Trump. ""But successful nonetheless.""

Romney has been critical of Trump's tone for months, but this speech comes as Trump has won 10 of the first 15 nominating contests, holds a lead in convention delegates and shows little sign of flagging. While many Republican insiders are eager to rally around a non-Trump candidate, there's no indication voters are consolidating around an alternative.

In addition to criticizing his temperament, Romney argued that Trump is unelectable in a general election.

""Trump relishes any poll that reflects what he thinks of himself. But polls are also saying that he will lose to Hillary Clinton,"" said Romney.

This week, a group of more than 60 conservative foreign policy experts wrote an open letter denouncing Trump's statements, concluding that Trump is ""fundamentally dishonest"" and would ""use the authority of his office to act in ways that make America less safe, and which would diminish our standing in the world."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Paul Sancya/AP

This has been an unpredictable primary season, but one thing is becoming increasingly clear: This race, on both sides, is going to go on for a while.

For Republicans, because of how the vote has been split up, no one will have the required delegates to be the nominee until — at the earliest — their very last nominating day, June 7. That's true even if Donald Trump sweeps the big winner-take-all states Tuesday, although the direction will be very clear if that happens.

For Democrats, Tuesday will be pivotal. If Bernie Sanders wins at least two states and comes close in Ohio, though Hillary Clinton would undoubtedly have the advantage, his campaign sees a path — albeit very narrow — to winning a majority of the pledged delegates. It hinges on doing well — almost running the table — over the next six weeks, including big wins in Arizona, Washington state, Wisconsin, New York, New Jersey and California.

Republicans — What could happen Tuesday?

Scenario A — Trump wins both of the winner-take-all states of Ohio and Florida

toggle caption Domenico Montanaro/NPR/AP

If Trump wins both, he needs 49 percent of all remaining delegates. It would almost certainly mean he goes into the convention with the most delegates. That's because everyone else would need even more than he would. Ted Cruz would need 69 percent, Marco Rubio 85 percent (and he would have almost certainly dropped out after losing his home state), John Kasich 93 percent. Rubio and Kasich would all but be mathematically eliminated, something that would happen in only a matter of weeks.

But because of all the vote that's been split up already, this doesn't guarantee Trump gets a majority heading into the convention.

OK, let's assume he wins Ohio and Florida. When could Trump get a majority?

toggle caption Domenico Montanaro/NPR

Let's go even further. Give Trump Ohio, Florida and even Missouri on Tuesday, which is a mix of winner-take-all statewide and by congressional district. Then give him half the delegates of every contest after Tuesday. Mind you, before Tuesday, he has won a majority in only six of the 26 contests that have taken place. Then, there are three more purely winner-take-all contests before now and June totaling 116 delegates — Arizona, Delaware and Nebraska. Give him all of those. That would take him to roughly 1,100 delegates, give or take. That would still be short of the magic number of 1,237. He called this number ""very random"" at the most recent GOP debate. But it's not random at all — it's a majority of the total voting number of Republican delegates to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this July.

So all of this means the earliest Trump would likely clinch is June 7, when California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota vote. He could go into that day 100 to 150 delegates or so short of the magic number and would need half of the 303 delegates up for grabs that day. He would need some combination of the winner-take-all states of New Jersey (thanks, Chris Christie), South Dakota and Montana and/or a significant share of California's.

Scenario B — Trump loses both Florida and Ohio

toggle caption Domenico Montanaro/NPR

If he loses both, he and the party are in a very precarious situation. Losing both states, Trump would need 62 percent of what's remaining. But every other candidate would be even worse off — unless Cruz won both states, which is unlikely. If Cruz did win both states, he'd vault into the lead but still would need 56 percent of all remaining delegates to get a majority before Cleveland.

Putting Cruz aside, if Kasich and Rubio split their respective home states, Trump would still be in the lead but would need a whopping 62 percent, Cruz 69 percent, Rubio 78 percent and Kasich 88 percent. Rubio and Kasich would only be weeks away from being mathematically eliminated.

And we'd likely be headed to the first contested convention in 40 years on the Republican side and possibly the first brokered in almost 70.

Scenario C — Trump wins Florida but loses Ohio

toggle caption Domenico Montanaro/NPR

This is a very possible scenario out of Tuesday given the current polling. We would be basically right back where we started the day. Trump would need 54 percent of all remaining delegates, Cruz 69 percent, Rubio 85 percent and Kasich 89 percent.

In this scenario, Rubio loses Florida, and his candidacy is likely over. Kasich would still have only a matter of weeks until he's mathematically eliminated.

Democrats — What could happen Tuesday?

Enlarge this image toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Wilfredo Lee/AP

Scenario A — Good day for Clinton: Wins big in Florida and North Carolina, ekes out Ohio

toggle caption Domenico Montanaro/NPR

Clinton is favored in Florida and North Carolina, and by big margins. Winning there with 60 percent of the vote and then losing in Illinois and Missouri 52 to 48 percent and winning in Ohio by the same margin, Clinton would have a very good delegate day. She would net nearly another 60 delegates and need just 43 percent of all remaining delegates for the pledged majority with just 29 contests to go. Sanders would need 57 percent of all remaining delegates. Though the calendar lines up for him well over the next several weeks, that would be very difficult to overcome. And none of that is counting superdelegates, who are overwhelmingly with Clinton — for now.

Delegate split: 375-316 Clinton, % needed: Clinton 43%, Sanders 57%

When could Clinton win a majority of delegates?

Staying with her best outcome on Mega Tuesday, with superdelegates factored in, Clinton likely wouldn't be able to wrap up the nomination until June 7, when California votes.

Scenario B — Good day for Sanders: Wins Illinois, Missouri and ekes out Ohio, trims margins in Florida, North Carolina

Welcome to a world in which the Sanders campaign can plausibly make the case that he has a (narrow) path to win a majority of pledged delegates by the end of June. In this scenario, Sanders wins the day by one delegate, winning Missouri 60 to 40 percent, Illinois 55 to 45 percent, Ohio 54 to 46 percent and holding Clinton to 55 percent in Florida and 59 percent in North Carolina. Sanders would find himself further behind than when the day began, needing 55 percent of all remaining delegates, and this is where the race gets interesting. His campaign believes it's come through the toughest stretch and the next several races line up Sanders' way.

Delegate split: 346-345 Sanders, % needed: 45% Clinton, 55% Sanders

OK, so what's that path look like? Because Democrats hand out delegates proportionally, he would have to virtually run the table in every big state and small caucus, starting with Arizona on March 22. It's no mistake that Sanders is in Phoenix on Tuesday night, rather than in one of the places he might (or might not) win that night. He would also have to win decisively in Washington state (March 26), Wisconsin (April 5), New York (April 19), Kentucky and Oregon (May 17), New Jersey and California (June 7).

California could be key. In one analysis run by NPR, Sanders was down 92 delegates going into June 7, but with a 60-40 win in California, which has 475 delegates, Sanders was able to pull ahead. Here's one estimate that has fairly narrow margins that shows Sanders pulling off a two-delegate win. Some might take issue with Sanders winning Maryland given its high share of black voters, but it's one example.

Some other contests to watch: Pennsylvania (April 26), Indiana (May 3) and West Virginia (May 10). Oh, and remember those caucuses that don't really hand out delegates that night but at county and state conventions? The Sanders campaign is contesting each of those, fighting for delegates, hoping to pick up more delegates than Election Night media estimates.

One potentially dangerous scenario: If superdelegates hang with Clinton, even in the most rosy Sanders scenario, she would surpass the magic number of 2,383 just on or before June 7. That's right when, in this same scenario, Sanders would take the pledged-delegate lead.

One thing's for sure: With the coalitions both of these candidates have put together, nothing will be easy."

.@BillClinton to protesters: You're ""defending the people who kill the lives you say matter"" https://t.co/3900s5sWFP https://t.co/SQtQnx8w7n — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) April 7, 2016

This post has been updated at 10 a.m. ET, April 8

In a prolonged exchange Thursday afternoon, former President Bill Clinton forcefully defended his 1994 crime bill to Black Lives Matter protesters in the crowd at a Hillary Clinton campaign event.

He said the bill lowered the country's crime rate, which benefited African-Americans, achieved bipartisan support, and diversified the police force. He then addressed a protester's sign, saying:

""I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other African-American children,"" Clinton said, addressing a protester who appeared to interrupt him repeatedly. ""Maybe you thought they were good citizens .... You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter. Tell the truth. You are defending the people who cause young people to go out and take guns.""

The Clintons have faced criticism from BLM activists and younger black voters for months now over that bill, which they say put an unfairly high number of black Americans in prison for nonviolent offenses.

After a protester interrupted him repeatedly, Bill Clinton began to take on that critique directly, making the claim that his crime bill was being given a bad rap.

""Here's what happened,"" Clinton said. ""Let's just tell the whole story.""

""I had an assault weapons ban in it [the crime bill]. I had money for inner-city kids, for out of school activities. We had 110,000 police officers so we could keep people on the street, not in these military vehicles, and the police would look like the people they were policing. We did all that. And [Joe] Biden [then senator and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee] said, you can't pass this bill, the Republicans will kill it, if you don't put more sentencing in it.""

""I talked to a lot of African-American groups,"" Clinton continued. ""They thought black lives matter. They said take this bill, because our kids are being shot in the street by gangs. We have 13-year-old kids planning their own funerals.""

Throughout the spirited defense of his policy, Clinton continued to be interrupted, and he repeatedly seemed to single out one protester.

""She doesn't wanna hear any of that,"" Clinton said to the protester. ""You know what else she doesn't want to hear? Because of that bill, we have a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in murder rate. And because of that and the background check law, we had a 46-year low in the deaths of people by gun violence, and who do you think those lives were? That mattered? Whose lives were saved that mattered?""

For several minutes, the discussion of the crime bill, Clinton's exchange with the protester and the crowd's attempts to yell and chant over her were missing one thing: any mention of Hillary Clinton, the one Clinton running for president this election cycle.

Bill Clinton did finally address her. ""Hillary didn't vote for that bill, because she wasn't in the Senate,"" Clinton said. ""She was spending her time trying to get health care for poor kids [referencing her advocacy for the Children's Health Insurance Program]. Who were they? And their lives mattered. And her opponent [Bernie Sanders] did vote for it. But I don't blame him either ... There were enough Republicans in the Senate to kill this bill, and nobody wanted it to die. That's what happened.""

""But she [Hillary Clinton] was the first candidate, the first one to say let's get these people who did nonviolent offenses out of prison,"" Clinton continued. ""And guess what? A lot of Republicans agreed. They know they made a mistake.""

Clinton went on to further defend his administration, referencing the financial crisis: ""It reminds me of when the Republicans try to blame me for the financial meltdown.""

He turned back to his wife and said: ""This election is about the future. They're trying to blame her for something she didn't do. So I'll tell you another story about a place where Black Lives Matter? Africa."" The former president went on to speak of his wife's work fighting AIDS in Africa while secretary of state.

Late Thursday night, NPR spoke with Philadelphia resident Erica Mines, one of the protesters at the Bill Clinton event.

""I'm not mad at Bill Clinton,"" Mines said. ""I'm not mad at him as a person, he's a human being. But his politics are very wrong.""

Tomorrow, Wisconsin's primary is poised to do something it has not done in more than 30 years. It is about to deal a blow to a presidential front-runner.

Still more amazing is the fact the state's primary voters are expected to throw some shade on both the Democratic and Republican front-runners, an unimaginable result in the long era since World War II.

For six decades, Wisconsin has been anything but the field of dreams for long shots and outsiders. Wisconsinites have voted roughly halfway through the primary calendar, and they have almost always endorsed the candidates who were already winning.

Among Republicans, think Mitt Romney and John McCain, and both of the presidents named George Bush, plus Bob Dole, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon (three times) and Dwight Eisenhower.

Adding the Democrats, you have Barack Obama, John Kerry, Al Gore, Bill Clinton and Michael Dukakis — not to mention John F. Kennedy.

In fact, Wisconsin has been fine with the front-runner in both parties in every cycle since 1988. Setting aside one deviation on the Democratic side in 1984 (and the ""favorite son"" candidates who won on both sides in 1964) Wisconsin primary voters have fallen in line with the eventual nominees consistently since 1956 — long before most Americans alive today were even born.

Front-Runner Hopes May Be Dashed

This year, however, things suddenly look different. While Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were ahead in the polls in Wisconsin as recently as early March, both have slid steadily downward since. Clinton has fallen behind rival Bernie Sanders by several percentage points, while Trump now trails Ted Cruz by double digits.

These trends are clear in the state's best-known and most reliable poll, done by Marquette University Law School. They are also corroborated in the latest polling by the Fox Business Channel and by CBS News. The polls could be wrong, of course, but they do also comport with field reports and other signals from the ground: Wisconsin is Cruzing and feeling the Bern.

Wins in Wisconsin should provide a major boost for both Cruz and Sanders, who can soar on the thermal updraft for two weeks before the next voting takes place.

Just how much momentum they gain in their still-steep climbs toward their party nominations will depend on the margins of their victories — and on the media treatment those results receive in New York, which votes on April 19. Both Trump and Clinton have maintained a kind of home-court advantage in New York despite their ups and downs around the country.

Given the trend in Wisconsin, wins for Cruz and Sanders will not have that element of surprise that supercharged them in Iowa (for Cruz) and Michigan (for Sanders). But winning big will contribute to the psychology now buoying both these long-shot candidates and their legions of true believers.

Winning margins in double digits tomorrow would constitute ""winning big."" So would a super-share of delegates for Cruz. Republican rules allow him 18 delegates for the statewide win and another three for each congressional district he carries. That makes it possible, if not likely, that Cruz could take home all 42 of the Wisconsin delegates.

There are several reasons for the Cruz and Sanders surge in this Midwestern purple state.

Trump has remarkably high negatives in the three ""collar counties"" outside Milwaukee that are the richest vein of Republican votes in the state. These suburban and ex-urban voters tend to be better educated, more affluent and much closer to the values of the GOP establishment than party voters outstate.

Trump has alienated much of the GOP base statewide by attacking the local hero, Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Trump went after Walker in the first several debates, and again this past week on the stump (after Walker endorsed Cruz). Walker's approval among state Republicans is in the range of 80 percent.

Wisconsin has a large and robust community of Christian evangelicals that has waited for a candidate like Cruz to embrace. It is now embracing Cruz.

For his part, Sanders can benefit from the strong preponderance of Anglo white voters among Wisconsin Democrats. No one doubts he will carry this dominant demographic on Tuesday.

Sanders benefits from the concentrations of younger voters in Dane County (the capital and home of the largest university campus), as well as satellite versions of same in other cities with University of Wisconsin campuses.

Sanders has devoted far more time and other resources to Wisconsin, eager to show that his recent dominance in five caucus states can be extended to a populous state where ""open primary"" rules allow independents to participate.

A Long History Of Confounding Candidates

Wisconsin also has a contrarian streak that has produced surprises in the past. While the primary has nearly always been won by the eventual nominee, Badger voters have also managed to send a message now and then that shook things up. In 2004, John Kerry solidified his grip on the Democratic nomination in Wisconsin's primary. But his 39 percent share of the multi-candidate vote barely edged John Edwards' 34 percent. Edwards said Kerry should realize that ""objects in the rearview mirror are closer than they appear."" Kerry subsequently chose Edwards as his running mate.

Forty years earlier, in 1964, one-third of the state's Democratic primary vote went to Alabama Gov. George Wallace, the segregationist who mounted a challenge to President Lyndon Johnson in protest of the civil rights bill then making its way through Congress. (Wallace ran again in the Wisconsin Democratic primary in 1972, receiving 22 percent of the vote to George McGovern's winning 29 percent).

Perhaps the two Wisconsin primaries that produced the most intense media attention in the past half-century took place in 1960 and 1976. The first contest matched neighboring Minnesota's Democratic Sen. Hubert Humphrey against the young upstart from Massachusetts John Kennedy. The latter won decisively, shifting the momentum of that year's nomination fight.

In 1976, liberal champion Morris Udall was a congressman from Arizona and a Mormon. He thought he had won the Wisconsin Democratic Party's nod when most people went to bed on primary night. But overnight that result was reversed, and in the morning Georgian Jimmy Carter was flashing his trademark smile under a copy of the Milwaukee Sentinel that erroneously reported Udall as the winner in a front-page banner headline.

Udall dropped out shortly thereafter, leaving Carter to march on to the nomination and the White House.

But Wisconsin has not always been such a bellwether. From 1912 until 1956, Wisconsin Republicans favored someone other than their party's eventual nominee. For several cycles, the state party preferred its own Robert ""Fighting Bob"" La Follette, a founder and favorite of progressive Republicanism.

Even after La Follette was gone, the state's GOP went for Midwesterners such as Harold Stassen or hard-line conservatives such as retired Gen. Douglas MacArthur (whose family had roots in the state) or Ohio Sen. Robert Taft. In 1952, the Wisconsin GOP preferred Taft to Dwight D. Eisenhower. After Ike won the nomination and the presidency that year, he was able to win the Wisconsin primary in 1956 — the first eventual nominee of his party to do so.

The Badger State's reputation is steeped in politics at the edge: The visionary progressive La Follette was a demigod on the left, while the amazingly charismatic anti-communist Joseph R. McCarthy was and is an icon on the right.

But in practical terms, most of Wisconsin's governors and senators have tended to be closer to the mainstream of their respective parties. While the state is known for ideological partisanship, two Democrats, William Proxmire and Herbert Kohl, held one of its two U.S. Senate seats for more than half a century (1957-2012) while functioning as self-defined independents.

It is this independent element of Wisconsin's complex political identity that has informed the results of its quadrennial presidential primary. As the state does not register voters by party, it has always been part of the local tradition to hold an ""open primary"" for president.

Voters can sign in on primary day, take a blank ballot for each party, fill one out and discard the other. The clerk in the precinct never knows which ballot each voter has actually used.

Given this tradition, and the state's mid-position on the calendar, Wisconsin has nearly always served as the confirmation of the front-runner's inevitability.

The only cycle after 1952 when Wisconsin did not presage the GOP nominee was 1964, when the state party chairman got a popular congressman to run as a ""favorite son"" and then persuaded both of the party's leading national candidates (Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller) to stay out of the state for the sake of unity. Both did.

That was, needless to say, a different era."

Saying he apologizes for ""any embarrassment I have caused for my colleagues and constituents,"" Kansas Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder has confirmed a Politico report that he was the ""nude member of Congress"" who took a dip in the Sea of Galilee last year during a late-night escapade ""that involved drinking [and] numerous GOP freshmen lawmakers.""

According to Politico:

""During a fact-finding congressional trip to the Holy Land last summer ... Yoder took off his clothes and jumped into the sea, joining a number of members, their families and GOP staff during a night out in Israel ... sources told POLITICO. Other participants, including the daughter of another congressman, swam fully clothed, while some lawmakers partially disrobed. More than 20 people took part in the late-night dip in the sea, according to sources who were participants in the trip.""

As The Kansas City Star reminds its readers this morning, ""Christians consider the Sea of Galilee a holy site; it is where the Bible says Jesus walked on water.""

Yoder told the Star that:

""Part of the reason I made that decision at that moment was there was really nobody in the vicinity who could see me. ... I dove in, hopped right back out, put my clothes on and, regardless, that was still not the behavior people expected out of their congressman.""

According to the Star, the congressman said he remained in the water for about 10 seconds.

Politico says that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., was on the trip as well. He apparently was not among the group that went to the Sea of Galilee. Politico says that Cantor ""was so upset about the antics that he rebuked the 30 lawmakers the morning after the Aug. 18, 2011, incident, saying they were distracting from the mission of the trip.""

Yoder is running unopposed for a second term."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Darron Cummings/AP Darron Cummings/AP

Ahead of the potentially pivotal Indiana primary Tuesday, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence announced he will be voting for Republican candidate Ted Cruz.

""This is a time for choosing,"" Pence said on WIBC radio in Indianapolis. He called Cruz, a senator from Texas, a ""principled conservative"" who ""stood up for taxpayers"" in fighting spending in Washington, said he was ""very impressed"" with his ""knowledge and devotion"" to the Constitution and his ""strong, unwavering stand"" against abortion rights.

But Pence seemed to go out of his way to praise Republican front-runner Donald Trump. He also stressed that his endorsement was not intended to sway the votes of Indiana Republicans.

""I respect the right of every Hoosier in making their determination,"" Pence said, adding, ""I encourage everyone to make up their own mind.""

In fact, Pence mentioned Trump before mentioning his endorsement of Cruz.

""I like and respect all three of the candidates,"" Pence began. ""I particularly want to commend Donald Trump,"" whom he said has given voice to people's frustrations. He said he was ""grateful"" for Trump at least twice — for taking a stand for Hoosier jobs. And ""for his voice in the national debate. I'm not against anybody, but I will be voting for Ted Cruz in the Republican primary.""

And, he added, ""Let me be very, very clear on this ... whoever wins the Republican nomination I'm going to work my heart out for this fall.""

Pence's endorsement was closely watched, in part, because he'll be on the ballot this fall as a candidate for re-election, and because, in the past, he's been seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate.

Cruz also hopes Pence's endorsement gives him a boost in the Hoosier State, where he's trailing Trump in recent surveys. Cruz was helped by Scott Walker's endorsement in Wisconsin, giving Cruz his only big-state primary victory so far in this campaign.

But Cruz not only had Walker's endorsement, but almost the entire GOP infrastructure in Wisconsin, including talk radio.

Pence's endorsement was far less forceful than Cruz would probably have liked.

There are 57 delegates at stake in Indiana on Tuesday. If Trump sweeps those delegates, his path to the nomination not only becomes clear, but likely.

Currently, he needs 42 percent of remaining delegates to win, which is very doable. If he wins all of Indiana's 57 delegates, that drops to 36 percent."

Donald Trump now has the support of 1,238 delegates — just a hair above the 1,237 threshold needed to clinch the Republican presidential nomination, according to The Associated Press.

Trump was able to reach that number Thursday after 29 unbound Republican delegates told the AP that they would support him at the party's July convention. Fifteen of those unbound delegates came from North Dakota, seven from Pennsylvania, two each from West Virginia and Nevada and one each from Colorado, New Hampshire and Oklahoma (the unbound delegate who announced her support for Trump in this state is GOP chairwoman Pam Pollard).

Most Republican delegates are bound by the results of their states' presidential primary elections but as many as 200 are not bound by those rules.

Five states including California vote on June 7 with more than 300 delegates at stake. As the sole candidate left running on the GOP side, Trump will easily add to his slim delegate edge on that day.

Trump is now the Republican Party's presumptive nominee; he won't be the official nominee until the July convention in Cleveland when delegates vote. But Trump reaching the magic number caps the businessman's unlikely presidential run and rise and avoids further talk of a possible contested GOP convention.

As NPR Political Editor Domenico Montanaro said on Morning Edition, Thursday's news turns the GOP convention into ""what it usually is, which is a wedding reception, essentially. ... it's going to be more of what you usually get."" The unknown, of course, will be what happens outside the convention hall by way of protests. Previews of opposition to Trump were seen in New Mexico and California earlier this week.

The fact that unbound delegates are now supporting Trump, Montanaro said, is further evidence that Republicans are starting to fall in line behind the candidate. ""There were a lot of Republicans who had said that they were 'Never Trump' ... and that's just not the case. Now we're starting to see what are typical proportions — about 75, 80 percent of Republicans in polling saying they're going to get behind Donald Trump.""

""The reverse is not true on the Democratic side at this point,"" Montanaro added, in part because Bernie Sanders is still winning states. ""Democratic unity hasn't quite happened in the way it has — or appears to be happening — on the Republican side."""

A federal judge released hundreds of pages of court documents Tuesday related to Trump University, Donald Trump's real estate and investment training venture that has sparked lawsuits from former students. The records include a careful guide to selling — and to dealing with reporters.

The documents were released in response to a request from The Washington Post. After their release today, the newspaper's Tom Hamburger took a break from looking through the records to describe them to NPR's Ari Shapiro.

'Trump University' Documents Put On Display Aggressive Sales Techniques Listen · 3:56 3:56

Many of the court documents, Hamburger says, can be split into two basic categories: depositions from Trump executives, and ""playbooks"" — essentially, marketing and strategy plans for selling courses and mentoring sessions to students, often with an emphasis on finding takers for the ""Gold"" level courses that cost nearly $35,000.

Enlarge this image toggle caption NPR NPR

The Trump University documents' topics range from how employees should file expense reports to guides for making sales in various environments, from one-off preview events to three-day sessions. Nearly all of the pages are marked ""Confidential.""

Tips for dealing with the news media are included in the 2008 edition of the playbook, starting with the idea that any reporters should be directed to a Trump media contact. The reminder ""courtesy gets you a long way"" is also among the tips:

The playbooks were publicly released on the same day that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, called ABC News reporter Tom Llamas ""a sleaze"" during a news conference, prompting CNN to declare, ""Donald Trump's criticism of the media has reached Nixonian levels — only Trump isn't doing the name-calling in private.""

Representing several years' worth of sales playbooks, the guides also include Trump employees' suggested responses to customers who balk at a sale, offering rebuttals to objections that range from a need to consult a spouse to a reluctance to go into debt.

Another tip in the venture's 2010 Playbook requires sales staff to ""Be Deliberate."" Here's that paragraph:

""Be deliberate and conscious when communicating to potential students. Remember that we have time to think and plan and develop questions and commands that lead people into a flow that they must deal with and respond to. Without a game plan you are required to respond to them and do much more thinking on your feet. Remember that we need to stay on 'offense.' ""

The playbook also urges Trump's sales teams not to let a lack of money be used as an excuse for turning down Trump University's three-day training.

""Money is never a reason for not enrolling in Trump University,"" the sales guide states, adding, ""if they really believe in you and your product, they will find the money.""

The documents and records were ordered to be released by U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel of the Southern District of California, who has come under personal attack from Donald Trump.

As Hamburger wrote on Friday for the Post:

""Trump, who previously questioned whether Curiel's Hispanic heritage made him biased due to Trump's support for building a wall on the Mexican border, said Friday that Curiel 'happens to be, we believe, Mexican.' Trump called the judge a 'hater of Donald Trump' who had 'railroaded' him in the case.""

Here's a sampling of the full documents:

The documents stem from lawsuits filed by Trump University's customers back in 2013; their case gained new prominence back in February, when Trump's Republican rival Marco Rubio brought them up during a debate.

After that debate, Michael Isikoff, the chief investigative correspondent for Yahoo! News, spoke to NPR's Robert Siegel about the former students' complaints against Trump. From the transcript:"

Enlarge this image toggle caption Abd Doumany/AFP/Getty Images Abd Doumany/AFP/Getty Images

More than 50 U.S. State Department officials have signed an internal memo calling for a change in the way the United States approaches Syria — specifically, advocating military pressure on Bashar Assad's regime to push him toward the negotiating table.

The diplomats expressed their opposition to the current U.S. policy through a cable on the State Department's dissent channel — which exists for just that reason.

But NPR's Michele Kelemen reports that it's unusual for so many officials to sign on to such a cable.

""Secretary of State John Kerry says he respects the process and will study their views,"" Michele tells our Newscast unit.

""The cable reportedly calls for targeted military strikes against the Assad regime, something the Obama administration has been reluctant to do,"" she reports. ""Such action would also put the U.S. on a collision course with Russia at a time that Moscow is backing the Assad regime — and working with Secretary Kerry on a cease-fire and a diplomatic path that has faltered.""

The New York Times, which has seen a copy of the memo, reports that the diplomats say they aren't advocating a confrontation with Russia. But a credible military threat against Assad is necessary to pressure him to negotiate, the officials argue.

""The moral rationale for taking steps to end the deaths and suffering in Syria, after five years of brutal war, is evident and unquestionable. ... The status quo in Syria will continue to present increasingly dire, if not disastrous, humanitarian, diplomatic and terrorism-related challenges,"" the cable says, according to the Times.

The American Foreign Service Association, which represents active and retired members of the Foreign Service, said in a statement that ""constructive dissent is a core tenet of the Foreign Service."" It added:

From The Archives From The Archives From 2004: Channeling Dissent from the Foreign Service Channeling Dissent from the Foreign Service Listen

""America's diplomats are tasked with addressing some of the world's most complex challenges in order to protect America's people and national security — charge that requires a professional environment that values candor and debate when the stakes are high and the costs of failure are unacceptable. We applaud the individuals who had the intellectual courage to express their dissent.""

There's a long tradition of dissenting internal memos at the State Department. The dissent channel was established in 1971, during the Vietnam War, and is meant for ""dissenting and alternative views on substantive foreign policy issues."" Messages go directly to the top of the chain of command — they are immediately distributed to the secretary of state and other leaders in the department.

Cables sent through the channel are supposed to remain confidential.

In 2004, Michele reported on the State Department diplomats who expressed their objections to the war in Iraq. She said at the time, about six messages a year were sent through the channel.

""One little lonely voice out in the wild reaches of Mongolia was certainly not going to turn the train of war around,"" one diplomat who sent an anti-war dissent cable told Michele. But even if it wouldn't change history, the diplomat wanted her concerns put in writing and read by the country's top diplomat."

United Kingdom voters sent shockwaves across Europe and beyond with their vote to exit the European Union. The ""Brexit"" vote stunned the country's political elite, the financial markets and British bookmakers, all of whom had expected a very close vote in favor of remaining in the European Union.

Instead, Britain now finds itself in uncharted waters, and looking for a new captain. Prime Minister David Cameron, just days after vowing that ""Britain never quits,"" says he'll be stepping down by October.

""I fought this campaign in the only way I know how, which is to say directly and passionately what I think and feel, head, heart and soul,"" he said outside the prime minister's office at 10 Downing St.

""But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path, and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.""

Cameron will stay on as a caretaker, but said a new prime minister should be in place by the time his Conservative Party holds a party conference in October.

How are financial markets reacting?

The British pound plunged to 31-year lows, stock markets around the world churned, and the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, stepped forward to reassure markets and bankers that nothing will be changing immediately. He said the Bank of England has 250 billion pounds in assistance at the ready, and will take all necessary measures to maintain market stability.

How will the U.K. and the EU divorce?

The vote itself does not immediately remove Britain from the EU, which is based in Brussels. The British government must notify the EU of its intention to withdraw from the union, which will trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, one of the EU's fundamental documents.

Article 50 envisions a two-year window to negotiate the terms of Britain's withdrawal, and to set in place whatever new agreements can be reached. There are provisions for extending the two-year period, if all members agree. Much remains unknown, as this has never happened before in the EU, which now has 28 members, including the U.K.

Cameron's announcement that he'll be gone within months suggests that this negotiating process won't begin in earnest until the fall.

Who are the winners and losers?

The biggest loser is Cameron, who just last year was being hailed for his electoral skills after bringing the Conservative Party a clear governing majority. Cameron decided to hold the EU referendum because he thought it would be a way of getting the Euro-skeptics in his own party to ""stop banging on about Europe,"" as he once said.

Philip Cowley, professor of politics at Queen Mary College London University, said before the vote that ""it would be remarkable if someone who had taken the party back into power, then managed to win a majority against all odds, found himself kicked out within a year because he gambled on something he never wanted to do in the first place.""

That prediction is now coming to pass.

Other losers include Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was roundly criticized for his ""half-hearted"" support of remaining in the EU. Labour mobilized its resources fairly late in the game, and voters in many Labour strongholds cast ballots in large numbers in favor of the Brexit. Corbyn finds himself in the uncomfortable position of a pro-workers rights politician who's seen as out of touch with his rank and file.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Stefan Rousseau/AP Stefan Rousseau/AP

On the winning side of the ledger, former London Mayor Boris Johnson is seen as a strong contender to replace Cameron in the Conservative Party leadership contest that effectively begins immediately. Other contenders include Justice Minister Michael Gove, a leading Brexit campaigner, and the Home Secretary Theresa May.

And it's unlikely that anyone is celebrating the vote any more thoroughly than Nigel Farage, head of the right-wing U.K. Independence Party (UKIP). Never part of the official Leave campaign and dismissed by his critics as a fringe politician, Farage focused relentlessly on immigration and British sovereignty, two hot-button issues with Leave voters.

Now seen by his supporters as a champion of the working class, Farage called the vote a ""victory for real people."" He also said he looked forward to other EU countries holding their own referendums.

""The EU's failing, the EU's dying, I hope we've knocked the first brick out of the wall,"" he said.

EU leaders in Brussels will not be amused by Farage's Berlin Wall analogy, but they will have other worries on their minds: Just like U.K. residents, they awoke this morning to a very different future."

Tony Thompson hopes the United Kingdom votes on Thursday to leave the European Union. Standing in a green smock behind his meat counter in the town of Romford, a short train ride from central London, the 58-year-old butcher explains why in four words.

""Got to stop immigration,"" says Thompson. ""It's only an island. You can only get so many people on an island, can't you?""

Thompson says immigration has cost him. He had a butcher shop in London's famed East End, but over time, his white, British-born clients moved out and were replaced by Muslims from Somalia, Pakistan and India. They had no use for an English butcher — they could eat only halal meat.

""That's when I noticed a lot of change,"" says Thompson, ""because my business went under.""

Thompson insists he is not a racist — he has four mixed-race sons — but he thinks communities and the culture are changing too fast.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Frank Augstein/AP Frank Augstein/AP

""It's like the English are being pushed out to the coasts,"" he says, ""and main towns, even Birmingham and those places, it's not England anymore.""

Thursday's vote is officially about leaving a giant trading block of 28 nations with more than 500 million people, but most in the so-called ""Leave"" camp are — like Thompson — focused on immigration. They say membership in the EU permits too many foreigners to flow too freely into their country.

Romford is part of the London borough of Havering, which YouGov, an online polling firm, estimates is the most anti-European area in the country. Although the vast majority of people in Havering are white, the percentage of minorities has more than doubled since 2001, according to government figures.

Lawrence Webb, a councilman in the area, says rapid growth has frustrated locals. A journey that used to take ten minutes across the borough now takes 30. Big houses, Webb says, have been replaced by a series of apartments.

""It has nothing to do with color and race necessarily,"" says Webb, who is with the nationalist UK Independence Party, which is campaigning hard for a British exit — or ""Brexit"" — from the EU. ""People perceive that their quality of life is diminished.""

Drive five hours west of Romford through rolling hills dotted with sheep, and you arrive in Aberystwyth, which sits in a cove along the Welsh coast looking out toward Ireland. Aberyswyth looks like a classic British seaside town, with a fading pier stretching out into the ocean and the remains of a castle on a nearby hillside.

YouGov's polling found that the area around the city was the most EU-friendly region in the United Kingdom.

Even though Aberystwyth is far from London, it feels more diverse than Romford. Consider Shumana Palit, who works as a server at Ultracomida, a Spanish restaurant and deli.

""I'm originally from Wales, so I'm half-Welsh, and my father's from India,"" Palit says as she prepares a coffee behind the counter. ""My husband's half-Spanish, half-French.""

Palit says a major reason the city has an unusually cosmopolitan feel is because of Aberystwyth University, which has a large population of international students.

""It feels very European when you're here,"" she says, ""it doesn't feel like somewhere that wants to be cut off from Europe.""

toggle caption Frank Langfitt/NPR

Instead of seeing membership in the EU as a problem — as butcher Tony Thompson does — many businesses here see it as crucial to their success, because it allows them to trade freely with the continent. Ultracomida owner Paul Grimwood places 30 orders a week from Spain, which is comparatively easy because the EU operates as a single market. Grimwood says that a Brexit would make things harder, and that it would drive down the value of the British pound and raise his costs by 20 percent.

In some parts of the country, people complain that working-class immigrants are driving down wages. But Cameron Singhclare, an economics student at the university, says foreigners in Aberystwyth are different, and less of a competitive threat.

""The majority who came here are students or academics or professionals, and maybe that's why there is less resentment about migration from the EU,"" says Singhclare, who rooms with a Bulgarian.

Toby Bragg, who works at Summit Cycles in town, has spent much of his career in the U.K. and Europe working with people of different nationalities. He says his fellow citizens who don't like the changing ethnic makeup of the country have short memories.

""We're essentially an island,"" says Bragg. ""If you look back through history, we've been colonized, overtaken, invaded, assimilated many, many different ways.

""I get the idea that for some people there's this very English England — which probably never existed or ever will.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Richard Drew/AP Richard Drew/AP

Amid furor over an email leak that revealed a bias against Bernie Sanders inside the Democratic National Committee, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced Sunday she will step down as chair.

Wasserman Schultz will still open and close the convention, she said in a statement, and ""address our delegates about the stakes involved in this election not only for Democrats, but for all Americans.""

""We have planned a great and unified Convention this week and I hope and expect that the DNC team that has worked so hard to get us to this point will have the strong support of all Democrats in making sure this is the best convention we have ever had,"" the statement continued.

Donna Brazile, former Al Gore campaign manager and Bill Clinton adviser, will be the interim committee chair through the election, according to a verified tweet from DNC Communications Director Luis Miranda:

DNC Vice Chair Donna Brazile will serve as Interim Chair through the election #DNCinPHL — Luis Miranda (@LuisMiranda) July 24, 2016

In response, Sanders said Wasserman Schultz made ""the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party.

President Obama, who appointed Wasserman Schultz in 2011, praised her service, saying the Florida congresswoman's ""leadership of the DNC has meant that we had someone who brought Democrats together.""

In a statement, Hillary Clinton thanked her ""longtime friend"" for her leadership. ""There's simply no one better at taking the fight to the Republicans than Debbie.""

Clinton also announced that Wasserman Schultz will serve as honorary chair of the campaign's ""50-state program to gain ground and elect Democrats in every part of the country"" and that the two will campaign together both to help elect Clinton to the White House and to help with Wasserman Schultz's House re-election campaign.

Donald Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort said Wasserman Schultz resigned over ""her failure to secure the DNC's email servers and the rigged system she set up with the Clinton campaign.""

He said Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz's lead and drop out over her failure to safeguard top-secret, classified information both on her unauthorized home server and while traveling abroad. Wasserman Schultz's emails only put the Democratic Party at risk, he said, but Clinton's emails put all of America at risk.

Earlier in the day, Wasserman Schultz was replaced as chair of the Democratic National Convention, which begins Monday in Philadelphia. Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge was named the new convention chair.

The emails, which were released by WikiLeaks just days before the party's convention launches in Philadelphia, appear to show top DNC officials trading ideas on how to hurt Sanders at the polls.

In one email out of the 20,000 leaked, the committee's chief financial officer, Brad Marshall, appears to float an idea to question the Vermont senator's Jewish faith.

In an interview with CNN, Sanders, once again, called on Wasserman Schultz to resign.

""It goes without saying the function of the DNC,"" Sanders said, ""is to represent all of the candidates to be fair and even-minded.""

Sanders also called the emails an ""outrage"" and ""sad"" but also said they do not come as ""a great shock."" He believes that the DNC was ""at opposition to our campaign"" all along, he said Sunday morning.

""I mean, there's no question to my mind and I think no question to any objective observer's mind that the DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton, and was at opposition to our campaign,"" Sanders said.

He had been saying for months that he believes Wasserman Schultz should resign. She should step down, he said, ""not only because of the prejudice I think [the DNC] showed during the campaign but also because I think we need new leadership that will open up that party"" to working people, young people and ""have the kind of vitality we need.""

Clinton has had a long-standing relationship with the DNC and Wasserman Schultz. Wasserman Schultz was the co-chair of her 2008 bid for president. Sanders is a relative newcomer to the Democratic Party and the DNC, having long served as an independent in the Senate.

Still, Sanders and others feel that the DNC chair should remain neutral during a nominating process.

On NBC's Meet the Press, Sanders wouldn't say whether Wasserman Schultz should be forced to resign before the Democratic convention begins. But some of his supporters went there — commentator and activist Van Jones tweeted that he'll speak out until she steps down:

She will not have a speaking role at this week's convention, according to several reports.

Blowback to the emails came from all corners of the political world Sunday — including Clinton supporters and Donald Trump.

Former DNC Chair and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who is a Clinton supporter, called the leak ""very disturbing"" if true and told NPR that the chair's job should be ""to remain neutral.""

""I sat in that chair in 2004 trying to navigate all the different candidates we had,"" he said. ""But if you had people in there who were trashing one of the candidates, I can tell you this, if I were still chairman, they wouldn't be working there. I mean, that is just totally unacceptable behavior.""

Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook also called the emails ""disturbing"" and something that ""voters need to reflect on.""

Trump also blasted the emails via Twitter, saying they would make it hard for Sanders to continue supporting Clinton:

The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2016

Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016

But Sanders maintained that his support for Clinton is strong, saying his immediate message to his supporters now is that ""disastrous"" Donald Trump must be defeated. ""My second message is that we continue the political revolution."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images

Donald Trump accepted the Republican nomination for president Thursday night, delivering a speech that lays out America's struggles with crime, terrorism and immigration and how he plans to address them.

NPR's politics team has annotated Trump's speech below. Portions we commented on are highlighted, followed by analysis, context and fact check in italics.

Thank you, thank you. Thank you very much.

Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Who would have believed that when we started this journey // because we are a team would have received almost 14 million votes the most in the history of the Republican party and that the Republican party would get 60 percent more votes than it received eight years ago. Who would have believed this. Who would have believed this.

The Democrats on the other hand received 20 percent fewer votes than they got four years ago. Not so good. Not so good.

Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace.

We will be a country of generosity and warmth.

But we will also be a country of law and order.

[Law and order has become a big theme for Trump in recent weeks, particularly since the killings of five police officers in Dallas. — Sarah McCammon]

Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism of our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.

Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims. I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, and I mean very soon, come to an end.

Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.

[Policing, public safety and the vast majority of the criminal justice apparatus are controlled by state and local authorities, not the federal government. — Carrie Johnson]

The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead. It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.

I will present the facts plainly and honestly.

We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.

So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there.

But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.

[Fact checkers might beg to differ. PolitiFact, for instance, has found a number of false statements uttered at this week's RNC. — Tamara Keith]

These are the facts: Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years.

[These data seem to come from a January Washington Post analysis that found homicides were up by 17 percent in 2015 over 2014, and that it indeed was the largest increase since 1990. — Danielle Kurtzleben] [However, violent crime is an intensely local phenomenon and murders were not up in all of those 50 cities. — Carrie Johnson] [And there's a broader context for crime figures: While violent crime may be climbing this year, rates are far below their peak in the early 1990s. — Danielle Kurtzleben] [Americans in recent years have said they believe crime is getting worse even though the overall trend is down. — Sarah McCammon]

In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.

[That same Post analysis found murders up by 54.3 percent in Washington, D.C., and 58.5 percent in Baltimore in 2015 over 2014. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

In the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victims of shootings this year alone.

[Just three days ago, the Chicago Tribune reported that nearly 2,200 people have been shot in Chicago this year, with 329 of those people dead. The Tribune also reported that that's 100 more such deaths than at this point last year. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

And more than 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.

The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year.

[The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund says as of July 21, 2016, total fatalities this year compared with the same time last year reflect an increase of five deaths, or 8 percent. Deaths related to firearms are up by 14 deaths, or 78 percent. — Carrie Johnson]

Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.

The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.

[The number of families apprehended this fiscal year along the Southwestern border thus far (that is, starting in October 2015) is around 51,000, according to Border Patrol data. That is already over the nearly 40,000 apprehended during fiscal year 2015. Total apprehensions are also on pace to exceed their 2015 total, as well, according to these data. However, that wouldn't be a very high number in the context of recent years; total apprehensions at the border today are far, far lower than they were in the early 2000s. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.

One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Number one in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law. I've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. No more.

One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders.

[America does not have ""open borders."" It has restrictions on immigration and Border Patrol agents who make hundreds of thousands of apprehensions a year. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

What about our economy? Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are now not employed.

[Thirty-six percent of African-Americans under 18 were below the poverty line as of 2014, according to the Census Bureau. It's not entirely clear what Trump means by ""not employed,"" which is not technically the same as ""unemployed,"" which counts people who aren't working and are looking for work. However, the unemployment rate for black Americans ages 16 to 19 was 38.1 percent as of June. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago.

[That's roughly true, by the latest data available. Around 11 million Hispanic-Americans were in poverty in 2008, compared with 13.1 million in 2014. The poverty rate makes more sense to compare, though — that has grown 0.4 points since 2008, but it has also declined lately, down by nearly 3 points since 2010. As for whether President Obama is responsible for this, we get to that below. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.

[There's a lot going on in this statistic. So here goes: Trump may be talking about the number of adults not in the labor force — that is, neither working nor looking for work (so it includes retirees and students, for example). That figure has climbed by 14 million since January 2009 (importantly, this isn't people leaving the labor force; it's just people not in it, period). But while labor force participation is relatively low, the labor force has still been growing — Trump's 14 million figure might imply that it's not. And that low labor force participation isn't entirely about a tough economy — a lot of it is simple demographics. In 2014, the Congressional Budget Office found that half of a recent 3-point drop in the rate had been due to baby boomers retiring. The other half was economic factors. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. That's sixteen years ago.

[That's true, using median household income data, though he is not measuring from the start of the Obama administration as he is for the other stats here. If he measured from 2008, the drop was $1,656. Measuring from 2000 means measuring from the figure's near-peak. [A broader point about all of these economic statistics: A lot of them have been true, but the question is whether Obama is to blame. Higher poverty, for example, doesn't appear to be Obama's doing, as we wrote in a fact check last year. Moreover, many experts believe a president generally has only very limited ability to affect the economy. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

Our trade deficit has reached an all-time high think of this, think of this, our trade deficit is nearly $800 billion, think of that, 800 billion dollars, last year alone. We're going to fix that.

The budget is no better. President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. And yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.

Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad. Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they've lived through one international humiliation after another.One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated.

[PolitiFact has debunked this — that $150 billion is an estimate (and a high one) of the value of Iranian assets tied up by economic sanctions, according to the site. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing. In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames.

[The diplomatic outpost in Benghazi was not a consulate. Here's how former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell described it in a Politico article: [""The State Department facility in Benghazi has been widely mischaracterized as a US consulate. In fact it was a Temporary Mission Facility (TMF), a presence that was not continuously staffed by senior personnel and that was never given formal diplomatic status by the Libyan government."" — Tamara Keith]

America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.

[Editor's note: Crowd chants ""Lock her up.""]

Let's defeat her in November, okay?

I am certain that it was a decision that President Obama truly regrets.

[President Obama has enthusiastically endorsed Clinton, so it would seem unlikely that he regrets choosing her to be his secretary of state. — Tamara Keith]

Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record.

In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing and really a big big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the entire world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis, now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness. But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy.

[Attacks on Hillary Clinton and the argument that she is part of the status quo that is making many Americans unhappy in their lives are a common theme at Trump rallies. — Sarah McCammon]

The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place.

A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes.

[Many of these ideas are familiar: making better trade deals, fighting terrorism, putting ""America first,"" and the notion that only a dramatic change in the leadership of the country will be able to solve national problems. — Sarah McCammon]

Tonight, I will share with you my plan for action for America. The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First.

Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect. The respect that we deserve.

The American People will come first once again.

My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order.

On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.

A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That's because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me. It's for their benefit.

Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place.

They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.

That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change. Never ever.

[Clinton has reams of plans and proposals to change everything from the nation's immigration system and criminal justice policies to the way people pay for college. — Tamara Keith]

My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now.

Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned. I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten. But they're not going to be forgotten long.

These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. I am your voice.

I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. I have no patience for injustice -

[Editor's note: Protester interrupts, crowd shouts ""USA""]

How great are our police! And how great is Cleveland?

Thank you.

I have no patience for injustice. No tolerance for government incompetence of which there is so much, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens. When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way. And I won't look the other way.

And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.

[There was no official determination that the private server was illegal, although the State Department inspector general found it was not approved and would not have been had Clinton asked. — Carrie Johnson]

When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was ""extremely careless"" and ""negligent,"" in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did.

[FBI Director James Comey had plenty of criticism for Clinton but said ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would charge Clinton with a crime for the emails. — Carrie Johnson]

They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible, terrible crimes.

In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.

I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves.

Nobody knows the system better than me.

Which is why I alone can fix it.

I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance. Never had a chance. But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country.

[Sanders had a lot of issues that he was deeply passionate about, including trade, but it wouldn't be at the top of his list. His campaign revolved most intensely around two things: income inequality and a broken campaign finance system. — Tamara Keith]

Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for all Americans.

[A recent Pew poll found that just 9 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning Sanders supporters said they planned to vote for Trump in the general election. ""85% say they plan to vote for Clinton in the general election, compared with 9% who say they will vote for Trump and 6% who volunteer that they will vote for another candidate or don't know."" [Sanders got approximately 12 million popular votes. Back-of-the-envelope calculation, 9 percent of 12 million is a bit more than 1 million, not millions. And that poll was taken before Sanders endorsed Clinton. — Tamara Keith]

In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy.

We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana. Which is amazing.

He's a man of character and accomplishment. He's the man for the job.

[Trump is saying that he and Pence will improve U.S. trade deals, but trade is just one of several areas on which they differ. Pence has been a strong proponent of free trade in the past, having approved of NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as the New York Times reports. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens our community. America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.

On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very, very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.

I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me. Believe me.

I will work with, and appoint, the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done.

[The president does select U.S. attorneys, but those top federal prosecutors handle a small fraction of violent crime cases in the nation. Most murders, robberies and assaults are prosecuted by local authorities. — Carrie Johnson]

In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.

The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment that frankly that I have ever seen of anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.

[The Brennan Center for Justice says overall crime rates from 2014 to 2015 were ""nearly identical."" Violent crime rose by 3 percent over that period. — Carrie Johnson]

This Administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember, it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them in every way and at every single level. When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.

Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have really, in every way folks, the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? Any other child.

To make life safe for all of our citizens, we must also address the growing threats from outside the country. We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS and we're going to defeat them fast.

Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning. The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, at a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many many other locations.

Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community. No good, and we're going to stop it.

As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me.

[The party is well to Trump's right on LGBT issues, as NPR's Brian Naylor has reported. The Log Cabin Republicans have called it the ""most anti-LGBT platform"" in GOP history, according to ABC News. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

And I have to say as a Republican it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.

To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things. We must have the best, absolutely the best gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world. The best. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, in Libya, in Egypt and in Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast.

This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.

Recently, I have said NATO is obsolete because it did not properly cover terror. And also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the costs. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism. A true step in the right direction.

Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country.

My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian, think of this. Think of this, this is not believable but this is what's happening. A 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of President Obama.

She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.

[PolitiFact ranked the claim about the lack of a vetting system false. [However, PolitiFact did find that Trump's number is correct as to the increase in refugee admissions proposed by Clinton. Interestingly, about a month ago, Trump said it would be a 500 percent increase. PolitiFact noted that it actually worked out to 550 percent. Trump has adjusted to the higher and more accurate number. [In 2015, the U.S. admitted (per the State Department) 1,682 Syrian refugees. That is well under President Obama's goal. It would be hard to argue that is ""massive."" — Tamara Keith]

I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.

Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.

Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.

On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants: Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so greatly. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even close I have to tell you, than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders which we can solve. We have to solve it.

These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protect them and certainly none to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Believe me. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities.

But where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?

Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other, it's so sad to even be talking about it, because we can solve this problem so quickly. Where was the sanctuary for all of the Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are not alone any longer.

Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.

We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.

I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents.

And will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. Lawful.

By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will end the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it, it won't be happening very much anymore. Believe me.

Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect that they deserve.

Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very, very closely to the words I am about to say. On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.

We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.

USA. USA. USA.

[Editor's note: Trump chanted along with the crowd here.]

My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Which is what we have now. Communities want relief. Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.

Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class.

I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat. Of which there are many.

It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.

I have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I'm going to make our country rich again.

Using the greatest business people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements.

America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton. Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country. Or frankly, any other country. Never ever again.

[As we have pointed out in two earlier Trump speech annotations, and as NPR's Chris Arnold reported this year, it appears that NAFTA didn't have a huge effect on jobs. As the Congressional Research Service reported in 2015, the agreement neither lived up to proponents' promises nor caused the massive job losses that opponents claimed it would. Also, Bill Clinton was not solely responsible for NAFTA; it was negotiated under George H.W. Bush before it became law under Clinton. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania, and New York, and Michigan, and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequence. Not going to happen anymore.

My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters.

She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Which will not only destroy our manufacturers, but will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it's not going to happen.

I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom or independence. We will never sign bad trade deals. America First again. America First.

Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands.

We are going to enforce all trade violations, against any country that cheats.

This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about. They are the greatest currency manipulators ever.

Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we'll walk away if we don't get that kind of a deal.

Our country is going to start building and making things again.

Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for the president this year – Democrat or Republican.

Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone. I mean everyone.

America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.

Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it'll happen and it'll happen fast.

Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very, very quickly.

[A few analyses have found that regulation costs around $2 trillion — one of the best-known, from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, estimated it at around $1.9 trillion this year. But as the Washington Post's Fact Checker has pointed out, in the past this figure has been characterized as a ""back of the envelope"" count, and that moreover, it doesn't make sense to talk about costs without trying to count the benefits of regulation. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.

This will produce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades. My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and the great steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business – that will never happen with Donald J Trump as president. Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again.

With these new economic policies, trillions and trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions of more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.

My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children. And that's what she's doing. And that's what's she's done. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.

You will be able to choose your own doctor again.

And we will fix TSA at the airports! Which is a total disaster.

We're going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out in their adult lives. Tremendous problem.

We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their fair share.

We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before.

My just released 10 point plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days on a line and dying.

My opponent dismissed the VA scandal. One more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days.

The politicians have talked about this for years, but I'm going to do it.

[Editor's note: Crowd chants ""Yes You Will""]

We are going to appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.

The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment.

I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.

At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what. Because the support they've given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it, has been so amazing. And has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. True. So true.

They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away.

[Here's an IRS explanation of the rules on churches and taxes, saying that to be tax-exempt, a church may not ""participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office."" This LA Times piece from 2008 is a breakdown of some of the arguments for and against the Johnson Amendment. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans.

We can accomplish these great things, and so much more – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.

In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka, did they do a job.

[There's also a bit more of the personal in this speech. Trump not only talks about his children, as he often does, but also his parents and siblings. This week we've seen an effort to humanize a man who is known for being bold and confrontational, and that continues here. — Sarah McCammon]

My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this, and to see me, tonight.

It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people.

He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, and carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people.

Then there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great great judge of character. She could pick 'em out from anywhere.

To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me.

I have had a truly great life in business. But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for you. It's time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again.

But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past. America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.

Remember: all of the people telling you you can't have the country you want, are the same people telling you that wouldn't stand, I mean they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight. Not a chance. The same people. Oh we love defeating those people. Don't we? Don't we? Love it. Love it. Love it.

No longer can we rely on those same people in the media media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.

[Americans as a whole aren't fans of the news media, but Republicans dislike the media even more. According to a 2015 Pew Research Center report, 17 percent of Republicans say the national news media ""has a positive effect on the way things are going in the country,"" compared with 33 percent of Democrats. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

Instead, we must choose to Believe In America. History is watching us now. We don't have much time, but history is watching. It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.

I am asking for your support tonight so I can be your champion in the White House. And I will be your champion.

My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: ""I'm With Her"". I choose to recite a different pledge.

[""I'm With Her"" started out as a hashtag and sometimes supporters do chant it at events, but the Clinton campaign doesn't ask supporters to pledge loyalty by reciting it. The campaign's current slogan is ""Stronger Together."" — Tamara Keith]

My pledge reads: ""I'M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.""

I am your voice. So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.

To all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Proud Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again.

God bless you, and goodnight. I love you."

Republican Donald Trump spoke at a press conference Wednesday morning, in which he said Russia should try to find thousands of deleted emails from his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's private system.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has now found himself in the middle of an email leak controversy. This is the scandal that the Democratic National Committee had to deal with before the Democratic Convention opened this week. Democrats had been pointing the finger at Russian hackers. President Obama even seemed to suggest that the breach was done to help Donald Trump.

Well, today Trump was asked about that at a press conference in Florida, and he tried to pivot to the controversy over Hillary Clinton's private email system.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.

SIEGEL: The Clinton campaign immediately accused Trump of encouraging Russian espionage against the Democratic candidate. NPR's Sarah McCammon is traveling with the Trump campaign. She's in Scranton, Pa., where he's scheduled a town hall this afternoon. Hi, Sarah.

SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi there.

SIEGEL: Has Donald Trump responded to this charge that he was actually encouraging the Russians to spy on Hillary Clinton?

MCCAMMON: You know, the response from him and his campaign has been what I would describe as mixed. So his spokesman, Jason Miller, you know, soon after this press conference this morning tried to clarify. He tweeted, quote, ""to be clear, Mr. Trump did not call on or invite Russia or anyone else to hack Hillary Clinton's emails today.""

But Robert it is worth pointing out that during that press conference, Trump was pressed by reporters on this point and did not step back. And then right after the presser, he tweeted, if Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI. So he seemed to be doubling down at that point.

His running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, also has released a statement on this subject. It said, I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences, meaning for the Russians, if they did it. That said, the Democrats are singularly focusing on who might behind it instead of what it exposed, saying that should disqualify Hillary Clinton from serving as president.

So you know, it depends on sort of who you ask at the Trump campaign. But I can say I was at that press conference. Trump looked right at the camera and said basically, Russia, go find those emails.

SIEGEL: In the past, Donald Trump has had some kind words for Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. What did he have to say today about Russia at his news conference?

MCCAMMON: Well, he downplayed any ties to Russia. He said he had, quote, ""zero ties"" to the Russian government and did talk about selling property to Russians in the United States. But he says, you know, he sells property to lots of people. In the press conference, Trump also said again that he hoped he could work with Putin and threw cold water on the idea that the Russian (inaudible) behind the DNC hack. You know, he said, I've never met Putin. I don't know who Putin is.

And it is worth pointing out though that both Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have traded some compliments with each other. But he said he wants to be friendly with Russia so that we can, quote, ""knock out ISIS together.""

SIEGEL: Now, Trump is campaigning this week pretty busily, even coming to the same state where the Democrats are holding their convention. How would you describe the Trump campaign's goal this week?

MCCAMMON: So they've been hitting the trail pretty hard. He and his running mate, Mike Pence, have been campaigning together and also fundraising, and he's been asked about that. It's sort of traditional for candidates to step back a little bit during the other party's convention. Hillary Clinton did a couple of events early last week.

But Trump said, you know - he was asked about this, and today in Scranton, he said, look; we're campaigning; we're out here because we want to make America great again. He got a really enthusiastic reception. He and Pence both have been in some key swing states, and then they're going to be splitting up tonight and hitting several more.

SIEGEL: OK. That's NPR's Sarah McCammon in Scranton, Pa., where Donald Trump has been campaigning today. Sarah, thanks.

MCCAMMON: Thank you.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images

The Green Party officially nominated Jill Stein for president and human rights activist Ajamu Baraka as her running mate on Saturday, at a convention in Houston that attracted many disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters.

Much of the three-day gathering was an explicit appeal to former backers of the Vermont senator to join their fold, and several speakers argued that Sanders had been treated unfairly by the Democratic Party.

""I want to thank Bernie Sanders supporters who refused to let the political revolution die,"" Stein said in her acceptance speech. ""We have a tremendous opportunity before us. The American people are longing for a change. They are ready to do something different, and we have to be the vehicle for that difference.""

She cast herself and the Green Party as the precursor to the Sanders movement, arguing they had first championed many of the same ideas that fueled his unlikely rise.

""We have been ahead of the curve in so many ways — on climate change, on green energy on demilitarization, on marriage equality, on free public higher education and canceling student debt, on stopping the [Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal]. On ending the war on drugs and the incarceration state, on providing reparations for slavery and to the indigenous people. On opposing war crimes committed by Saudi Arabia in Yemen and war crimes and occupation committed by the Israeli government in Palestine,"" Stein ticked off.

""And on so much more we have been ahead of the curve for decades, and all of a sudden that curve is catching up to us.""

Stein took aim equally at both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and GOP nominee Donald Trump. She told NPR in a brief interview after her nomination that she wasn't trying to be a spoiler candidate and backing her wasn't a wasted vote.

""If our voting system has no room for our values or for our moral compass, then we just keep getting more of this screwing that we've been getting by the two corporate political parties,"" Stein said in stark terms.

NPR's Jessica Taylor interviews Green Party nominee Jill Stein at her nominating convention in Houston. Posted by NPR Politics on Saturday, August 6, 2016

Throughout the day, chants of ""Jill Not Hill"" and ""No More War"" broke out. Many attendees also held up their own ""No TPP"" signs similar to ones that Sanders supporters waved as they disrupted the Democratic National Convention last month in Philadelphia.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spoke to the group via satellite from the Embassy of Ecuador in London, where he's been living for the past four years as he faces extradition to Sweden over sexual assault allegations. His group was responsible for posting more than 20,000 emails from the DNC showing they were trying to undermine Sanders.

The controversial figure was introduced as a ""hero,"" and after some technical problems getting the sound to work, he got some of the most rousing applause of the day as he condemned the major party's candidates in very graphic language.

You're asking me if I prefer cholera or gonorrhea.

""You're asking me if I prefer cholera or gonorrhea,"" he said when asked to choose between Clinton or Trump.

Dr. Cornel West, a social justice advocate and academic who was one of Sanders' most fervent surrogates, also cast the choice of either major party candidate as a horrific one.

""We understand the difference between a neo-fascist catastrophe and a neo-liberal disaster,"" West said in endorsing Stein.

There are some big hurdles for Stein before she can be a real factor on the ballot this fall. She needs to get to 15 percent to just make the debate stage, and right now she's polling at about 5 percent. But she points out that's much better than she was ever expected to do (four years ago she got just 0.36 percent of the vote), and with many former Sanders voters coming to her camp, she can only go up.

But while there was a vocal contingent of onetime Sanders lovers in Houston this weekend, it's not the mass exodus that Stein needs. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll this week shows Clinton has shored up support from 86 percent of former Sanders supporters.

Stein will have to tamp down some of her own controversies, too. She's a medical doctor, and in a Reddit AMA earlier this year, she seemed to raise questions about whether vaccines can cause autism — a link that has been disproved. She's walked that back somewhat, saying she's simply skeptical of the FDA approval process, but she seems to have been trying to woo some anti-vaccinators to her side as well.

She's also pointed to some studies that raised questions about the effects of Wi-Fi on children's brains, saying that a regulatory agency should look at the issue.

The three-day convention wasn't without its flashpoints either. As the roll call vote began, candidate Sedinam Kinamo Christin Moyowasifza-Curry rose to complain that she was being discriminated against during the process as a black Muslim woman, and had been left off the voting slate. She said the party needed a more diverse nominee than the 66-year-old Stein, whom she had called a ""privileged older woman"" in a press conference earlier Saturday.

As she walked away from the roll call vote after speaking, she literally dropped the mic with a thud that reverberated throughout the auditorium."

Enlarge this image toggle caption John Raoux/AP John Raoux/AP

Libertarian Party candidates Gary Johnson and Bill Weld pitched themselves as the antidote to Washington partisanship in a CNN town hall, hoping to appeal to voters frustrated with both the Republican and the Democratic presidential nominees.

Both are former Republican governors — Johnson from New Mexico and Weld from Massachusetts — and told CNN's Anderson Cooper they align with most voters on both fiscal and social issues.

""We want the government out of your pocketbook and out of your bedroom, and the polling shows that a majority of Americans think that,"" said Weld, the party's vice presidential nominee.

Johnson, who ran for the GOP nomination in 2012 before becoming the Libertarian nominee four years ago, said if they are elected, the two longtime lawmakers will almost act as co-presidents — sharing a staff and ""planning to do this as a partnership.""

""Two heads for the price of one, and that it would be a plus for the country, believing that,"" the former New Mexico governor said.

""I think it would be refreshing to have a party that was not terribly partisan holding the White House, and we would hire the best people from the Democratic Party, the smartest people from the Republican Party and the best people from the Libertarian Party,"" Weld added.

The two bemoaned the rules that, as of now, would keep them off the presidential debate stage come this fall. A third-party candidate must hit at least 15 percent in polling, and the Libertarian ticket is at 9 percent in the latest CNN/ORC poll. The Green Party's Jill Stein is at 5 percent in that same survey.

A third-party candidate hasn't made it onto the stage since independent Ross Perot in 1992, but with both Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton still struggling to unite their parties' bases while being dragged down by high disapproval ratings, there is a rare opening. And Johnson and Weld are aiming to fill that void.

""The idea that we should not be at those debates expressing what is a majority point of view in the country can only be laid at the door of the two-party monopoly, the duopoly, that has a stranglehold on power in Washington,"" Weld said. ""That's the Rs and the Ds, who sometimes seem to exist mainly for the express purpose of killing each other.""

Johnson stood by his characterization that Clinton was ""beholden"" to special interests and slammed her high fees for speaking to Wall Street groups. He argued there is a conflict of interest between the former secretary of state and her family's Clinton Foundation that ""smacks of pay-to-play.""

But Weld had harsher words for Trump and the way the GOP candidate has reacted to criticism from the family of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq.

""He's a showman. He's a pied piper. He's the music man,"" Weld said about the billionaire real estate magnate. ""More recently, it's gotten more serious, and the noun that comes to my mind is a screw loose.""

Johnson dismissed the idea that they would play spoiler this fall, though.

""A wasted vote is voting for somebody that you don't believe in, and if we're going to continue to vote for the lesser of two evils, that's still evil,"" he told a questioner.

Johnson did depart from typical libertarian orthodoxy in one instance. Previously, he has said that ""religious freedom, as a category"" was ""a black hole,"" and he said he wouldn't back any state religious freedom laws, such as ones that would protect people like wedding photographers or bakers from having to provide services for a gay wedding.

""I fear that under the guise of religious liberty, the LGBT community is being discriminated against,"" Johnson said. ""There can be a balance between the two, but I don't want to support discrimination in any form whatsoever.""

Shetamia Taylor, a woman who was wounded in the Dallas police attack last month, asked Johnson about the Black Lives Matter movement. And the Libertarian nominee gave a rare acknowledgement that, as a white man, he had been slow to realize there was a problem between minorities and law enforcement.

""My head's been in the sand on this. I think we've all had our heads in the sand, and let's wake up,"" Johnson said. ""This discrimination does exist.""

On the subject of foreign policy, Johnson said the two weren't pushing for an isolationist approach, simply one that was more hesitant to enter into foreign skirmishes.

""We both reject the notion that libertarians are isolationists,"" Johnson said. ""We're not isolationists. We're non-interventionists. We don't want to get involved in regime change that has the potential to make the world less safe."""

Updated at 9 p.m. ET

Donald Trump has been saying for months that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton wants to ""abolish the Second Amendment,"" but now the Republican presidential nominee has gone even further.

At a rally in Wilmington, N.C., on Tuesday afternoon, Trump repeated that charge and then appeared to many observers to suggest taking up arms against his rival.

""Hillary wants to abolish — essentially abolish — the Second Amendment,"" Trump said. ""If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don't know.""

You can watch that portion of Trump's speech here:

C-SPAN YouTube

The response from Clinton and her supporters was swift. In an interview with the public radio program Texas Standard, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine said, ""There is absolutely no place, there should be no place in our politics for somebody who wants to be a leader to say something even in an offhand way that is connected to inciting violence.""

Almost immediately after Trump spoke, the pro-Clinton superPAC Priorities USA Action emailed out a clip of Trump's comments with the subject heading, ""Donald Trump Just Suggested That Someone Shoot Hillary Clinton,"" plus a one-sentence message: ""THIS IS NOT OK.""

Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement, ""This is simple — what Trump is saying is dangerous. A person seeking to be president of the United States should not suggest violence in any way.""

But the Trump campaign was quick to dispute that interpretation. In an emailed statement with the subject line, ""Trump Campaign Statement on Dishonest Media,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said:

""It's called the power of unification — 2nd Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power. And this year, they will be voting in record numbers, and it won't be for Hillary Clinton, it will be for Donald Trump.""

Trump reiterated that explanation in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Tuesday: ""This is a political movement. This is a strong, powerful movement, the Second Amendment. You know, Hillary wants to take your guns away.""

Fox News YouTube

CNN commentator and Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany explained it this way:

""I think he's referring to the fact that the National Rifle Association is the most powerful lobby, hands-down, in the United States. So if anyone can stop a very anti-Second Amendment agenda, it would be the NRA and the Second Amendment folks.""

Clinton has not called for abolishing the Second Amendment. What she has called for is tougher gun regulations — including expanded background checks and allowing families of victims of gun violence to sue gun manufacturers or dealers.

Hillary Clinton's Twitter account sent out a message from former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was badly injured in a shooting at a constituent outreach event she held in Tucson, Ariz., in 2011 that killed six people.

The U.S. Secret Service, charged with protecting both nominees, said on Tuesday evening that it was ""aware"" of Trump's comments, but the agency did not comment further."

If it's Friday in politics, there's the potential for a news dump.

This Friday, that means tax returns. The Clinton campaign, in an effort to pressure Donald Trump into releasing his taxes, released the Clintons' 2015 numbers. The Clintons made $10.6 million combined, mostly from speeches, and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent. Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Tim Kaine, also released 10 years' returns. In 2015, Kaine made about $313,000 and paid a 16.1 percent tax rate. (Here are all the tax returns released by the Clinton campaign.)

Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have already released tax returns dating to the 1970s given their long history in public life. The Clintons, in June of last year, released the previous eight years of returns. Here's some of what we found out from those, as reported by NPR's Scott Horsley:

It has become tradition in U.S. presidential politics that the party standard-bearers release their tax returns. In fact, every major-party nominee in recent history has done so. Trump, though, has declined to follow suit. Why? Trump says he is being audited by the IRS and won't release his taxes until that audit is done. But there's nothing preventing Trump from releasing his taxes while under audit, a point the Clinton campaign and its supporters have pressed, arguing that Trump must be hiding something.

It's possible Trump pays $0 in taxes, or close to it, the New York Times reported, because of deductions for real estate developers. There's some history of that for Trump, who ""reported losses and paid no federal income tax in 1978 and 1979 and paid only modest sums — a total of less than $75,000 — for the prior three years,"" the Times wrote.

Trump himself fueled that speculation when he told ABC's George Stephanopoulos in May, ""I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.""

ABC News via YouTube

That Americans demand that the people who run for president serve up what amounts to a financial colonoscopy is something of an odd, voyeuristic tradition. (You can read all of the released tax returns from past presidents and vice presidents and the current 2016 field here at the Tax History Project's archive. Candidates are also required under federal law to release financial disclosures that show ranges of the worth of assets and debts.)

Below are three reasons we care about what's in those tax returns — and a little history of where this tradition came from.

First, A Little History

It's a political cliche to say that if you want a friend in Washington get a dog.

And the origin of politicians releasing their tax returns goes back to Richard Nixon — and his cocker spaniel.

Nixon, running as Eisenhower's vice president in 1952, was accused of financial wrongdoing ""related to a fund established by political backers to pay for campaign expenses,"" Joseph J. Thorndike of the Tax History Project wrote in 2012.

Nixon admitted to taking one gift — Checkers, the family dog — from a donor. ""[T]he kids, like all kids, love the dog,"" Nixon said, ""and I just want to say this, right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we're gonna keep it.""

What's become known as Nixon's ""Checkers speech"" was all an attempt to clear his name. He challenged the Democratic Party ticket, headed by Adlai Stevenson, to ""make a complete financial statement as to their financial history,"" as he believed he had.

If they didn't, Nixon alleged, it would be proof ""they have something to hide."" So Stevenson and his running mate, Alabama Sen. John Sparkman, released a decade of their tax returns. Eisenhower, the guy at the top of the ticket with Nixon, even released a summary of his own taxes.

Nixon, though, did not.

The practice of releasing taxes didn't become tradition until 21 years later — again involving Nixon. PolitiFact wrote:

""The IRS audited Nixon in 1973, when questions bubbled up about a fishy charitable donation and speculation that Nixon had tried to game the tax system, according to a paper prepared for the United States Capitol Historical Society. (This happened around the same time as the Watergate investigation but was a separate issue.) Nixon said one of his most well-known lines amid this scandal: 'People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I am not a crook'. ""Nixon eventually released a slew of financial information to the public in December 1973, including the previous four years of tax returns, to try to quell the criticism. He asked a congressional committee to examine them, too. However, the congressional investigation ultimately found that Nixon owed $476,431 (approximately $2.3 million in today's dollars) in unpaid taxes and accrued interest. Oops.""

From that point on, tax-return disclosure became the norm for people wanting to be president.

Reasons We Care

1. Conflicts of interest: Almost every candidate who runs for public office is fairly wealthy. (Even the candidates who have the government pay their salary, like Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, make far more money than the average American.) Because of that wealth, how they made their money (we'll get to heart in a second) can tell you whether they have potential conflicts of interest — who they made that money from.

Trump's business interests all over the world could become entangled with presidential politics. Just look at his response to Brexit — that the dropping euro could be good for tourism to places like his Scottish golf course. For the Clintons, the Clinton foundation could also raise the issue of conflicts of interest as it raises gobs of money from foreign entities. Would some of those governments expect special treatment from a second President Clinton? A look at recently released emails from her time at the State Department — and what aides did for big Clinton foundation donors — gives people reason to question.

2. Do they have heart? Tax returns tell us how much candidates give to charity. The Clintons, as noted above, gave between 8 and 15 percent — or about $15 million total — during that eight-year period. Most of that went through the Clinton Family Foundation, as The Atlantic reported. They also contributed to the Nelson Mandela Foundation, First United Methodist Church and the Humana Challenge golf tournament.

People could have questions about why so much of their money went to their own foundation — and whether that's really in the spirit of giving. For Trump, on the other hand, it took a Washington Post investigation to unearth that he hadn't given $1 million to veterans' charities, as he had promised after a fundraiser he held earlier this year (an event he held in competition with a debate he decided not to attend because he was upset that Fox News' Megyn Kelly was moderating). Trump eventually laid out how much was raised and allocated in a testy news conference. So is criticism of Trump unfair? Is he really quietly a very charitable person — or not? Tax returns would reveal that.

3. Are they like us? Again, these candidates are much wealthier than the average American. Median household income in this country is $53,482, according to the census. The Clintons made $28 million in 2014 (mostly from speeches). They also live in a posh New York suburb, Chappaqua, where they bought their home for $1.7 million in 1999 just before leaving the White House. (In 2016 money, that appreciates to about $2.5 million.) The average home price in the U.S. in June 2016 was $358,000 (median home price was $307,000).

Trump, of course, makes it a point to say he's ""really rich,"" claiming he's worth $9 billion. Trump's net worth is something of a mystery. He says it fluctuates even based on his own ""feelings."" The Washington Post reported this week on a 2007 deposition that caught Trump in repeated lies and exaggerations when it came to his wealth and earnings. His tax returns would certainly clarify whether he is as rich as he says.

There's also the business of tax rates. The Clintons have paid a fairly high tax rate over the years. Trump, on the other hand, has boasted that, ""I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible"" and called his tax rate ""none of your business."" But when a candidate fights hard to pay less in taxes than most people, especially when he is uber-rich, that can be a political problem. That was certainly the case in 2012, when the Obama campaign and its outside group allies were able to paint Mitt Romney as someone who got away with paying less in taxes. (Romney paid an effective tax rate of 14 percent because so much of his income came from dividends and capital gains.)"

Is Donald Trump considering wavering on a key campaign promise?

That's what several news reports published over the weekend suggest. And while the Trump campaign issued a statement denying any shift on immigration policy, top surrogates and campaign operatives hinted that a change just might be on its way.

You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely.

The issue: what to do with the estimated 11 million immigrants already living in the United States illegally.

Since he entered the presidential race last year, Trump insisted they would have to be expelled from the country, despite the logistical and humanitarian questions a mass deportation would present.

""You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely,"" he told MSNBC in November 2015.

But this weekend, Buzzfeed reported that during a meeting with a Hispanic advisory council, Trump hinted he wasn't totally attached to that proposal. People who attended the meeting told the website that Trump asked for suggestions on a ""humane and efficient"" way to address people already living in the country illegally. Other news outlets confirmed the conversations.

Univision went one step further, reporting that Trump will roll out a new immigration plan Thursday in Colorado ""that will include finding a way to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants.""

That's something the campaign immediately pushed back on. ""Mr. Trump said nothing today that he hasn't said many times before, including in his convention speech,"" said Trump campaign staffer Steven Cheung in a statement provided to NPR.

And yet, when asked on CNN the next day whether Trump's immigration policies would include that promised ""deportation force,"" Trump's new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, responded, ""To be determined.""

On CBS News' Face the Nation, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions said Trump is ""wrestling with how to do that,"" referring to removing people in the country illegally.

""He did not make a firm commitment yesterday or at the meeting the other day about what he will do with that,"" Sessions said. ""But he did listen, and he's talking about it.""

A major shift on immigration policy would be the clearest signal yet that, faced with widening deficits in most national and state-level polls, the Trump campaign is now making a concerted effort to appeal to moderate and independent voters.

But a shift would carry major political risks, too. Immigration is a key issue — if not the key issue — for many of Trump's fiercest supporters. And it's been a hallmark of Trump's campaign since day one, when he warned that people entering the country from Mexico were ""bringing drugs; they're bringing crime; they're rapists.""

Trump has also framed himself as a no-apologies ""truth"" teller, who will push for what he thinks is best regardless of the political consequences. Walking back from a high-profile promise could undermine that image.

Trump's campaign never provided details about what that deportation force would look like or how it would track down and expel people in the country illegally. But Trump stuck to the promise.

""We have no choice if we're going to run our country properly and if we're going to be a country,"" he said in a December debate.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich questioned Trump's proposal during that forum, saying, ""Come on, folks. We all know you can't pick them up and ship them across — back across the border. It's a silly argument. It's not an adult argument. It makes no sense.""

Trump responded by citing a controversial Eisenhower administration initiative called ""Operation Wetback,"" which deported up to 1.5 million immigrants who were living in the United States illegally.

Trump's response to terrorism has centered on immigration as well. After the mass shootings at Orlando's Pulse nightclub in June, Trump reiterated his call for a temporary ban on all Muslims immigrating to the United States. That's despite the fact that the shooter was born in New York City.

""The only reason the killer was in America in the first place is because we allowed his family to come here,"" Trump said in his first speech after the attacks. ""That is a fact — and a fact we need to talk about.""

At nearly every campaign rally, supporters chant ""Build that wall! Build that wall!"" referencing Trump's promise to erect a wall along the entirety of the United States-Mexico border.

""We will build a wall, don't you worry,"" Trump assured the crowd Friday evening at a Michigan rally."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mike Segar /Reuters /Landov Mike Segar /Reuters /Landov

Update at 8:40 a.m. ET. Jobless Claims Went Up; So Two Out Of Three Reports Were Positive:

There were 372,000 first-time claims for unemployment insurance last week, up by 10,000 from the week before, the Employment and Training Administration says. What's more, that previous week's total was revised up from the previous estimate of 350,000.

The relatively negative news about jobless claims means that two out of this morning's three employment-related reporters were positive. As we reported earlier, the ADP National Employment Report showed a much larger than expected gain of 215,000 jobs in private sector payrolls last month. Also, the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that the number of layoffs announced in 2012 was the lowest for any year since 1997.

Friday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is due to release the week's big employment report. It will tell us what the unemployment rate was in December and how many jobs were added to payrolls last month.

According to Bloomberg News, economists expect to hear that there were 150,000 jobs added to public and private payrolls in December — about the same as the 146,000 added in November. They also expect to hear that the nation's unemployment rate stated at 7.7 percent.

Update at 8:20 a.m. ET. Hiring Picked Up In December:

The morning's second employment-related report also brings at least modestly good news.

""Private sector employment increased by 215,000 jobs from November to December,"" according to the latest ADP National Employment Report. That's well above what economists expected to hear: a gain of about 130,000.

And ADP revised up its figure on growth in November, to a gain of 148,000 jobs — vs. its original estimate of 118,000.

The ADP report, a private survey done by that company and Moody's Analytics, is sometimes a sign of what the Bureau of Labor Statistics will say when it releases its figures on monthly job growth. As we said earlier, BLS is due to release its December data on Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET.

We'll update this post again when we see the figures on last week's claims for unemployment benefits. They're due at 8:30 a.m. ET.

Our original post:

There's some good news this morning about the labor market.

The number of layoffs announced by U.S. companies plunged in December, a new report signals. Also, the number of layoffs announced in 2012 was the lowest for any year since 1997.

That news from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas is the first of three jobs-related reports due this morning. In the next hour, we're due to get the ADP National Employment Report about hiring at private companies last month and the Employment and Training Administration's latest figures on first-time claims for unemployment benefits. We'll update with highlights from those reports.

According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas:

-- ""After three consecutive months of increased layoff activity, the number of planned job cuts announced in December plunged to 32,556, the second lowest monthly total of 2012"" and down from 57,081 in November.

-- ""Due in large part to the slow pace of downsizing in the third quarter, annual job cuts totaled 523,362, which is the lowest year-end total since 1997, when employers announced 434,350 job cuts during the year. The 2012 total was 14 percent lower than the 606,082 job cuts announced in 2011.""

-- "" 'We have not seen this [lower] level of job cutting since before the dot.com collapse and subsequent 2001 recession,' said John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas.""

It was tense even before they started. Reporters tweeted that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump entered the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner from separate sides of the room, and didn't even shake hands (which at this point really isn't a surprise).

But there was hope that Thursday night's event could serve as a comedic salve for the nation following three decidedly nasty presidential debates. The fundraising event for Catholic charities — now in its 71st year — traditionally is a time for the candidates to offer jokes about themselves and their opponent.

Trump spoke first, and it was hard at times to tell if he was joking. Trump complained about all the politicians who loved him, his money and his endorsements before he decided to run for president. ""Suddenly, [they] decided when I ran for president as a Republican that I've always been a no-good, rotten, disgusting scoundrel. And they totally forgot about me."" And he continued, to silence from the crowd, ""but that's OK.""

Some of Trump's jokes resonated, such as his crack about Clinton's ongoing email server saga. ""And even tonight, with all of the heated back and forth between my opponent and me at the debate last night, we have proven that we can actually be civil with each other. In fact, just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me, and she very civilly said, 'Pardon me.' ""

It was a direct reference to the FBI's decision to not charge Clinton over her use of a private email server — and Trump's claims that he'd prosecute her over the matter if he becomes president. He continued, ""And I very politely replied, 'Let me talk to you about that after I get into office.' ""

Trump also joked about calling Hillary Clinton a ""nasty woman"" at their final debate Wednesday in Las Vegas. ""But this stuff is all relative,"" he said. ""After listening to Hillary rattle on and on and on, I don't think so badly of Rosie O'Donnell anymore,"" another famous woman he's previously disparaged.

The Republican nominee even scored laughter at the expense of his wife, Melania, who drew sharp criticism after she plagiarized portions of a Michelle Obama speech in her 2016 address to the Republican National Convention. ""Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it, it's fantastic,"" Trump said. ""They think she's absolutely great. My wife, Melania, gives the exact same speech, and people get on her case!""

But then things went south. Trump called Clinton corrupt several times, and not in a joking kind of way. ""Hillary believes that it's vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private."" That remark drew boos.

And there were even more boos when Trump alluded to recent emails dumped by WikiLeaks showing Clinton staffers disparaging conservative Catholics. ""Here she is tonight, in public, pretending not to hate Catholics.""

Clinton, as she's known to do, smiled throughout. But when it was her turn she also let her opponent have it, ribbing him over his recent allegations that the election might be rigged, and that he may not accept the results of the vote. ""It's amazing I'm up here after Donald,"" Clinton said. ""I didn't think he'd be OK with a peaceful transition of power.""

She mocked Trump for talking over her during the debates. She mocked Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, for defending Trump to no end, saying she'd enjoy listening to Trump's VP pick denying Trump ever gave his Al Smith Dinner speech. She mocked Trump on the way he talks about women's looks, saying he'd rank the Statue of Liberty ""a four, maybe a five if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.""

The Clinton line that drew the most laughs might have been her take on Trump's debate performance and the drama he provided before it even started. ""Sharing a stage with Donald Trump is like, well, nothing really comes to mind,"" Clinton said. ""Donald wanted me drug tested before last night's debate. ... I am so flattered that Donald thought I used some sort of performance enhancer. Now, actually, I did. It's called preparation.""

After pausing for laughter, Clinton added, ""And looking back, I've had to listen to Donald for three full debates, and he says I don't have any stamina!""

One needed much stamina to endure the night's sometimes cringe-worthy moments. Though Trump provided almost all of them, Clinton's more traditional speech couldn't lift the awkward mood of the event. If the Al Smith Dinner in previous years has served as a respite from bitter campaign seasons, this year it may have failed to do so.

There was at least one bright spot, though. Before the event was done, Clinton and Trump did shake hands. The development was announced from the stage, to applause."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP

The cost of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act is expected to rise an average of 22 percent in 2017, according to information released by the Obama administration Monday afternoon.

Still, federal subsidies will also rise, meaning that few people are likely to have to pay the full cost after the rate increases to get insurance coverage.

""We think they will ultimately be surprised by the affordability of the premiums, because the tax credits track with the increases in premiums,"" said Kevin Griffis, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services.

The 22 percent rise reflects the average for all insurance marketplaces, both federal and state-based exchanges for which data are available. For insurance purchased through the federal HealthCare.gov exchange the rise will average 25 percent.

During a media briefing Monday, Griffis said the 2017 rates are roughly at the level the Congressional Budget Office forecast when the law was proposed. ""The initial marketplace rates came in below costs,"" he said. ""Many companies set prices that turned out to be too low.""

Enrollment opens Nov. 1. For coverage effective Jan. 1, people need to pick a plan by Dec. 15. With a few exceptions, the last day to sign up for Obamacare is Jan. 31, 2017. Plans are available on HealthCare.gov and state-run exchanges.

While the average premiums on the benchmark health plans are increasing, the government says more than 70 percent of people buying insurance on the marketplaces created by the law could get a health plan for less than $75 a month for 2017. To get the best deal, people would have to pick a low-cost plan with limited benefits and take advantage of all the subsidies available.

People who already have coverage through the exchanges can often save money by switching plans, the administration said. More than three-quarters of people could save money by switching to the lowest-cost plan within the level of coverage, such as bronze or silver, that they've previously selected.

The Obamacare insurance exchanges are under strain after three major insurers pulled back from offering coverage in markets across the U.S. The administration says about 1 in 5 people buying insurance through the marketplaces will have only one company offering coverage.

It's in places like that where consumers will feel the most pain. ""Where it really matters is where a big insurance company has exited and where that's going to leave just one company remaining,"" said Cynthia Cox, associate director of health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""For those people who live in that area, many people may have to switch plans. And they won't have much choice if they want to receive financial assistance and purchase through the exchanges."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP

President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Wilbur Ross Jr., a billionaire investor and turnaround specialist, as his commerce secretary.

Ross announced his selection Wednesday during a joint CNBC interview with longtime Wall Street banker Steve Mnuchin, Trump's pick for Treasury secretary.

""Wilbur Ross is a champion of American manufacturing and knows how to help companies succeed,"" Trump said in a statement announcing his choice.

""Wilbur knows that cutting taxes for working families, reducing burdensome government regulations and unleashing America's energy resources will strengthen our economy at a time when our country needs to see significant growth.""

Ross, 79, is a donor and longtime associate of Trump's, having helped him resurrect his casino company after it went bankrupt in the early 1990s.

Over the years, Ross has grown rich by buying troubled companies in industries such as steel, textiles, auto parts and coal and restructuring them, often with significant layoffs and budget cuts. He is said by Forbes to be worth $2.9 billion, making him the country's 232nd richest person.

In 2002, he cobbled together several troubled steel companies to create the International Steel Group. He later sold the company to Mittal Steel in the Netherlands.

As The New York Times reported, ""Some businesses where he has invested, like textile mills, have struggled. But other investments have salvaged industry and jobs while providing a lucrative payday.""

In 2008, Ross told NPR's Steve Inskeep:

""One of the problems with industries that have been in relatively long-term declines is that very often, the managements in those industries develop a kind of loser mentality. And when you ask them what's wrong with the business, they'll point to extraneous forces. ""It'll be the fault of the unions, or it'll be the fault of China or the fault of the government or the fault of the class-action people. So rather than dealing with the things that may be within their own control, they kind of sit around sulking about things that are fundamentally out of their control.""

Ross is the chairman and chief strategy officer, as well as the founder, of the private equity firm WL Ross and Co. He later sold the company to Invesco but is still involved with it.

Among the darker chapters in his career was his involvement with the Sago Mine in West Virginia. Shortly after his company purchased the mine, an explosion there killed 12 miners.

A former Democrat, Ross has been a loyal Trump supporter who shares his skepticism about trade agreements and said in a June interview with CNBC that the U.S. needs a ""more radical, new approach to government.""

His second of three wives was former New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey, who authored several articles widely thought to have helped kill off Hillary Clinton's attempt at health care reform in the 1990s.

In Wednesday's statement, Trump also announced that he's selected Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts for the job of deputy commerce secretary."

Nancy Pelosi beat back her toughest challenge yet to her leadership of Democrats in the House of Representatives, defeating Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan to secure another term as House minority leader.

The California Democrat got 134 votes to Ryan's 63 in a secret ballot vote on Wednesday. Pelosi had boasted going into the vote that she had support from two-thirds of the caucus, and she received just over that amount.

Pelosi, 76, has held the top slot in House Democratic leadership since 2003. She became the first female speaker of the House in history when Democrats won control of Congress in 2006. But since they suffered devastating losses in 2010, the liberal San Francisco congresswoman has faced questions about whether she's the best one to lead the minority party in the House.

After Democrats lost 63 seats in 2010, she faced a challenge from then-North Carolina Rep. Heath Shuler, who drew 43 votes. Ryan's 63 votes is the most serious defection she has faced.

The debate over who was best to lead the House Democrats, who are now entering their sixth year in the minority, was emblematic of the larger debate over the direction of the party after Hillary Clinton suffered a surprising and stinging loss in the presidential race to Donald Trump. House Democrats had hoped to pick up as many as 15 or 20 seats to cut into Republicans' 30-seat edge. Instead, they flipped only six seats, a disappointing showing to many Democrats.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Trump's upset came after he was able to win narrow victories in a handful of Rust Belt states, such as Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan, delivering him the Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. Many of the seats Democrats were unable to win back also came in more working class, rural areas of those states. Ryan argued that the party needed someone who understands blue collar voters as well as new, younger blood in leadership. The 43-year-old Democrat argued he was better equipped to do that, coming from the manufacturing hub of Youngstown, Ohio.

Ryan's home county had even flipped to Trump by six points after previously voting for President Obama by 22 points just four years ago. Pelosi mocked that loss in an interview with the Huffington Post, saying he ""didn't even carry his district for Hillary Clinton."" But others saw it as a sign that Ryan was the type of Democrat who could win over working class voters better than someone from ultra-liberal San Francisco."

A police officer was shot and killed Sunday in San Antonio in an apparent ambush-style slaying, authorities say. A suspect is still at large.

Separately, an apparent ambush the same day in St. Louis left a police officer in critical condition. A suspect in that incident was later killed.

Two other officers also were shot and wounded on Sunday — one in Gladstone, Mo., in an encounter with a suspect who was shot and killed, and one in Sanibel, Fla., during a traffic stop.

Joey Palacios of Texas Public Radio reports that the fatal attack in San Antonio occurred during a traffic stop that morning, when 50-year-old Detective Benjamin Marconi was shot in his patrol car.

""The 20-year police veteran was killed outside of the San Antonio Police headquarters after pulling over a vehicle just before noon,"" Palacios reports. ""While parked, a black Mitsubishi Galant drove up behind him. The driver of that car got out, approached the driver's side of Marconi's patrol car and opened fire, shooting him twice in the head. Marconi died at a nearby military hospital.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption San Antonio Police Department via AP San Antonio Police Department via AP

The suspect is still at large, and a manhunt is currently under way. San Antonio police released a photo of a black man in his 20s and said they are still looking for the Mitsubishi Galant, as well as for any witnesses to the shooting.

In St. Louis, a police sergeant was shot twice in the face while sitting in his patrol car, The Associated Press reports.

""The officer was not involved in a call or a traffic stop but was sitting in traffic about 7:30 p.m. Sunday when another car pulled up alongside his marked police vehicle,"" the AP writes. Police Chief Sam Dotson says the 46-year-old officer was shot by an individual in the other car, who shot out the patrol car's window.

The officer was in critical condition but is expected to survive. A male suspect, who police say was wanted for violent crimes and might have feared recognition, was subsequently killed in a shootout with police, the AP writes. Neither the officer nor the suspect has been identified.

In Sanibel, a police officer was wounded in a drive-by shooting around 8 p.m. ET on Sunday. The officer was sitting in his patrol car after a routine traffic stop, according to the local newspaper The News-Press.

The officer was treated at a hospital and released. Other police officers exchanged fire with a suspect, who is now in custody, according to The News-Press.

Local police tell the paper this is the first time a police officer on Sanibel — an island near Fort Myers that is popular with tourists — has been shot in the line of duty.

And then on Sunday evening in Missouri, an officer in Gladstone was shot in a struggle after a traffic stop, The Kansas City Star reports.

""According to Kansas City police, who were called to assist Gladstone police, a passenger ran from the vehicle after it was stopped about 10:30 p.m. Sunday. Officers pursued the suspect on foot and attempted to take the person into custody. Police say a struggle followed and the suspect produced a handgun,"" the Star writes. ""Shots were fired and the officer received non-life-threatening injuries and the suspect was shot and killed.""

It's not clear whether the attacks in Sanibel and Gladstone were targeted police attacks, like authorities say the St. Louis shooting and San Antonio killing were.

As the AP notes:

""The attacks on police came less than five months after a gunman killed five officers in Dallas who were working a protest about the fatal police shootings of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana. It was the deadliest day for American law enforcement since Sept. 11, 2001. ""Ten days after the Dallas attack, a man wearing a ski mask and armed with two rifles and a pistol killed three officers near a gas station and convenience store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. And earlier this month, two Des Moines, Iowa-area police officers were fatally shot in separate ambush-style attacks while sitting in their patrol cars.""

In 2015, according to FBI data, four law enforcement officers were killed in ambushes and three died in unprovoked attacks, out of 41 total officers ""feloniously killed."" Six officers were killed in connection with a traffic stop or pursuit.

President-elect Donald Trump wants to clip the wings of a new Air Force One, saying the customized 747 is too expensive.

""The plane is totally out of control,"" Trump told reporters Tuesday morning. ""I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.""

Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted that the new aircraft would cost more than $4 billion and urged the government to cancel the contract. Neither Trump nor his spokespeople said where that cost estimate came from.

Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016

Trump's tweet followed an article in the Chicago Tribune suggesting Trump's tough talk on trade could be bad for Boeing's export business.

Last year the Air Force struck an agreement with Boeing to deliver two new 747s around 2024, by which time the two planes now in service for presidential travel will be more than 30 years old. The new models will be able to fly about 1,000 miles farther than the current planes. They'll also be slightly larger and faster, but will have a smaller carbon footprint.

""The presidential aircraft is one of the most visible symbols of the United States of America and the office of the president of the United States,"" Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said at the time.

While affordability was listed as a top concern for the Air Force, the presidential planes include special features that drive up the cost, including secure communications equipment, counterterrorism features and capability for in-flight refueling.

The Air Force says it is still defining what it wants the planes to do and how much it's willing to pay. The military has budgeted $2.7 billion for research and development on the project, but says it expects that number to change as the process moves forward.

So far, Boeing is only contracted for $170 million to determine the capabilities of the new planes.

""We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,"" the company said in a statement.

Similar concerns were raised in the early weeks of the Obama administration over costs for a new fleet of presidential helicopters. That $13 billion project was eventually canceled, but not before Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., needled the new president over the high price tag.

Obama agreed the effort to upgrade Marine One was too extravagant.

""The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me,"" Obama said at the time. ""Of course, I've never had a helicopter before, you know? Maybe I've been deprived and didn't know it."""

Time magazine has named President-elect Donald Trump as the 2016 Person of the Year, a title Trump called ""a tremendous honor"" in an interview on the Today show.

Trump was selected from a shortlist that included prior winners Mark Zuckerberg and Vladimir Putin, as well as first-time candidates the Flint water crisis whistleblowers and Beyoncé Knowles.

Previous winners include Pope Francis and Pope John Paul II, groundbreaking scientists and groups or archetypes such as ""the protester"" and ""Ebola fighters."" But the award isn't always an honor: Adolf Hitler was Person of the Year in 1938, and Joseph Stalin was given the title twice.

Time says the title is awarded to ""the person or persons who most affected the news and our lives, for good or ill, and embodied what was important about the year, for better or for worse,"" as then-Managing Editor Walter Isaacson wrote in 1998.

""So which is it this year: Better or worse?"" Nancy Gibbs writes in Time. ""The challenge for Donald Trump is how profoundly the country disagrees about the answer.""

In an essay on Trump, Time writes that he ""has upended the leadership of both major political parties and effectively shifted the political direction of the international order.""

The magazine also notes that it's continuing a recent trend by naming the president-elect Person of the Year: Barack Obama was given the title in 2012 and 2008, and George W. Bush in 2004 and 2000."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images

President Obama has ordered the intelligence community to conduct a ""full review"" of ""malicious cyber activity"" timed to U.S. elections, the White House said Friday.

The review will go all the way back to the 2008 campaign when China was found to have hacked both the Obama and McCain campaigns, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said at a Friday press briefing.

In the 2016 election, U.S. intelligence officials charged that Russia had interfered. In early October, they released a strongly worded statement saying they were ""confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations."" The statement went on to say ""these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.""

Shortly after that, WikiLeaks began posting emails hacked from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta's Gmail account. The slow drip of those emails, including transcripts of Clinton's remarks to Goldman Sachs, hung over the campaign in its closing weeks and proved embarrassing at times. Podesta said he spoke to the FBI about the hacking, and intelligence experts blamed Russia for that as well.

""We may be in, have crossed into a new threshold,"" said Lisa Monaco, the White House homeland security adviser, at a breakfast Friday morning hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, of the 2016 hacking. ""It is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some after action, to understand what this means, what has happened and to impart those lessons learned, and that's what we're going to go about doing.""

Schultz said the review would look at ""all foreign actors and any attempt to interfere with our elections."" He added, ""This isn't going to be a narrow dive; this is going to be a deep dive"" into this troubling pattern.

He also noted the White House will aim to release as much of the review as it can appropriately to the public and will also brief Congress and other stakeholders.

This news comes as Republican members of Congress are promising their own investigations into Russian hacking around the election. But all of that would be in direct conflict with the view of President-elect Donald Trump, who, in a debate earlier this year, questioned whether Russia was even behind it.

""I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China, could also be lots of other people,"" Trump said. ""It also could be somebody sitting on the bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?""

In a recent interview with Time magazine, Trump went further, saying, ""I don't believe they interfered.""

Schultz deflected when asked whether Obama had let Trump know he was ordering this review.

The review is due to be completed before Jan. 20, when Trump takes office."

NPR via YouTube

President Obama says the United States will respond to Russian cyberattacks that the intelligence community has concluded were part of an effort to influence the 2016 presidential election.

In an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep that is airing Friday on Morning Edition, Obama said, ""I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections ... we need to take action. And we will — at a time and place of our own choosing. Some of it may be explicit and publicized; some of it may not be.""

Obama tells NPR ""we will"" respond to Russian hacking Listen · 0:29 0:29

U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that hackers working for Russia hacked into the Democratic National Committee's computer network, as well as the private email of John Podesta, a top adviser to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

Russia responded Friday morning. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesman, said the U.S. needs to show some proof or quit talking. ""It is necessary to either stop talking about it, or finally produce some evidence,"" he told Interfax, per the New York Times. ""Otherwise, it all begins to look quite unseemly.""

With the question of Russia's ultimate motivation for the hack becoming increasingly divisive, Obama was careful to not endorse a CIA assessment, reported by NPR and other news outlets, that asserts that Russia's goal was to elect Trump.

""There are still a whole range of assessments taking place among the agencies,"" Obama told NPR, referring to an order he has given the U.S. intelligence community to conduct a full review of the cyberattacks before Inauguration Day. ""And so when I receive a final report, you know, we'll be able to, I think, give us a comprehensive and best guess as to those motivations. But that does not in any way, I think, detract from the basic point that everyone during the election perceived accurately — that in fact what the Russian hack had done was create more problems for the Clinton campaign than it had for the Trump campaign.

""There's no doubt that it contributed to an atmosphere in which the only focus for weeks at a time, months at a time were Hillary's emails, the Clinton Foundation, political gossip surrounding the DNC.""

In fact, email had been a major focus since before Clinton formally entered the presidential race, owing to revelations first reported by the New York Times that she used a private email server during her tenure leading the State Department. Updates about the FBI's investigation of the server dripped out at intervals throughout the entire campaign.

The State Department also released Clinton emails at semi-regular intervals throughout the campaign, as did the conservative group Judicial Watch, which obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.

Obama didn't pin the blame for Clinton's loss on the leaked information, saying, ""Elections can always turn out differently. You never know which factors are going to make a difference. But I have no doubt that it had some impact, just based on the coverage.""

Obama said his goal is for a definitive White House report on the matter to be issued before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. He was also careful to say that while the Russian hacks benefited Trump, he is not suggesting Trump's campaign helped coordinate the attacks or played any role in them, other than to exploit them for political advantage. ""They understood what everybody else understood, which was that this was not good for Hillary Clinton's campaign,"" the president said.

Obama acknowledged that every ""big power"" spies and collects intelligence on each other, but, he said, ""There's a difference between that and the kind of malicious cyberattacks that steal trade secrets or engage in industrial espionage, something that we've seen the Chinese do. And there is a difference between that and activating intelligence in a way that's designed to influence elections.""

Obama discussed cybersecurity with Vladimir Putin during a 90-minute meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit held in China in early September. The president characterized the meeting at the time as ""candid, blunt, businesslike.""

While Obama is threatening to retaliate against Russia, he has only about five weeks left in the Oval Office. Trump has dismissed — in fact, mocked — intelligence assessments tying the DNC and Podesta hacks to Russia, and he campaigned on improving the U.S. relationship with the country.

In his interview with NPR, Obama appeared mystified by that stance.

""The irony of all this, of course, is that for most of my presidency, there's been a pretty sizable wing of the Republican Party that has consistently criticized me for not being tough enough on Russia,"" he said. ""Some of those folks during the campaign endorsed Donald Trump, despite the fact that a central tenet of his foreign policy was we shouldn't be so tough on Russia. And that kind of inconsistency I think makes it appear, at least, that their particular position on Russia on any given day depends on what's politically expedient.""

The president cited a recent Economist-YouGov poll that found Republican voters view Putin much more favorably now than they did before the 2016 presidential election.

""This is somebody, the former head of the KGB, who is responsible for crushing democracy in Russia, muzzling the press, throwing political dissidents in jail, countering American efforts to expand freedom at every turn; is currently making decisions that's leading to a slaughter in Syria. And a big chunk of the Republican Party, which prided itself during the Reagan era and for decades that followed as being the bulwark against Russian influence, now suddenly is embracing him.""

Several of Donald Trump's Cabinet choices have prompted controversy from the moment they were named, but the one most likely to face real Senate opposition is Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, whom Trump wants as his secretary of state.

How badly did Trump want Tillerson on his team? Badly enough to defend his pick's remarkable profile as a Russophile, a reputation so vivid that several Republican senators immediately began flashing yellow cards — if not red.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said being a ""Friend of Vladimir"" was hardly a Cabinet qualification, a reference to Russian President Putin, who once gave Tillerson the ""Order of Friendship"" — the highest accolade Moscow grants to friendly foreigners.

Arizona Sen. John McCain went farther, calling Putin a ""murderer, a thug and a KGB agent,"" a reference to the Russian leader's early career with the Soviet Union's secret police. So was he calling Tillerson a friend of murderers, thugs and KGB agents?

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham added his grave doubts, as well, suggesting there might be enough Republican defections from the GOP's 52-seat majority to block the nomination on the Senate floor.

This much at least is clear: For all the shade that has been thrown on other Trump Cabinet picks — from the generals to the Goldman Sachs alumni club — none seems in as much danger of Senate rejection as the big guy from the Big Oil company.

Trump no doubt knew he would catch flak over Tillerson's Putin ties, but saw them as proof of the Texan's deal-making and globe-trotting savvy. And he was settled enough on his man to stand by him even after the story had broken about the CIA concluding the Russians interfered with the 2016 election with an eye to aiding Trump.

Under these extraordinary circumstances, many will see the Tillerson pick as Trump doubling down on a potentially explosive departure from Republican orthodoxy. The party that nominated Trump has never been at ease with his defense of Putin as ""a strong leader"" or his divergence from the party's longstanding commitment to NATO. (A more traditional GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, said during the 2012 presidential debates that Russia was the biggest threat to the U.S. on the planet.)

At the same time, for those who say they like Trump because he sticks to his guns, Tillerson is proof — and as such he offers a chance to cheer. And for those who prefer a practitioner of private sector realpolitik over a politician or a polished diplomat, Tillerson may fill the bill rather admirably.

For others, even those implacably opposed to Trump and Tillerson both, this may be a moment to consider the options. Sure, the head of ExxonMobil may be the antithesis of everything you hold dear. Yes, you would have preferred the head of Greenpeace USA. But given that Trump was choosing, what did you expect?

Tillerson has drawn predictable pushback from all the proper quarters. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called it ""very troubling ... very sad ... very dangerous,"" because it meant Trump saw ""the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry [as] more important than climate change and the future of the planet.""

Environmental groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund said Trump was putting the oil-and-gas industry interests above Americans' health. Government watchdogs, such as Every Voice, were disturbed, because Tillerson owns so much stock in a company active in 50 countries with interests likely to conflict with those of the U.S.

As an example, Tillerson has opposed the U.S.-NATO sanctions on Russia imposed after the latter annexed Crimea — after those sanctions blocked his company's plans to drill below the Arctic Sea with Moscow's blessing. That issue will surely be a feature of his confirmation hearings, if not a major stumbling block.

But elections have consequences, as President Obama was once fond of saying. Tillerson makes sense in a Trumpian world, because he breaks the mold of diplomats and politicians who usually command the U.S. State Department. He has no government experience, but that is surely not disqualifying in the Trump administration.

Trump and Tillerson are two tough-minded corporate businessmen who have spent decades atop large companies with global interests. Both have a penchant for big projects and a professed devotion to the works of philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand.

Trump makes a show of downscale tastes while living in a tower on Fifth Avenue. Tillerson has the versatility to talk Texan while also playing the sophisticated realist who sees the world as something more than us versus them. At ExxonMobil he has led a complex, worldwide organization that at least publicly recognizes the realities of climate change, fossil fuels and alternative energies.

That veneer of commitment to future technologies will not placate those who see environmental disaster on the horizon. But if Tillerson defines the extremes of drill-baby-drill for these activists, that is just fine with the man who is soon to redecorate the Oval Office.

One might say the whole idea behind the Trump Cabinet is to pick people who personify ""the problem"" — as defined in the liberal mindset. Whether Trump ultimately follows his team of hotspurs or uses them as heat shields as he negotiates a new reality, he sees them all as serving his purpose — not the other way around.

Trump nominees Georgia Rep. Tom Price (Health and Human Services) and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt (the Environmental Protection Agency) are prime examples of this. Each can protect Trump's right flank within the GOP if and when the new president cuts his own deals on health care and the environment.

Tillerson is more multidimensional than that, and may prove more original and interesting. Trump clearly wants a redefinition of the Russia relationship, and he may pursue that with a combination of Tillerson on one hand and a hard-line old-fashioned Cold Warrior on the other. For example, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton has been mentioned as a possible No. 2 at State.

That should be a sufficient reminder to administration critics that other candidates for the most prestigious and symbolic Cabinet job — including Bolton and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani — might have made the Tillerson choice seem palatable by comparison."

The Islamic State issued a statement on Monday saying it was responsible for the attack at a New Year's Eve celebration at a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey, in which at least 39 people were killed.

The ISIS-linked Amaq News Agency published the statement:

""In continuation of the blessed operations that Islamic State is conducting against the protector of the cross, Turkey, a heroic soldier of the caliphate struck one of the most famous nightclubs where the Christians celebrate their apostate holiday.""

NPR's Peter Kenyon reports the ISIS claim hasn't been verified.

On Sunday, Peter reported that Turkish officials identified several possible culprits for the shooting, including the Islamic State, Kurdish militants or far-left groups.

Turkey's state-run news agency says that nearly two-thirds of the people killed were foreign nationals.

Clubgoers from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon and France are thought to have been killed.

Funerals for some of the Turkish victims began on Sunday.

A 19-year-old Arab-Israeli woman was killed in the attack. Peter reports that her father warned her not to go but she insisted — wanting to be with her friends.

Nearly 70 people were wounded in the attack, among them a 35-year-old businessman from Delaware, according to the State Department.

WCAU-TV reports that Michael Raak of South Philadelphia says his brother, William Jacob Raak, called on New Year's Eve to say he had been shot in the leg.

The search for the attacker, who has not yet been identified, is still underway, says Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. Police believe he carried out the attack alone.

The Associated Press reports:

Hurriyet and Karar newspaper reports Monday cited unnamed security officials saying that authorities have determined that the gunman who killed 39 people comes from a Central Asian nation and is believed to be either from Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan. Police had also established similarities with the high-casualty attack at Ataturk Airport in June and was investigating whether the same IS cell carried out both attacks.

NPR's Peter Kenyon reported on Weekend All Things Considered that Turkey's prime minister says the attacker left his weapon at the scene and fled in the chaotic aftermath.

At Reina, one of Istanbul's most popular nightclubs, it's believed some 500 to 600 revelers were celebrating the start of the new year.

Reuters reports that the attacker shot at a police officer and at civilians before entering the nightclub. Many inside were said to have jumped into the neighboring Bosphorus waterway in an attempt to save themselves from the gunfire.

The U.N. Security Council condemned the attack in a statement, calling it a ""heinous and barbaric terrorist attack.""

Both the White House and State Department condemned the attack.

The assault on the nightclub comes just two weeks after Russian ambassador Andrei Karlov was shot dead by off-duty Turkish policeman Mevlut Mert Altintas and three weeks after a bomb attack killed 44 people at a football stadium in Istanbul. A Kurdish militant group claimed responsibility for the latter.

Turkey, which is part of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, has faced numerous security threats. In all, there were at least six attacks in Turkey in 2016, claiming more than 200 lives."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP

Updated at 10:15 a.m. ET

The House Republican Conference voted Monday night to approve a change to House rules to weaken the independence of the Office of Congressional Ethics and place it under the oversight of the House Ethics Committee, a panel controlled by party leaders.

It will be part of a broader House Rules package to be voted on by the full body on Tuesday after the 115th Congress officially convenes and the House elects a speaker.

The Office of Congressional Ethics was established in 2008 under House Democrats, in response to the era of lobbying scandals made notable by Jack Abramoff, the former lobbyist who went to prison on corruption charges.

It is the first independent body to have an oversight role in House ethics. There is no Senate counterpart. The OCE independently reviews allegations of misconduct against House members and staff, and if deemed appropriate refers them to the House Ethics Committee for review. The OCE cannot independently punish lawmakers for any ethics violations.

House Speaker Paul Ryan spoke out against the move, according to a source in the room who said Ryan stated that ""there's a bipartisan way to better reform the office.""

President-elect Donald Trump was critical of the vote, tweeting Tuesday morning, ""With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it may be, their number one act and priority.""

Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway had defended the move earlier, telling ABC's Good Morning America that the election justified the action by congressional Republicans. ""There's a mandate there for them to make significant change,"" Conway said.

The vote has caused a backlash among Democrats, who say it's hypocritical given that Trump was elected vowing to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington.

The language approved Monday night, authored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., would prevent staff from making public statements independent of the House Ethics Committee and prevents it from investigating anonymous tips. A senior GOP aide said that's all ""because members are sick of having their name dragged through the mud based on partisan sometimes anonymous accusations.""

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was speaker when the OCE was created, criticized the decision in a statement.

""Republicans claim they want to 'drain the swamp,' but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions,"" she wrote. ""Evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress.""

In a statement, Goodlatte said his rules change would ""strengthen"" the OCE and improve due process rights for those subject to ethical investigations.

""The amendment builds upon and strengthens the existing Office of Congressional Ethics by maintaining its primary area of focus of accepting and reviewing complaints from the public and referring them, if appropriate, to the Committee on Ethics. It also improves upon due process rights for individuals under investigation, as well as witnesses called to testify. The OCE has a serious and important role in the House, and this amendment does nothing to impede their work,"" Goodlatte wrote.

The Goodlatte amendment still would allow the OCE to accept and review complaints, but it would bar the consideration of anonymous complaints. It also would rename it the ""Office of Congressional Complaint Review.""

While Speaker Ryan spoke out against the move to his fellow GOP lawmakers, his office defended the amendment, saying it provides ""greater due process rights, clear timelines for consideration of complaints, and a basic level of oversight by the evenly-split bipartisan ethics committee. It does NOT remove the responsibility of the office to review complaints, carry out investigations, and make referrals to the ethics committee. The office will continue to operate in the new year and provide public accountability to Congress.""

In November, Ryan stopped the House from bringing back earmarks — provisions that in the past allowed members to direct spending to specific projects.

""We just had a 'drain the swamp' election,"" Ryan reportedly said at the time. ""Let's not just turn around and bring back earmarks two weeks later."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mahmoud Illean/AP Mahmoud Illean/AP

The U.N. Security Council has approved a resolution condemning construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, after the U.S. abstained from the vote rather than vetoing the resolution outright.

In explaining the U.S. abstention, Ambassador Samantha Power said the move doesn't signal diminished U.S. support for Israel; she later added that the continued construction of settlements ""seriously undermines Israel's security.""

Power said, ""The United States has been sending the message that the settlements must stop, privately and publicly, for nearly five decades.""

NPR's Michele Kelemen reports for our Newscast unit:

""A day after Egypt withdrew the resolution under pressure from Israel and President-elect Donald Trump, several other Security Council members brought the draft to a vote. Fourteen supported it; Power was the only one to abstain.""

Less than an hour after the vote, Trump tweeted, ""As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.""

At the start of Power's remarks explaining the U.S. position on the resolution, the ambassador read aloud a quote she said was from President Ronald Reagan, in 1982:

""The United States will not support the use of any additional land for the purpose of settlements during the transitional period. Indeed, the immediate adoption of a settlement freeze by Israel, more than any other action, could create the confidence needed for wider participation in these talks. Further settlement activity is in no way necessary for the security of Israel, and only diminishes the confidence of the Arabs that a final outcome can be freely and fairly negotiated.""

Power said that in addition to condemning settlements, the resolution ""reflects the facts on the ground,"" condemns violence and terrorism and addresses ""counter-productive actions by the Palestinians"" while also calling on both sides to engage in peace talks.

The U.S. abstention comes one day after President-elect Trump issued a statement calling on the U.S. to veto the resolution.

""As the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,"" Trump said. He added that the resolution ""puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.""

The subject of fairness came up in Power's remarks, as well — as she said Israel has long been the victim of bias in the U.N. Power said:

""In reality, this vote, for us, was not straightforward, because of where it's taking place: at the United Nations. For the simple truth is that for as long as Israel has been a member of this institution, Israel has been treated differently from other nations at the United Nations.

""And not only in decades past, such as the infamous resolution that the General Assembly adopted in 1975 with the support of the majority of member states, officially determining that Zionism is a form of racism. But also in 2016, this year. One need only look at the 18 resolutions against Israel adopted during the General Assembly in September, or the 12 Israel-specific resolutions adopted this year in the [U.N.] human rights council — more than those focused on Syria; North Korea; Iran and South Sudan put together.""

Power stated that ""such unequal treatment not only hurts Israel; it undermines the legitimacy of the United Nations itself."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP

President Obama meets with Democrats on Capitol Hill today, looking for ways to preserve his signature health care law in the face of stiff Republican opposition.

Senate Republicans have already taken the first step toward repealing Obamacare. On Tuesday, they introduced a budget resolution that would ultimately allow Republicans to unravel large parts of the Affordable Care Act with a simple majority vote.

Democrats still hope to defend the law, which has extended health insurance to some 20 million Americans. Repealing the law would very likely strip protection from many of those people. So far, Republicans have not reached agreement on how to replace Obamacare. And the outgoing administration mocks the idea of repeal now and replace later.

""That ultimately is nothing more than just bait and switch,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest.

The American Medical Association issued a similar note of caution in an open letter to lawmakers. The association, which supported the Affordable Care Act when it passed seven years ago, acknowledged that the law is imperfect, but said any effort to cut costs or increase choice should at least preserve the existing level of coverage.

""Before any action is taken through reconciliation or other means that would potentially alter coverage, policymakers should lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what will replace current policies,"" wrote the association's CEO, James L. Madara. ""Patients and other stakeholders should be able to clearly compare current policy to new proposals so they can make informed decisions about whether it represents a step forward in the ongoing process of health reform.""

Reconciliation is a procedural tactic that would allow Senate Republicans to unwind large parts of the Affordable Care Act without the threat of a Democratic filibuster.

Some Republican senators are wary of stripping health insurance from people without a plan to take its place. And conservative health care scholars Joseph Antos and James Capretta of the American Enterprise Institute warn that repeal without simultaneous replacement ""carries too much risk of unnecessary disruption to the existing insurance arrangements upon which many people are now relying to finance their health services.""

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan is undeterred, calling the budget resolution ""the first step towards relief for Americans struggling under Obamacare."" In a statement, Ryan said his goal is ""to ensure that patients will be in control of their health care and have greater access to quality, affordable coverage.""

President-elect Donald Trump weighed in via Twitter, writing, ""People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn't work, and it is not affordable.""

President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue as his nominee for agriculture secretary, according to a transition official and a source close to the process.

This is the last open Cabinet position, although Trump has yet to name a Council of Economic Advisors chair, which is a Cabinet-level position.

The process of selecting an agriculture secretary turned into a marathon, as Trump interviewed many candidates.

Perdue was a favorite among major farmers' groups and leaders in the Republican establishment.

He got his start in local politics in Georgia as a Democrat, then switched parties and in 2003 he became the first Republican governor of Georgia in a century.

Perdue has a cousin serving in the Senate — Republican David Perdue, also of Georgia.

If confirmed, Perdue will be in charge of several programs that some Republicans in Congress have suggested trimming. These include food aid to the poor, financial aid to farmers, and new school lunch standards.

His selection means Trump's Cabinet could be the first in 28 years without a Latino member.

Some Republicans had urged the president-elect to pick Abel Maldonado, a former lieutenant governor of California who's the son of immigrant farm workers.

Perdue is the son of a Georgia farmer and was trained as a veterinarian."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Anadolu Agency/Getty Images

President Trump's executive order on immigration late Friday ignited nationwide protests — and a slew of legal challenges.

At least four federal judges across the country have blocked part of the order and temporarily ensured refugees and travelers who reached U.S. soil would not be deported.

Here's an explanation of what happened so far and what could come next.

1. Who is covered by the executive order?

The order suspended new refugee admissions for 120 days. It capped the total number of refugees allowed into the country this year at 50,000, far lower than the Obama administration had allotted. And travelers from seven countries — Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia — are barred for 90 days. Border Patrol agents and lawyers said the order and statements by top White House officials have not made clear how Green Card holders, or lawful permanent residents, are to be treated.

2. What have the federal courts ruled so far?

The American Civil Liberties Union sued in Brooklyn over the detention of two Iraqi clients at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Late Saturday, Judge Ann Donnelly issued a temporary restraining order barring the deportation of as many as 200 people. Judge Donnelly cited ""irreparable harm"" they would face, and she demanded that the Trump administration provide a list of all affected refugees and travelers. Later, a federal judge in suburban Virginia ordered that travelers be allowed to consult with volunteer attorneys. And another judge in Massachusetts ruled the travelers not only were free from deportation, but that those being held must be released from federal detention. There are reports from pro bono lawyers that border agents may not be complying with some of those directives from the federal judiciary.

3. What is the Trump administration saying about this?

White House officials said the policy is designed to protect U.S. borders and to restrict the entry of terrorism suspects. The Department of Homeland Security said fewer than 1 percent of the average 325,000 people who journeyed to the U.S. on Saturday were ""inconvenienced."" DHS said the president's order remains in place and ""the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety.""

On NBC's Meet The Press on Sunday, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said Green Card holders would not be affected ""moving forward,"" but he went on to say that they would ""be subjected to further screening"" at the border.

4. Where do the legal challenges go from here?

The president has sweeping authority on matters of immigration. Federal law allows the president to suspend people or classes of people if he determines their entry is ""detrimental"" to the nation. But a 1965 update to that law, the Immigration and Naturalization Act, clarifies that people should not experience preferences or discrimination on account of their ""race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.""

Trump's order appears to grant some religious preference to Christians and to target seven majority-Muslim countries, though his order points out that people from those countries had already been singled out for extra vetting during the Obama years.

Lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, immigrants rights groups and other advocates are likely to file more lawsuits in the coming days on the grounds that the order violates the 1965 immigration law, the right to due process, and the First Amendment clause that bars Congress from establishing a religion, among other things.

White House officials insisted they did not set out to create a ""Muslim ban."" But Trump associate Rudy Giuliani told Fox News that Trump had reached out to him and others about how to make such a ban, which Trump proposed on the campaign trail in December 2015, legal. And the son of national security adviser Michael Flynn tweeted about a ""Muslim ban,"" as well. Those statements could be used by refugee advocates to demonstrate the administration's intent.

5. What happens with Trump's nominees for key Cabinet posts?

Democrats argue that key offices within the State Department and the Justice Department were in the dark about the immigration order before it was made public. They want to know if Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, the nominee to be attorney general, advised Trump on the order — and whether Sessions will commit to making sure Justice Department lawyers are consulted in the future. The Senate Judiciary Committee is supposed to vote on Sessions' nomination on Tuesday. If he passes that vote, Sessions could be confirmed by the full Senate by the end of the week."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP

Ruffling U.S. ties with one of its closest allies, President Trump is sharply criticizing an Obama-era agreement with Australia — a deal that also reportedly prompted the American leader to tell Australia's prime minister that his was the ""worst"" phone call Trump received after his inauguration.

Late Wednesday night, the president vented his anger on Twitter, saying: ""Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!""

As the Australian Broadcasting Network notes, Trump's tweet ""incorrectly labels refugees 'illegal immigrants' and cites 'thousands' of people instead of 1,250.""

The deal concerns refugees, many of them children, who've been housed in offshore detention centers on Nauru and other islands. The arrangement has been controversial in Australia, particularly after incidents of abuse emerged.

Speaking to a radio station in Sydney, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says he's aware Trump doesn't like the agreement, but, he added, the question is will he commit to honor the deal. He has given that commitment.""

Turnbull says he's disappointed that details about his communication with Trump were leaked — and while acknowledging that the talk was ""very frank and forthright,"" he has dismissed the version of events reported by some outlets, that the American president hung up on his Australian counterpart.

""The report that the president hung up is not correct,"" Turnbull told Sydney radio station 2GB. ""The call ended courteously.""

After news of the apparent rift emerged, Sen. John McCain said he called the Australian ambassador ""to express my unwavering support for alliance"" with the country that he described as one of America's oldest friends and allies. The two allies, McCain noted, have fought together from World War I to Vietnam and the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

From Melbourne, Louisa Lim reports for our Newscast unit:

""The trouble started during an acrimonious telephone call between Trump and Turnbull. The U.S. president had spoken to four other world leaders. But he told Turnbull this was the 'worst call by far' and ended it abruptly, according to The Washington Post.""

Louisa adds, ""This episode has already added weight to calls for Australia to re-evaluate its decision to host U.S. Marines."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Senate TV /AP Senate TV /AP

When Senate Republicans silenced Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., during debate over the nomination of Jeff Sessions to serve as attorney general, they sparked a furious response — but also used a rule that's meant to encourage civil debate.

Senate Rule 19 includes this prohibition: ""No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.""

While there is much room to argue Warren's specific case, the rule itself is one that many of us would do well to live by.

First, the facts. Warren spoke on the Senate floor. She criticized Jeff Sessions, a Republican senator from Alabama and the nominee to lead the Justice Department. Warren read a letter from Coretta Scott King, written in 1986 as Sessions sought a post as a federal judge. Martin Luther King Jr.'s widow had questioned Sessions' work as a federal prosecutor: ""Mr. Sessions has used the awesome powers of his office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters.""

As she read the letter, Warren was warned by Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., who was presiding over the Senate at the time. Warren asked Daines how it could be improper to quote a letter from the widow of Martin Luther King Jr. and she was allowed by Daines to continue reading the letter. Later in Warren's remarks about Sessions, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader from Kentucky, appeared in the chamber to stop Warren for violating Senate Rule 19 and the Senate, in a party-line vote, supported McConnell. Warren was silenced—at least on the Senate floor—though she was soon reading the letter again on social media.

According to Senate Republicans, Warren impugned the ""conduct or motive"" of Sessions, who is expected to be confirmed as attorney general Wednesday night.

Warren's supporters saw a stifling of dissent, and asked how the mere reading a letter could violate the rule. It's a fair question: Can't a senator refer to the public record?

But set aside her specific case for a moment, just to focus on the purpose of the rule.

Rule 19 forbids an especially corrosive form of verbal combat.

Any student of interpersonal relations knows that questioning another person's motives escalates an argument. Think about the difference between saying ""You're wrong"" and ""You deliberately lied."" Or consider the last two words of a line spoken by a furious husband in the comedy A Christmas Story: ""You used up all the glue ... ON PURPOSE!""

This reality applies to politics. Think of President Trump this week, who made a false claim about the media — that the media fail to cover terror attacks — and then suggested nefarious motives. ""It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported,"" the president said, despite abundant evidence to the contrary. ""And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.""

Rule 19 is meant to prevent this sort of fact-free statement, at least on the Senate floor.

Granted, such a rule can seem hopelessly outdated in an era of acid remarks on social media. It can also seem like a needless luxury at this moment when the political stakes are so high. We all need a full and ruthlessly honest debate. If there was ever a time to avoid tiptoeing around the issues, that moment surely is now.

But we also need civil debate. And in the Senate, lawmakers have learned to sting each other within Rule 19. If they have an insult to fling at another member, they simply disguise it as a compliment.

In 2001, as a reporter covering the Senate, I witnessed a particularly brilliant exchange on the floor between the late Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy and Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch. Kennedy fiercely criticized Hatch's position. Hatch responded by saying Kennedy was wrong, and then adding a few lines of ""praise.""

""[Reality] doesn't stop bombastic arguments, nor should it. I love them myself. I love to see the distinguished senator from Massachusetts get up there and everybody's almost positive he's going to blow a fuse before he's through. He has a right to do that, and I admire him for doing it. I admire the way he supports his special interests. And I love my colleague, as very few in this body do.""

Senators on the floor, and onlookers in the gallery, burst out laughing.

Nobody missed Hatch's point. Nor did anybody call out Hatch for a violation of Rule 19. Sen. Kennedy offered his own lines about Sen. Hatch. When the exchange was over, Kennedy — who was an old friend of Hatch — walked over and hugged him."

The area around a huge dam at California's second-largest reservoir is in a state of emergency, with some 180,000 residents ordered to evacuate the area Sunday out of fears that part of Oroville Dam could fail. A glimmer of hope arrived late Sunday night, when officials said water had finally stopped pouring over the dam's emergency spillway.

The secondary spillway was in use because the main spillway had developed a huge hole, stressed by the need to release water accumulated from California's wet winter — and brought to a new crisis point by last week's heavy rains.

""So the lake rose 50 feet in just a few days,"" Dan Brekke of member station KQED tells Morning Edition, ""and got up to this emergency spillway which had never been used since the dam went into service in 1968. And on Saturday morning, it began pouring over there.""

Residents of the area some 70 miles north of Sacramento were placed under evacuation orders around 4:30 p.m. Sunday, after the reservoir rose to a record level — more than a foot above what's considered ""full"" — and its main spillway struggled to provide relief and its auxiliary spillway was seen at risk of failing. At the time, officials said that dangerous flooding could be just hours away.

Even as the evacuation orders were issued, officials had reason to hope that Lake Oroville would soon begin to recede, due to a drop in the amount of runoff water entering the lake and a dry weather forecast. But the reservoir's infrastructure was struggling to cope.

""The lake is considered full at 901 feet [above sea level], and it's at that level that it began pouring over an emergency spillway early Saturday,"" KQED reports.

The lake kept rising, surpassing its ""full"" level by more than a foot. Last night, Lake Oroville's water level finally dropped below 900 feet around midnight, in a trend that has continued into Monday morning.

As for the residents and evacuees, Brekke says he has seen many confused, scared people — one woman's son, he says, compared the evacuation to a zombie apocalypse. And another woman said she's still worrying over the family members who weren't able to leave.

That resident, Marilyn McKinney, told Brekke:

""My daughter-in-law is still there with her sister, who is bedridden, but we've got her in a wheelchair. They were supposed to be sending an ambulance or someone to help transport her out. And nobody has shown up for her yet. She called 911, and 911 said they weren't sending anybody else out.""

Overnight, evacuation centers and shelters were still being outfitted with beds and blankets. Gov. Jerry Brown issued an emergency order last night to help with the process, which saw shelters erected at fairgrounds to handle the thousands of people leaving Oroville and other downstream areas.

While the waters are receding and dry weather is expected for Monday and Tuesday, the region in Northern California could get another round of rain later this week, when forecasts are calling for several days of rain.

The Oroville Dam incident has sparked questions about how to repair the dam's spillways — and whether other structures in California and beyond are similarly vulnerable. After the main spillway developed a 200-foot hole, the auxiliary spillway also began to erode, sparking Sunday's evacuation.

Flood control expert Jeffrey Mount, of the Public Policy Institute of California and the University of California Davis, says the auxiliary spillway at Oroville had never been tested — always a challenge with emergency equipment — and that it will be very expensive to repair.

""The weaknesses were revealed immediately in the design, and it threatened to collapse,"" Mount tells Morning Edition.

""I can tell you that this event will cause us to do some soul-searching about the amount of money we're spending on infrastructure — maintenance, particularly — here in California,"" Mount says."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images

Updated at 7:50 p.m. ET

A federal appeals court has unanimously rejected a Trump administration request to allow its travel ban to take effect.

The three-judge appeals panel declined to overturn a lower court's order suspending the president's ban against entry into the United States by refugees and travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations.

The travel ban was put on hold by federal district Judge James L. Robart of Seattle, who issued a nationwide restraining order on Feb. 3. Robart said that the two states challenging the ban, Washington and Minnesota, had shown that their residents and universities were harmed by Trump's action. The administration then asked the appeals court for an emergency stay of Robart's restraining order.

But the judges dismissed the administration's request, saying that it had to show that it is likely to succeed in the trial court on the merits of its appeal.

""[We] hold that the Government has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that failure to enter a stay would cause irreparable injury, and we therefore deny its emergency motion for a stay,"" wrote the panel.

President Trump tweeted his reply, indicating he will appeal.

Trump also spoke briefly with reporters outside his press secretary's office after the ruling was announced and, as reported by Reuters, called the decision political and predicted the administration would ultimately win.

The result is a rebuke to the White House. In oral arguments heard on Tuesday, the panel vigorously quizzed attorneys both for the administration and for the state of Washington, the lead plaintiff, which originally filed the suit challenging the travel ban.

The solicitor general for the state of Washington, Noah Purcell, argued that the travel ban is discriminatory and violates both federal statutes and the U.S. Constitution. He told the court that the judiciary's role is to step in and check the abuses of the executive branch.

But August Flentje, special counsel to the assistant attorney general, argued that the president has the ultimate authority to protect the national security and that his action in that regard — namely, the travel ban — was unreviewable by the courts.

In their ruling, the judges were unequivocal. ""There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our democracy,"" the court wrote.

The judges also said that the administration had also failed to show it would suffer ""irreparable injury"" if its travel ban were not allowed to go back into effect. Acknowledging the government's interest in combating terrorism, the judges nonetheless wrote, ""The Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States. Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review the decision at all.""

The states challenging the president's travel ban won on virtually every issue, says Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.

""The order was unanimous. The panel found that the states had standing, that the executive order was reviewable by the court, that the U.S. was not likely to succeed on the merits and that it had not shown that a stay was necessary to avoid irreparable injury,"" said Tobias.

In a news conference, Purcell declared victory. ""What we argued is it's the role of the courts to say what the law is, and to serve as a check on the executive branch, and that's what the court has done in this opinion, in this excellent opinion, with this well-reasoned, careful, thoughtful opinion that seriously considered all the government's arguments and rejected them,"" he said."

President Trump and his top aides can't seem to shake the Russian bear that follows them around.

It put its paw on the scales of the U.S. presidential election last year, according to the U.S. intelligence community. It cost Trump his then-campaign manager, Paul Manafort. And now the connections between Trump's camp and Moscow might mean that another top aide, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, could be sent off to Siberia — metaphorically.

The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff of California, said Friday that if reports are accurate about Flynn's contact with Russia's ambassador ahead of sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama late last year, ""he should no longer serve in this administration or any other.""

If more Democrats — or, critically, Republicans — join Schiff in calling for Flynn to step down, Trump could have the first big staff crisis of his new presidency.

How did we get here? What might happen next? Here are the five things you need to know about the unfolding imbroglio over Trump, Flynn and the Kremlin.

1. Mike Flynn's conversation

The story begins before the Trump administration even took office, as the outgoing Obama administration was wrapping up a last bit of ugly and difficult business. Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered his intelligence agencies to wreak havoc in the U.S. presidential race, America's top spies concluded. They did so by hacking into the email accounts of Democratic and former national security leaders and releasing what they stole.

With the investigation concluded and the case made in public, Obama was under pressure to retaliate. He did so by expelling some Russian spies operating under diplomatic cover, closing sites they were using outside Washington and New York, and imposing economic sanctions on Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU; another spy service, the FSB; and their top leaders.

Meanwhile Trump, Flynn and then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and the administration in waiting were getting ready for the inauguration and their own assumption of responsibility. On Christmas Day, before Obama announced his punitive measures against Russia, Flynn communicated with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. That they talked is not in dispute. The issue is what they said. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that their discussions included, if not a warning by Flynn about the pending new sanctions, a promise that whatever Obama did, Trump could undo once he was in office.

If Flynn was negotiating with the Russians on behalf of an administration not yet in power, that could technically be against the law — though it's a law no one has ever been prosecuted for breaking, the Logan Act. The conversations also expose the Trump administration to more charges about secret collusion with Moscow.

A spokesman for Flynn told the Post that he didn't remember all of what was discussed and that it's possible sanctions might have come up. But on Jan. 15 Pence said categorically on CBS's Face the Nation that Flynn and Kislyak did not talk about sanctions.

2. The Watergate rule

One of the oldest saws in Washington runs like this: ""The cover-up is worse than the crime."" A senior administration official told NPR on Friday that Pence's comments on Face the Nation were based entirely on the vice president's discussion with Flynn — in other words, that Flynn owns the substance of what the White House said publicly in explaining his contact with the Russian ambassador.

America's intelligence services monitor the communications of foreign agents, and the detail about Flynn's communication with Kislyak was reported (also in the Post) even before Trump took office. The Trump transition team said Flynn had only wished the ambassador Merry Christmas. Then the Trump camp said the two were making staff-level arrangements for a phone call between Trump and Putin. The Trump team talked about an invitation from Moscow for the U.S. to join Russian-led peace talks about the war in Syria. The timing of the conversations, as Pence explained on television on Jan. 15, was ""strictly coincidental.""

Now Flynn has said they may have talked about sanctions, but he doesn't remember, and Pence is taking himself out of it, saying all of this is on Flynn. What also isn't clear is what Trump might have known or when he knew it. Did Trump order that these conversations take place? Or was Flynn acting on his own?

3. What we don't know

What hard evidence exists about any of this? The Washington Post and New York Times quote unnamed current and former national security sources who say they know what Flynn and Kislyak discussed — is there a transcript somewhere? A recording? Flynn's explanation to the Post that he doesn't remember the full discussion only raises eyebrows given that Putin responded to Obama's démarche by taking the high road.

Instead of retaliating by expelling Americans or taking other such measures, Putin did nothing. Is that because he knew he would get a better deal from Trump?

""It is regrettable that the Obama administration is ending its term in this manner,"" Putin said at the time. ""Nevertheless, I offer my New Year greetings to President Obama and his family.""

Trump weighed in on Twitter with praise for Putin, calling him ""very smart!""

If the White House knows there is a recording, or a transcript or other information about Flynn's contacts that substantiates the news accounts, Flynn could become too hot to handle. If it believes he can ride this out, it does not want to hand Democrats any kind of victory.

4. Palace intrigue

Trump's White House team is still getting its sea legs. Trump is the unique president to never have held a government or military job and is still learning the basics of how the federal behemoth works even as he also tries to wield it to achieve his goals.

Part of that unsteadiness is a scramble inside the president's inner circle to determine who gets access to him and who has his imprimatur when acting with people outside the White House. Flynn, who had Trump to himself as national security aide during the presidential campaign, now has more competition from Defense Secretary James Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, chief strategist Steve Bannon and others. The leaks, responses and counterleaks in the press and on TV are the public face of an internal struggle for power.

Compounding the difficulties for Flynn are resentments that may still be simmering against him across the Potomac River in the U.S. intelligence community. Obama fired Flynn after a chaotic run as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, during which he is said to have made enemies with his then-bosses in the Defense Department and at least one rival spy service: the CIA.

Flynn appeared to get the last laugh when he befriended a presidential hopeful who won a surprise victory and brought him into the White House. But to the degree there are unsettled scores within the intelligence community, his troubles might not be over.

5. Where does it all lead?

Trump has never hidden his admiration for Putin or his public desire to improve America's relationship with Russia. He — and voters — knew that Flynn had traveled to Russia after leaving his DIA job and had appeared on Russia's state-run propaganda arm, RT.

Americans accepted the outcome of the election as legitimate and many supporters welcomed what they viewed as the fair-play disclosures by WikiLeaks of information stolen by Russia's hackers. The political dilemma for Trump, however, is that Russia turns into a bad penny, popping up everywhere and never giving him room to maneuver on his own.

Separately this week, Reuters reported that Trump didn't know about the 2010 New START (strategic arms treaty) when he spoke to Putin on the phone — then denounced it anyway. The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan warned Congress about Russian meddling in Afghanistan, which he said was intended to undermine NATO. Russia has increased its military attacks in Eastern Ukraine. Trump risks appearing as though all he does is react to initiatives taken by Putin.

The other political danger for the White House is losing control of the story.

Virginia Democrat Mark Warner, the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the news reports ""underscore both the gravity and the urgency"" of his committee's investigation into ties between Trump and Russia. And his colleague Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said separately he is glad at least one other investigation is taking place – the one being done by the FBI.

Russian intelligence officials made repeated contact with members of President Trump's campaign staff, according to new reports that cite anonymous U.S. officials. American agencies were concerned about the contacts but haven't seen proof of collusion between the campaign and the Russian security apparatus, the reports say.

Law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the calls at the same time as they investigated Russia's attempts to tamper with the presidential election, according to The New York Times, which first reported the contacts.

Both the Times and CNN, which has published its own story about the intercepted communications, cite multiple current and former U.S. officials as the sources for their stories.

According to CNN, ""The communications were intercepted during routine intelligence collection targeting Russian officials and other Russian nationals known to U.S. intelligence.""

Reporter Matt Apuzzo, part of the Times team that broke the story, tells NPR's Morning Edition that while officials said they haven't seen proof of collusion — ""just the flurry of contacts was enough, and the timing of the contacts, was enough to get them very concerned.""

Reports: U.S. Intercepted Calls Between Trump Campaign Staff And Russian Intelligence Listen · 7:01 7:01

U.S. agencies are still working to determine the reasons behind the contacts, officials tell both news outlets.

Michael Flynn, whose tenure as national security adviser lasted less than four weeks, was among the Trump insiders who were regularly in touch with Russians, according to CNN.

Flynn resigned late Monday after reports alleged that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with that country's ambassador — and then misled Vice President Pence about the conversations. The chain of events emerging today suggests that those contacts in late December are separate from the calls cited by officials who discussed contacts between Trump campaign aides and Russian nationals during the heat of last year's election season.

President Trump called the new reports ""conspiracy theories"" early Wednesday.

""The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred,"" the president wrote. He then added that MSNBC and CNN are ""unwatchable,"" while the Fox News program Fox & Friends ""is great.""

The Kremlin had a similar response, with Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying, ""Let us not believe in what media say, for nowadays it is very difficult to tell actual news from fake ones.""

That's according to state-run Tass media, which adds that Peskov also criticized the use of anonymous sources by the media.

In Washington, government leaks have fueled a succession of unflattering stories about the new administration, from details about President Trump's phone calls with foreign leaders to rumored rivalries among senior White House staff.

Faced with a new leak Wednesday, Trump tweeted, ""The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by 'intelligence' like candy. Very un-American!""

Allegations about Trump's involvement with Russia have ranged from reports last month of a dossier that alleged collusion between the then-candidate and Russian President Vladimir Putin to a public call from the candidate himself last July, when he urged Russian agents to ""find"" Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's emails and release them.

The FBI has been investigating contacts between Trump aides and Russia; in Congress, there are also calls for public investigations. Last month, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence announced it would investigate allegations that Russia meddled in the U.S. elections.

But there is resistance among Republicans in Congress to go after one of their own, particularly as the new president is settling into the White House.

Republican Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who's on the House Judiciary Committee, tells Morning Edition, ""I don't think we need an independent investigation here, I think we need to let the Intelligence and the Judiciary committees do their work.""

Reports: U.S. Intercepted Calls Between Trump Campaign Staff And Russian Intelligence Listen · 7:17 7:17

That work, he said, includes receiving classified briefings about the new allegations. Johnson also raised questions about leaks in the government — particularly of information that's drawn from surveillance that swept up the communications of U.S. citizens.

""There are some serious legal implications here,"" Johnson said, ""but it has nothing to do with partisan politics. I mean, the leak of highly classified information by what is apparent here — a number of individuals inside our intelligence community — is the illegal act that I think we need to review.""

Johnson also faulted intelligence agencies for not doing more to protect the identity of Americans — such as former national security adviser Michael Flynn — whose communications with a foreign national were monitored.

New reports of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia follow the exit of a third member of Donald Trump's inner circle in the past 12 months amid allegations of inappropriate contact with the country:

Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser this week over the handling of his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S.;

Paul Manafort resigned as Trump's campaign chairman last August amid reports of his attempts to align Trump's policies with Russian interests;

Carter Page removed himself as a foreign policy adviser last September, as reports emerged about a visit to Russia and other potential contacts.

Manafort and Flynn were among the senior Trump team members who were ""regularly communicating with Russian nationals,"" CNN reports.

In an interview with the Times, Manafort called the officials' account ""absurd"" and said he had never had anything to do with Putin's government.

Manafort told the newspaper, ""It's not like these people wear badges that say, 'I'm a Russian intelligence officer.'"""

PBS NewsHour via YouTube

President Trump skipped the annual Conservative Political Action Conference last year, but this year he was the annual gathering's hero who had finally returned the White House to Republicans.

Trump's stem-winder of just under an hour, which he delivered to the adoring crowd just outside Washington on Friday morning, felt more like a campaign speech than a presidential address, reliving many of his greatest hits and applause lines on the campaign trail — even down to the crowd breaking out in chants of ""lock her up"" about his vanquished rival, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

The president boasted to attendees that ""the era of empty talk is over"" as he began to tick off each of his campaign promises.

""We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare,"" he promised, despite the fact that Republicans have not yet settled on an alternative plan.

""We're going to build a wall. Don't worry about it,"" Trump crowed to the crowd, saying the plans were ""way ahead of schedule.""

""As we speak today, immigration officers are finding gang members, drug dealers and criminal aliens and throwing them the hell out,"" the president said. The comments follow memos this week from the Department of Homeland Security on how it will be enforcing executive orders on immigration and border security.

Attendees loved Trump's strongman approach as he promised to rebuild the military and take on terrorism.

""As part of my pledge to restore safety for the American people, I have also directed the defense community to develop a plan to totally obliterate ISIS,"" he said to cheers. ""Working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the Earth.""

And of course he threw plenty of jabs at his favorite punching bag — the media.

Trump claimed that the ""dishonest media"" would say he didn't receive a standing ovation because everyone was standing in the room and never sat down.

And then he doubled down on his tweet a week ago calling the media the ""enemy of the people.""

Trump claimed his comments had been misrepresented because he didn't call all media the enemy — just the ""fake news,"" though he cited mainstream news sources that do not print fake news stories, such as CNN, NBC News, CBS News and others.

And he took aim at the use of anonymous or unnamed background sources in the media — even though, as is a common practice in many administrations, a ""senior administration official"" had just briefed reporters Friday morning on the condition of not being named.

""I'm against the people that make up stories and make up sources,"" Trump said. ""They shouldn't be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody's name. Let their name be put out there. Let their name be put out.""

With his usual bombast, the president boasted that ""nobody loves [the First Amendment] better than me. Nobody."" But then he went on to issue an ominous warning: ""So just in finishing, I say [the fake news] doesn't represent the people, it ... never will represent the people, and we're going to do something about it because we have to go out and have to speak our minds and we have to be honest. Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before.""

Overall, the love was palpable from both sides as Trump addressed a capacity CPAC crowd.

""I love this place. Love you people,"" the president said as he took the stage. ""I wouldn't miss a chance to talk to my friends. These are my friends.""

That wasn't always the case. A year ago he wasn't most attendees' first choice at the gathering, which is typically more libertarian-leaning and hews more closely to conservative orthodoxy than the Trump brand of populism he campaigned on. Trump ultimately did not attend.

A rising ""Never Trump"" movement was forming at that time in the campaign, but Trump said Friday that the reason he skipped out was that he ""was worried that I would be, at that time, too controversial"" given his desire for border security and a ""very, very strong military.""

Trump acknowledged that it was this very conference that may well have launched his electoral career six years ago when he made a last-minute appearance at CPAC in 2011. The way the president told it, that's where he caught the political bug, loving the people there and the ""commotion.""

""But it gave me an idea. And I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was happening in the country. And I said, 'Let's go to it,' "" Trump said. ""So, it was very exciting. I walked the stage on CPAC. I'll never forget it, really. I had very little notes and even less preparation. So when you have practically no notes and no preparation and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, I said, 'I think I like this business.' ""

Now, as White House counselor Kellyanne Conway joked during her remarks Thursday morning, the conference is beginning to feel like ""TPAC"" in honor of Trump."

Updated at 5:10 p.m. ET

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says the U.S. doesn't want to take military action against North Korea, but ""all of the options are on the table"" if a serious threat arises. Tillerson made his frank remarks in a visit to South Korea on Friday, a day after saying diplomatic efforts ""have failed"" to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.

Tillerson's Asia tour began in Japan and will end in China. The top American diplomat is traveling without a press contingent.

""The policy of strategic patience has ended,"" Tillerson said, according to The Korea Times, in an apparent reference to the Obama administration's approach. ""We are exploring a new range of diplomatic, security, economic measures. All options are on the table.""

Discussing potential military action, Tillerson said that while the U.S. would prefer to avoid an armed conflict, ""If they elevate the threat of their weapons program to a level that we believe requires action, then that option's on the table.""

""I think he's being very straight with China, and the regional allies in the Asia region — South Korea and Japan — that we're looking at negotiations all the way to preemption,"" Joseph DeTrani, former special envoy for six-party talks with North Korea, tells NPR's Audie Cornish. ""If there's an imminent strike against the United States, we have to look at all options on the table.""

North Korea is casting a long shadow over this trip, both for its potential nuclear threat and the recent flurry of missiles it tested, in a launch that sent weapons hundreds of miles toward Japan before landing in the Sea of Japan. In a news conference with Tillerson and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida on Thursday, the Korean peninsula was mentioned more than 40 times.

On Friday, concerns about North Korea prompted a missile evacuation drill on Japan's coast, where more than 100 residents of a town heard sirens and were told to take cover in an exercise that's seen as unprecedented.

But it's not only reactive measure that are necessary, DeTrani tells NPR.

""We've got to be as creative, we've got to be as forward-leaning as possible to give North Korea those off-ramps so they realize there are opportunities available to them that will not be available if they continue on the path of building nuclear and missile capabilities,"" he says.

""And part of that will be international legitimacy — normal relations with the United States — but also part of that will be having a better relationship with the country that, whether they like it or not, they're tethered to, and that's the People's Republic of China.""

Tillerson will head to China this weekend, as NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Beijing:

""The State Department says that an important part of Tillerson's agenda here will be to push Beijing to push North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programs. He is also expected to plan for a visit by President Xi Jinping to meet with President Trump at his private club in Mar-a-Lago, Fla., next month, although that hasn't been formally announced yet.""

Anthony adds, ""For its part, China wants ties with the U.S. to remain stable, so as not to distract from a leadership reshuffle this fall."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images

Updated: 5:08 p.m. ET

The Trump administration's new budget blueprint aims to quantify the president's nationalistic agenda in dollars and cents. The plan, released Thursday morning, calls for significant increases in military and border-security spending, along with corresponding cuts in many other parts of the government.

The blueprint was designed to ""send a message to our allies and our potential adversaries that this is a strong-power administration,"" Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney explained on Wednesday as he previewed the document in a briefing with reporters.

It also sends a clear message domestically: This administration is willing to make drastic, controversial cuts to fund that ""strong-power"" message. That includes slashing spending on foreign aid and the environment, as well as long-standing programs aimed at boosting the arts and humanities, as well as the fortunes of the most vulnerable Americans. The question now is how much the Republican-controlled Congress will go along with that vision.

Like any White House budget, Trump's blueprint is more of a political document than an accurate predictor of government spending. Congress controls the purse strings and lawmakers may have very different priorities. As a statement of presidential intention, though, the blueprint is crystal clear.

""This is the America First budget,"" said Mulvaney Wednesday. ""In fact, we wrote it using the president's own words. We went through his speeches. We went through articles that have been written about his policies ... and we turned those policies into numbers.""

""There's no question this is a hard-power budget,"" Mulvaney also said Wednesday. ""It is not a soft-power budget. This is a hard-power budget. And that was done intentionally.""

Trump wants lawmakers to boost military spending in the coming fiscal year by 10 percent, or $54 billion. Rather than raise taxes or increase the deficit, the president is calling for equivalent cuts in other areas. Foreign aid would be especially hard hit, with the State Department's budget cut by about 28 percent.

Alongside Defense, the agencies for which the White House proposes spending increases are almost entirely military- and national security-related. The Department of Homeland Security would see a hike in funding of 6.8 percent, as would the Department of Veterans Affairs (5.9 percent) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (11.3 percent).

""The president ran [his campaign] saying he would spend less money overseas and more money back home,"" Mulvaney said Wednesday. ""When you go to implement that policy, you go to things like foreign aid, and those get reduced.""

Critics argue the administration's single-minded focus on hard power is short-sighted, and could ultimately be detrimental to national security. They point to past comments from Defense Secretary James Mattis, a retired Marine general, who once told lawmakers, ""If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition, ultimately.""

The White House blueprint does not address major safety net programs such as Social Security and Medicare, which the president has promised to protect. But Trump is calling for sharp cuts in discretionary spending, including the Environmental Protection Agency.

The administration is proposing cutting the EPA's budget by 31 percent, from $8.3 billion in fiscal year 2017 to $5.7 billion in fiscal year 2018. That's the largest cut among all Cabinet departments and major agencies.

The budget says that slash in funding is necessary ""to ease the burden of unnecessary Federal regulations that impose significant costs for workers and consumers without justifiable environmental benefits.""

Instead of carrying out many of its current functions, the agency would ""primarily support States and Tribes in their important role protecting air, land, and water in the 21st Century,"" the document adds.

The EPA's new administrator, Scott Pruitt, is a longtime critic of what he sees as the agency's activist agenda. He and the president have both promised to scale back environmental regulation, including efforts to curb carbon pollution and promote alternative energy. Last week, Pruitt reiterated his doubts that carbon emissions are a primary contributor to climate change. That puts him at odds with the overwhelming scientific consensus.

Climate research at NASA could also take a hit under Trump's budget. The plan would reduce overall spending at NASA by around 1 percent, Mulvaney said, but would increase spending on space exploration, which Trump supports.

""We're not spending money on this anymore. We consider that a waste of your money,"" Mulvaney said about climate change research as he took questions from White House reporters at Thursday's afternoon press briefing.

In addition, funding for the National Institutes of Health would fall by 18 percent, or $5.8 billion. That cut involves ""a major reorganization of NIH's Institutes and Centers,"" including closing some of those centers, ""to help focus resources on the highest priority research.""

In a speech to a joint session of Congress last month, Trump promised to bring renewed hope and opportunity to what he called ""our neglected inner cities."" The Department of Housing and Urban Development will not be the vehicle for that effort, though.

""We've spent a lot of money on housing and urban development over the last decades without a lot to show for it,"" Mulvaney said Wednesday. He added that Trump prefers to invest in cities' infrastructure and school choice.

""Nobody's going to get kicked out of their houses,"" Mulvaney told reporters Thursday afternoon, reiterating that many of the HUD cuts were related to infrastructure and would be addressed in the massive infrastructure plan the president wants to implement.

The president's plan calls for a 6 percent increase in spending by the Department of Homeland Security, including $2.6 billion to begin work on a planned border wall. The White House is also asking Congress to devote $1.5 billion to the wall in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.

Trump claimed throughout the campaign that he would get Mexico to pay for the wall, but Mulvaney said Thursday afternoon that, ""as to the source of funds, that's up to the president, the Treasury and the State Department"" and wouldn't commit to getting the funds from Mexico.

Leading Democrats on Capitol Hill slammed Trump's budget blueprint as wrongheaded. ""President Trump is not making anyone more secure with a budget that hollows out our economy and endangers working families,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, of California, said in a statement, adding, ""The budget is a statement of values, and President Trump has shown he does not value the future of children and working families."" The Senate's top Democrat was more direct: ""Democrats in Congress will emphatically oppose these cuts & urge our Republican colleagues to reject them as well,"" Sen. Charles Schumer, of New York, said on Twitter.

The two Republican Hill leaders were supportive of the blueprint but both signaled a long process lay ahead. ""I welcome the president's blueprint for next year's budget, which turns the page from the last eight years,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan, of Wisconsin, said in a statement, adding that he looked forward to ""reviewing this with the Appropriations Committee and our entire conference."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, said he ""pleased to see an increased focus on our national security and veterans budgets,"" calling them ""positive steps in the right direction,"" according to the Washington Examiner. But McConnell added he looked forward ""to reviewing this and the full budget when it is released later this spring.""

Among all the proposed spending hikes and cuts, some areas would see spending cuts of 100 percent. The administration wants to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Together, the two groups receive about $300 million annually.

Trump also wants to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps to finance public radio and television stations. CPB received $445 million in the current fiscal year.

Several of these eliminated programs aim to help the poorest Americans. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps people pay utility bills and weatherize their homes. And the Community Development Block Grant, a part of HUD, helps support affordable housing and infrastructure (among many other things).

Grants to Meals on Wheels would also likely be eliminated as part of the cuts to the Community Development Block Grant program, and Mulvaney defended those cuts Thursday afternoon, claiming the block granting program was ""not showing any results.""

Pressed on whether cutting back or eliminating altogether programs that help the poor was not being compassionate toward people who needed help the most, Mulvaney said that passing this budget was ""one of the most compassionate things we can do"" because it was being compassionate toward taxpayers who are funding those programs.

The budget also proposes eliminating the Appalachian Regional Commission, which promotes economic development in the region stretching from northern Mississippi to western New York. Many counties in that swath heavily supported Trump in November.

Updated at 5 p.m. ET

House Republicans scrapped a vote on their health care replacement plan on Friday after defections from both the right and center that made it clear the bill would not pass.

""Obamacare is the law of the land. It is going to remain the law of the land,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan admitted shortly after he pulled the bill. ""We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future. I don't know how long it's going to take us to replace this law.""

Ryan may have admitted defeat, but President Trump chalked it up to a ""learning experience."" Trump also tried to spin the setback as an opportunity for a potential ""bipartisan"" bill in the future.

""Both parties can get together ... and have a better bill,"" he said, adding, ""Having bipartisan would be a big, big improvement.""

But Trump and Ryan both said health care is being put on the shelf for the time being. They're moving on to tax reform.

The failure of the health care bill is a major setback for Trump's leadership and Ryan's ability to control his conference. That control was something that eluded his predecessor, John Boehner, and eventually led to Boehner's ouster.

""The best thing we can do politically speaking is let Obamacare explode,"" Trump argued in the Oval Office. ""It is exploding right now.""

Trump — who is the first president to enter office without any political or legislative experience — seemed to admit there was a bit of a learning curve.

""This was an interesting period of time,"" Trump said. ""We all learned a lot. We learned a lot about loyalty and we learned a lot about the vote-getting process. And we learned about very arcane rules in both the Senate and the House. Certainly, for me, it was a very interesting experience, but for me, it'll be an experience that leads to an even better health care plan.""

Striking a more solemn tone, a dejected Ryan admitted that fulfilling the GOP's pledge to repeal the Affordable Care Act was tougher than expected.

""Moving from an opposition party to a governing party,"" Ryan said, ""comes with growing pains, and, well, we're feeling those growing pains now.""

He added, ""This is a setback — no two ways about it. ... I will not sugarcoat this — this is a disappointing day for us.""

The way forward for Republicans on exactly how to replace Obamacare remains murky. And it's not clear whether they will try again. Ryan had already delayed the bill a day to try to muster support. Trump had delivered an ultimatum to House Republicans — pass the GOP replacement, the American Health Care Act, or Obamacare will stand.

Ultimately, the votes never came together for a fractured GOP caucus, and Ryan traveled to the White House to tell Trump he was pulling the bill.

Democrats, meanwhile, were more than happy to take a victory lap in the GOP's defeat. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, whose caucus was decimated in 2010 after the health care bill was passed, appeared flanked by Democratic leadership to gloat just a day after the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act.

""It's pretty exciting for us,"" the California Democrat said, beaming. ""Yesterday the anniversary. Today is a victory for us.""

The inability of Republicans to reach consensus on a bill, given their control of the House, Senate and White House, badly hurts the GOP's image as a party that can govern, and Ryan admitted as much on Friday.

The GOP has vowed repeatedly over the past eight years that it would repeal and replace Obamacare. The legislative stalemate endangers Trump's and the GOP's agenda and casts a cloud over the legislative path forward after an election waged almost entirely as the antithesis to a progressive agenda enacted by former President Barack Obama, Trump's predecessor.

The risks were high for Trump on the bill. He has hyped a brand of someone able to strike the best deals. Being unable to get this through, after giving an ultimatum to congressional Republicans Thursday, raises questions about just how good a deal-maker he is and underscores his lack of legislative and policy experience upon entering the White House.

Vice President Pence, who canceled a trip out of Washington, had hoped to make one last sale in a meeting with the roughly 40-member, hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus, which had also refused to budge from its ideological objections to the bill.

In an attempt to win the caucus over, an amendment was added to the bill late Wednesday night, cutting essential health benefits, 10 types of medical care that insurance companies are required to cover. The Freedom Caucus wants to see premiums come down and believes cutting benefits is the way to do that.

But that also had an effect on moderates. For example, Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., who represents a swing district in the D.C. suburbs, said she wouldn't back the bill, joining more moderate Republicans who are top 2018 Democratic targets who don't want to take a tough vote that might come back to bite them during the midterms.

Rep. David Joyce, R-Ohio, another centrist Republican, announced he wouldn't support the bill either, saying in a statement that the GOP's replacement plan was no better than Obamacare.

And House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., also broke ranks with GOP leadership on Friday, announcing that he was a no vote. His reasoning: The current bill adds too many new costs and barriers, along with taking away benefits requirements.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer had maintained at his daily briefing that a vote was still slated for this afternoon. He said Trump had ""left everything on the field"" to try to woo Republican members, having contacted over 120 members. But his tone and tense were notable.

Spicer wouldn't concede that the bill might fail, but he did admit that ""at the end of the day, you can't force somebody to do something.""

He added, ""At the end of the day, this isn't a dictatorship."""

President Trump was downright low energy.

The look on his face, as he meandered through unscripted remarks Friday after the defeat of the Republican health care plan he supported, told the story. The unusually subdued Trump called the loss a ""learning experience."" Then he seemed to shrug it all off and said he was moving on.

But it's hardly going to be that simple or easy. The same fissures in the GOP that derailed the health care bill will be there when it comes to any big issue moving forward, whether it's tax reform, infrastructure or funding the government. And Republicans warn that, unless the president is willing to learn and own the details, the result will likely be the same — failure.

""Trump's defeat this week was entirely predictable,"" said Alex Conant, who worked on Marco Rubio's presidential campaign and was a spokesman for the Republican National Committee and the Bush White House. ""He has never showed any detailed knowledge of health care policy and has few relationships in Congress. Getting health care passed was always going to be a heavy lift, but Republicans should be concerned that Trump couldn't even get it off the ground.""

During the campaign, Trump connected with a significant chunk of the country with big, bold promises. But on arguably his (and the GOP's) highest-profile promise — repealing and replacing Obamacare — he flamed out in one of the most embarrassing ways possible just 64 days into his presidency. It's unlikely that Republican voters will be satisfied with leaving Obamacare in place.

""It failed brilliantly,"" said another Republican strategist, who requested anonymity to speak frankly about a president the strategist may be working with on upcoming priorities. ""Going forward, I would expect there would be a greater ownership on the White House's part on the legislation that is being advanced, and he's going to have to be in a position to know the details.""

No one looks good

No one comes off looking good in the debacle — not House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was the brains behind the bill and led the legislative strategy; not White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who is close to Ryan; not White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who reportedly tried to play hardball with the roughly 40 hard-line conservatives of the House Freedom Caucus, who were largely responsible for the bill's defeat.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images

""I don't give a s*** what you guys think,"" Bannon reportedly told them, per CNN, in a meeting Thursday before the bill went down.

""Guys, look, this is not a discussion,"" Bannon said, per Axios. ""This is not a debate. You have no choice but to vote for this bill.""

Trump himself showed a level of impetuousness with the Freedom Caucus and a lack of policy understanding that eventually did him in.

""Forget about that little s***,"" Trump told the group Thursday, per Politico. ""Let's focus on the big picture here.""

That might be how campaigning works, but it's not how governing does. Sweating the little stuff is important when it comes to legislating. That's especially true for the big things Trump wants to tackle.

But, though Trump said he had ""learned a lot"" and wants to move on, he was looking backward over the weekend, tweeting blame at the Freedom Caucus — a group he underestimated:

It's a group that won't be intimidated by ultimatums or tweets. Current House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes of California once referred to the conservatives who became the Freedom Caucus as ""lemmings with suicide vests.""

Trump is going to have to figure out how to deal with them.

He also faced opposition from more moderate Republicans, like Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, who were averse to the ramifications of the policy laid out in the GOP bill. Dent did not deny an exchange reported by Robert Draper in the New York Times Magazine, in which Trump said he was ""destroying the Republican Party"" and was going to be blamed for foiling tax reform by blocking the health care plan.

Part of Trump's ""learning experience"" was seeing how members of Congress may care more about what their constituents think than their president does. Trump may be the leader of the Republican Party, but he isn't its CEO.

Winning isn't everything, and the ""little s***"" matters

Trump likes to win. He told the country during the presidential campaign that we would all get so tired of winning under him that we would all be so bored. The Art of the Deal author hyped himself as the best dealmaker anyone's ever seen.

Instead, his first major effort at legislating handed him a stunning loss. It was a textbook chapter in how not to legislate.

Part of the problem is that Trump wanted a win on health care so badly that he may have been blinded by his willingness to take any win.

He outsourced the details to Ryan and others, and when it got difficult, Trump didn't have enough policy knowledge to close the deal.

""How he was dismissive of policy concerns, and instead focused on the big picture and big political issue, that is never going to get you a win when you're negotiating with Congress,"" Conant warned.

Health care affects one-sixth of the U.S. economy and includes lots of ""little"" things that are important to real people's lives.

Every year Medicaid expansion is limited or rolled back means potentially millions of people who don't have access to health care.

Every ""essential health benefit"" that's put on the chopping block, for, oh say, whether your insurance is required to cover emergency room visits, means potentially thousands of dollars in or out of constituents' and hospitals' pockets.

The ""little"" stuff is the important stuff.

Conservative writer Matt Lewis observed during the brief debate over the GOP health care bill how far it strayed from Trump's campaign platform. ""He ran as a guy, 'I will solve your problems. I want to take care of everybody. Nobody's going to lose anything. Everybody's going to have the best health care.' This health care plan is off-brand for Donald Trump,"" Lewis told NPR's Mara Liasson.

An enduring problem for the president may be that his brand of populism doesn't necessarily match the small-government conservatism that defines the House GOP Conference.

Sure, Trump made the phone calls and lobbied wavering Republicans, but he grew impatient and frustrated. After less than three weeks, he issued an ultimatum to those hardline conservatives — he was done negotiating: vote for this bill, or Obamacare stays in place.

It was a big gamble, and he lost.

""Winning"" isn't everything; it really is how you play the game in Washington that enables winning. And when it came to playing the legislative game, Trump's lack of attention to policy detail, impatience and cavalier impetuousness cost him.

""He should know, from being engaged in a lot of negotiations, if you're constantly looking over your shoulder and needing someone to fill in the details in the conversation sometimes that doesn't wear real well,"" the strategist said.

Learning from Obama

There's a reason it took former President Obama more than a year to pass the Affordable Care Act.

He knew the details, and was often the best — and only — salesperson for it. He took the show on the road and got into the nitty gritty.

Pete Souza, the former White House photographer, subtly made that point in a post on Instagram on Saturday:

President Obama working on his health care speech that he made to a Joint Session of Congress in September 2009, six months before the Affordable Care Act was voted on in Congress. A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Mar 25, 2017 at 7:14am PDT

""Give credit where it's due, Obama was really good at that,"" the strategist said. ""Obama was really good at working with individual members knowing the legislation as well or better than they did. They [the Trump White House] need to get to that level, or close to it, or there are going to be gross inefficiencies built in and opportunities that are lost.""

That is going to have to include more coalition-building inside and outside the GOP conference, with outside conservative groups, as well as industry groups.

""He didn't spend much time or political capital to get this bill through,"" Conant said.

Conant also pointed out that part of the problem is a level of distrust within the White House for everyone in ""the establishment"" and anyone who hasn't been on Team Trump all along.

""There continue to be a lot of vacancies,"" Conant said, ""and they have rejected a lot of people who have government experience because of loyalty tests from the campaign.""

That eliminates a lot of professionals with experience on Capitol Hill.

If Trump doesn't start to focus on the details and become more invested in how government works — something he has always been loath to do — he should expect similar results.

""There's an eagerness on all sides to move on, to put this episode behind and move on to a new issue,"" Conant said. ""But regardless of what issue we turn to next, Trump will likely run into the same internal GOP divisions and partisan opposition. To be a successful president, Trump will have to display skills that we have not yet seen from him.

""It will require humility, patience, outreach to opponents and the forging of consensus."""

Updated at 8:15 p.m. ET

The head of the House Intelligence Committee secretly went to the White House grounds to meet with a source, before he surprised his colleagues by briefing the president — and the press — on information they hadn't seen.

The revelation, first reported by CNN and later confirmed by a spokesman for the chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, is the latest twist in the strange saga of Nunes' unorthodox actions last week.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in this tweet that Nunes should recuse himself ""from involvement in investigation/oversight of Trump campaign & transition.""

""This is not a recommendation I make lightly,"" added Schiff.

House minority leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also called for Nunes to recuse himself from investigations of any Trump connections with Russia.

The statements came shortly after Nunes, in a live interview with CNN, said that it is very common for him to go to an executive branch building such as the White House, Pentagon, or CIA to review classified documents.

Nunes said he did not meet with the president or his aides while he was on the White House grounds.

""I'm quite sure that people in the West Wing had no idea that I was there,"" he said.

Earlier in the day, Nunes announced that the House Intelligence Committee will not hold a closed hearing on Tuesday as scheduled with the directors of the FBI and National Security Agency.

You'll remember that President Trump has claimed, without evidence, that his campaign was illegally surveilled by the Obama administration. The claim has been denounced at the highest levels of the intelligence community. But the explosive allegation has come up several times as the committee attempts to investigate Russian meddling in the U.S. election, and the handling of classified information in connection to that story.

Nunes (R-Calif.), the committee chairman, raised eyebrows on Wednesday when he gave a press conference to say President Trump and his transition team were accidentally caught up in routine U.S. surveillance of foreign targets.

Nunes himself said there was no sign the Trump team was targeted specifically, and that the surveillance appeared to be wholly legal. The conversations in question also happened after the election and, as observers have noted, could include remarks about Trump and his team. Still, Trump claimed the press conference as partial vindication.

Nunes said his announcement was based on classified intelligence from an unnamed source and that he had briefed the president. Notably, no one else had seen the information — including the other members of the House Intelligence Committee. Rep. Schiff called that ""bizarre"" and ""wrong."" (Nunes later apologized to his colleagues.)

The briefing raised a number of questions. One big one: Where did that intelligence come from?

""Democrats were skeptical, and immediately questioned whether Nunes had obtained his information from the White House itself,"" NPR's Scott Detrow reports. ""Now, a Nunes spokesman says the Republican did meet with his source on the White House grounds.""

The spokesman says that the location was chosen for its ""proximity to a secure location."" There are, of course, other secure locations available on Capitol Hill.

The Trump administration has denied that it provided the information to Nunes. On Thursday White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that idea didn't pass the ""smell test,"" asking why Nunes would brief the president on information if it came from the president's team.

At a press conference on Monday, Spicer said he didn't know what Nunes saw or what he said to Trump.

He referred questions about the origin of the information to Nunes, but when pressed on whether it might have come from a White House staffer, Spicer said ""anything's possible.""

The administration has delivered some harsh rhetoric over earlier leaks of information, but Spicer didn't express concern that there might be a leak from inside the administration. Instead, he noted that Nunes was cleared to view classified material — drawing a contrast between leaks to reporters and the passing of any information to Nunes.

Here's more on what we know about Nunes' meeting, from The Associated Press:

""Nunes' office said the information provided to the chairman came from 'executive branch documents that have not been provided to Congress.' "" 'Because of classification rules, the source could not simply put the documents in a backpack and walk them over to the House Intelligence Committee space,' [Nunes spokesman Jack] Langer said. 'The White House grounds was the best location to safeguard the proper chain of custody and classification of these documents, so the chairman could view them in a legal way.' ""

Nunes has not identified his source. Any White House staffer can approve a visitor to the White House grounds, the AP notes.

Nunes' spokesman did not specify when he visited White House property.

Last week the Daily Beast reported, citing anonymous sources, that Nunes ""jumped out out of an Uber"" on Tuesday evening after receiving a message on his phone, and didn't tell his staffers where he went. The press conference was held on Wednesday.

CNN has since reported a similar account of Nunes abruptly leaving a staffer on Tuesday night. On Friday, ranking member Rep. Schiff appeared to allude to the incident as a mysterious ""dead of night excursion.""

Schiff has been sharply critical of Nunes' recent decisions, including holding Wednesday's press conference and cancelling a public hearing this Tuesday. Schiff is one of several voices on Capitol Hill calling for an independent investigation of Russian intrusion in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Meanwhile, the Senate's investigation is moving forward. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will be talking to the Senate committee, and the committee will hold its first open hearing on Thursday."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Matt Dunham/AP Matt Dunham/AP

Updated at 4:30 a.m. ET Thursday

British authorities have made eight arrests in their investigation into Wednesday's attack in London, police said Thursday morning.

Mark Rowley, the national lead for counterterrorism policing, told reporters that there were four dead, including the attacker, and 29 people have been treated in hospitals. Seven people are in critical condition, he said.

Police had earlier said there were five dead including the attacker.

Overnight, police raided properties, including in London and in the city of Birmingham, which is located in central England to the northwest of London. Rowley said police have searched six addresses in connection with the investigation.

""It is still our belief — which continues to be born out by our investigation — that this attacker acted alone yesterday and was inspired by international terrorism,"" he said, reading from a statement. ""To be explicit — at this stage, we have no specific information about further threats to the public.""

The attack happened midday Wednesday, near the U.K. Parliament building. An assailant killed two civilians and a police officer before being shot to death, British authorities say.

Police described it as a terrorist incident Wednesday. Rowley said police believe they know, but aren't ready to release, the name of the man they believe was a single attacker.

Rowley requested that journalists refrain from ""unnecessary reporting"" while investigators check into the suspect's background and any associates. He said police suspect the attack was inspired by Islamist extremism.

He identified the police officer who was killed as Keith Palmer, 48, an officer for 15 years and a husband and father.

Rowley said the public will see more police officers on patrol, especially in crowded places and ""iconic locations.""

Prime Minister Theresa May condemned the attack as ""sick and depraved"" in remarks on Wednesday evening.

Authorities say a small SUV barreled into pedestrians along the sidewalk of Westminster Bridge, causing multiple ""catastrophic injuries"" to pedestrians.

Rowley said he believes this is where the civilian deaths occurred. Three police officers, who happened to be returning from a commendation ceremony, were also injured by the vehicle, he said.

Three teenage French students on a school trip to London were also among the wounded, Reuters reports.

A woman was found in the Thames after the attack, alive but injured; how she fell in the river is not clear.

After striking the pedestrians on the bridge, the SUV then crashed into the fence that surrounds Parliament. A man armed with a knife emerged and stabbed a police officer before being shot to death by police.

British law enforcement officers do not typically carry guns, but the Metropolitan Police said on Twitter that armed officers were among the law enforcement personnel ""on scene and dealing with the incident.""

The officer who was fatally stabbed was not armed, Rowley said.

The British press reports that a member of Parliament was among the people providing first aid to the police officer who was stabbed. Photographs show Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood, his face bloodied, crouched at the heart of a group of emergency responders.

Ellwood is a former soldier whose brother died in the 2002 terrorist attack in Bali, The Telegraph reports.

The U.K. House of Commons was put under lockdown, as NPR's Frank Langfitt in London reports. Here's more from Frank on how the incident unfolded, beginning with the events on Westminster Bridge:

""This is the bridge that goes right up to Big Ben — it crosses the Thames. And it appears that a vehicle went across the bridge [and] went down the sidewalk. And we can see from aerial helicopter shots that in fact there are at least four or five people being treated, lying on sidewalk. Then it came across the bridge [and] crashed into a gate; the front end is smashed up. ""And then somehow a man ... got actually inside the gates of the Parliament building and apparently stabbed a police officer.""

House of Commons business was suspended for approximately 15 minutes before Commons Leader David Lidington told members of Parliament about the situation, saying a police officer had been stabbed and the alleged assailant shot by armed police.

During the lockdown, members of the House of Commons nearly filled the chamber's famed green benches — moments earlier, the benches sat empty after a sparsely attended debate over pension plan rules.

MPs later voted to adjourn Parliament for the remainder of the day. But Parliament says it will return to its normal schedule Thursday.

""For this to happen right in the heart of the city is very shocking,"" Frank added. It's also surprising that an attacker appears to have gotten into the heavily fortified premises of Parliament.

The nearby Westminster metro station was closed ""due to a police investigation,"" city authorities said Wednesday, and police asked members of the public to steer clear of the area.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said President Trump spoke with the prime minister.

""The victims in this are in our thoughts and our prayers. The city of London and her majesty's government have the full support of the U.S. government in responding to the attack and bringing those to justice who are responsible.

This is a developing story. Some things that get reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from police officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images

Updated at 10:30 a.m. ET

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill want the Trump administration to outline a broader strategy in Syria following the president's decision to authorize U.S. missile strikes Thursday night in response to the apparent chemical weapons attack by Syrian President Bashar Assad.

""I think it was appropriate but I would like to say, despite all the enthusiasm we see this morning, if I might quote [Winston] Churchill, 'It's the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end,' "" Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., told MSNBC on Friday morning.

He added: ""We have a Middle East in chaos, the Europeans being destabilized, the spread of [the Islamic State] throughout the world. This is the challenge of Bashar al-Assad, and then we have also got the challenge of ISIS, so there's a lot more to go.""

Speaking on the Senate floor, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R.-Ky., urged the administration to collaborate, and elaborate, on where the strategy goes from here. ""In the days ahead, I am committed to working with the administration to continue developing a counter-ISIL strategy that hastens the defeat of ISIL and establishes objectives for dealing with the Assad regime in a manner that preserves the institutions of government in an effort to prevent a failed state,"" he said.

""Making sure Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said late Thursday. ""It is incumbent on the Trump administration to come up with a strategy and consult with Congress before implementing it.""

Senators were scheduled to hold a classified briefing with military and intelligence officials Friday afternoon. The Senate adjourns Friday afternoon for the two-week Spring recess; the House has already left town for the break.

Questions about constitutionality

Some Democrats, and at least two Republicans, are questioning the strikes' constitutionality. The military action also is reviving debate over Congress' role in the matter and whether the president needs to obtain congressional authorization for any prolonged military engagement in the region.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who favors a more isolationist foreign policy approach, wrote on Twitter, ""The President needs Congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution.""

Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., echoed Paul's remarks: ""Airstrikes are an act of war. Atrocities in Syria cannot justify departure from Constitution, which vests in Congress power to commence war.""

That notion is supported by Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif. — a prominent liberal supporter of Congress passing a new authorization for the use of military force (AUMF). On Twitter, Lee characterized the airstrikes as ""an act of war.""

Lee tweeted: ""I was the lone vote against 2001 AUMF. Syria strikes are far beyond the scope of this war authorization. Speaker Ryan needs to bring a vote.""

President Trump — like President Barack Obama before him — has launched airstrikes against ISIS targets using as legal justification the 2001 war authorization Congress passed after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But lawmakers are split over whether that justification covers attacks against the Assad government.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said the strike was ""appropriate and just"" and signaled that he also wants the Trump administration to consult Capitol Hill lawmakers on the matter. ""I look forward to the administration further engaging Congress in this effort,"" he said."

Updated at 4:50 p.m. ET

North Carolina has repealed portions of the state's controversial ""bathroom bill,"" including the requirement that trans people use the bathroom that matches their birth certificate, member station WUNC reports.

Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper said he has signed the repeal measure, which he said is ""not perfect"" but is ""an important step forward.""

At a news conference on Thursday he said the compromise repeal, which leaves in place a temporary prohibition on local anti-discrimination measures, was a necessary compromise with a Republican-controlled Legislature.

Around the Nation North Carolina's 'Bathroom Bill,' A Year Later North Carolina's 'Bathroom Bill,' A Year Later Listen · 3:06 3:06

""It stops short of many things we need to do as a state,"" he said, calling for a ""clean repeal"" of HB2 and statewide LGBT protections in the future.

The compromise deal was announced late on Wednesday by Cooper and Republican state lawmakers. They said they had agreed on a way to repeal portions of HB2 — just in time for a deadline set by the NCAA.

The agreement removes the limits on trans bathroom use but ""would still leave state legislators in charge of policy on public restrooms,"" WUNC reports. Like HB2, it also blocks local jurisdictions from passing anti-discrimination measures protecting LGBT people — but only until 2020, instead of indefinitely.

Cooper also emphasized on Thursday that the compromise measure allows local governments to set LGBT protections for their own employees and contractors, even though they can't set them for the public.

Debate on the measure showed Democrats were divided on the measure, WUNC's Jeff Tiberii reports. You can see more coverage of the debate at WUNC's website.

LGBT activists quickly denounced the proposal, which would limit the ability of local officials to extend protections to transgender citizens for several years.

Cooper acknowledged that he was frustrated, even as he defended the compromise.

""Under HB2 that kind of justice was permanently denied,"" Cooper said, whereas under the compromise it's only delayed. ""I wish it were sooner than 2020, I really do.""

The compromise has also angered some conservatives who supported the original measure. One senator who supported the bill spoke during the Senate debate on Thursday, calling it ""at best a punt; at worst, a betrayal of principle,"" Tiberii reports.

Republican leaders Rep. Tim Moore and Sen. Phil Berger of North Carolina's General Assembly said in a statement late Wednesday: ""Compromise requires give and take from all sides, and we are pleased this proposal fully protects bathroom safety and privacy.""

According to Moore and Berger, the bill leaves regulation of ""multi-occupancy facilities to the state"" and puts in place a ""temporary moratorium on local ordinances similar to Charlotte's until December 1, 2020, to allow federal litigation to play out.""

Cooper, who eked out a win over former Republican Gov. Pat McCrory in November's election, said he supports the bill.

The agreement was reached shortly before a deadline that would have caused North Carolina to lose the option of hosting NCAA basketball championships, Reuters reports.

The college athletic association and other civic and business groups had taken steps to sanction or boycott North Carolina because of the law.

It's not yet clear whether the deal will be sufficient for the NCAA.

Lawmakers passed HB2 in March 2016 under McCrory. In addition to the bathroom restrictions, the law also limits localities' ability to pass nondiscrimination protections and minimum wage measures.

State lawmakers passed the measure in response to a Charlotte ordinance that would have protected the rights of transgender people to use restrooms corresponding to their gender identity.

Chad Griffin, president of the LGBT rights organization Human Rights Campaign, tweeted that the deal was a ""state-wide prohibition on equality"" and ""doubles down on discrimination.""

Previous deals to repeal HB2 have fallen apart.

Earlier this week, The Associated Press estimated that a continuation of HB2 would cost North Carolina $3.76 billion over the course of 12 years."

Enlarge this image toggle caption AP AP

President Trump threatened Iran in a late-night tweet on Sunday, responding angrily after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani criticized Trump and warned the American president not to ""play with the lion's tail"" and that ""war with Iran is the mother of all wars.""

Trump's tweet, posted in all-capital letters: ""NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.""

He declared, ""WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!""

At a gathering of Iranian diplomats in Tehran on Sunday, according to Iran's state news agency, Rouhani said, ""America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars.""

Iran can defend itself, Rouhani added, hinting that his country could also affect oil shipping through the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf if it were to come under attack.

As for how Trump's response has been received, Iran's state news agency said the tweet was typical of the American president's ""bullying words.""

NPR's Peter Kenyon reports some people have pointed out that ""you can't really do all-caps in Persian, that doesn't quite translate. But no mistaking the threatening nature of the message.""

Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee tweeted a retort to the president's message, saying, ""DON'T BE DISTRACTED BY ALL CAPS. WE'RE NOT ATTACKING IRAN.""

They then urged Trump to hold Russia responsible for interfering in the 2016 U.S. election.

Also on Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo launched a blistering attack on Iran in remarks at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California.

Pompeo accused Iran of corruption and mismanagement at the highest levels and said the country had backed terrorist attacks in Europe even as it tried to reassure EU members that Iran will follow restrictions in their nuclear agreement.

In pointed remarks, Pompeo said Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, controls a hedge fund valued at $95 billion — a fund called the Setad (and on which Reuters did a special report in 2013).

""That wealth is untaxed, it is ill-gotten, and it is used as a 'slush fund' for the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps],"" Pompeo said. ""The level of corruption and wealth among Iranian leaders shows that Iran is run by something that resembles the mafia more than a government.""

Pompeo also tweeted a succession of messages in Farsi, trying to bring his message directly to any Iranians able to skirt their country's censors. In them, he said Iran's 1979 revolution had borne ""bitter fruit.""

Pompeo said, ""After 40 years of tyranny, the proud Iranian people are not staying silent about their government's abuses. We will not stay silent either.""

In Tehran, Rouhani questioned whether the U.S. can embrace Iran's people while fighting its government, saying, ""There were no times in the past like today that we are witnessing the White House acting against the international law, Islamic World and Palestinian people.""

Trump's tweet prompted questions about what the president meant by ""consequences"" for Iran, aside from the economic sanctions the U.S. is already set to reimpose after leaving the Iran nuclear deal.

On Monday morning, the White House released this statement from national security adviser John Bolton: ""I spoke to the president over the last several days, and President Trump told me that if Iran does anything at all to the negative, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid before.""

The timing of Trump's heated remarks also raised the question of why he decided to issue his tweet late Sunday — after a week of negative attention for his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Monday, and the revelation that his former attorney Michael Cohen recorded him in 2016 discussing payments to a woman who claimed she had an affair with Trump.

""Donald Trump likes to direct the media narrative, to control it,"" NPR's Mara Liasson said on Morning Edition. ""And he's gotten us all talking about Iran this morning, instead of talking about Putin, or the investigation into Russian interference.""

Mara noted that Trump also directed violent language toward North Korea — before meeting with Kim Jong Un in Singapore. ""Sometimes he likes to create a crisis, and then become the hero of his own story and declare the crisis over,"" Liasson said.

In the case of North Korea, she pointed out, the crisis was declared over despite any nuclear weapons being dismantled."

This morning on MSNBC's Morning Joe, there was a tense confrontation between Chris Matthews and the Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chris Pizzello/AP Chris Pizzello/AP

Well, perhaps calling it a confrontation might imply two were involved when for most part, it was Matthews dumping on Priebus, whose party he accused of playing the ""race card.""

The conversation involved two things, mostly: The Mitt Romney joke about Obama's birth certificate that made news last week, and the Romney ad that falsely claims President Obama ""quietly ended the work requirement, gutting welfare reform.""

During the whole exchange, Priebus and the other guests looked uncomfortable and one of the show's hosts even asked that the panel work on their ""tone.""

Here's the video:

YouTube

And here's how The Huffington Post describes the exchange:

""'That cheap shot ... was awful,' Matthews said, referring to the joke. 'It is an embarrassment to your party to play that card ... you are playing that ethnic card there.' As Priebus apparently laughed and co-host Joe Scarborough tried to get a word in, Matthews continued, 'you can sit there and giggle about it, but the fact is your party is playing that card.' ""'You think Mitt Romney's playing the race card?' Scarborough asked. ""'There's no doubt he did,' Matthews said. Co-host Mika Brzezinski speculated that Romney may have said what he said because he is an 'awkward joker.' ""Priebus said Matthews was just trying to 'push his brand' with his 'monologue.' ""'It just seems funny that the first joke [Romney] ever told in his life was about Obama's birth certificate,' Matthews said.""

Priebus noted that it was Obama who joked about the issue during a Washington Correspondents Dinner. Needless to say, the two did not find middle ground and the argument ended with awkward silence and both of them accusing each other of spewing garbage.

Elon James White, the host of This Week In Blackness, agrees with Matthews in his latest commentary. He points out that it's not necessarily the birth certificate that matters, he said. It was the rest of what Romney said — the implication that Obama, unlike he and his wife, did not belong — that brought race into the equation.

That kind of language, said White, has been a part of the campaign for a while. White said that was, perhaps, best exemplified when a Romney campaign advisor told a British newspaper that Romney, unlike Obama, understood the shared ""Anglo-Saxon heritage"" between the U.S. and Britain. (It's important to point out that Romney and his campaign disowned those comments.)

What do you think? Is there a racial undercurrent in the presidential race? Or are people looking too closely at a joke or an attack ad?

Enlarge this image toggle caption Pool/Getty Images Pool/Getty Images

Updated at 5:00 p.m. ET

In a blow to President Trump, a federal judge says a lawsuit that alleges Trump's business interests violate the Constitution can proceed.

Federal District Judge Peter Messitte denied the Department of Justice's request to dismiss a case brought by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia. The Emoluments Clause bars any president from personally profiting from his dealings with foreign governments — or even U.S. state governments.

It's the first ruling in federal court to define ""emolument,"" which goes undefined in the U.S. Constitution's two emoluments clauses.

Messitte rejected the ""cramped interpretation"" of the term offered by the Justice Department. He wrote that the term applies to ""any profit, gain or advantage"" of value that Trump has gotten from foreign, the federal or domestic governments.

""Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the President has been receiving or is potentially able to receive 'emoluments' from foreign, the federal and state governments in violation of the Constitution,"" wrote Messitte.

Until the Trump administration, emoluments have been an obscure part of the Constitution, said John Mikhail, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, whose research was cited in Messitte's opinion.



""I think it comes as a surprise to many people that there are terms in the Constitution, individual words that at this late date, 230-plus years into the operation of the Constitution, that those have never been authoritatively adjudicated,"" said Mikhail.

The judge's decision clears the way for the Maryland and District of Columbia legal teams to begin the discovery process, which could include requesting sensitive financial information from the president and the Trump Organization.

The Justice Department, which represents Trump in this matter, argues the clause is not relevant to Trump's businesses. ""We continue to maintain that this case should be dismissed,"" said Andy Reuss, a spokesman for the Justice Department.

It's the second victory for Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, who were granted legal standing to sue Trump in March. They allege their jurisdictions are economically and financially harmed as political and diplomatic officials shift their business to Trump's downtown Washington, D.C., hotel from nearby convention centers owned by those governments.

""Today's historic ruling is a substantial step forward to ensure President Trump stops violating our nation's original anti-corruption laws,"" said Racine. ""The Constitution is clear: The president can't accept money or other benefits from foreign or domestic governments.""

After opening shortly before the 2016 election, the Trump International Hotel has quickly became a favorite gathering place for the president's supporters, who frequently hold fundraisers and conferences there. Foreign governments have also held events and put dignitaries up in the hotel.

The hotel is housed in the Old Post Office, which is owned by the federal government and leased by the Trump Organization. Legal challenges to the Trump Organization's lease on the property have not succeeded."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Leah Millis/Reuters Leah Millis/Reuters

Ivanka Trump is closing her fashion company, saying her commitments in helping her father in Washington — and the limits imposed on her business as a result — have left her with no other option.

""After 17 months in Washington, I do not know when or if I will ever return to the business,"" Ivanka Trump said in a statement, ""but I do know that my focus for the foreseeable future will be the work I am doing here in Washington, so making this decision now is the only fair outcome for my team and partners.""

The move comes after Trump faced scrutiny for her commercial enterprises as she joined her father to work as a senior adviser in the White House. Questions of potentially preferential treatment were raised after China granted more than a dozen trademarks to Trump's company. Chinese officials said there was nothing improper with the government handled the trademark applications.

The fashion and clothing brand generated at least $5 million for Trump via the trust she formed to control it last year, according to documents that the White House released in June. Taken together, Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, reported earnings of at least $82 million in 2017.

Confirming the shutdown, the company released a statement saying, ""This decision has nothing to do with the performance of the brand and is based solely on Ivanka's decision to remain in Washington indefinitely.""

The company also cited the ""strict limitations on the business"" that were put in place when Trump resigned to take up a job in the government.

The original business had been structured around growth, the company said, adding that the restrictions placed on it due to ethics rules ""limited the brand's ability to grow — both domestically and abroad.""

Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, called its closure ""a very difficult decision for Ivanka.""

Critics had questioned several instances when Trump's role in her father's administration was seen overlapping with the business that bore her name.

After she appeared on 60 Minutes with President Trump, for instance, the company pushed out an ad for the expensive bracelet she had worn during the segment. And less than two weeks into the administration taking office, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News, ""Go buy Ivanka's stuff.""

Existing Ivanka Trump products will continue to be sold under existing licensing contracts that have put the company's wares on shelves at stores such as Lord & Taylor, Dillard's and Bloomingdale's, and online at Zappos, Amazon and other sites.

Ivanka Trump first ventured into the fashion business in 2007, when she started selling a line of jewelry. She launched her brand in its current form in 2014. Soon afterward, the company added footwear and handbags, before expanding into areas from denim and activewear to baby bedding products.

The number of full-time employees at the Ivanka Trump brand wasn't included in a news release about the closure. The company's website currently lists a staff of 12.

In her statement about winding down the company, Trump added, ""While we will not continue our mission together, I know that each of them will thrive in their next chapter."""

Updated at 7:33 p.m. ET

On the first day of Paul Manafort's trial, prosecutors sought to paint him as a man with absurdly extravagant taste who thought he was above the law, while the former Trump campaign manager's defense lawyers tossed blame onto one of his closest associates.

Most tax and bank fraud cases are built on stacks of bland business documents and Internal Revenue Service paperwork — hardly the stuff of international intrigue.

But the trial of Manafort, which began Tuesday in a suburban Washington, D.C., courthouse, is already upending those low expectations. The trial is the first brought on indictments by special counsel Robert Mueller's office.

TV crews were in place setting up outside the courthouse before 5 a.m., and a jury of six men and six women, largely white, was seated before the lunch break of the trial's first day. There are also four alternate jurors, three of whom are women.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Uzo Asonye's opening statement followed the strategy prosecuting lawyers have planned for the trial. They plan to call witnesses who they say demonstrate how Manafort spent his allegedly ill-gotten gains: custom-made suits, Persian rugs, landscaping fees, Land Rovers and Mercedes-Benz vehicles, and season tickets to the New York Yankees, among other items.

Manafort is accused of paying for that lifestyle, which Asonye also specifically mentioned included a $15,000 jacket ""made from an ostrich,"" by evading taxes on money he made for political consulting work in Ukraine and lying to banks to get loans.

""A man in this courtroom believed the law did not apply to him,"" Asonye said.

Asonye said Manafort made $60 million in Ukraine between 2010 and 2014, and operated 30 bank accounts in three foreign countries in an effort to skirt tax laws.

Manafort's defense attorney, Thomas Zehnle, however, vehemently disagreed with that characterization in his opening statement. Instead, he presented Manafort as a self-made, second-generation immigrant, and a ""driving force in the candidacy of multiple U.S. presidents.""

""Paul Manafort has rendered a valuable service to our system of government,"" Zehnle said.

Manafort was often on the road, sometimes seven time zones away from his political consulting business, so he relied on his business partner Richard Gates to handle operations and finances, the defense lawyer argued.

""We're primarily here because of one man — Rick Gates,"" Zehnle said.

Gates abused Manafort's trust and allegedly embezzled from the business, only to take a guilty plea and become the government's star witness in the case. His goal was to save himself from prison time and having to pay back taxes, Zehnle said.

Special counsel Robert Mueller did not appear in court for the first day of the trial. Two of his deputies, James Quarles and Aaron Zebley, sat in the audience for the opening statements.

It's what may not come up much during the trial in Alexandria, Va., that will draw attention from all over the world: Manafort's work for candidate Donald Trump for a critical period in 2016 when Trump clinched the Republican nomination for president.

In pretrial arguments, prosecutor Greg Andres told the court that the government would only bring up Manafort's campaign work in the context of a witness from a bank that gave him a loan, with the expectation that the banker would win consideration for a post in the Trump administration.

""I don't anticipate that a government witness will utter the word 'Russia,' "" Andres said.

Manafort's defense team has argued that any mention of Trump could be seized on by jurors who have an unfavorable view of the president.

""Evidence or argument relating to Mr. Manafort's work for then-candidate Trump's campaign in 2016 or the Special Counsel's investigation of the campaign's alleged collusion with the Russian government is wholly irrelevant to whether Mr. Manafort's personal income tax returns were false, whether he willfully failed to file reports of foreign accounts, and whether he conspired to commit, or committed, bank fraud,"" defense lawyers wrote.

There was no mention in the courtroom of President Trump on the trial's first day.

Judge T.S. Ellis III opened the trial, and jury selection, by reading 60 potential jurors a brief summary of the indictment and reminded them that the indictment itself was ""not proof of a crime.""

Already, Ellis has confronted questions about whether prospective jurors can be impartial in the highly charged case. Earlier this month, the judge denied a bid by Manafort to move the case out of Alexandria. The defense had worried that voters in Northern Virginia leaned more Democratic than in the western part of the state in 2016, but the Reagan-appointed judge said that was not the standard to assess whether a defendant could receive a fair trial.

""On the basis of the record presented thus far, there is no reason to believe that fair and impartial jurors cannot be found in the Eastern District of Virginia,"" the judge concluded.

The prospective jurors filled out a lengthy questionnaire that asks about their experience with the criminal justice system and their familiarity with Ukraine. Manafort's work for the pro-Russian government in Ukraine plays a central role in the allegations against him, because prosecutors say he concealed income from that work from U.S. tax officials and allegedly laundered more than $18 million in proceeds.

The heart of the government's case involves nine years of Manafort's lucrative lobbying and consulting for Ukraine and its former leader Viktor Yanukovych, work the U.S. government said Manafort should have registered with the Justice Department. The grand jury indictment accused Manafort of funneling the money to offshore accounts in Cyprus, the Seychelles and other locations, as well as failing to report it to the IRS.

When Yanukovych fled to Russia, Manafort and his business partner Gates experienced a severe cash crunch, and the men allegedly began leveraging real estate to take out new loans, providing false or incomplete profit and loss statements and other data to banks.

Gates has since pleaded guilty and agreed to help prosecutors with their case, as one of the government's star witnesses. That leaves Manafort, 69, facing charges that could keep him behind bars for the rest of his life.

Manafort's defense team has filed a flurry of motions — to suppress evidence gathered from a Virginia storage unit, to challenge the mandate of the special counsel and to delay the trial — nearly all of which it has lost so far. A legal defense fund set up to help cover his mounting bills praises his ""lifetime of service"" to ""no less than four United States presidents.""

Responding to allegations that Manafort took the campaign job with Trump in 2016 to pay off debts he owed to a Russian oligarch, the defense fund website asserts that he was ""motivated solely by his appreciation and ardor for our country.""

""Hearing the voice of so many Americans who felt unrepresented by our government, Paul helped to define Donald Trump's core beliefs and, along with other remarkably talented individuals, they achieved what is believed to be one of the greatest victories in the annals of any presidential campaign,"" the defense fund site said.

But that lofty rhetoric stands in contrast to Manafort's current circumstances. His legal burden grew heavier in mid-June, when a different judge, in Washington, D.C., ordered Manafort to jail, as a flight risk. A grand jury in D.C. had indicted Manafort on new charges — of alleged witness tampering — for contacting people who could testify in the cases against him.

Authorities initially detained him more than 100 miles away in the Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw, Va. His lawyers cited the distance in a bid to postpone the trial until autumn at the earliest.

Instead, Ellis directed U.S. marshals to move Manafort to the detention center in Alexandria, near the courthouse. That facility has housed a variety of prominent defendants including Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, and spies Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames.

The judge told potential jurors that the trial would last no more than three weeks.

When it is over, Manafort will not quite be done with the justice system. He faces a separate trial in late September in Washington, D.C."

Updated at 9:08 a.m. ET

The economy continued to add jobs at a steady pace last month, and the unemployment rate remained low. Analysts have been looking for signs that wage growth might pick up, but it held steady, too.

Payrolls grew by a lower-than-expected 157,000 in July, and the unemployment rate edged down to 3.9 percent, as projected, the Labor Department said Friday.

However, payrolls were revised upward by 59,000 for the prior two months. They grew 248,000 in June, up from the previously reported 213,000, and 268,000 in May, compared with the 244,000 last reported. Over the prior 12 months, payrolls have been growing an average 203,000 per month.

Manufacturing jobs grew by 37,000 in July, jobs in professional and business services were up 51,000, and leisure and hospitality jobs rose 40,000.

Private analysts had estimated that about 190,000 jobs were added in July, and they had expected the unemployment rate to inch down to 3.9 percent from June's 4 percent. Before this year, the last time the jobless rate was this low was in 2000.

Loading...

In July, average hourly earnings increased by 7 cents, to $27.05. That level is up 2.7 percent over the prior year, the same as June's pace. With the economy at full employment and hiring managers struggling to fill open positions, wages normally would be expected to start rising at a faster rate.

But, as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, ""some economists say that should add up to wage growth rates of about 3.5 percent. Instead, wages are increasing at a 2.7 percent annual rate."" And when factoring in the cost of living, those increases look even weaker.

It's no wonder that more jobs are available. The economy picked up dramatically in the second quarter. The 4.1 percent pace — lifted by jumps in consumer spending and exports — was the strongest in nearly four years.

Some economists said those were temporary factors — boosted by the Republican tax cuts and increased export shipments ahead of retaliatory tariffs by China on U.S. agricultural products.

But President Trump called the numbers ""very sustainable,"" adding: ""This isn't a one-time shot. ... Next quarter, I think it's going to be outstanding.""

This week, the Federal Reserve noted that the labor market has ""continued to strengthen"" and that the economy overall has also been strong. ""Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low,"" it said.

The central bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged, but it has signaled that it will hike them twice more this year."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Rich Pedroncelli/AP Rich Pedroncelli/AP

Updated at 11:58 a.m. ET

The Trump administration has proposed a rollback of Obama-era fuel efficiency and emissions standards, while simultaneously taking aim at California's unique ability to set more stringent rules.

Under the Obama administration, the Environmental Protection Agency called for the fuel economy standards for new vehicles to ratchet up over time. The increasingly strict standards were designed to combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

On Thursday, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released a new proposed rule that would instead freeze the standards at their 2020 levels for six years.

""Cars and trucks are just part of the basic fiber of the American economy and the American experience, so we take what we're doing very, very seriously,"" Bill Wehrum, EPA assistant administrator, told reporters on Thursday.

The agencies say that increasing fuel efficiency requirements contributes to an increase in the cost of new cars and trucks, which may discourage consumers from buying new vehicles. Because newer vehicles have advanced safety features, the administration argues, increasing fuel economy requirements therefore harms highway safety, as well as having economic effects.

Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, challenged the administration's argument that freezing the standards promotes safety by making newer, safer cars more affordable.

""Given this administration's dramatic lack of progress on auto safety, and the auto industry's proven ability to improve safety and fuel efficiency at the same time, it is troubling at best that this rollback was made under the guise of safety,"" David Friedman, vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, said in a statement.

The EPA has also argued that the federal standards imposed by the Obama administration are burdensome on auto manufacturers. However, ""major automakers have repeatedly said they do not back freezing the requirements but have called for changes to take into account fuel prices and shifting consumer demand,"" Reuters says.

The proposed rules also call for eliminating California's power to set its own auto emissions standards, a powerful tool the state has used to try to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

Because of a federal waiver, California has been allowed to set its own tailpipe emissions standards that are more stringent than federal law.

This is a privilege that California alone has, as NPR reported: ""Other states can follow California's lead or the federal government's lead but they aren't allowed to strike out on their own.""

The proposed rules call this practice a ""fundamental and unnecessary complication"" to regulations, and proposed replacing them with a less-stringent set of rules applying to all 50 states.

""California will fight this stupidity in every conceivable way possible,"" California Gov. Jerry Brown said in a statement on Thursday.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the proposed rules ""a brazen attack, no matter how it is cloaked, on our nation's Clean Car Standards.""

At least 12 other states have adopted California's standards, and together they form a powerful unit. As NPR's Nate Rott reported, ""together they account for a third of all car sales in the U.S.""

California, 16 other states and the District of Columbia sued the EPA in May in anticipation of the EPA action, NPR has reported: ""The states are asking a court to review the EPA's proposed actions, arguing that they violate the Clean Air Act.""

Now Becerra is planning to lead 19 attorneys general in a new lawsuit against the actual proposal.

California prides itself as a pioneer in pushing for clean air — an approach that was born out of its own severe air pollution issues. In the 1940s, the smog was sometimes so thick in Los Angeles that visibility was just three blocks, according to the California Air Resources Board.

For decades, the state has argued that it needs stricter standards ""due to California's unique geography, weather and expanding number of people and vehicles,"" CARB adds.

California has already reached its emissions reduction target for 2020. As the Los Angeles Times reported, it has ""hit its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels."" Now, it's trying to cut emissions even further, aiming for an additional 40 percent by 2030.

But automobiles are, by far, the largest source of California's greenhouse gas emissions. And as the Times reported, those numbers have been rising.

California's regulations also require car companies to produce and deliver a specific percentage of vehicles that are zero emissions — a framework that other states have also adopted.

Some conservative groups have welcomed the proposed rules.

Brent Gardner, Americans for Prosperity chief government affairs officer, said in a statement that California's higher fuel standards — and its electric vehicles mandate, in particular — impose costs on carmakers that ultimately are passed on to all consumers.

""Someone in Oklahoma should not be forced to pay more for their truck to subsidize someone's Tesla in San Francisco,"" he said in a statement.

Meanwhile, a group of 10 health and medical organizations, including the American Lung Association, called the suggested policy change a ""step backward"" in the fight against climate change.

""From degraded air quality due to higher temperatures to increased risk from wildfires, climate change poses serious threats to all Americans, especially to the most vulnerable, including children, older adults and those living with chronic diseases,"" the groups said in a combined statement."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Becky Lettenberger/NPR Becky Lettenberger/NPR

A soft murmur of familiarity rippled through the packed GOP convention hall Tuesday night when Mitt Romney's wife, Ann, spoke not of their ""storybook marriage"" but of one touched by cancer, multiple sclerosis and the trials of raising five sometimes screaming children.

""A storybook marriage? Not at all,"" she said, during her much anticipated prime-time speech. ""What Mitt Romney and I have is a real marriage.""

It was that moment that encapsulated the job that Ann Romney had to do, and how well she managed it.

From her perch of privilege and prerogative, she managed to convey not ordinariness, but at least a familiarity with struggle and a connection with women — actually, mothers were her exclusive focus — who have gone to bed exhausted; who have struggled with health issues as she has with breast cancer and multiple sclerosis; and who, when juggling the demands of raising children and running a home while her husband pursued his education and fortune, has wondered what she'd gotten herself into.

""I was so glad she had this opportunity to talk to the women of America, to have them hear about the trials they went through,"" said Barbara Bair, 47, a convention delegate from York, Pa. ""And to hear that her husband is a man that stands behind her, supporting her through breast cancer. There is nothing scarier for families than cancer.""

The speech, the experts and pundits proclaimed, needed to humanize Mitt Romney. But it really served as a vehicle to humanize her — a woman of great attractiveness and expensive polish — and, by extension, him. And that's all intended, of course, to help him appeal more to women who have been spooked by the Republican Party's positions on reproductive and workplace rights.

""She may have privilege, but she understands,"" said Kitty Dunn, 65, a Utah delegate who has met the Romneys.

That's not to say that Ann Romney stuck with her speech's opening line, ""I want to talk to you about love.""

About halfway through her speech, the soft tones of reminiscence of family and young love gave way to a tougher, more strident defense of her husband, his unheralded good works, his business success.

""Do we want to raise our children to be afraid of success?"" she asked with a tough edge. And she defended Bain as a dream launcher, a company that ""has helped so many others lead better lives.""

That part was clearly a tougher sell.

But her soft sell, from her ""I love you women!"" exclamation — it wasn't on the teleprompter — and the connection she made talking about her own struggles, was effective.

""She gave an energetic explanation of marriage — and I know, because I have three children at home,"" said Greg Treat, 34, a delegate and state senator from Oklahoma. ""I think Ann Romney will make a difference. Michelle Obama is a huge positive for the president, and Mrs. Romney will be for her husband as well."""

Transcript of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's keynote speech as prepared for delivery at the Republican National Convention.



This stage and this moment are very improbable for me.

A New Jersey Republican delivering the keynote address to our national convention, from a state with 700,000 more Democrats than Republicans.

A New Jersey Republican stands before you tonight.

Proud of my party, proud of my state and proud of my country.

I am the son of an Irish father and a Sicilian mother.

My Dad, who I am blessed to have with me here tonight, is gregarious, outgoing and loveable.

My Mom, who I lost eight years ago, was the enforcer. She made sure we all knew who set the rules.

In the automobile of life, Dad was just a passenger. Mom was the driver.

They both lived hard lives. Dad grew up in poverty. After returning from Army service, he worked at the Breyers Ice Cream plant in the 1950s. With that job and the G.I. bill he put himself through Rutgers University at night to become the first in his family to earn a college degree. Our first family picture was on his graduation day, with Mom beaming next to him, six months pregnant with me.

Mom also came from nothing. She was raised by a single mother who took three buses to get to work every day. And mom spent the time she was supposed to be a kid actually raising children – her two younger siblings. She was tough as nails and didn't suffer fools at all. The truth was she couldn't afford to. She spoke the truth – bluntly, directly and without much varnish.

I am her son.

I was her son as I listened to ""Darkness on the Edge of Town"" with my high school friends on the Jersey Shore.

I was her son as I moved into a studio apartment with Mary Pat to start a marriage that is now 26 years old.

I was her son as I coached our sons Andrew and Patrick on the fields of Mendham, and as I watched with pride as our daughters Sarah and Bridget marched with their soccer teams in the Labor Day parade.

Video: Chris Christie's speech, from PBS NewsHour PBS NewsHour YouTube

And I am still her son today, as governor, following the rules she taught me: to speak from the heart and to fight for your principles. She never thought you get extra credit for just speaking the truth.

The greatest lesson Mom ever taught me, though, was this one: she told me there would be times in your life when you have to choose between being loved and being respected. She said to always pick being respected, that love without respect was always fleeting — but that respect could grow into real, lasting love.

Now, of course, she was talking about women.

But I have learned over time that it applies just as much to leadership. In fact, I think that advice applies to America today more than ever.

I believe we have become paralyzed by our desire to be loved.

Our Founding Fathers had the wisdom to know that social acceptance and popularity is fleeting and that this country's principles needed to be rooted in strengths greater than the passions and emotions of the times.

Our leaders today have decided it is more important to be popular, to do what is easy and say ""yes,"" rather than to say no when ""no"" is what's required.

In recent years, we as a country have too often chosen the same path.

It's been easy for our leaders to say not us, and not now, in taking on the tough issues. And we've stood silently by and let them get away with it.

But tonight, I say enough.

I say, together, let's make a much different choice. Tonight, we are speaking up for ourselves and stepping up.

We are beginning to do what is right and what is necessary to make our country great again.

We are demanding that our leaders stop tearing each other down, and work together to take action on the big things facing America.

Tonight, we choose respect over love.

We are not afraid. We are taking our country back.

We are the great grandchildren of men and women who broke their backs in the name of American ingenuity; the grandchildren of the Greatest Generation; the sons and daughters of immigrants; the brothers and sisters of everyday heroes; the neighbors of entrepreneurs and firefighters, teachers and farmers, veterans and factory workers and everyone in-between who shows up not just on the big days or the good days, but on the bad days and on the hard days.

Each and every day. All 365 of them.

We are the United States of America.

Now we must lead the way our citizens live. To lead as my mother insisted I live, not by avoiding truths, especially the hard ones, but by facing up to them and being the better for it.

We cannot afford to do anything less.

I know because this was the challenge in New Jersey.

When I came into office, I could continue on the same path that led to wealth, jobs and people leaving the state or I could do the job the people elected me to do – to do the big things.

There were those who said it couldn't be done. The problems were too big, too politically charged, too broken to fix. But we were on a path we could no longer afford to follow.

They said it was impossible to cut taxes in a state where taxes were raised 115 times in eight years. That it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit. Three years later, we have three balanced budgets with lower taxes.

We did it.

They said it was impossible to touch the third rail of politics. To take on the public sector unions and to reform a pension and health benefit system that was headed to bankruptcy.

With bipartisan leadership we saved taxpayers $132 billion over 30 years and saved retirees their pension.

We did it.

They said it was impossible to speak the truth to the teachers union. They were just too powerful. Real teacher tenure reform that demands accountability and ends the guarantee of a job for life regardless of performance would never happen.

For the first time in 100 years with bipartisan support, we did it.

The disciples of yesterday's politics underestimated the will of the people. They assumed our people were selfish; that when told of the difficult problems, tough choices and complicated solutions, they would simply turn their backs, that they would decide it was every man for himself.

Instead, the people of New Jersey stepped up and shared in the sacrifice.

They rewarded politicians who led instead of politicians who pandered.

We shouldn't be surprised.

We've never been a country to shy away from the truth. History shows that we stand up when it counts and it's this quality that has defined our character and our significance in the world.

I know this simple truth and I'm not afraid to say it: our ideas are right for America and their ideas have failed America.

Let's be clear with the American people tonight. Here's what we believe as Republicans and what they believe as Democrats.

We believe in telling hard working families the truth about our country's fiscal realities. Telling them what they already know – the math of federal spending doesn't add up.

With $5 trillion in debt added over the last four years, we have no other option but to make the hard choices, cut federal spending and fundamentally reduce the size of government.

They believe that the American people don't want to hear the truth about the extent of our fiscal difficulties and need to be coddled by big government.

They believe the American people are content to live the lie with them.

We believe in telling seniors the truth about our overburdened entitlements.

We know seniors not only want these programs to survive, but they just as badly want them secured for their grandchildren.

Seniors are not selfish.

They believe seniors will always put themselves ahead of their grandchildren. So they prey on their vulnerabilities and scare them with misinformation for the cynical purpose of winning the next election.

Their plan: whistle a happy tune while driving us off the fiscal cliff, as long as they are behind the wheel of power.

We believe that the majority of teachers in America know our system must be reformed to put students first so that America can compete.

Teachers don't teach to become rich or famous. They teach because they love children.

We believe that we should honor and reward the good ones while doing what's best for our nation's future – demanding accountability, higher standards and the best teacher in every classroom.

They believe the educational establishment will always put themselves ahead of children. That self-interest trumps common sense.

They believe in pitting unions against teachers, educators against parents, and lobbyists against children.

They believe in teacher's unions.

We believe in teachers.

We believe that if we tell the people the truth they will act bigger than the pettiness of Washington, D.C.

We believe it's possible to forge bipartisan compromise and stand up for conservative principles.

It's the power of our ideas, not of our rhetoric, that attracts people to our Party.

We win when we make it about what needs to be done; we lose when we play along with their game of scaring and dividing.

For make no mistake, the problems are too big to let the American people lose – the slowest economic recovery in decades, a spiraling out of control deficit, an education system that's failing to compete in the world.

It doesn't matter how we got here. There is enough blame to go around.

What matters now is what we do.

I know we can fix our problems.

When there are people in the room who care more about doing the job they were elected to do than worrying about winning re-election, it's possible to work together, achieve principled compromise and get results.

The people have no patience for any other way.

It's simple.

We need politicians to care more about doing something and less about being something.

Believe me, if we can do this in a blue state with a conservative Republican Governor, Washington is out of excuses.

Leadership delivers.

Leadership counts.

Leadership matters.

We have this leader for America.

We have a nominee who will tell us the truth and who will lead with conviction. And now he has a running mate who will do the same.

We have Governor Mitt Romney and Congressman Paul Ryan, and we must make them our next president and vice president.

Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to put us back on the path to growth and create good paying private sector jobs again in America.

Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to end the torrent of debt that is compromising our future and burying our economy.

Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to end the debacle of putting the world's greatest health care system in the hands of federal bureaucrats and putting those bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor.

We ended an era of absentee leadership without purpose or principle in New Jersey.

It's time to end this era of absentee leadership in the Oval Office and send real leaders to the White House.

America needs Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan and we need them right now.

There is doubt and fear for our future in every corner of our country.

These feelings are real.

This moment is real.

It's a moment like this where some skeptics wonder if American greatness is over.

How those who have come before us had the spirit and tenacity to lead America to a new era of greatness in the face of challenge.

Not to look around and say ""not me,"" but to say, ""Yes, Me.""

I have an answer tonight for the skeptics and the naysayers, the dividers and the defenders of the status quo.

I have faith in us.

I know we can be the men and women our country calls on us to be.

I believe in America and her history.

There's only one thing missing now. Leadership. It takes leadership that you don't get from reading a poll.

You see, Mr. President – real leaders don't follow polls. Real leaders change polls.

That's what we need to do now.

Change polls through the power of our principles.

Change polls through the strength of our convictions.

Tonight, our duty is to tell the American people the truth.

Our problems are big and the solutions will not be painless. We all must share in the sacrifice. Any leader that tells us differently is simply not telling the truth.

I think tonight of the Greatest Generation.

We look back and marvel at their courage – overcoming the Great Depression, fighting Nazi tyranny, standing up for freedom around the world.

Now it's our time to answer history's call.

For make no mistake, every generation will be judged and so will we.

What will our children and grandchildren say of us? Will they say we buried our heads in the sand, we assuaged ourselves with the creature comforts we've acquired, that our problems were too big and we were too small, that someone else should make a difference because we can't?

Or will they say we stood up and made the tough choices needed to preserve our way of life?

I don't know about you, but I don't want my children and grandchildren to have to read in a history book what it was like to live in an American century.

I don't want their only inheritance to be an enormous government that has overtaxed, overspent and over-borrowed a great people into second-class citizenship.

I want them to live in a second American century.

A second American century of strong economic growth where those who are willing to work hard will have good paying jobs to support their families and reach their dreams.

A second American century where real American exceptionalism is not a political punch line, but is evident to everyone in the world just by watching the way our government conducts its business and everyday Americans live their lives.

A second American century where our military is strong, our values are sure, our work ethic is unmatched and our Constitution remains a model for anyone in the world struggling for liberty.

Let us choose a path that will be remembered for generations to come. Standing strong for freedom will make the next century as great an American century as the last one.

This is the American way.

We have never been victims of destiny.

We have always been masters of our own.

I won't be part of the generation that fails that test and neither will you.

It's now time to stand up. There's no time left to waste.

If you're willing to stand up with me for America's future, I will stand up with you.

If you're willing to fight with me for Mitt Romney, I will fight with you.

If you're willing to hear the truth about the hard road ahead, and the rewards for America that truth will bear, I'm here to begin with you this new era of truth-telling.

Tonight, we choose the path that has always defined our nation's history.

Tonight, we finally and firmly answer the call that so many generations have had the courage to answer before us.

Tonight, we stand up for Mitt Romney as the next President of the United States.

And, together, we stand up once again for American greatness."

The U.S. Army has halted the process of discharging immigrants who enlisted under a program designed to recruit people with critically needed skills.

Reports emerged in July that the Pentagon had canceled the enlistment contracts of dozens of these recruits.

""Effective immediately, you will suspend processing of all involuntary separation actions,"" says the memo from Marshall Williams, the acting assistant secretary of the Army for manpower and reserve affairs.

The program is known as Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest.

""This in no way reflects a change in the Army's compliance with DOD's MAVNI program,"" said Lt. Col. Nina Hill, an Army spokesperson. ""We continue to abide by all requirements to include completing a thorough background investigation on all MAVNI applicants.""

As NPR's Vanessa Romo has reported:

""[MAVNI] was established in 2009 to create an opportunity for the military to enlist people with specialized knowledge, including highly sought-after language and medical skills. ""Those enrolling had to reside in the U.S. legally, such as under student visas, or seek asylum but could not be green card holders. Enlisting gave them a fast-track path to citizenship, sometimes even before beginning basic training.""

The MAVNI program has been officially suspended since 2016, after the Pentagon said its security protocols should be reviewed. But that has left hundreds of people in limbo — and at risk of seeing their visas run out in addition to having their military contracts canceled.

As of April 2018, ""roughly 1,100 people who had signed contracts but had not gone off to basic training"" were still in the pipeline, Maj. Carla Gleason, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon, told NPR last month.

In July, dozens of enlistees were told they weren't eligible to serve in the U.S. military, with officials citing the results of security screenings. But in the case of two recruits who spoke to NPR, those problems seemed to be the existence of any ties outside the U.S.

A reservist who spoke to NPR — and who filed a Freedom of Information Act to discover the reason for his discharge — learned that foreign ties were to blame. His fiancée and his parents live in Pakistan. And despite a reviewer's positive impression of the man and his loyalty to the U.S., he was turned down for service.

Another enlistee, Panshu Zhao, signed up after moving from China to the U.S. for school. He is now pursuing a doctorate in geography at Texas A&M University — but after the military rejected him, he told NPR, ""This is a whole disaster. This is a total mess — a big mess."""

Updated at 6:10 a.m. ET

Voters in Missouri have overwhelmingly rejected a right-to-work law passed by the state's Republican-controlled Legislature that would have banned compulsory union fees — a resounding victory for organized labor that spent millions of dollars to defeat the measure.

With about 98 percent of the precincts reporting, the ""no"" vote on Missouri's Proposition A, which supported the law, was running about 67 percent, with nearly 33 percent voting ""yes.""

In 2017, the right-to-work law passed Missouri's Republican Legislature and was signed by then-Gov. Eric Greitens. However, union organizers gathered enough signatures to keep it from going into effect pending the results of a statewide referendum. The rejection of Proposition A effectively kills the law.

""It's a truly historic moment,"" said Mike Louis, president of the Missouri AFL-CIO. ""Tonight we celebrate, but tomorrow we're getting back to work. We're going to take this energy and momentum and build more power for working people across Missouri.""

Currently, 27 states and Guam have laws allowing employees in private-sector unionized workplaces to opt out of union membership and union fees.

(In a case involving public-service employees, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that unions cannot require workers to pay union dues or fees.)

As The Associated Press notes, ""At issue are so-called fair-share fees, which are less than full dues but are intended to cover unions' nonpolitical costs such as collective bargaining. Unions say it's fair for people to pay the fees, because federal law requires them to represent even those employees who don't join. But supporters of right-to-work laws counter that people should have the right to accept a job without being required to pay a union.""

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports:

""Voters in rural and urban areas all showed strong support for scrapping the law. In St. Louis City, with 100 percent of precincts reporting, 88 percent of voters landed on the 'no' side. ""Labor-friendly parts of southeast Missouri also showed strong opposition to the law, with more than three-fourths of voters in Iron, Reynolds, St. Francois and Ste. Genevieve counties voting to shoot down right to work.""

The Post-Dispatch reports that even deep-red St. Charles County saw nearly 72 percent of voters rejecting the measure.

Missouri went heavily for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election and the rejection of right to work — a core Republican aim — could have wider political implications.

According to the AP, ""unions powered an opposition effort that had spent more than $15 million as of late July, well over three times as much as various groups that support right-to-work. Advertisements generally have focused on economics, with supporters claiming right-to-work would lead to more jobs and opponents claiming it would drive down wages."""

A Colorado school district intent on saving money has cut one of its greatest costs: teaching.

District 27J, one of the state's larger districts, has dropped Mondays from the school week and switched to a four-day schedule as of Tuesday, the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year. Superintendent Chris Fiedler told NBC 9 News that the district will save on transportation costs, teaching salaries and districtwide utilities.

""We anticipate about $1 million in savings,"" Fiedler said.

9 News reported that the change comes on the heels of six failed attempts by the district to raise additional money through bond elections.

The district northeast of the Denver metropolitan area serves nearly 18,000 students and includes 12 elementary schools, four middle schools, four high schools and five charter schools. It is the 98th district in the state approved by the Colorado Department of Education to adopt the shorter schedule.

Fiedler estimates that running fewer school buses alone will save the district about $700,000.

""I realize this will be a significant change for our students, their families, and the communities we are so fortunate to serve, but our district can no longer be expected to do more with less financial resources,"" district officials said in a press release, according to 9 News.

The district plans to offer child care on Mondays for $30 per child per day.

Students will attend regular classes Tuesday through Friday and class time will be extended by 40 minutes per day.

The schedule was submitted for approval by the Colorado Department of Education in March."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jeffrey Phelps/Getty Images Jeffrey Phelps/Getty Images

When we arrived in Tampa for the Republican convention, much of the buzz centered on vice presidential pick, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.

Young — he's 42 — and a favorite of the conservative right, Ryan brought energy and attention to Mitt Romney's ticket, and could help him play better in the key Badger State in November. Tonight, he's set to accept his party's vice presidential nomination.

We set about to ask people who had flocked to stormy Florida for the convention how they view Ryan, not knowing that the Pew Research Center was asking the same question in a national survey.

Our sample size was decidedly smaller than Pew's 1,010. But what we heard mirrored what its interviewers found when they asked Americans to describe Ryan in a word.

There's a clear partisan divide in perception, with 69 percent of Republicans using positive words to describe Ryan (""intelligent,"" ""good"") and 59 percent of Democrats using negative words (""extreme,"" ""phony"").

Pew found that many people referred to Ryan's intelligence, and many also noted his conservative ideology.

Here's what the Pew folks had to say about their findings:

""While Americans offer a wide range of descriptions of Ryan, a few themes stand out. References to his intelligence are common, with more positive assessments (25 people used the word 'intelligent,' another 13 'smart,' 4 'knowledgeable,' 4 '""sharp' and 3 'educated') than negative (10 people called Ryan an 'idiot,' 5 described him as 'stupid' and 4 as 'clueless'). ""Ryan's ideology is another often noted characteristic. The single most often used description is 'conservative,' offered by 26 people. Another 4 people specifically identify Ryan as 'too conservative,' while 8 call him 'extreme.""

Overall, 37 percent of those surveyed by Pew used a positive word to describe Ryan, 35 percent used a negative word, and 28 percent used a word that was counted as neutral. Those words, Pew said, included conservative, young, unknown.

Pew noted that four years ago when it asked for a one-word description of GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin a few weeks after her nomination, the most commonly word used was ""inexperienced.""

We didn't ask our interview subjects, found at both the Republican convention and at a protest march, to characterize Ryan in a word. We asked them to finish the sentence, ""If we say Paul Ryan, you say ...""

Here's what we heard, and who we heard it from.

Arizona senator and former Republican presidential nominee John McCain died Saturday at the age of 81.

McCain leaves behind his wife of more than three decades, Cindy; seven children, including three from his first marriage, to Carol Shepp; and his 106-year-old mother, Roberta McCain.

Perhaps America's most famous prisoner of war, the former Navy pilot with a famous admiral father was shot down over Vietnam and spent 5 1/2 years as a POW in the north, most of that time in a prison sarcastically termed the Hanoi Hilton for the way inmates were treated.

McCain endured torture at the hands of his captors, a cause he would speak out against 40 years later as a United States senator during the Iraq War following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. McCain even objected publicly to President Trump's nominee to be director of the CIA, Gina Haspel, for her role in overseas detention centers.

A Washington institution, McCain served in the Senate for more than 30 years, first entering public service as a congressman in 1982, just nine years after his release from the Vietnamese prison.

McCain released a memoir, The Restless Wave, earlier this year, and he noted how he wanted to be remembered.

Politics Sen. John McCain Reads From His Forthcoming Memoir, 'The Restless Wave' Sen. John McCain Reads From His Forthcoming Memoir, 'The Restless Wave' Listen · 8:04 8:04

""I made a small place for myself in the story of America and the history of my times,"" McCain notes, adding, ""What an ingrate I would be to curse the fate that concludes the blessed life I've led. I prefer to give thanks for those blessings, and my love to the people who blessed me with theirs. The bell tolls for me. I knew it would. ... I hope those who mourn my passing, and even those who don't, will celebrate as I celebrate a happy life lived in imperfect service to a country made of ideals, whose continued success is the hope of the world. And I wish all of you great adventures, good company, and lives as lucky as mine.""

Clashes with Trump

The Arizona senator frequently clashed with President Trump. After McCain said in July 2015 that Trump ""fired up the crazies,"" especially when it came to immigration, Trump fired back. He mocked McCain, saying, ""I like people who weren't captured.""

The chasm between the two men — one of the party's past and one of its present — centered on more than just personal attacks; it was very much about America's place in the world.

McCain laid it out in October 2017 during his acceptance speech for the National Constitution Center's Liberty Medal, in which he blasted ""half-baked, spurious nationalism"":

""To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain 'the last best hope of earth' for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems, is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.""

Former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was a longtime friend of McCain's despite their deep policy differences. Earlier this year, Biden presented an international peace and conflict resolution award to McCain's wife, Cindy.

""Regardless of any political differences we've had,"" Biden said, ""we've always stood shoulder to shoulder as staunch defenders of that enduring, bipartisan vision for vigorous, engaged American leadership of the liberal international order that was created after World War II. It's a vision that's under attack today.""

McCain, who was a thorn in the side of the last three presidents, extended his criticism of Trump to action on subject matters beyond foreign affairs.

McCain effectively ended GOP efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017, signaling his ""no"" vote on a repeal bill with a thumbs-down in the middle of the night on the Senate floor.

That move widened the gulf between him and the president. Trump would mock McCain at campaign rallies, without mentioning his name, when talking about the failed health care vote. And he tweeted his outrage toward McCain on multiple occasions following the vote. Earlier this month, Trump even declined to use McCain's name during an event about a defense-authorization bill — which had McCain's name on it.

An unlikely political comeback

Enlarge this image toggle caption Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images

McCain overcame a savings-and-loan scandal early in his political career. He and four other senators had pressured regulators to back off their political benefactor Charles Keating. They became known as the ""Keating Five.""

Keating eventually served jail time for fraud. McCain was the only congressman involved to go on to serve long-term.

""It's amazing he survived that,"" Arizona State University professor Bruce Merrill told the Arizona Republic in 2014 following Keating's death. ""And I guess one could argue that his political skills brought him through that.""

McCain's willingness to buck his own party earned him the nickname ""maverick,"" a moniker he wore proudly. But that independent streak — and his famous temper — did not always endear him to party leadership.

In 1999, McCain clashed with the GOP establishment in his run for president. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, son of former President George H.W. Bush, was seen as the far and away front-runner. But McCain nearly swiped the nomination, trouncing Bush in the New Hampshire primary.

Bush saw a massive lead evaporate in the next primary, in South Carolina. But Bush and his supporters in the state used a heavily negative campaign to derail McCain. There was even a whisper campaign that McCain had fathered a black child. McCain has an adopted daughter from Bangladesh.

The episode left McCain bitter toward the future president of his own party.

But McCain and Bush were able to work together on immigration. McCain, a border senator, championed Bush's comprehensive immigration overhaul effort.

It eventually collapsed because of a lack of support from rank-and-file Republicans. And it was something for which McCain had to apologize to the Republican base to win the 2008 presidential nomination.

The 2008 campaign: From ""No, ma'am"" to Sarah Palin and Barack Obama

The 2008 campaign, in which McCain received nearly 60 million votes on Election Day, showed McCain's resilience. In the summer of 2007, he was seen as an afterthought in the Republican primaries after his campaign collapsed and ran out of money.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images

But on a shoestring budget and a limited staff, he ran a campaign full of town halls, retail politicking and a particular openness with the media. He wound up overcoming the long odds, displaying the same stubbornness and determination he had shown surviving 5 1/2 years as a tortured prisoner of war that left him with injuries so bad, he walked with a noticeable limp for the rest of his life and could not raise one arm above his shoulder.

The Great Recession that began in late 2008 and the Iraq War during the Bush years proved impossible for McCain to overcome. McCain, needing a boost, took a chance with his vice presidential pick. He put Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin on the ticket.

It was a move that looked smart early on, as he got a bump in the polls, and Palin would routinely draw larger crowds than McCain himself. There was so much excitement with the base around her being on the ticket, some people would cut off the McCain portion of their McCain-Palin bumper stickers.

The jolt was short-lived. Palin would make missteps that had a negative affect on the campaign. But her star turn with the base would inspire the outgrowth of the Tea Party, help Republicans take back the House in 2010, and lay a lot of the groundwork that made a Trump presidency possible.

Compounding the difficulty of McCain's campaign was Barack Obama, McCain's Democratic opponent. Obama was young and dynamic and would be the nation's first black president.

In a notable moment during the campaign, McCain defended Obama's identity against a woman who said she was uncomfortable with Obama, whom she declared an ""Arab.""

YouTube

""No, ma'am,"" McCain said in a video that went viral. ""He's a decent family man, a citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign is all about. ... I admire Sen. Obama and his accomplishments. I will respect him. I want everyone to be respectful, and let's make sure we are, because that's the way politics should be conducted in America.""

McCain also showed grace in defeat, praising Obama and focusing the country on the historic nature of his candidacy.

""Sen. Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country,"" said McCain, who grew up a generation before the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act.

Back to the Senate

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

McCain served 10 more years in the Senate, facing serious primary challenges in 2010 and 2016 that forced him to take more hard-line conservative positions during those campaigns than he had in the past, particularly on immigration and border security.

He also became a critic of the Obama administration's foreign policy, calling it ""feckless."" McCain was especially exasperated by the Obama administration's lack of engagement in Syria, as it fell into civil war. He personally made a trip to the country secretly in 2013 to meet with opposition leaders.

McCain spent his final years in the Senate as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, championing higher defense spending. He also regained some of his ""maverick"" image as one of the few Republican lawmakers willing to criticize Trump.

""The senator has always understood that people in positions of power have a responsibility not only for what they say, but for what people hear,"" said Pablo Carrillo, who worked for McCain for 15 years and served as his chief of staff from 2013 to 2017. ""And in that sense, I think that his approach to governing and leadership would have been guided by that in mind. Indeed, that's something that we are well-served in remembering, especially those with responsibility."""

Lions and tigers and bears are now roaming free — on the box for Barnum's Animals crackers.

For more than a century, the animal cracker packaging has shown the mighty beasts locked behind bars in a circus boxcar.

A spokeswoman for Mondelez International, Nabisco's parent company, said it was time for a change.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals had asked for a change in the design. The group has opposed using animals in circuses for decades, as NPR reported. Last year, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus announced they were shutting down after nearly 150 years following pressure from animal rights groups and declining ticket sales.

In 2015, the circus decided to stop having elephants in its shows, one of the reasons the company thought attendance was dropping.

For PETA, the new box design is indicative of a cultural shift.

""Big victories can come in small packages, and no matter where we look, we find new evidence that people are embracing compassion for animals like never before,"" PETA said in a statement, saying they participated in discussions with the company about the redesign.

""The new box for Barnum's Animals perfectly reflects that our society no longer tolerates caging and chaining exotic animals for circus shows,"" PETA adds. ""No living being exists simply to be a spectacle or to perform tricks for human entertainment, yet all circuses and traveling shows that use animals treat them as mere props, denying them everything that's natural and important to them.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images

Updated at 5:22 p.m ET

Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh opened on a contentious note Tuesday, with Senate Democrats raising noisy objections that much of Kavanaugh's lengthy paper trail is still off limits.

The hearing proceeded despite Democrats' call for delay. Republicans, who control the Senate, hope to confirm Kavanaugh in time to join the high court when its fall term begins next month, cementing a 5-4 conservative majority.

At 53, Kavanaugh would be the second-youngest member of the court and the second appointed by President Trump.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, described Kavanaugh as one of the most qualified nominees he has ever encountered. The Yale law school graduate has spent 12 years on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where he has authored hundreds of opinions.

In his opening statement, Kavanaugh praised retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom he once clerked and whose seat he would fill, as well as another judicial hero — his mother.

""My mom taught me that judges don't deal in abstract theories; they decide real cases for real people in the real world,"" Kavanaugh said. ""And she taught me that good judges must always stand in the shoes of others.""

Before Kavanaugh spoke Tuesday evening, the hearing was repeatedly interrupted by protesters.

""What we've heard is the noise of democracy,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.

In a statement Tuesday evening, the U.S. Capitol Police said a total of 70 people were charged in connection with protests at Tuesday's hearing.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the committee, warned that Kavanaugh would tilt the high court to the right, especially on hot-button issues such as abortion and gun control.

Politics Brett Kavanaugh's Record On Abortion Brett Kavanaugh's Record On Abortion Listen · 5:08 5:08

""The president that nominated you has said, 'I will nominate someone who is anti-choice and pro-gun.' And we believe what he said,"" Feinstein said.

Feinstein was not reassured by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who said Kavanaugh told her that the high court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion is ""settled law.""

""The question is really do you believe that it's correct law,"" Feinstein said.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., scoffed at Democrats who complained that Kavanaugh is too partisan.

""You had a chance and you lost,"" Graham said, referring to the 2016 presidential contest. ""If you want to pick judges from your way of thinking, then you better win an election.""

Trump also chimed in via Twitter, calling the hearings ""a display of how mean, angry, and despicable the other side is."" Trump charged that Democrats ""will say anything, and are only looking to inflict pain and embarrassment to one of the most highly renowned jurists to ever appear before Congress.""

Kavanaugh himself, however, pushed back against the idea of the Supreme Court as a partisan institution.

""The justices on the Supreme Court do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle,"" he said. ""If confirmed to the Supreme Court, I would be part of a Team of Nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States.""

Democrats also complained that the Trump administration blocked the release of more than 100,000 pages of documents detailing Kavanaugh's service in the George W. Bush White House. Other documents were released at the last minute, or not at all — including documents from 2003 to 2006 when Kavanaugh served as Bush's staff secretary.

""There's a 35-month black hole in your White House career where we've been denied access to any and all documents,"" Durbin said. ""During that period of time, President Bush was considering same-sex marriage — an amendment to ban it — abortion, executive power, detainees, torture, Supreme Court nominees, warrantless wiretapping.""

""Before sitting on the bench, you were a political operative, involved in the most political and partisan controversies of our time,"" added Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ""It is precisely those views that are being hidden from us today.""

""I would think that anyone who wanted to sit on the nation's highest court would be proud of their record and would want the American people to see it,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, dismissed the complaints over missing documents as a distraction.

""There's an old saying for trial lawyers: If you have the facts, pound the facts. If you have the law, pound the law. If you have neither, pound the table. We're seeing a lot of table pounding this morning,"" Cruz said.

Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, agreed, calling Democrats' complaints ""trumped up.""

""Their motives are clear,"" Crapo said. ""Use any means available to attempt to delay the confirmation process of a well-qualified jurist, fit for the job, indefinitely.""

Durbin also questioned Kavanaugh's credibility.

During his confirmation hearing for the appeals court in 2006, Kavanaugh assured Durbin that he had not been involved in White House discussions of torture or the treatment of enemy combatants. NPR and the Washington Post later reported that Kavanaugh was involved in those discussions, offering counsel on how those policies might be judged by the Supreme Court.

""You are a committed textualist, Judge Kavanaugh,"" Durbin said. ""If you are going to hold others accountable for their words, you should be held accountable for your own words.""

Although Kavanaugh helped to investigate then-President Bill Clinton while working for independent counsel Kenneth Starr in the 1990s, he later wrote in a 2009 law review article that presidents' official duties are too demanding for them to be subject to such a probe.

""I believe it is vital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible,"" Kavanaugh wrote. He suggested that Congress excuse the president from both civil lawsuits and criminal investigations while in office.

Feinstein takes issue with that approach.

""He does not believe a sitting president should be investigated or prosecuted,"" she told reporters on a conference call last week. ""In other words, the president is above the law.""

Democrats say Kavanaugh's views on presidential immunity deserve special scrutiny now, given the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election by special counsel Robert Mueller, which has already implicated a number of Trump associates.

""This is a president who has shown us consistently that he is contemptuous of the rule of law,"" Durbin said at Tuesday's hearing, noting Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey and his repeated criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

""And it's that president who has decided you are his man. You're the person he wants on the Supreme Court,"" Durbin said. ""So are people nervous about this? Are they concerned about it? Of course they are.""

""We have to confront an uncomfortable but important question,"" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., added: ""Whether President Trump may have selected you, Judge Kavanaugh, with an eye towards protecting himself.""

Two Republican members of the committee who often criticize the president agreed that judicial independence is a particular concern in the Trump era, though they seemed less skeptical of Kavanaugh than did their Democratic colleagues.

Sens. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Ben Sasse, R-Neb., both pointed to Trump's tweet on Monday criticizing the Justice Department over the indictments of two ""popular"" Republican lawmakers, just ahead of the midterms.

""That is why a lot of people are concerned about this administration, and why they want to ensure that our institutions hold,"" Flake said.

""The comments from the White House yesterday, trying to politicize the Department of Justice, they were wrong and they should be condemned,"" Sasse added. ""And my guess is that Brett Kavanaugh would condemn them.""

The testy exchanges Tuesday morning highlight Democrats' lingering resentment over the treatment of former President Barack Obama's last Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, who was never granted a hearing by Senate Republicans.

Kavanaugh, who serves alongside Garland on the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, spoke highly of his colleague, describing Garland as ""superb"" in his opening statement.

Despite their concerns, Democrats have few tools to block Kavanaugh's path to the high court. A rule change last year allows the Senate to confirm a Supreme Court nominee with a simple majority vote.

In a troubling sign for Republicans less than two months before November's elections, Democrats' advantage on the question of which party Americans are more likely to vote for in November is ballooning, according to a new NPR/Marist poll.

The gap has widened to 12 percentage points, up from 7 in July — and it is largely because of voters in the Midwest. They have swung 13 points in Democrats' direction since July. That Midwestern shift is consistent with what Marist has found in statewide polls conducted for NBC in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota that showed President Trump's support there starting to erode.

""Every way we are looking at the data, the same general pattern is emerging,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll. ""The Midwest is an area that is getting restless about what they hoped was going to occur and what they feel is not occurring.""

Trump has waged trade wars with several countries, aiming to renegotiate deals and has instituted tariffs on imports that have been met with retaliatory tariffs on exports. Many of those have taken a toll on Midwestern farmers, for example. And some automakers have come out against Trump's moves on car imports, hitting Trump with some tough headlines.

And that appears to be sticking to the GOP now.

""Republicans have not only been fairly silent in opposition to the president,"" Miringoff said, ""but they've been driving very hard in the Senate when it comes to his Supreme Court nominee. Congressional Republicans are buying into Trump for November. In terms of brand, they look totally in lockstep with the president — and that has become extremely clear to voters.""

Overall in the poll, half of voters (50 percent) said they are more likely to vote for the Democrat in their congressional district over the Republican (38 percent). In July, the Democratic edge was 47 percent to 40 percent.

It's the largest gap on this question, known as the congressional ballot, since December 2017 when Marist showed Democrats with a 13-point advantage. The lead is also similar to Democrats' advantage on the question in 2006, the last time they took back the House.

Trump approval dangerously low

Trump's approval rating is below 40 percent in the poll. Just 39 percent said they approve of the job the president is doing.

The rating is unchanged from the last Marist poll in July. But it's the third poll this week to show Trump below 40 percent amid the release of an explosive new book from journalist Bob Woodward detailing chaos in the Trump White House and an op-ed in The New York Times from what the paper describes as a senior official who writes that there is a ""resistance"" within the Trump administration to save the country from the president.

The GOP's and the president's weaknesses continue to be in the suburbs and now with Midwestern voters. They retain advantages in rural areas, the South and with white, non-college-educated voters and white evangelicals. But even in rural areas and small towns, there has been some slippage from July.

""It's not that Democrats are going to carry rural America,"" Miringoff stressed, ""but [Republicans are] not performing the way the president needs them to.""

In small towns, for example, there was an 11-point swing toward Democrats, and there was a 6-point drop-off among rural voters on the congressional ballot.

The president's approval rating in the suburbs is just 34 percent. And in those same suburbs, Democrats enjoy a whopping advantage (56 percent to 34 percent) over Republicans on whom Americans are more likely to vote for.

That is particularly problematic for Republicans, because many of the key races for control of the House run through the suburbs.

There is also a massive gender gap. Men approve of the job Trump is doing, a 50 percent to 42 percent margin. But women, who are fueling Democratic hopes in these midterm elections, disapprove of his job, 62 percent to 28 percent.

In the 2016 presidential election, Trump won 41 percent of women, according to exit polls.

""This is an election about gender,"" Miringoff said, pointing out that party identification and race are still major factors, but the gender numbers are much bigger than might be expected after 2016.

What happens when approval slips

The NPR/Marist poll was conducted Sept. 5 through Sunday. It surveyed 777 registered voters and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.

The two other polls out this week that showed the president slipping below 40 percent were CNN and Quinnipiac. CNN had Trump at 37 percent and Quinnipiac 38 percent.

Slightly earlier polls that meet NPR's polling standards — from Gallup, YouGov (43 percent), Ipsos (42 percent) and Selzer (43 percent) — had Trump at or slightly above 40 percent.

For context, let's look at some history to see where that ranks and what it could mean for the GOP's chances in two months. Just one president since polling began was below 40 percent in the last Gallup poll before a president's first midterm: Harry Truman in 1946. (Gallup has comprehensive historical data on presidential approval ratings.)

Just 33 percent of Americans approved of the job Truman was doing less than a year after the end of World War II. His party wound up losing 55 House and 12 Senate seats. Truman's 12-seat loss in the Senate remains the worst for a president's first midterm since 1862, according to numbers from Vital Statistics on Congress.

It's hard to compare to just one president, however. So widening out the lens, there have been plenty of presidents who were below 50 percent before their first midterm. And on average, their parties lost 44 House seats and five Senate seats.

A performance like that for Republicans this year would give Democrats control of both the House and Senate. (Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats to gain control of the House and two seats to take the Senate.)

Every election, though, has its unique factors. Not every president below 50 percent had as favorable a Senate map as Republicans do. Not every president below 50 percent had structural House district advantages because of redistricting or the fact that the opposition party has holed up in cities. And, arguably, not since the Civil War has the country been as polarized politically as it is today.

But, overall, first-term midterms are not kind to the president's party. (On average, they have lost 29 House and three Senate seats dating back to Truman.)

And it's even worse when the country thinks the president isn't doing a very good job.

""Presidents' approval ratings, when they are low in midterm elections cause havoc for the party in power,"" Miringoff noted. And Trump's approval rating, he added, is ""casting a cloud over the GOP Congress.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images

The Supreme Court on Tuesday insisted that many donations to predominantly conservative political nonprofit groups — what's often called dark money — be disclosed, seven weeks ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.

The ruling closes, at least for now, a loophole that has allowed wealthy donors to finance aggressive ads while staying anonymous. Crafted by the Federal Election Commission nearly 40 years ago, the loophole flourished after the 2010 Citizens United ruling.

The court set aside an order issued by Chief Justice John Roberts on Saturday. The social welfare group Crossroads GPS, a defendant in the lawsuit, had fought to stall disclosure while it prepares to appeal. It failed in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and then appealed to the Supreme Court.

The disclosure requirement is expected to apply to explicitly political ads by nonprofit groups for the remaining weeks of the campaign season.

The decisions came in a 2016 lawsuit against Crossroads and the FEC, by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the federal district court in Washington, D.C., last month ruled in CREW's favor. She gave the FEC 45 days to replace the regulation, which it didn't do.

CREW's executive director, Noah Bookbinder, said the Supreme Court ruling ""is going to affect spending in the 2018 elections. Groups that run these kinds of ads — ads that tell you to vote for or against another candidate — are going to have to disclose their contributors, and that is incredibly important.""

The Supreme Court's decision comes less than a week after a new research report by the government reform group Issue One, which puts some dollar amounts on what these unreported donors are giving. The report, which took a year of research, finds that the top 15 politically active nonprofits raised and spent more than $600 million on campaigns between 2010, when Citizens United boosted secret fundraising, and 2016.

The secret giving is made possible by a regulatory loophole at the FEC. The groups, usually organized as 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations or 501(c)(6) business associations, don't register as political committees with the commission. With the loophole, the FEC wants donor disclosure only when a donor earmarks the money for specific ads.

The top four spenders identified by Issue One are the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the mainstream conservative Crossroads GPS, the Koch network's Americans for Prosperity and the National Rifle Association. Issue One says that collectively, the four groups pumped at least $357 million into elections between 2010 and 2016.

""Opaque organizations are using contributions from opaque donors and secretly funding election campaigns and ads that are urging viewers to vote for or against candidates,"" said Michael Beckel, research manager at Issue One. ""And it remains very difficult to track back the true sources of dark money groups.""

Meanwhile, Americans for Prosperity has launched AFP Action — a superPAC that will regularly report its donors to the FEC, sidestepping the disclosure controversy."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Charles Dharapak/AP Charles Dharapak/AP

It's been the political world's obsession for weeks leading into the Republican National Convention in Tampa.

Would nominee Mitt Romney manage what would be miraculous for any candidate, and in a handful of days and one big speech wash away the problems of a modern candidacy?

Turns out Romney's moment Thursday night was a fine one, if not a great one.

His speech continued the campaign's concerted effort to reach out to skeptical female voters, reminding the audience that his strong mother ran for Senate.

It spoke to those disillusioned with President Obama, and criticized his record on the economy and lack of business experience, while stressing his own.

And it had its genuinely moving interludes — the must-have humanizing moments the often stiff and always private candidate was advised to serve up to the likeability gods.

Romney, who appeared a bit exhausted from the start, teared up when talking about his mother, and again when he expressed the heart-tugging longing he and his wife, Ann, experience for the days when their house was filled with their five sons and all their noise and rambunctiousness.

But the speech, and its already familiar themes, seemed unlikely to light a fire under the small slice of America's electorate still deciding whom to vote for, or whether to even head to the polls.

The night, however — with the exception of the awfully strange, quixotic appearance by Clint Eastwood speaking to an invisible Obama, who he pretended was sitting on a real chair onstage — was chock-a-block with powerful testimonials for the newly minted nominee.

Mormon church members recalled his kindnesses when he led a congregation in Boston. Business partners talked about a successful, hands-on penny pincher. A Massachusetts official who worked for him while he was governor described him as ""authentic.""

And there was a truly charming biographical video, stressing family and hard work, with home movies featuring Romney's father, a Michigan governor and auto company executive, and captivating images of young Ann and Mitt Romney and their brood.

The problem?

That personal, strong program was interrupted by the Eastwood ""interlude"" (that's how a clearly startled Romney campaign began describing the actor's unscripted performance), and a speech by rising GOP star Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who started strong but flagged.

A quote by the late Herb Brooks, who coached the U.S. Olympic hockey team to gold in 1980, which included a win over a powerful Soviet team, ended the Romney video: ""Great moments are born from great opportunity,"" it read.

Romney had an effective night, if it didn't end up being a great night.

That was enough for supporters like Janice Adkison, 52, of Florida, who said she has had to warm to Romney.

""My husband and I both had reservations,"" she said, citing concerns about Romney's lack of magnetism. ""But the more we learned about his personal life, his family, his business, the more impressed we were,"" she said as she left the hall after the balloons and confetti had dropped. ""We don't need a celebrity; we need a leader.""

Enough for Adkison and supporters like her, and maybe more Americans — if they didn't switch channels when Eastwood was talking to his imaginary president."

Updated at 9:05 p.m. ET

Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assaulting her in high school, has agreed to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, her attorneys said Saturday.

Bipartisan negotiators have tentatively agreed to work toward a Thursday hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee with Kavanaugh and Ford, but talks continue on a final agreement, according to multiple congressional sources.

After multiple extensions last week, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, gave Ford a deadline of 2:30 p.m. on Saturday to decide whether she would testify before the panel next week. If she did not comply, the committee would go ahead with a vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on Monday.

In an email to the committee, lawyers for Ford said that while she has agreed to ""provide first-hand knowledge of Kavanaugh's sexual misconduct,"" they are disappointed ""with the leaks and bullying that have tainted the process.""

The timing and terms of the hearing are still unclear, as negotiations continue between Ford's attorneys and the Senate Judiciary Committee, but in a letter, Ford's lawyers said they were ""hopeful that we can reach agreement on details.""

The email also indicated that Michael R. Bromwich, former inspector general of the Justice Department, has joined Ford's team of lawyers. Bromwich currently represents former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired earlier this year.

Ford alleges Kavanaugh groped her and tried to forcibly remove her clothes during a house party in Bethesda, Md., in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation and said he would appear before the committee next week.

""Brett Kavanaugh has been clear from the beginning—he categorically and unequivocally denies this allegation and is eager to testify publicly to defend his integrity and clear his good name,"" White House spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement. ""On Monday, Brett Kavanaugh met with Committee counsels to answer questions subject to criminal penalties and offered to testify publicly Tuesday morning. Since then, we have heard about different dates, conditions, and ever changing schedules, but today we appear no closer to a fair hearing. But one thing has remained consistent: Brett Kavanaugh remains ready, willing and eager to testify as soon as possible.""

As the Saturday deadline approached, NBC News reported that Garrett Ventry, a communications aide on the Senate Judiciary Committee who had been helping lead the response to Ford's claim against Kavanaugh, was stepping down after evidence surfaced that he was fired from a previous job partly because of sexual harassment allegations against him.

Ventry denied any past ""allegations of misconduct,"" according to NBC News. He told The Washington Post that he resigned ""in order to not be a distraction"" as Republicans in the Senate continue to work on getting Kavanaugh confirmed.

This abrupt resignation is one more point in the chaotic timeline of Kavanaugh's confirmation struggle."

Updated at 3:30 p.m. ET

The Federal Reserve announced another quarter-percentage-point increase in interest rates Wednesday as expected, citing a strong labor market and economy.

The Fed raised the benchmark borrowing rate to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent, the third hike this year.

In its announcement, the Fed said: The labor market ""has continued to strengthen and ... economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low.""

Loading...

In the three months since the Fed last raised rates, there have been reports of strong jobs numbers, bullish markets, blockbuster growth in GDP, a rock-bottom unemployment rate and sky-high consumer confidence. And on Wednesday, the Fed raised its forecast for economic growth this year to 3.1 percent from the 2.8 percent it projected in June.

""It's a particularly bright moment ... for the U.S. economy,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters.

That's not to say there aren't dark spots.

There is a lot of uncertainty over trade and how that is going to play out in the economy. But more importantly for workers, sluggish wage growth lingers and economists caution that higher rates could hurt already tight household budgets.

""Wage growth — finally it has accelerated a bit, but it's still a shadow of its former self. Especially after adjusting for inflation, which has picked up,"" says Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.

With the unemployment rate hovering at a low 3.9 percent, workers should be in high demand. But they don't seem to be getting paid like it. Many economists touted August's 2.7 percent year-over-year wage growth as the fastest in nearly a decade. But the cost of living increased at roughly the same rate, effectively wiping out the gains for most consumers.

Economists have cited a raft of possible causes for the slow wage growth. It could be that workers are receiving more bonuses and benefits rather than raises. Employers may be desperate to find workers but aren't finding enough trained ones. Or it could be simply that the unemployment rate is deceiving — and that many people have left the labor force since the financial crash about a decade ago.

Economy Why Are Wages Stagnating? Why Wages Are Stagnating Listen · 3:51 3:51

At a news conference earlier this year, Powell called the issue ""a bit of a puzzle.""

""We hear about labor shortages, but where is the wage reaction?"" he asked in June, right after the Fed raised the federal funds rate for the second time this year — to between 1.75 percent and 2 percent.

As rates continue to climb, it could place greater pressure on families who have been relying on their credit cards and mortgages to get by.

""For a lot of households, their wages have barely kept pace with the increases in household expenses — if even that,"" says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. ""Layer on top of that rising interest rates and the rising headwind that that presents toward consumers that are trying to get their debt paid off, and it's just going to further strain families that already have tight household budgets.""

Wages were not the only riddle hanging over the two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's board of policymakers. There are also troubles beyond U.S. borders.

From Argentina to Turkey, many of emerging economies have been hit by turbulence as a strengthening U.S. dollar helped send their own currencies into a skid.

Add to that the uncertainty surrounding the deepening trade dispute between the U.S. and China, leading to tariffs leveled on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of goods. Powell said businesses have raised concerns about the impact of trade conflicts, but the Fed has not seen much of an impact on the economy so far.

""The Fed will always say it's making policy decisions for the U.S. economy, and that's their mandate,"" Swonk says. ""But the reality is, what happens around the world does not stay around the world. It washes up on our shores, as well.""

Still, even with eight hikes in the past three years, interest rates remain historically low. The Fed effectively placed its foot on the gas during the Great Recession, driving down rates to boost borrowing and pump more money into the economy. Now that money is flowing, and now that inflation is ticking up, most analysts say it's about time to ease up off that gas pedal.

""There's a lot of momentum in the inflation process, and I think there's always a concern that if the Fed waits too long to address inflation, then it becomes more difficult,"" says Ann Owen, a professor at Hamilton College and former Fed economist.

If the central bank waits too long to head off inflation by raising rates, she explains, it could mean having to do more drastic rate hikes down the road. The Fed wants to avoid that whiplash. So the central bank may need to inflict modest pain on borrowers now if it means preventing much worse pains later.

""One of the really difficult things about monetary policy is that it's really hard to know if you're at a turning point in the economy. So they're always questioning, 'Is now the time for us to act?' "" Owen says. ""Hindsight is 20/20, but they have to make policy today.""

So, what does all this mean for average folks in the meantime? Probably not much in the short term. ""A really important point for people to keep in mind is that interest rates are still very, very low right now,"" Owen says, and the Fed so far has just been raising it with little nudges.

But those increases are expected to continue — with several more tentatively planned in the next year — and those changes may soon be evident in pricier credit card statements, mortgages and student loans. At the same time, they may also translate to higher returns for people who have been socking away money in a bank account.

""Rising rates are going to be good news for savers and bad news for borrowers,"" Bankrate's McBride says. ""Do what you can to put yourself on the right side of that equation."""

A wild turn of events on Friday flipped a new FBI investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from a long shot into a sure thing.

That was one result of an eleventh-hour agreement among the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee after a contentious session of offstage horse-trading.

The panel voted to recommend the embattled Kavanaugh to the full Senate on the condition that the final floor vote not take place until after the FBI conducted a background investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct confronting the nominee.

The inquiry would be ""limited in scope"" and completed within a week. The White House later Friday ordered the bureau to do just that. The FBI is expected to produce a report for the White House, which the administration would then give the Senate.

The compromise

Democrats and outside groups had been calling for the FBI's involvement since the allegations by Christine Blasey Ford and other women first surfaced that Kavanaugh had assaulted them or committed other such acts — allegations that Kavanaugh strongly denies.

Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., pitched the delay and new investigation to his compatriots, apparently setting that as his condition for ultimately supporting Kavanaugh on the Senate floor.

Republican leaders, who need every vote they can get to confirm the nominee, agreed.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, had opposed involving the FBI but said Friday he would take up Flake's case. Ultimately he secured an agreement with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

""We've had a good day today by moving the nominee,"" Grassley told reporters. ""A good day. We're very happy with the progress we've made.""

Democrats said the compromise was the right move.

""I think it will be better for the country that this FBI investigation occur,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., told NPR. ""I'm not sure what the answers will be. It's possible some of the witnesses won't even agree to talk with FBI. ... But to think we wouldn't even try would be the saddest thing for the country.""

What happens next

The new deadline for a Kavanaugh vote is Oct. 5. Grassley asked President Trump to instruct the FBI to spend that week conducting interviews, reviewing documents and looking into the new accusations.

The president agreed.

""The supplemental FBI background investigation would be limited to current credible allegations against the nominee and must be completed no later than one week from today,"" Grassley said.

It wasn't immediately clear whether ""current credible allegations"" would mean the FBI would interview only people connected with Ford's case or with some of the other women who have come forward with allegations against Kavanaugh.

The FBI is unlikely to open a criminal investigation. Instead, its investigators are expected to pursue the same kind of background inquiry they have conducted on Kavanaugh in the past, focused on the new allegations.

The nominee said in a statement released by the White House that he would go along.

""Throughout this process, I've been interviewed by the FBI, I've done a number of 'background' calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me,"" Kavanaugh said. ""I've done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate.""

At least one key player in this drama also volunteered to talk: Mark Judge — a boyhood friend of Kavanaugh's who has been accused by Ford of being a bystander to her sexual assault and was named in other allegations — said in a letter to the Judiciary Committee that he would cooperate under certain conditions.

Judge renewed his denials about being involved with any sexual misconduct and said that he would ""cooperate with any law enforcement agency that is assigned to confidentially investigate these allegations.""

Why would the FBI make a difference?

It's a crime to lie to Congress, but lying to the FBI is a whole other matter. And there is a practical difference between people in the Kavanaugh case issuing written statements — as Judge and others have done — and actually sitting down with human special agents.

Investigators might glean details from people involved that aren't yet in the public eye. They might discover there are more people, including witnesses or others, than have been a part of the public accounting so far.

But the FBI will not give its own determination about the truthfulness of what witnesses say — one reason Grassley and Kavanaugh both earlier said they opposed activating the bureau. Investigators probably only will conduct interviews and then pass them to the Senate, they said.

Even if the bureau serves only as a gold-plated transcription service in this case, the completeness of those transcripts might exceed the body of evidence that now exists — and it would be evidence obtained from witnesses who could be prosecuted if they lied to the feds.

Democrats and outside groups — and now, Flake — argue that the information that has surfaced recently means the FBI must look into Kavanaugh again.

Ford told the Judiciary Committee she hadn't told anyone about her alleged sexual assault by the 1990s, when Kavanaugh was screened for a job in the Justice Department, or even by the early 2000s, when he was cleared to work in the White House of President George W. Bush.

Many Republicans say the due diligence on Kavanaugh already was complete. Now that the Judiciary Committee has voted to recommend him to the full Senate, they argue, the full chamber must decide.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images

The State Department has reversed course on its visa requirements for same-sex partners of foreign diplomats and the staff of U.S.-based international organizations. On Monday, it implemented a policy denying visas to such partners if they're not legally married.

U.S. diplomats had announced the decision to foreign delegations in July, saying the move is intended to render department policy consistent between same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Previously, under a policy instituted in 2009 under then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, ""domestic partners"" were considered members of the family — and thus eligible for a G-4 visa.

But on a conference call with reporters Tuesday, senior administration officials emphasized said they undertook a change in policy to accommodate the Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015.

""The purpose of the policy is the equal treatment of all family members and couples,"" one official said. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert declined to address the policy at her regular briefing with reporters Tuesday.

LGBTQ activists, for their part, have expressed alarm that the move will actually harm these couples, many of whom hail from countries where same-sex marriage is illegal. Without a legal marriage, and thus without a visa, such partners face the threat of deportation; but activists point out that if they get legally married to stay in the U.S., they could also face persecution upon returning to their home country.

Same-sex marriage remains illegal in the vast majority of United Nations member states — some of which, such as Saudi Arabia, which is on friendly terms with the U.S., punish same-sex relationships with the death penalty.

""It is an unfortunate change in rules, since same-sex couples, unlike opposite-sex couples, have limited choices when it comes to marriage,"" U.N. Globe, a group that advocates for LGBT staff at the U.N., said in a statement released before the change.

The organization recommended that partners living in New York City ""consider getting married in City Hall"" before Dec. 31. After year's end, the Trump administration expects unmarried partners to change visa status or leave in 30 days.

But Human Rights Watch also noted that getting married in the U.S. still poses dangers back at home for many foreigners.

""In many situations registering a marriage could put same-sex couples at risk in a way that privately providing evidence of a domestic partnership would not have done,"" said Akshaya Kumar, the organization's deputy U.N. director.

""One Nigerian man (not a UN staffer) who married his same-sex partner abroad reported that both he and his family members in Nigeria received death threats as a result. Egypt, Tunisia, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia, Uganda, Russia and many other countries have arrested people for same-sex conduct.""

According to administration officials, the change directly impacts 105 families, roughly half of whom are connected with international organizations based in the U.S. such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.

Officials, however, say they ""will put processes in place"" for supporting unmarried partners, pledging to consider situations on a case-by-case basis.

They noted one particular exception to the new policy: The administration is prepared to work with diplomats from countries where same-sex marriage is illegal, provided the country offers equivalent protections to LGBTQ diplomats from the U.S.

""This is certainly not an attack. It was not meant as an attack; it is not meant to be punitive,"" another Trump administration official explained. ""It is a recognition and a codification of the fact that same-sex marriage is legal in the United States.""

Explanations such as these have failed to persuade the Human Rights Campaign, which called the policy change ""unnecessary, mean-spirited, and unacceptable.""

""The White House must immediately go back to a policy that is fully inclusive and takes into account the dangers faced by LGBTQ foreign diplomats, U.N. employees, and their families,"" said David Stacy, government affairs director for the gay-rights advocacy group.

Samantha Power, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under the Obama administration, also reacted with outrage to the news — decrying the move as ""needlessly cruel & bigoted."""

Updated at 11:31 p.m. ET

A sharply divided Senate — reflecting a deeply divided nation — voted almost entirely along party lines Saturday afternoon to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court.

A little more than two hours later, Kavanaugh was sworn in during a private ceremony as protesters stood on the court's steps.

Kavanaugh becomes the nation's 114th Supreme Court justice and President Trump's second appointment to the court, creating a conservative majority on the nation's highest court for years to come.

The Senate vote was 50-48. Only one Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, joined Republicans in backing Kavanaugh. One Republican, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, voted ""present"" although she said she opposed the nomination. One GOP senator was absent during the vote because of his daughter's wedding thousands of miles from Washington, D.C.

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as he flew to Kansas for a political rally, Trump said he was ""very, very, very happy"" about the vote and said Kavanaugh will be ""a brilliant Supreme Court justice for many years.""

After the vote, the president called Kavanaugh to congratulate him, the White House said in a statement. Trump also spoke with Vice President Pence, Sen. Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan.

Kavanaugh was sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy Saturday evening. Roberts administered the constitutional oath and Kennedy the judicial oath. ""Both oaths will be administered so that [Kavanaugh] can begin to participate in the work of the Court immediately,"" the court said in a statement prior to the swearing in. A formal investiture ceremony will take place at a later date, the Supreme Court also said.

And Trump told Kansas rallygoers that he will hold a ceremonial swearing-in for Kavanaugh at the White House Monday evening.

Senators sat at their desks during Saturday's roll call, rising when it was their turn to vote. The session was presided over by Pence. In the debate preceding the vote, senators sounded as though they were describing two different men. McConnell called Kavanaugh ""among the very best our nation has to offer."" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called the 53-year-old Kavanaugh a victim of ""an ugly left-wing smear campaign"" and charged Democrats with character assassination.

Kavanaugh had been accused by three women of sexual misconduct while he was in high school and college more than 30 years ago — charges he angrily denied.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called Kavanaugh's confirmation ""a low moment for the Senate, the court, and the country"" and said of Kavanaugh, ""He doesn't belong on the nation's highest bench.""

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who was first elected in the ""Year of the Woman"" in 1992 after the confirmation of Justice Clarence Thomas, said that in confirming Kavanaugh the Senate would be telling young girls and women that ""your voices just don't matter.""

On Air Force One, Trump told reporters his speech in Mississippi last week, in which he was widely seen to be mocking Christine Blasey Ford, ""had such a great impact. I think it was a very important thing."" Ford had accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982 when they both were in high school.

Trump also said women, far from being outraged at Kavanaugh, ""were outraged at what happened to Brett Kavanaugh, outraged.""

Asked about the #MeToo movement and her husband's recent comments about its potential impact on men, first lady Melania Trump weighed in on Kavanaugh's controversial nomination before Saturday's vote. ""I would say if we're talking about the Supreme Court and Judge Kavanaugh, I think he's highly qualified for the Supreme Court,"" Mrs. Trump said while speaking to reporters in Egypt during a solo international trip to Africa. ""I'm glad that Dr. Ford was heard; I'm glad that Judge Kavanaugh was heard. FBI investigation was done, is completed and Senate voted.""

But when asked whether she believed Ford, the first lady would not answer directly. ""I will move on that and I think that all the victims, they need — we need to help all the victims no matter what kind of abuse they had, but I am against any kind of abuse or violence,"" the first lady said.

In the hours before the vote, police arrested demonstrators who had broken through barriers around the Capitol and tried to climb the building's steps. Protesters were also heard shouting from the Senate gallery during the roll call.

A total of 164 people were arrested according to U.S. Capitol Police.

Speaking after the vote, McConnell said the protests against Kavanaugh over the past several weeks have ""turned our base on fire."" Citing the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and ""the virtual mob that assaulted us in the course of this process,"" McConnell said ""they've managed to deliver the only thing that we had not been able to figure out how to do, which was to get our folks fired up.""

A recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll showed in fact that the Republicans have narrowed the enthusiasm gap with Democrats in the past few weeks.

In an interview with the Washington Post, Trump said Murkowski will face political consequences for opposing Kavanaugh. ""I think she will never recover from this,"" Trump said. ""I think the people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did.""

Murkowski lost a primary battle in 2010 but was re-elected as a write-in candidate. She next faces voters in 2022.

On Friday, after the nomination cleared a key procedural hurdle with a 51-49 vote, two previously undecided senators, Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced they would support Kavanaugh. That support all but assured Republicans of the votes they needed to push the nomination across the finish line.

In a much anticipated speech on the Senate floor Friday afternoon, Collins said that she believed that Ford was a survivor of sexual assault. Still, Collins said, the allegations ""fail to meet the 'more likely than not' standard,"" and ""I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court.""

And in a statement issued soon after Collins spoke, Manchin explained he was supporting Kavanaugh notwithstanding the ""serious accusations"" leveled against the judge and lingering questions about Kavanaugh's temperament.

""I have reservations about this vote given the serious accusations against Judge Kavanaugh and the temperament he displayed in the hearing,"" Manchin said. ""And my heart goes out to anyone who has experienced any type of sexual assault in their life. However, based on all of the information I have available to me, including the recently completed FBI report, I have found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist who will follow the Constitution and determine cases based on the legal findings before him. I do hope that Judge Kavanaugh will not allow the partisan nature this process took to follow him onto the court.""

Speaking to NPR on Friday, a lawyer for Ford said the California professor's goal was never to derail the nomination. ""Dr. Ford's goal here was never to impact the process to derail a nomination,"" attorney Lisa Banks said on All Things Considered. ""What she was trying to do was what she thought was the right thing to do as a citizen, which is to provide the information to the U.S. Senate so they could make the most informed decision possible. Her goal wasn't to derail this nomination; it was to inform the nomination and she's done that."""

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrapped up his fourth visit to North Korea on Sunday, describing his talks with leader Kim Jong Un as productive.

Pompeo met with Kim for about two hours, according to a pool report from CBS' Kylie Atwood, the only U.S. journalist who accompanied the secretary on his trip. The visit comes after President Trump's historic summit with Kim in June, which resulted in a vague commitment from Pyongyang to denuclearize.

""Had a good trip to # Pyongyang to meet with Chairman Kim,"" Pompeo said on Twitter, adding that the leaders ""continue to make progress on agreements made at Singapore Summit.""

A U.S. official who accompanied Pompeo on the trip, and spoke to Fox News on the condition of anonymity, said the Sunday meeting was ""better than the last time"" but that ""it's going to be a long haul.""

After their private meeting, Kim hosted Pompeo for lunch at the Paekhwawon State Guest House. As Pompeo waited for him, he clasped his hands in front of his body and State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said, ""It's like you are standing at the alt[a]r,"" according to the pool report. Pompeo smiled but said nothing in return.

When Kim entered the room, the leaders exchanged pleasantries.

""So is everything OK?"" Kim asked through an interpreter as they walked toward the banquet hall.

""Everything is great,"" Pompeo said. ""Everything is great. I am very much looking forward to our time together too.""

As the guests took their seats at the table, Kim said, ""It's a very nice day that promises a good future for both countries.""

Pompeo thanked him for hosting the event and conveyed President Trump's regards.

Onto South Korea

Later that afternoon, Pompeo touched down in Seoul to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

Moon thanked Pompeo for coming straight to the capital after his meeting with Kim, calling it a very important day. He said, ""I dearly hope that your latest visit, as well as the upcoming U.S.-North Korea summit, which I hope will be happening soon, will make an irreversible and decisive progress in terms of complete denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula as well as the peace process.""

He asked Pompeo to share what he could with the public.

Pompeo thanked him and said, ""I don't have much to add. I will certainly tell you in private about our conversation, but we had a good, productive conversation.""

He continued, ""As President Trump has said, there are many steps along the way and we took one of those today; it was another step forward.""

Pompeo offered no further details, such as whether he had established a time and place for a second summit or what either side was demanding, but Moon's press secretary shared more in a statement reported by South Korean news agency Yonhap: At a closed meeting, Pompeo told Moon that he and Kim agreed to arrange a second U.S.-North Korea summit ""at the earliest possible date,"" as well as discuss the specifics of date and location, Press Secretary Yoon Young-chan said.

Pompeo also spoke about additional denuclearization steps and Washington's monitoring of the verification process and ""corresponding measures,"" Yoon said.

""The two sides will form working-level negotiation teams to discuss North Korea's denuclearization process and Trump-Kim summit schedule,"" Yoon said.

Spokesperson Heather Nauert said later on Sunday that Pompeo and Kim also agreed to instruct their working-level teams to meet soon, and that Kim invited inspectors to visit the Punggye Ri nuclear test site to confirm that it had been irreversibly dismantled.

The U.S., in its mission for a fully verified denuclearization of North Korea, demands that the country turn over a full inventory of its nuclear weapons program. North Korea has rejected those demands and wants sanctions to be lifted before nuclear talks proceed.

South Korea has suggested that the U.S. sign a treaty formally ending the Korean War, in exchange for North Korea closing its main nuclear plant, as NPR's Anthony Kuhn reported for our Newscast.

Gridlock has been part and parcel of the negotiation process. In August, Trump canceled Pompeo's trip to North Korea because they were ""not making sufficient progress"" in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, he said.

On Sunday, after Pompeo's meeting with Kim, Trump tweeted ""Progress made on Singapore Summit Agreements! I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim again, in the near future.""

Pompeo's trip started with a visit to Tokyo on Friday, where he met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to coordinate positions in the push to get Pyongyang to relinquish its nuclear weapons.

On Monday, Pompeo is expected to land in Beijing — the last stop on his whirlwind diplomatic tour."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic

Taylor Swift is done being apolitical. On Sunday, the pop megastar took to Instagram and endorsed two Democratic candidates up for election in Tennessee.

""I'm writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I'll be voting in the state of Tennessee,"" writes Swift. ""In the past I've been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country.""

Swift's statement could potentially boost turnout among her fans, many of whom were preteens when Swift first rose to stardom, and are now of voting age.

Swift says she ""cannot support Marsha Blackburn,"" a Republican congresswoman running for the Senate. Instead, Swift says she will be voting for Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives.

""She didn't make it about partisan issues. She made it very much about values, and I think that is an integral part of this election,"" says 21-year-old Blake Kitterman, vice president of Tennessee Young Democrats. Kitterman tells NPR that Swift has the potential to influence many young voters.

""The basic values that she has as a person, and that I would hope everyone else in the country has, do not really surprise me. It's a clear cut choice between Marsha Blackburn and Phil Bredesen, and I'm happy and reassured that she supported the right candidate in my mind,"" says Kitterman.

Swift writes in her Instagram post about Blackburn:

""Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values.""

In her Sunday Instagram post, Swift, who is 28, also made it clear she wants people in office who support LGBTQ rights and gender and racial equality.

""I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love,"" she says.

Andy Cole, the vice chairman of the Tennessee Young Republicans, says he doesn't think Swift's endorsement will have much influence on the minds of young voters.

""We've seen celebrities endorse Democrats before. Most Tennessee voters are worried about which candidate is going to give them a good job, which candidate is going to get out and fix the education system, which candidate is going to do the things Tennessee voters need ... We're glad she has an opinion, and we love to see younger people have opinions, because frankly, I think too often, younger people have been disengaged.""

It's unclear to what extent Swift's endorsement could help Democratic candidates. According to a study by Pew, millennials are among the most liberal generations in the U.S., with the majority supporting Democrats in their districts. Only 27 percent of millennials approve of President Trump's job performance.

At the same time, young voters are not showing up at the polls. In the past four midterm elections, young people between the ages of 18 and 24 voted at a rate of just 20 percent.

In her post, Swift urges her young fans to show up at the ballot in November.

""Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway...So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count.""

Kitterman of the Tennessee Young Democrats says that even without Swift's support, an increasing number of younger voters will be turning out to vote this year.

""There are multiple threats now going against us, and I think that is a factor in pushing millennial turnout,"" he says. ""Taylor Swift only reinforces this built-up tension that we have in ourselves. Whereas before we thought that we could have no impact, now we have no choice but to exhaust all options to try and make an impact.""

According to The Tennessean and a CBS poll released over the weekend, Blackburn has surged to an eight point lead over Bredesen."

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis ""could"" be considering a departure, Saudis can expect ""severe punishment"" for any involvement in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, and climate change is probably real, but not caused by man, President Trump said in an interview aired Sunday on CBS' 60 Minutes.

The wide-ranging discussion with the network's Lesley Stahl touched on Trump's opinion of politicians (""deceptive, vicious""), Chinese tariffs and Christine Blasey Ford, among other things. The show interviewed him in the White House last Thursday; the interview aired on CBS on Sunday night. The president was previously interviewed by Stahl for 60 Minutes in Trump Tower with his family in 2016, days after the election.

Stahl has interviewed Trump as a candidate, as president-elect and now as president. ""In terms of the three interviews, he was completely different,"" she said. ""He's so much more confident. He is truly president. And you felt it. I felt it in this interview.""

Trump often pushed back at the journalist when she asked him to elaborate. ""In the meantime I'm the president and you're not,"" he said after one exchange about the press.

On Defense Secretary Jim Mattis

Mattis is visiting Vietnam this week, as China continues its growing military assertiveness in the South China Sea.

Trump, perhaps opening the door to Mattis' exit, told Stahl that the defense secretary ""could"" be considering a departure from the Cabinet. She asked the president if Mattis was going to leave.

President Trump: Well, I don't know. He hasn't told me that. I have — Stahl: Do you want him to — President Trump: — a very good relationship with him. It could be that he is. I think he's sort of a Democrat, if you want to know the truth. But General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That's Washington.

The president also decried claims of chaos in his administration as ""fake news.""

""I have people now on standby that will be phenomenal,"" Trump said. YouTube

On disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi

Other world leaders are grappling with the Turkish government's allegations that Khashoggi was killed by Saudi officials in Istanbul this month. Trump threatened ""severe punishment"" if the allegations are true.

The president said the Saudis have denied involvement and that he expects to know why Khashoggi disappeared ""in the not-too-distant future.""

""Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon,"" he said, referring to U.S. defense contractors with business in Saudi Arabia. ""I don't want to hurt jobs. I don't want to lose an order like that. There are other ways of — punishing, to use a word that's a pretty harsh word, but it's true.""

""There's a lot at stake. And maybe especially so because this man was a reporter,"" the president said. ""You'll be surprised to hear me say that. ... We're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment"" if he was murdered.

The Saudis say they will retaliate against any attempt to punish them over the incident.

On climate change

Stahl sparred with Trump in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael, citing the recent trend of powerful storms. Trump has called climate change a hoax perpetuated by China in the past, but in the interview, seemed to partly reverse his position.

""I think something's happening,"" Trump said.

""Something's changing and it'll change back again. I don't think it's a hoax,"" he told Stahl.

""But I don't know that it's man-made. I will say this. I don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs. I don't want to be put at a disadvantage,"" he said.

""Look, scientists also have a political agenda,"" he added.

On Kim Jong Un

The president's remarks about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have frequently made headlines. At a rally in West Virginia last month, Trump told the crowd about the ""love"" he has developed for Kim.

""He wrote me beautiful letters. And they're great letters. We fell in love,"" he said. Just a year earlier, Trump had mocked Kim as ""Little Rocket Man"" while Kim returned the insult, calling the president a ""mentally deranged U.S. dotard.""

Stahl pressed Trump on those September comments.

Stahl: I want to read you his resume, okay? He presides over a cruel kingdom of repression, gulags, starvation — reports that he had his half-brother assassinated, slave labor, public executions. This is a guy you love? President Trump: Sure. I know all these things. I mean — I'm not a baby. I know these things. Stahl: I know, but why do you love that guy? President Trump: Look, look. I — I — I like — I get along with him, okay? Stahl: But you love him. President Trump: Okay. That's just a figure of speech. Stahl: No, it's like an embrace. President Trump: It well, let it be an embrace. Let it be whatever it is to get the job done.

On Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford

At a rally in Mississippi earlier this month, the president mocked Ford, who has accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.

Stahl's question was simple: ""Why did you have to make fun of her?""

""I'm not gonna get into it because we won,"" Trump eventually answered. ""It doesn't matter. We won.""

On trade with China

The U.S. has already imposed about $250 billion in tariffs on China, and there ""might"" be more on the way, the president said. He's not trying to push China into a depression, he said. ""I want them to negotiate a fair deal with us. I want them to open their markets like ... our markets are open.""

Chinese officials have said in the past they are prepared to retaliate with higher tariffs of their own.

""They want to negotiate,"" the president said. ""I have a great chemistry also with President Xi of China. I don't know that that's necessarily going to continue. I told President Xi we cannot continue to have China take $500 billion a year out of the United States in the form of trade and others things."""

Blindsided is what North Carolina Republicans felt four years ago when President Obama won the state, though by the slightest of margins — a mere 14,177 votes out of 4.3 million cast.

Republicans admit they had taken as a given a 2008 North Carolina victory by Sen. John McCain. And who could blame them? No Democratic presidential candidate had won the state since Jimmy Carter in 1976.

But as McCain learned to his grief, history isn't always destiny. Obama's campaign had an effective strategy to win the state, and did.

This time around, Republican supporters of Mitt Romney and Rep. Paul Ryan, the GOP presidential ticket, vow to keep Obama from achieving a North Carolina two-peat.

The Romney campaign is pouring resources into what most observers view as a must-win state for the Republican ticket.

""I've been doing races for a while in this state and I've never seen the money or resources the presidential campaign has given us,"" said Luther Snyder, a Republican political consultant in the state.

You don't have to be on the ground long in North Carolina before you see elements of the GOP effort in action.

It's partly the air war of TV commercials bombarding voters in the battleground states with campaign messages from Romney's team and their outside allies, groups like Americans for Prosperity.

National Journal reported that during a recent four-week period, Romney and his supporters outspent Obama and his allies by more than 2 to 1 in three of those weeks in battleground states, which include North Carolina.

It's also about the ground war, which includes exciting the GOP base, especially the volunteer foot soldiers whose efforts will be needed to get out the vote on Election Day.

Because polls generally suggest a North Carolina race that's tight as a tick, Republicans are seeking to increase their vote across the board, including places where Obama did well in 2008. Every vote gained is one denied to the president.

Thus, you get Ann Romney in July visiting the Guilford County Republican Party offices in what was formerly a furniture store in Greensboro. Obama won Guilford County handily by 19 percentage points, far exceeding Democratic Sen. John Kerry's 1-percentage-point win there in 2004 over President George W. Bush.

You also get one of the customized buses in the Romney campaign fleet showing up at the same location the Thursday just before the Republican convention, an effort to create some buzz for the volunteers who were working the phones to identify potential Romney voters.

And it's not just the Romney campaign or the official party organizations that are in action. As USA Today recently reported, Americans for Prosperity, an outside group funded by the Koch brothers, is sending volunteers into the field to canvass for voters receptive to the GOP candidates and message.

""We're not taking it for granted. We're doing everything we can on the ground to get people involved, encouraged and to the polls,"" said Rachel Adams, communications director for Romney's North Carolina campaign.

When Adams joined Romney's North Carolina staff in June, the campaign had four locations. It's now up to 20 ""victory offices,"" including Guilford, with plans for more. ""Were in places where there's a big [Republican] base; we're in places where there isn't,"" Adams said.

""There are folks, they're undecided and they might change their minds, or they voted Democrat in 2008 and they're not going to now,"" Adams said.

""We're trying to touch a lot of different people,"" Adams said. ""We're getting people on our phone banks who voted for Obama and they're not going to do it again. We're getting folks who weren't involved at all, that weren't politically active, period, and now feel it's the time, they have to get involved, there needs to be a change and are asking whatever they can do to help out. And then you always have the Republican voters who are excited and are trying to get all their friends who didn't vote to get in the door and vote.""

Obama built much of his 2008 North Carolina success by energizing at least two groups of voters: African-Americans, who are about 22 percent of the state's registered voters, and younger voters.

Romney's chances of getting many black North Carolinians to choose him instead of Obama to any significant degree are decidedly minimal. Young voters are a different story.

A December 2011 analysis of voter registration data from North Carolina and Nevada by the Center for Information and Research On Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University indicated that in the years since 2008, Democrats lost some of the edge over Republicans with voters between 18 and 25.

That could be an opportunity for Republicans, represented by the 20-somethings working the phones at the Guilford GOP headquarters.

Mindy Moorman, 26, counts herself among the underemployed — she works part time at a beauty parlor. Coming from a Republican family (her father was a Charlotte politician) it wasn't a big leap for her to become a Romney volunteer.

""Because I'm a young female, I run into a lot of other people who maybe don't know as much about politics as I do but just assume they're a Democrat or a liberal because of the age. So I kind of wanted to get involved to kind of be the face to say, 'You don't have to be over 60 years old to be a Republican. You can still be young and have your own views and ideals,' "" she said.

While she aligns with her party on fiscal issues, for instance, she doesn't on social issues, she said. ""What you do in your own home is your business,"" she said.

For Will Moore, a 20-year old Guilford College student, his decision to volunteer for Romney represents a significant break. The child of African-American Democrats and a ""long line of Democrats,"" as he put it, he decided the GOP better reflected his economic views.

Moore volunteered for the Romney campaign after being frustrated in his effort to find a summer job in Greensboro, about 45 minutes away from his home. Like many others in North Carolina, he blames the state's 9.6 percent jobless rate, higher than the national average, on Obama's failure to get the economy humming.

""When I couldn't find a job, I said, 'You know what? I'm going to make my trip all the way down to Greensboro worth it.' I came down here and made a couple of calls because if we don't change the policies it's going to be hard for businesses [to create] and individuals to find work. That's the engine [motivating] many people around here.""

California voters will soon decide whether to ban the sale of meat and eggs from farm animals raised in cages. A November ballot measure, Proposition 12, would require more spacious digs for pigs, veal calves and egg-laying hens. It applies to animals in California and to those raised elsewhere for products sold in the Golden State.

If you're experiencing a bit of déjà vu right now, it makes sense.

Back in 2008, voters overwhelmingly passed a strikingly similar animal welfare law. But some farmers argued the measure's language was too vague to interpret in practical terms.

The point for me is to raise animals in a way that they were intended to live.

After the 2008 law took effect, state agriculture officials ruled that farmers could comply with the law without getting rid of their cages as long as they provided more space within the cages.

To end confinement altogether, the Humane Society of the United States sponsored Proposition 12 this year.

Proponents

The measure is also endorsed by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Sierra Club, the California Democratic Party, the United Farm Workers, and the Center for Food Safety. The Yes on 12 campaign has raised $6.1 million as of Sept. 28, while the opponents, Stop the Rotten Egg Initiative, have raised about $566,000. The next financial reporting deadline is Oct. 25.

You know I don't believe fundamentally that animals have the same rights as humans.

Dede Boies supports the measure because it aligns with her farming philosophy. She raises chickens, ducks, turkeys and pigs on Root Down Farm, a huge open field in Pescadero, about an hour south of San Francisco.

""The point for me is to raise animals in a way that they were intended to live,"" says Boies. ""And to basically give them the best life possible.""

For Boies, confining animals in cages reduces them to products.

Proposition 12 requires each farm animal to have a specific amount of floor space beginning in 2020: 43 square feet for a veal calf; 24 square feet for a breeding pig; and 1 square foot for an egg-laying hen. Cage-free conditions will be mandatory for hens by 2022.

Opponents

The Association of California Egg Farmers and the National Pork Producers Council oppose Proposition 12 primarily because the measure applies to all veal, pork and eggs sold in California, even when the animals are raised in other states. For example, a pig raised and slaughtered in Illinois could not be housed in a crate if bacon or sausage from that animal is headed to California.

Ken Maschhoff is a fifth-generation hog farmer based in Carlyle, Ill., who runs one of the largest pork operations in the U.S.

""I certainly have a bone to pick with those that try to force their agenda and those costs on to others that would just as soon not bear those,"" says Maschhoff.

When his pigs are pregnant, which occurs twice a year or so, they're confined for about 100 days in a gestation crate that is 7 to 8 feet long and 24 to 30 inches wide. It does not allow the pigs to turn around.

Maschhoff says confining pigs during pregnancy is both humane and cost-effective because it prevents fighting between the animals, allowing more piglets to survive in the womb.

""I don't believe fundamentally that animals have the same rights as humans,"" says Maschhoff. ""I believe that farmers, ranchers, veterinarians, are animal welfare-ists. So there's a difference between animal rights and animal welfare.""

What's this going to cost consumers?

Maschhoff says Proposition 12 will require the pork industry nationwide to spend billions on new facilities, costs that will likely trickle down to pork consumers. Economists, though, say it's tough to forecast exact pork price increases.

It's easier to predict the cost of egg because cage-free eggs are already on store shelves. They're usually priced at about 50 cents to a dollar more per dozen than conventional eggs.

""People spend $50 to $100 a year on eggs,"" says University of California, Davis economist Dan Sumner. ""It'll go up to $100 to $150.""

Another factor could also be at play in egg prices: an uncertain future.

""The concern for the people investing in these new standards is that it's not at all clear that they're going to last very long,"" says Sumner.

In fact, animal welfare groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals are opposed to the new ballot measure. PETA says it doesn't go far enough to protect chickens, which still can be confined in barns if the proposal passes. So, even if voters approve Proposition 12 on Nov. 6, the battle over how much space farm animals need is likely not over."

President Obama won't be giving the speech he might wish to give tonight.

All presidents accepting their party's renomination seek to shift from a message of hope and change to one of progress and accomplishment. Although Obama will certainly talk up the highlights of his term, he won't want to sound triumphant — not with a jobs report due tomorrow that's expected to show a 43rd straight month of U.S. unemployment above 8 percent.

""In an acceptance situation, you want to paint a bright picture of all the wonderful things that have happened over the past four years,"" says Martin Medhurst, a professor of political science and rhetoric at Baylor University.

""While good things have happened, the economic picture is such that he'll be hard-pressed to paint a terribly bright picture,"" he says.

Obama's other main task — aside from knocking his opponent, Republican Mitt Romney — will be convincing voters that another four years in office will lead to greater things.

""He's got to remind people that he's done a tremendous amount and the best is yet to come,"" says Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, a vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

Rybak points to accomplishments Obama is likely to tout: bailing out the domestic auto industry, expanding health coverage for millions of Americans, reshaping the student loan business, ending the war in Iraq and winding down the one in Afghanistan, and green-lighting the mission that killed Osama bin Laden.

""He's delivered and is going to deliver a lot more than Mitt Romney can ever dream of doing,"" Rybak says.

As has been the case throughout the Democratic convention and the campaign as a whole, attacks on Romney's platform will certainly be a hallmark of Obama's speech.

""Both of them have to savage their opponent,"" says George C. Edwards III, a presidential scholar at Texas A&M University who has written a book about Obama's leadership titled Overreach.

""Obama has to frame the election as a choice, not a referendum [on his own record] — 'I'm better than the other guy,' "" Edwards says.

Obama will seek to raise doubts and fears about what a Romney administration would look like, arguing above all that it would imperil the middle class. And he'll be taking a page or two from the 1936 renomination acceptance speech of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Baylor's Medhurst suggests. Seeking a second term in the face of continuing depression and tremendously high unemployment, Roosevelt argued that the ""economic royalists"" in the Republican Party favored the rich, while he was for the little guy.

That fall, Roosevelt went on to win every state but Maine and Vermont.

""That's exactly the stance Obama is going to have to take,"" Medhurst says, ""that he stands for the middle class and Romney is for the rich people.""

Raising the stakes by painting a dire picture of a Romney presidency may be enough to prod the Democratic base, which has been noticeably less energized about this election than it was about Obama's run four years ago.

""I don't think he can recapture the magic of 2008 — no president can,"" says David Woodard, a Republican consultant who teaches at Clemson University. ""But he has to make them feel he can lead them to victory.""

Obama also has to speak to those other potential supporters who are disillusioned but might still be won over.

Romney and other Republicans sought at their convention last week to portray Obama as a well-intentioned man who has failed, so that voters will not feel bad about booting out a personally popular president.

""He's been president for four years, and I'm not sure the average person right now could answer the question, 'What does Barack Obama want to do in a second term that would have a better result?' "" says Gary Bauer, chairman of the Campaign for Working Families, a conservative political action committee.

The theme of the Democratic National Convention has been ""Forward."" Obama has to answer the question, ""Forward to what?""

""The challenge for Obama is that he needs to put out, much more than he has, a strong vision for what he wants to do in a second term,"" says Michael Waldman, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton and president of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school.

""Not an imaginary vision of what he would do if Democrats had all the power,"" Waldman adds, ""but, realistically, what people could expect from him if elected for a second term."""

Good morning.

Just as they did during the Republican National Convention, independent fact checkers are watching and listening to what's said at the Democratic National Convention. While they aren't yet slamming the Democrats for fudging their facts, they are finding some claims that don't add up or are misleading, both Tuesday night and again on Wednesday:

-- ""When former President Bill Clinton took the stage at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, he portrayed President Barack Obama as a pragmatic compromiser who has been stymied at every turn by Republicans,"" The Associated Press writes this morning. ""There was no mention of the role that the president and the Democrats have played in grinding compromise to a halt on some of the most important issues facing the country.

""That was among the lines by the former president and others Wednesday that either cherry-picked facts or mischaracterized the opposition.""

-- PolitiFact gives Clinton a ""true"" rating for saying that there have been 42 million private sector jobs created since 1961 when Democrats were in the White House, vs. 24 million under Republicans (a period over which Republicans held the White House for five more years than Democrats). It also rated as ""true"" Clinton's ""claim that Obama's stimulus program 'cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people.' ""

But PolitiFact dinged Delaware Gov. Jack Markell for saying that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney ""likes to fire people."" According to PolitiFact, ""that cherry-picks what Romney actually said, which was a comment on the advantage of being able to switch health insurance companies if a provider isn't giving good service. We rated Markell's claim False.""

-- FactCheck.org says Clinton's ""stem-winding nomination speech was a fact-checker's nightmare: lots of effort required to run down his many statistics and factual claims, producing little for us to write about."" (Which sounds to us like a good thing, overall.)

It adds that ""the worst we could fault him for was a suggestion that President Obama's Affordable Care Act was responsible for bringing down the rate of increase in health care spending, when the fact is that the law's main provisions have yet to take effect.""

-- But The Washington Post's The Fact Checker takes fairly strong issue with Clinton's statement that Obama's deficit reduction plan ""uses the bipartisan commission's balanced approach. It reduces the deficit by more than $4 trillion.""

According to The Fact Checker:

""The repeated claim that Obama's budget reduces the deficit by $4 trillion is simply not accurate. By the administration's math, you have nearly $3.8 trillion in spending cuts, compared to $1.5 trillion in tax increases (letting the Bush tax cuts expire for high-income Americans). Presto, $1 of tax increases for every $2.50 of spending cuts. ""But virtually no serious budget analyst agreed with this accounting. The $4 trillion figure, for instance, includes counting some $1 trillion in cuts reached a year ago in budget negotiations with Congress. So no matter who is the president, the savings are already in the bank. Moreover, the administration is also counting $848 billion in phantom savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, even though the administration had long made clear those wars would end.""

It wasn't what President Obama was hoping for: another disappointing jobs report the morning after he accepted the Democratic nomination and asked Americans to stay the course.

The U.S. economy added just 96,000 jobs last month, according to the Labor Department, and a drop in the unemployment rate to 8.1 percent was mostly due to people giving up on job searches.

Still, a number of analysts say the latest economic numbers likely won't change voters' minds.

Both political parties were quick to pounce on the data released hours after the Democratic National Convention wrapped up in Charlotte, N.C. Republicans painted the report as more evidence of Obama's failed policies, while Democrats said the recovery will take more time and that it has been hamstrung by the lockstep partisan divide in Congress.

""If last night was the party, this morning is the hangover,"" GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said in a statement. ""It's clear that President Obama just hasn't lived up to his promises and his policies haven't worked. We aren't better off than we were four years ago.""

Obama, who made a quiet exit from Charlotte en route to campaign stops in Iowa and New Hampshire, initially left the task of responding to the jobs report to his staff:

""Today's unemployment report provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression,"" Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement. He emphasized that the downturn began in December 2007, a full year before Obama took office.

Later, on the stump in New Hampshire, the president contrasted the August job gains to the massive job losses when he took office. ""We need to create more jobs, faster,"" he said.

Romney running mate Paul Ryan told CNBC: ""This is not even close to what a recovery looks like.""

The latest employment numbers may be deflating, but they seem unlikely to change the course of an election just two months away, says Allan Louden, a professor of presidential politics at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C.

""That ship has sailed,"" Louden says.

""Sure, for the Democrats, it steps on any afterlife of the convention,"" he says, ""but at this point, a good or bad jobs report might have a marginal, but not significant, impact on attitudes.""

Susan Drucker, a professor of political communication at Hofstra University, notes that Obama, Bill Clinton and other Democratic speakers this week sought to reframe the economic recovery as a marathon rather than a sprint.

""My impression is that public reaction to this jobs report will be the first test of that reframing,"" she says.

Obama campaign adviser Robert Gibbs today reiterated what has become a monthly mantra from the White House, saying the president ""understands we still have a long way to go.""

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi blamed Republicans for ""standing in the way of growth and certainty for our economy.""

Indeed, employers may be leery of hiring amid uncertainty over the looming fiscal cliff.

Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight, says businesses are feeling anxious about what lies ahead, given the partisan impasse in Congress that has delayed key decisions about tax rates and threatens to slash government spending.

""It creates enormous uncertainty and is surely having a depressing effect on hiring,"" he says.

And there's still one pre-election jobs report, due a month from now. What if things looked a lot better (or a lot worse)?

""People's views on the economy over the past four years are pretty well established,"" Gault says. ""If we did see some improvement over the next month or two, I doubt that is really going to convince people that the big picture is a lot different."""
