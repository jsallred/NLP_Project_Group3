An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows that 42 percent of voters expect the economy to improve over the next 12 months — the highest percentage since 2009 — and that 43 percent of voters think Mr. Obama would handle the economy better than Mr. Romney, compared with 43 percent who say the GOP candidate would do the better job.

SEE RELATED:

The results are a departure from polls throughout the race that consistently have shown that Americans think Mr. Romney is better equipped to handle the economy.

The poll, which surveyed 736 likely voters over the past week, also showed Mr. Obama with a 50-45 lead in the popular vote.

While the poll showed both candidates as even on the economy, Mr. Obama held significant edges in dealing with women’s issues and looking out for the middle class, and smaller edges in being a good commander-in-chief, dealing with Medicare and dealing with taxes.

The poll’s one bit of bad news for the president was that approval of his handling of foreign policy has slipped in the wake of ongoing unrest in the Middle East. Just 49 percent of voters said they approve of Mr. Obama’s foreign policy, down from 54 percent last month and his lowest figure since November 2010."
10,10,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/19/management-failures-cited-fast-and-furious-report/,Right,"The Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General on Wednesday blamed the failure of Operation Fast and Furious on a series of “misguided strategies,” but found no evidence that Attorney General Eric. H. Holder Jr. knew of the misguided gunrunning investigation before its public unraveling in January 2011.

The long-anticipated 471-page report cites “errors in judgment and management failures” on the part of officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives headquarters in Washington and in the Phoenix field office, and says “questionable judgments” by Justice Department officials in Washington marred the department’s response to Capitol Hill inquiries.

The investigation came to light after two AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifles purchased as a part of Fast and Furious were found at the scene of the killing nearly two years ago of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. The report recommended that 14 department employees be reviewed for possible sanctions or other disciplinary actions.

The report also says Acting Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler, Mr. Holder’s chief of staff, received a briefing about Fast and Furious in March 2010, but that the briefing “failed to alert Mr. Grindler to problems in the investigation.” The report says Mr. Grindler learned three days after the Dec. 14, 2010, death of Border Patrol Agent Brian A. Terry of the link between weapons found at the scene of the killing and Fast and Furious, but did not tell Mr. Holder. It said he should have “informed the attorney general as well as made an appropriate inquiry of ATF or the U.S. attorney’s office about the connection.”

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein, who reviewed Fast and Furious wiretap applications, resigned Wednesday in the wake of the report, which says he should have asked more questions about Fast and Furious, given his knowledge of a similar 2006 program known as Operation Wide Receiver. Former Acting ATF Director Kenneth Melson, named in the report as failing to maintain “appropriate oversight” of Fast and Furious, announced his retirement Wednesday, effective immediately.

Seriously flawed

According to the report, both Fast and Furious and Wide Receiver were “seriously flawed and supervised irresponsibly” by ATF’s Phoenix field division and the U.S. attorney’s office in Arizona, “most significantly in their failure to adequately consider the risk to the public safety in the United States and Mexico.” It said both investigations sought to identify the higher reaches of firearms-trafficking networks by deferring any overt law enforcement action against the individual straw buyers — such as making arrests or seizing firearms — even when there was sufficient evidence to do so.

“The risk to public safety was immediately evident in both investigations,” the report says. “Almost from the outset of each case, ATF agents learned that the purchases were financed by violent Mexican drug-trafficking organizations and that the firearms were destined for Mexico.”

Rep. Darrell E. Issa, California Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which investigated Fast and Furious, said Wednesday the report confirmed findings by Congress of a “near total disregard for public safety in Operation Fast and Furious, contrary to the denials of the attorney general and his political defenders.” Mr. Issa said the report notes that information in wiretap applications approved by senior Justice Department officials in Washington “did contain red flags showing reckless tactics” and they fault Mr. Holder’s inner circle for their conduct.

Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz is scheduled to testify to the committee on Thursday on the findings of his investigation.

Holder’s response

Mr. Holder said Wednesday the report’s key conclusions are “consistent” with what he and other Justice Department officials have said for many months: The inappropriate strategy and tactics employed were field-driven and date back to 2006; the leadership of the department did not know about or authorize the use of the flawed strategy and tactics; and the department’s leadership did not attempt to cover up information or mislead Congress about it.

“I want to assure the American people that I, and my colleagues at the department, will continue to focus on our mission of protecting their rights and their security and doing so in a manner that is consistent with the high standards of the Department of Justice,” he said.

The report identifies persons ranging from field agents and prosecutors in Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz., to senior ATF officials in Washington who “bore a share of responsibility” for ATF’s failures in both Fast and Furious and Wide Receiver to interdict firearms illegally bound for Mexico, and for pursuing “this risky strategy without adequately taking into account the significant danger to public safety that it created.”

“We operated with complete and total independence in our search for the truth, and the decision about what to cover in this report and the conclusions we reached were made solely by me and my office,” Mr. Horowitz said. “I am pleased that we are able to put forward a full and complete recitation of the facts that we found, and the conclusions that we reached, with minimal redactions by the department to our report.”

He also said the Obama administration made no redactions for executive privilege, even though the report evaluates in detail and reaches conclusions about the department’s actions in responding to Congress, adding that Justice has agreed to seek court authorization to unredact as much of the wiretap information as possible.

Lack of oversight

According to the report, investigators found that no one responsible for the operations at either the ATF Phoenix field division or the U.S. attorney’s office raised serious questions or concerns about the government not taking earlier measures to disrupt a trafficking operation that continued to purchase firearms with impunity for many months.

The report says that failure reflected a “significant lack of oversight and urgency” by both ATF and the U.S. attorney’s office and a “disregard by both” for the safety of persons in the United States and Mexico.

According to the report, Mr. Holder was notified immediately of Terry’s death but was not told about the connection between firearms found at the scene and Fast and Furious. It said he learned of the connection sometime in 2011, after he received a letter from Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, asking about Terry’s death.

“Had the department’s senior leadership taken immediate action after learning that weapons found at the scene of a federal law enforcement agent’s murder were linked to a straw purchaser in an ATF firearms-trafficking investigation, the department likely would have gathered information about Operation Fast and Furious well before it received the inquiry from Sen. Grassley about the very same issue in late January 2011. The Department, however, did not do so,” the report said.

The report said Mr. Grindler and former Deputy Chief of Staff Monty Wilkinson should have told Mr. Holder about the connection. It also singled out Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer, who heads the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, for possible disciplinary action for failing to alert Mr. Holder or his deputy when he learned in April 2010 that ATF had allowed guns to walk in Wide Receiver.

In addition, the report says Mr. Weinstein should have asked more questions about Fast and Furious, given his knowledge of Wide Receiver. Both Mr. Breuer and Mr. Weinstein were criticized for failing to draw a connection between the allegations in Mr. Grassley’s letters and their knowledge of gun-walking in Wide Receiver.

Weinstein’s dissenting view

In his resignation letter posted on his attorney’s website, Mr. Weinstein said he found it “personally painful” to read the report’s “completely false conclusion” that he knew about and failed to act on Fast and Furious guns being allowed to walk to Mexico. He said he had been assured by the ATF and prosecutors in Arizona that guns were not being transported south of the border.

According to the report, a poorly executed information-gathering and drafting process, as well as questionable judgments by department officials, contributed to Justice’s inclusion of inaccurate information in its Feb. 4 response letter to Mr. Grassley. It said that in preparing the letter, department officials relied on information provided by senior officials that was not accurate, primarily from U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke, ATF Acting Director Kenneth Melson and his deputy, William Hoover. It says they failed to exercise “appropriate oversight of the investigation, and to some extent were themselves receiving incorrect or incomplete information from their subordinates.”

Mr. Holder said officials within ATF and the U.S. attorney’s office in Arizona identified in the report as having been responsible for designing, implementing or supervising Fast and Furious have been “referred to the appropriate entities for review and consideration of potential personnel actions.” He declined to elaborate.

Political reaction split

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said the report “debunks many of the extreme allegations made by Republicans,” instead confirming conclusions reached in a minority report issued nearly a year ago that said neither Mr. Holder nor senior Justice Department officials authorized or approved of gun-walking in Fast and Furious, that gun-walking started under the President Bush’s administration in 2006, and that ATF agents in Phoenix and the U.S. attorney’s office in Arizona shared responsibility for “misguided operations spanning five years.”

Mr. Grassley said the report confirmed that Fast and Furious was the “height of irresponsibility on the part of a number of people from the ATF Phoenix field office all the way up to the Justice Department headquarters.” He said he was “glad” Mr. Horowitz was joining with him and Mr. Issa in urging the Justice Department to unseal Fast and Furious wiretap applications “so the American people can read them and make up their own minds.”

ATF shut down Fast and Furious after two AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifles purchased by straw buyers from a gun shop in Glendale, Ariz., were found near Terry’s body. The agent had been killed during a shootout with Mexican drug smugglers just north of the U.S.-Mexico border, south of Tucson. The killing led to public testimony by ATF agents opposed to the operation, who said more than 2,000 weapons had been walked to drug smugglers in Mexico, about 1,400 of which are still unaccounted for.

15,15,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/2/trump-drops-push-citizenship-question-2020-census/,Right,"President Trump’s quest to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census ended Tuesday, with the administration caving on the plans, bowing to a Supreme Court ruling and an intractable time crunch.

A Justice Department attorney, in an email that found its way onto Twitter, said the department had finalized the questionnaire and given the green light to print it without the citizenship question.

The decision is a symbolic blow to Mr. Trump, who staked significant political capital on his ability to get the question added and who had said it was “ridiculous” to conduct a census without asking about citizenship.

As late as Monday, the president told reporters he was considering ordering an unprecedented delay of the 2020 count to try to shoehorn the question into the form.

But by Tuesday, the realities of the calendar and his administration’s own legal positioning had set in.

“We can confirm that the decision has been made to print the 2020 Decennial Census questionnaire without a citizenship question, and that the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process,” Kate Bailey, one of the Justice Department attorneys involved in the case, said in the email that found its way onto social media.

Adding the question was going to be a long shot after the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., erected a roadblock last week.

The court ruled that while a citizenship question can be legal — and indeed has been asked on the full census before — the Trump administration cut too many corners by adding it this time.

The chief justice said he doubted the explanations of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for the need to add the question. He called it “contrived” and ordered a do-over.

The only problem was that the administration told the court that it faced a June 30 deadline — Sunday — for finalizing the questionnaire and sending it to the printer.

Mr. Trump was faced with options of either arguing that the deadline wasn’t real or attempting to delay the census entirely, which would have invited a whole new round of legal battles.

Democrats, who accused Mr. Trump of trying to weaponize the census to suppress Hispanic and immigrant participation, cheered the president’s failure.

“A citizenship question would have pushed us backward for nothing more than crass political calculations,” said Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., New Jersey Democrat. “Today America won, and Donald Trump and his political minions lost.”

The citizenship question had become a microcosm of the broader debate over Mr. Trump’s approach to racial and immigration matters, and both sides turned up the rhetoric.

“Nobody can believe this, but they spend billions of dollars on the census, and you’re not allowed to ask?” an incredulous president told reporters Monday.

He added: “There’s a big difference, to me, between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.”

Opposing Mr. Trump was the full array of liberal forces, including Democrat-led states, immigrant rights groups, civil rights organizations and progressive campaigns.

“The Trump administration’s politically motivated efforts to undermine the Constitution in this instance were so reprehensible that even the conservative Supreme Court couldn’t let them get away with it,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat.

The Trump administration seemed to have bungled the citizenship question effort from the start.

Mr. Ross said he added it after a request from the Justice Department, which said more specific citizenship data would help police voting rights laws.

But evidence emerged that Mr. Ross had been inclined to add the question before the Justice Department request and had been in contact with Trump political allies who had other reasons for wanting the data.

Critics also said the question, asked by this administration, would reduce the response rate.

Three district court judges ruled that Mr. Ross ignored those findings and cut too many other corners in his zeal to get the question approved in time.

The Supreme Court sped the case onto its docket without waiting for circuit courts of appeals to rule. In a stunning decision last week, the severely divided court, in a 5-4 ruling, ordered Mr. Trump to take a do-over.

But the ruling was handed down June 27, three days before the deadline for the census forms to go to print.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, Maryland Democrat and chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said the Supreme Court’s decision was a victory, but he added that he will continue an investigation into why it was added in the first place.

“The attorney general and the secretary of commerce must now turn over all of the documents our committee has subpoenaed on a bipartisan basis,” Mr. Cummings said.

30,30,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/7/iran-raises-uranium-enrichment-nuclear-deal-unrave/,Right,"TEHRAN, Iran — Iran announced Sunday it will raise its level of uranium enrichment, breaking another limit of its unraveling 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and further heightening tensions with the U.S.

Officials also said the next step impacting Iran’s compliance with the deal would be taken in 60 days. They did not elaborate.

At the same time, Iran was signaling openness to last-minute efforts to save the faltering deal. Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that discussions with European powers are continuing and that ministerial-level talks are planned later this month.

On Saturday, French President Emmanuel Macron told his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, in a phone call that he is trying to find a way by July 15 to resume the dialogue between Iran and Western partners.

Sunday’s announcement about uranium enrichment came a year after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the deal. Iran has repeatedly warned Europe in recent weeks that it would begin walking away from an accord neutered by a maximalist American campaign of sanctions.

Hopes for saving the faltering deal appear increasingly dim, as the Europeans have been unable to offer Iran any effective way around U.S. sanctions that block Tehran’s oil sales abroad and targeted its top officials.

At the same time, Iran’s recent measures, while of concern to nuclear non-proliferation experts, could be easily reversible if Europeans offer Iran the sanctions relief it seeks.

Iran has ruled out re-negotiating the 2015 deal in any new diplomatic efforts. Iran’s deputy foreign minister said Sunday that the U.S. can join any renewed talks, but must lift sanctions on Iran first.

Tensions began rising in May when the U.S. rushed thousands of additional troops, an aircraft carrier, nuclear-capable B-52 bombers and advanced fighter jets to the Mideast.

Mysterious oil tanker blasts near the Strait of Hormuz, attacks by Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen on Saudi Arabia and Iran shooting down a U.S. military drone have raised fears of a wider conflict engulfing a region crucial to global energy supplies.

In Sunday’s news conference, Iranian officials said the new level of uranium enrichment would be reached later in the day, but did not provide a percentage.

Government spokesman Ali Rabiei said the new level “will be based on our needs.” Under the nuclear deal, the cap for enrichment had been set at 3.67%.

Officials said details of Iran’s plan for going beyond the 3.67% limit will be sent in a letter by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.

The United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said it was aware of Iran’s comments and “inspectors in Iran will report to our headquarters as soon as they verify the announced development.”

The decision to ramp up uranium enrichment came less than a week after Iran acknowledged breaking the deal’s 300-kilogram (661-pound) limit on its low-enriched uranium stockpile.

Experts warn higher enrichment and a growing stockpile narrow the one-year window Iran would need to have enough material for an atomic bomb, something Iran denies it wants but the deal prevented.

The deputy foreign minister also signaled Iran’s intention to take further steps impacting compliance with the deal.

“We prefer to announce the third step after a 60-day deadline and in an appropriate time,” Aragchi said without elaborating

Enriched uranium at the 3.67% level is enough for peaceful pursuits but is far below weapons-grade levels of 90%.

Iran denies it seeks nuclear weapons, but the nuclear deal sought to prevent that as a possibility by limiting enrichment and Iran’s stockpile of uranium.

The spokesman for Iran’s nuclear department, Behrouz Kamalvandi, said Sunday that technical preparations for the new level of enrichment will be completed “within several hours and enrichment over 3.67% will begin.”

He says monitoring will show the increased level by Monday morning.

International reaction came swiftly, including from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who long has described Iran and its nuclear program as a threat to his country. He called on world powers to impose “snapback sanctions” on Iran.

Kim Darroch said in a letter Wednesday that even though his posting was due to end this year, he believed “in the current circumstances the responsible course is to allow the appointment of a new ambassador.”

Darroch said he is “grateful to all those in the UK and the US, who have offered their support during this difficult few days.”

Prime Minister Theresa May said it was a “matter of regret” that Darroch resigned.

Darroch’s forthright, unfiltered views on the U.S. administration — meant for a limited audience and discreet review — appeared in leaked diplomatic documents that were published in Britain’s Mail on Sunday newspaper."
60,60,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/14/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-fires-back-trump-you-cann/,Right,"President Trump’s comments Sunday about “Progressive Democratic Congresswomen” prompted a furious response from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who tweeted at Mr. Trump, “you can’t conceive of an America that includes us.”

Mr. President, the country I “come from,” & the country we all swear to, is the United States.



But given how you’ve destroyed our border with inhumane camps, all at a benefit to you & the corps who profit off them, you are absolutely right about the corruption laid at your feet. https://t.co/HLKQCotR8T — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 14, 2019



“Mr. President, the country I ‘come from,’ & the country we all swear to, is the United States,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat, said. “On top of not accepting an America that elected us, you cannot accept that we don’t fear you, either. You can’t accept that we will call your bluff & offer a positive vision for this country. And that’s what makes you seethe.”

She added, “You are angry because you don’t believe in an America where I represent New York 14, where the good people of Minnesota elected @IlhanMN, where @RashidaTlaib fights for Michigan families, where @AyannaPressley champions little girls in Boston. …You rely on a frightened America for your plunder.”

Her response Sunday afternoon was prompted by comments from Mr. Trump, also on Twitter, that she and the other first-term progressive women feuding with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should go back to the dysfunctional countries “from which they came” instead of criticizing the U.S.

Mr. Trump deleted the tweets early Sunday evening.

Mr. Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts were both born in the U.S. of American parents. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan was also born in the U.S., but to Palestinian immigrant parents. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota was born in Somalia and came to the U.S. as a refugee.

Ms. Omar told the president, “As Members of Congress, the only country we swear an oath to is the United States. Which is why we are fighting to protect it from the worst, most corrupt and inept president we have ever seen.”

“You are stoking white nationalism bc you are angry that people like us are serving in Congress and fighting against your hate-filled agenda,” she tweeted at Mr. Trump.

Ms. Tlaib fired back at the president, “I am fighting corruption in OUR country. I do it every day when I hold your admin accountable as a U.S. Congresswoman. Detroit taught me how to fight for the communities you continue to degrade & attack. Keep talking, you’ll be out of the WH soon. #TickTock”

80,80,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/15/nancy-pelosi-introduce-resolution-condemning-trump/,Right,"House Democrats said Monday they plan to introduce a resolution condemning President Trump’s “xenophobic” comments against four freshman Democratic lawmakers, as more Republicans publicly criticized Mr. Trump for his remarks telling the Democrats to go back to their original countries.

“The House cannot allow the president’s characterization of immigrants to our country to stand,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told colleagues in a letter. “Our Republican colleagues must join us in condemning the president’s xenophobic tweets.”

She said a resolution will be introduced by Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, who was born in Poland, and Rep. Jamie Raskin, Maryland Democrat.

“The president went beyond his own low standards using disgraceful language about members of Congress,” she said. “Our caucus will continue to forcefully respond to these disgusting attacks.”

In light of the tweets, Rep. Al Green announced he’d be pushing to force a vote on impeachment later this month.

“I will again, this month, bring impeachment to a vote on the Floor of the U.S. House of Representatives for bigotry in policy, harmful to our society,” the Texas Democrat announced.

While more than 80 Democrats are in favor of stating an impeachment inquiry, Mrs. Pelosi has been dead set against moving forward on that front.

Rep. Chip Roy, Texas Republican, became the first of several GOP lawmakers to criticize President Trump’s comments calling on a group of female freshman Democratic House members to go back to the countries they came from.

Mr. Trump “was wrong to say any American citizen, whether in Congress or not, has any ‘home’ besides the U.S.,” Mr. Roy tweeted late Sunday night.

But he added, “I just as strongly believe non-citizens who abuse our immigration laws should be sent home immediately, & Reps who refuse to defend America should be sent home 11/2020,” a reference to Election Day.

The only two black Republican lawmakers in Congress also criticized Mr. Trump’s comments. Rep. Will Hurd of Texas called the president’s remarks “racist and xenophobic;” Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Mr. Trump engaged in “unacceptable personal attacks and racially offensive language.”

Rep. Mike Turner, Ohio Republican, said the president’s remarks “were racist and he should apologize.”

Two Michigan Republicans, Reps. Fred Upton and Paul Mitchell, also disagreed publicly with Mr. Trump on Monday. Mr. Upton said on Twitter that he was “appalled” by the president’s comments.

“There’s no excuse,” Mr. Upton said. “Inflammatory rhetoric from both sides of the aisle that is used to divide us just isn’t right. It’s not helpful. We have too many challenges facing us that we ought to be working on together – immigration, the debt ceiling, the border crisis. The President’s tweets were flat out wrong and uncalled for, and I would encourage my colleagues from both parties to stop talking so much and start governing more.”

Democrats have accused Mr. Trump of racism for his tweets that were apparently aimed at Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a native of Somalia, and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. All are U.S. citizens.

The president redoubled his criticism of the Democratic lawmakers for spewing “racist hatred” and anti-Semitism, and he challenged other Democrats to rebuke them.

“If Democrats want to unite around the foul language & racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular & unrepresentative Congresswomen, it will be interesting to see how it plays out,” Mr. Trump tweeted Monday. “I can tell you that they have made Israel feel abandoned by the U.S. When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them & their horrible & disgusting actions!”

Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, said he spoke with Mr. Trump after the president’s initial tweets and urged him to tone down his rhetoric.

“Mr. President, you’re going to win. Just knock it down a notch,” Mr. Graham said on “Fox & Friends.”

He said the president needs to “aim higher” when talking about the liberal House Democrats.

“Talk about their policies,” Mr. Graham said, as if speaking directly to Mr. Trump. “They’re American citizens that are duly elected that are running on an agenda that’s disgusting. They’re anti-Semitic. They’re Socialist. Make them the face of the Democratic Party. They are American citizens. They won an election. You’re right about their policies. Just aim higher. Don’t get personal. Don’t take the bait. They’re on the wrong side of the future.”

The Trump campaign’s communications director said on Twitter that the president “loves this country & doesn’t like it when elected officials constantly disparage it & spew anti-Semitic rhetoric.”

“All Dems have leapt to defend the ‘Blame America First’ crowd when they really should be defending America & rooting out anti-Semitism in their ranks,” Tim Murtaugh said.

In an appearance on “Fox & Friends” on Monday, Mr. Roy said the president is “right” to be confronting the liberal House women over their opposition to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

“My radical leftist colleagues in the House, they need to go home, they need to be sent home, and I’m glad the president is taking them on,” Mr. Roy said. “The president is right to take them on, and we should make sure the American people know that that is the face of the Democratic Party. That is who needs to be sent home in 2020.”

82,82,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/17/trump-north-carolina-rally-winning-it-lot-attacks-/,Right,"Fresh from his condemnation by House Democrats, President Trump exulted Wednesday that he’s winning his feud against a “squad” of liberal lawmakers, pointing to an uptick in his polling and claiming victory with boisterous supporters at a campaign rally in North Carolina.

He attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali refugee and U.S. citizen from Minnesota, by claiming she is disloyal to the country, resulting in chants of “send her back” from his Greenville crowd and evoking his 2016 war with Hillary Clinton.

“I do think I’m winning the political fight, I think I’m winning it by a lot,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House. “They are not espousing the views of our country, the four congresswomen.”

He said the Democratic Party “is really going in a direction that nobody thought possible — they’re going so far left that they’re going to fall off a cliff.”

Down at the rally, Mr. Trump rejoiced that the House “has overwhelmingly voted to kill the most ridiculous project I’ve ever been involved in, the resolution — how stupid is that? — on impeachment.”

“The vote was a totally lopsided 332 to 95,” Mr. Trump said, referring to an attempt that didn’t have full backing from Democratic leaders. “So now we have that behind us.”

Citing the strong economy, the rebuilt military, tax cuts and lower regulation, the president said, “And they want to try and impeach. It’s a disgrace.”

A day after House Democrats voted to condemn what they called Mr. Trump’s “racist” comments for urging the four liberal lawmakers to “go back” to their countries of origin, the president pointed with satisfaction to only four GOP defections in the vote.

“The story last night was that 187 Republicans voted in favor of Trump, and four voted against,” the president said. “I think that was the big story. There’s great unity in the Republican Party.”

Mr. Trump also called attention to a new Rasmussen poll showing his job approval climbing 4 percentage points since Friday, to 50%. He credited it to his incendiary public battle with the so-called “Squad” of freshman Democrats — Ms. Omar and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, all of whom are U.S. citizens.

Mr. Trump claimed some of them lied about conditions at the border, where illegal-immigrant detention camps have drawn fresh scrutiny.

A poll taken since the president started the spat Sunday showed his popularity rising among Republicans. The Reuters/Ipsos poll found that Mr. Trump’s net approval among Republicans increased 5 percentage points, to 72%, compared with the same survey a week earlier.

The president has said the furor over his comments didn’t worry him “because many people agree with me.”

“I’m not relishing the fight,” Mr. Trump said. “I’m enjoying it because I have to get the word out to the American people.”

From Greenville, he recounted his 2016 victory in North Carolina and other key states, checking off his push for more jobs and a border wall with Mexico since that night.

“We have to do it again,” he said, prompting chants of “four more years” from the crowd.

He also claimed to be making inroads with women, a potential worry spot for the campaign in certain suburbs, citing economic progress under his tenure.

“What’s wrong with you, men?” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Trump called up Dan Bishop, a Republican who is taking on Dan McCready — a Democrat — in a special election for a congressional seat in North Carolina. The candidate revved up the crowd, arguing his foe will reverse the GOP tax cuts from 2017.

Mr. Trump also lauded Sen. Thom Tillis, North Carolina Republican facing reelection next year, for his work on fighting human trafficking.

The Reuters poll also showed, however, that Mr. Trump lost approval among independents and Democrats in the past week. About three out of 10 independents said they approved of Mr. Trump, down from four out of 10 a week ago, and his approval among Democrats was down 2 percentage points.

The president’s overall approval remained unchanged over the past week, at 41%, in the survey.

Mr. Trump sparked the controversy Sunday by tweeting the four congresswomen should all go back to their “broken and crime infested places from which they came.” Three of the lawmakers were born in the U.S., and Ms. Omar has been a naturalized citizen since she was a teenager.

The statement reminded minorities, immigrants and others of hurtful comments they’d heard their whole lives and that portray them as outsiders.

The president is shifting his language from “go back” to “leave,” saying he wants opponents to emigrate if they’re unhappy in the U.S.

“If they don’t love it, tell them to leave it,” Mr. Trump said.

Congressional Democrats said they didn’t expect to change Mr. Trump’s rhetoric but defended taking a stand against his comments through a resolution.

“Those words are racism,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters. “We’re offended that he says that about people across the country all the time — ‘go back where you came from.’ And that is, by its definition, those words are racism.”

She said the resolution to condemn him was “benign,” compared with the criticisms of the president that some of her Democratic troops wanted to include in it.

92,92,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/21/romney-tries-seize-mantle-change/,Right,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Now it’s Mitt Romney who wants to be the candidate of change.

Romney seized on President Barack Obama’s comment that “you can’t change Washington from the inside.” Grasping for a way to right his campaign and appeal to independents, the Republican nominee said he has what it takes to end the nasty partisanship in the nation’s capital.

“I can change Washington,” Romney said Thursday. “I will change Washington. We’ll get the job done from the inside. Republicans and Democrats will come together.”

Romney was expected to press the issue again Friday during a campaign rally in Nevada, a state hard hit by the nation’s housing and unemployment woes.

Obama, traveling Friday to Virginia and addressing an AARP convention by satellite, planned to keep hammering Romney for comments he made in a private fundraiser about 47 percent of the country believing they are victims and entitled to a government handouts.

Obama, who ran for president in 2008 on a pledge to fix Washington’s combative tone, said in an interview that he had come to the conclusion “you can’t change Washington from the inside. You can only change it from the outside.” Adding that he wanted people to speak out on issues, he went on to say: “So something that I’d really like to concentrate on in my second term is being in a much more constant conversation with the American people so that they can put pressure on Congress to help move some of these issues forward.”

After Romney focused on the “can’t change Washington from the inside” segment of Obama’s remarks, the president’s campaign countered quickly by noting that Romney said exactly that in 2007, when he was running for the 2008 Republican nomination: “I don’t think you change Washington from the inside. I think you change it from the outside.”

Obama adviser David Axelrod defended the president’s comments on NBC’s “Today.” ”He said in order to move Washington and to move the Congress, you have to enlist the American people,” Axelrod said.

“That was the lesson he learned from the standoff on the debt ceiling last summer, and he’s been making that point consistently,” Axelrod said. “The fact that Gov. Romney picked up on it and attacked him on it is just one more example of how he’s just cascading from one gratuitous attack to another, instead of talking about solutions to the problems we face.”

Obama’s campaign also released a web video Friday morning targeting older voters, many of whom would fall into the group of Americans Romney referenced when he said that nearly half of Americans don’t pay income tax but get benefits. Senior citizens receiving Medicare make up about 15 percent of those getting federal benefits; about 22 percent of those not paying income tax are seniors who get tax breaks that offset their income.

The Obama video features voters commenting on Romney’s assertions, including one man who says “It offends me.”

Polling shows Obama with a slight lead nationally, as well as in many of the eight or so battleground states that will decide the election. That includes Virginia, where Democrats with access to internal polling say Obama is up 3 or 4 percentage points over Romney in Virginia, a slimmer margin than in some recent public polling.

Obama has also pulled ahead of Romney in cash on hand, a key measure of a campaign’s financial strength. The Democrat has more than $88 million to spend in the campaign’s final weeks, while Romney has just over $50 million at his disposal.

Romney’s campaign is seeking to regroup after a rough stretch that included the emergence of a video in which he tells wealthy donors at a private fundraiser that 47 percent of Americans pay no income tax and that they believe they are victims and entitled to an array of federal benefits. Obama has cast those remarks as a sign that Romney is out of touch with most Americans.

“When you express an attitude that half the country considers itself victims, that somehow they want to be dependent on government, my thinking is maybe you haven’t gotten around a lot,” Obama said Thursday during a forum on Univision, the Spanish-language TV network.

Romney is also facing criticism from some in his own party that he’s spending too much time raising money and not enough time talking to voters in the eight or so battleground states that will decide the election. In response, his campaign added a Sunday rally in Colorado to his schedule and announced a three-day Ohio bus tour that kicks off Monday.

At the same time, his wife, Ann, said GOP critics should lay off. “Stop it. This is hard. You want to try it? Get in the ring,” she said Thursday evening in an interview with Radio Iowa.

“This is hard, and you know, it’s an important thing that we’re doing right now, and it’s an important election,” she said. “And it is time for all Americans to realize how significant this election is and how lucky we are to have someone with Mitt’s qualifications and experience and know-how to be able to have the opportunity to run this country.”

The president will campaign this weekend in Wisconsin, a state Romney is trying to put in play. Republicans are hoping the addition of Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan to the GOP ticket will help them claim victory there — or at least force Obama to spend time and money to hold the state.

Even with Election Day under seven weeks away, voters across the country are already casting ballots. By week’s end, early voting will be under way in two dozen states.

Obama was also making a play for older voters Friday by speaking via satellite to an AARP convention and taking questions from the group’s members. The president’s campaign is seeking to gain an advantage with seniors and voters nearing retirement by attacking the Republican ticket’s plan for Medicare.

The popular federal entitlement for seniors was the focus of a new television ad from the Obama campaign. The ad, scheduled to air Friday in Colorado, Florida and Iowa, presents a Democratic refrain — that Romney and Ryan would turn Medicare into a voucher program that could raise seniors’ health costs by up to $6,400 a year.

Independent groups have said that a House Republican budget proposal led by Ryan could lead to higher costs for older Americans. But exactly how much is far from clear. The ad relies on the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank, for the figure it cites.

Supporters of the Ryan plan say competition among private insurance providers could wring waste out of the system and bring down costs.

Peoples reported from Palm Beach, Fla."
148,148,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/4/mick-mulvaney-on-shootings-in-ohio-texas-to-think-/,Right,"Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that guns are only part of the discussion on how to prevent mass shootings like the ones in Texas and Ohio over the weekend.

“Are we going to talk about the role of guns? Certainly we are. But to think that this is just a gun issue that many people make it out to be is not right,” Mr. Mulvaney said on ABC’s “This Week.” “We’ve had guns in this country for hundreds of years. We haven’t had this until recently and we need to figure out why.”

“If we can agree on one thing as a nation — Democrat, Republican and independent, I don’t care — it is that crazy people like this should not have been able to get guns,” he said.

Dayton, Ohio, Mayor Nan Whaley said the person accused of killing at least nine people overnight near a bar was carrying a .223-caliber rifle and had multiple high-capacity magazines with him.

Mr. Mulvaney said social media should be part of the discussion. Authorities are investigating whether the man accused of killing at least 20 people Saturday in El Paso, Texas, also wrote a manifesto published online in which the author expressed fear that an influx of Hispanic voters into the U.S. could turn Texas blue.

“We’ve given a wide audience to these people. We’ve made them celebrities. We’ve allowed them to spew their hate without any restrictions whatsoever,” Mr. Mulvaney said. “I’m not saying we’re going to regulate social media -—I’m just saying we have to have a broad-based discussion about the causes here.”

He said President Trump has spoken with the governors of Texas and Ohio.

“The first call he made yesterday was to the attorney general to find out what we could do to prevent this type of thing from happening, what we could do to send a message to people, the sick people who would do this kind of stuff,” he said.

174,174,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/25/obama-us-will-stop-iran-developing-nukes/,Right,"His expected campaign advantage on foreign-policy issues suddenly in doubt, President Obama at the United Nations on Tuesday portrayed the deaths of four Americans in Libya as a result of inflamed tensions over an anti-Islam movie produced in the U.S. rather than a terrorist attack aimed at his policies in dealing with the Arab Spring and Middle East unrest.

Although his administration in recent days acknowledged that the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others were caused by a terrorist act on Sept. 11, Mr. Obama didn’t mention terrorism as the likely motive in front of an international audience at the U.N. General Assembly’s annual gathering. After referencing the killing of the ambassador, Mr. Obama focused much of his speech on promoting religious tolerance and free speech, blaming the film for provoking the anti-U.S. outbursts while saying there is never an excuse for violence.

“In every country, there are those who find different religious beliefs threatening; in every culture, those who love freedom for themselves must ask themselves how much they’re willing to tolerate freedom for others,” Mr. Obama said. “That is what we saw play out in the last two weeks, as a crude and disgusting video sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world.”

The White House has sparred in recent days with the campaign of GOP challenger Mitt Romney over whether the administration was too quick to condemn the U.S.-based makers of the film instead of the radical Islamic elements in the region who responded with violent protests that resulted in some 40 deaths across the region.

Mr. Obama also said there is “still time and space” to resolve the international impasse over Iran’s suspect nuclear programs, although “that time is not unlimited” for Tehran to make a deal.

He also said it is time for Syrian President Bashar Assad to step down in the face of a raging popular revolt.

“Make no mistake: A nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained,” Mr. Obama said. “It would threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations and the unraveling of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.”

But Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who addresses the U.N. gathering Wednesday, sounded a defiant note in a meeting with reporters Monday, while Iranian military leaders in Tehran released details of a long-range drone and test-fired four anti-ship missiles in a prelude to upcoming naval war games planned in an apparent response to U.S.-led warship drills in the Persian Gulf.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon picked up on Mr. Obama’s warnings over Syria, telling world leaders that international action was needed to end the violence in the 18-month-old conflict that, he said, has become “a regional calamity with global ramifications.”

“The international community should not look the other way as violence spirals out of control,” Mr. Ban said.

Shifting story

Downplaying the role of terrorism in the Libya attack was yet another shift in Mr. Obama’s explanation for the violence. In the days after the assault, the administration blamed the reports of the anti-Islamic video. Then last week, U.S. officials began to acknowledge that the attack bore the signs of terrorism.

The Libyan prime minister said the attack on the U.S. Consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi was planned, and the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said there was reason to believe that al Qaeda or its affiliates carried out the killings.

Even on Monday, while taping a TV segment of “The View” in New York, Mr. Obama indicated that the Libyan attack was the work of terrorists.

“There’s no doubt that the kind of weapons that were used, the ongoing assault, that it wasn’t just a mob action,” Mr. Obama said.

The consulate was attacked during anti-U.S. protests that have roiled the Middle East over the past two weeks, calling into question Mr. Obama’s approach to foreign policy in the Muslim world.

The shifting reasons for the attack in Libya also highlighted a challenge for Mr. Obama in the presidential race, where he is presenting himself to voters as the experienced hand compared with Mr. Romney. At the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., this month, the president portrayed his Republican opponent as new to foreign policy.

Mr. Obama is under increasing criticism from the right over his handling of Iran’s suspected nuclear weapons program and his perceived reluctance to give full-throated cooperation to Israel in stopping Iran from developing a weapon of mass destruction.

The president sought to allay those concerns Tuesday by telling the U.N. that his administration “will do what we must” to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.

Mr. Romney, addressing former President Bill Clinton’s international foundation in New York earlier in the day, insisted again that the Benghazi attack was an act of terrorism. A spokeswoman for Mr. Romney’s campaign added that, more broadly, the president is failing to lead internationally.

“For nearly four years, President Obama’s foreign policy has left our closest allies alienated and our security threatened,” said Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul. “Instead of delivering a ‘new beginning’ with Iran, the president’s failed policies have allowed Iran to move closer toward nuclear-weapons capability. Our national security and allies in the Middle East can’t afford four more years like the last four years under President Obama. As president, Mitt Romney will ensure that Iran is never permitted to develop a nuclear-weapons capability.”

‘Disgusting video’

But Mr. Obama devoted the bulk of his speech to explaining his approach to the Muslim world in light of the widespread backlash against the U.S. He asked other cultures to accept the American principle of free speech while laying much of the blame for the violence on the “disgusting” video.

“I know there are some who ask why we don’t just ban such a video,” Mr. Obama said. “The answer is enshrined in our laws: Our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech. Here in the United States, countless publications provoke offense. Like me, the majority of Americans are Christian, and yet we do not ban blasphemy against our most sacred beliefs.”

The president held himself up as an example of someone who shrugs off offensive commentary.

“As president of our country, and commander in chief of our military, I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day, and I will always defend their right to do so,” he said. “Americans have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views — even views that we disagree with.”

He used the story of Mr. Stevens’ life as the ideal of American foreign service and said other cultures should appreciate the diplomat’s commitment to improving the countries where he worked.

“I tell you this story because Chris Stevens embodied the best of America,” Mr. Obama said. “He acted with humility, but stood up for a set of principles — a belief that individuals should be free to determine their own destiny, and live with liberty, dignity, justice and opportunity.”

The president said leaders in every country have an obligation “to speak out forcefully against violence and extremism.”

“It is time to marginalize those who — even when not resorting to violence — use hatred of America, or the West, or Israel as a central principle of politics,” he said. “For that only gives cover, and sometimes makes excuses, for those who resort to violence. That brand of politics — one that pits East against West; South against North; Muslim against Christian, Hindu and Jew — cannot deliver the promise of freedom. Burning an American flag will do nothing to educate a child. Smashing apart a restaurant will not fill an empty stomach. Attacking an embassy won’t create a single job. That brand of politics only makes it harder to achieve what we must do together: educating our children and creating the opportunities they deserve; protecting human rights; and extending democracy’s promise.”

But his call for other countries to embrace American-style free-speech standards met with a mixed reaction from the gathering.

The foreign minister of Indonesia, home to the world’s largest Muslim population, said Mr. Obama’s speech was a “clarion call” for all nations to reject intolerance. He said it is “an issue that galvanizes all of us,” according to the Associated Press. But Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa added that freedom of expression should be exercised with consideration to morality and public order.

Dina Zakaria, a spokeswoman for the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice political party, said cultural differences between the U.S. and the Muslim and Arab world over the limitations of freedom of expression will persist.

“No one can argue against freedom of expression, but the Western understanding of it is different from ours,” she said. “Will this freedom allow for contempt of religion? For us, it is different. For us, it is a red line as Muslims and Christians as well.”

177,177,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/9/trump-holding-his-own-iowa-kernel-poll/,Right,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Dennis DeWitt says he typically doesn’t get involved in politics until it is time to vote, but he took the opportunity here Friday to throw his support behind President Trump in the Iowa State Fair’s popular “corn kernel poll.”

Mr. Trump is showing his strength in the informal survey of fairgoers, which through Thursday night showed that half of the more than 4,700 kernels cast had gone for Republicans and half had gone for Democrats.

Mr. Trump had received support from 97% of Republicans, while former Vice President Joseph R. Biden was the top choice of Democrats, pulling in 33% of the votes cast. The poll will run for more than a week.

“He’s telling the truth that people don’t want to hear, and they don’t like it,” Mr. DeWitt said after dropping his kernel into the Trump mason jar, which was filling up quickly Friday. “He does say things he shouldn’t say, but the economy is good.”

The support for Mr. Trump contrasts sharply with the criticism the 2020 field of presidential contenders has leveled at the Republican at the nearby Soap Box forum.

Sponsored by the Des Moines Register, the event is giving more than 20 presidential contenders the chance to deliver a stump speech and field questions from people at the fair.

The lineup of speakers Friday included former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, spiritual guru Marianne Williamson and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.

The foursome is struggling in the Democratic kernel poll.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is running second among Democrats in the kernel poll at 14%, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, 12%, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, 11%, and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont at 5%.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who has launched a challenge against Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination, has notched 3%.

188,188,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/12/potential-jurors-trial-greg-craig-former-obama-wh-/,Right,"Jury selection began Monday in the trial of Greg Craig, once the Obama White House’s top lawyer and a man who now stands charged with obscuring his efforts to assist a foreign government while in private practice.

Upon exiting the courtroom Monday, defense attorneys said they expect the jury process to conclude early Tuesday with opening arguments starting sometime after that.

Mr. Craig has pleaded not guilty to accusations that he failed to properly report his activities on behalf of officials in Ukraine, which included work with Paul Manafort, the one-time Trump campaign chairman who has been convicted on charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson twice told the potential jurors Monday of the case’s links to Mr. Mueller, asking if they have “any knowledge or connection” to Mr. Mueller, Manafort or his longtime business associate Rick Gates.

Gates also has pleaded guilty to charges brought by the special counsel team and is cooperating with the government. He is expected to be a key witness in the trial against Mr. Craig.

Judge Jackson said the questions were to find connections that would prevent or hinder an impartial verdict. She told jurors her goal was to find people who “do not already know anything about the case.”

Reporters and the public were permitted to watch the initial part of jury selection, but Judge Jackson then cleared the courtroom so attorneys could ask more personal questions of the jurors.

Mr. Craig was indicted in April on two counts of providing false statements to the Justice Department. Judge Jackson threw out one of those counts last week but allowed trial to commence this week on the remaining count.

The case against Mr. Craig centers on work he and his law firm — Skadden Arps Slate Meager & Flom — performed for Ukraine’s pro-Russia government in 2012.

Manafort tapped the firm to draw up a report whitewashing the Ukrainian prime minister’s prosecution of a former political rival.

Prosecutors say when Mr. Craig pitched the report to The New York Times as an independent review of the case, he was lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. In doing so, Mr. Craig violated the Foreign Agent Registration Act, because he never registered as a foreign agent, the Justice Department said.

Emails obtained by the government detail Mr. Craig’s lengthy discussions saying he wanted to avoid having to register, fearing it would shut him out of future government jobs if he did.

The Craig defense team says his activities were on behalf of his law firm, not a foreign government, and thus didn’t require registration.

The law firm reached a settlement this year on charged it violated the agent-registration law, agreeing to register and to pay a $4.6 million fine and thus avoiding prosecution.

213,213,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/16/justice-department-issues-warrant-iranian-tanker-s/,Right,"A U.S. court has issued a warrant for the seizure of an Iranian oil tanker at the center of a fierce international dispute, the Justice Department said late Friday.

The oil tanker, Grace 1, with more than 2 million barrels of oil aboard and $995,000 are subject to forfeiture based on a complaint by the U.S. Government.

Jessie K. Liu, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia said the tanker and its contents should be forfeited because of violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, bank fraud, money laundering and terrorism forfeiture statutes.

The Justice Department says the Grace 1 has ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which it had designated a terrorist organization.

“The documents allege a scheme to unlawfully access the U.S. financial system to support illicit shipments to Syria from Iran by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a designated foreign terrorist organization,” Ms. Liu said in a news release. “The scheme involves multiple parties affiliated with the IRGC and furthered by the deceptive voyages of the Grace 1. A network of front companies allegedly laundered millions of dollars in support of such shipments.”

The Justice Department released the warrant one day after a judge in Gibraltar allowed the release of the detained vessel.

British authorities boarded Grace 1 off the coast on Gibraltar last month alleging it was transporting millions of barrels of crude oil to the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad in violations of European Union sanctions.

On Thursday Gibraltar’s Chief Minister Fabian Picardo said he received assurances from Iran that Grace 1’s cargo was not destined for Syria.

“I welcome that assurance,” Mr. Picardo said in a statement, adding there were “no longer any reasonable grounds for the continued legal detention.”

Although Gibraltar lifted the tanker’s detention order, the legal battle became messy after a last-ditch U.S. effort to hold it.

Mr. Picardo said the U.S. request should be reviewed by Mutual Legal Assistance authorities who will make “an objective, legal determination of that request for separate proceedings.”

235,235,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/26/trailing-polls-romney-deploys-celebrity-friends/,Right,"WESTERVILLE, Ohio — Scrambling to regain his footing in the Buckeye State, Mitt Romney enlisted the help Wednesday of a golf legend and a television star with the sort of blue-collar credentials that could resonate with the state’s working-class voters. President Obama, meanwhile, made his own Ohio pitch to college crowds at Bowling Green and Kent State.

The dueling visits spoke volumes about the critical role that Ohio — a state where manufacturing jobs in the automobile industry and other sectors have been lost in recent years as companies have shifted operations overseas — is expected to play in the coming presidential election.

Voters here have been pummeled with political television advertisements.

Bloomberg News reported this week that between the two campaigns and their supporters, there have been 29,000 ads aired here in the month before Sept. 17 — more than any other state in that time.

The ad blitz comes during a crucial stretch of the race, with both campaigns urging Ohioans to take advantage of state law that allows them to start early voting next week.

The stakes could not be higher for Mr. Romney: No Republican has won the presidency without Ohio, and the latest round of polling does not bode well for his chances of capturing the state come Election Day.

Mr. Romney kicked off his celebrity twofer by linking up with golf legend Jack Nicklaus, an Ohio native, at a campaign rally outside Columbus, and then teamed up with Mike Rowe, host of the Discovery Channel’s “Dirty Jobs,” at a business “roundtable” meeting in the Cleveland suburbs.

Mr. Romney used the stops and another in Toledo to warn that Mr. Obama will continue to saddle future generations with trillions in debt and to hammer the president for failing to crack down on China’s unfair trade practices.

“We’re going to crack down on China when they cheat. They’ve stolen our jobs. That’s got to stop,” Mr. Romney said at the event with Mr. Nicklaus, who told the crowd of about 2,000 that the former Massachusetts governor was the right man for the job.

Mr. Rowe did not endorse Mr. Romney, saying instead his experience on “Dirty Jobs” has taught him thatthe nation is disconnected with the plumbers, public works employees and tradesman that make “civilized life possible for the rest of us.” The reality TV star said a greater emphasis should be placed on promoting those professions as good jobs.

“I mean, there’s got to be a better way to be happy and successful in your career than simply assuming a massive amount of debt and exiting an educational program that gives you a degree without training,” he said.

The flash of star power could be just what the doctor ordered for the Romney campaign, as the appearances coincided with a new CBS/New York Times/ Quinnipiac University poll that held ominous signs for the Republican nominee in Ohio, as well as in Florida and Pennsylvania.

The survey found Mr. Obama holds a 53 percent to 43 percent edge over Mr. Romney among likely Ohio voters. Those surveyed also gave Mr. Obama a 6-point advantage when it comes to the economy — a month after the two candidates were even on the issue.

The poll came on the heels of a Washington Post survey released Tuesday that gave Mr. Obama an 8-point lead here. It also showed that more likely voters in Ohio trust the Democrat more when it comes to handling the economy and think he has a better understanding of the problems people are facing on the economic front.

Part of the problem for the Romney camp is that the improving employment picture in Ohio muddies the Republican candidate’s argument that Mr. Obama’s policies are suffocating job creation. That attack has put Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, in the tricky position of explaining the state’s success without undercutting Mr. Romney’s message.

“I hope you all know that Ohio’s coming back,” Mr. Kasich said Wednesday. “From 48th in job creation to No. 4. No. 1 in the Midwest. From 89 cents in a rainy-day fund to a half a million dollars, and we have grown 123,000 jobs in the state of Ohio. Our families are going back to work.”

He added, “But every day I have to face the headwinds that come from Washington.”

The Romney camp is downplaying the recent surveys, suggesting their internal polling numbers tell a different story.

“After the debates and after the campaigns and after all the ads are over, the people of Ohio are going to say loud and clear on Nov. 6, ‘We can’t afford four more years; we must do better,’” Mr. Romney said.

Mr. Obama countered Mr. Romney’s criticisms at the rally at Bowling Green State University, telling the young crowd that the Republican’s tough talk on China rings hollow.

“It sounds better than talking about all the years he spent profiting from companies that sent our jobs to China,” Mr. Obama said. “So, you know, when you hear this newfound outrage, when you see these ads he’s running promising to get tough on China, it feels a lot like that fox saying, ‘You know, we need more secure chicken coops.’”

Mr. Obama was referring to Mr. Romney’s $75,000 investment in CNOOC Ltd., the Chinese state-owned oil company, which was revealed when former Massachusetts governor released his 2011 tax return last week. Mr. Romney’s blind trust purchased the shares, then dumped them, Mr. Obama charges, when the presidential candidate decided he was going to start talking tough on China.

In the past week, Mr. Obama has repeatedly attacked Mr. Romney for the CNOOC investment, even after a report in BuzzFeed said the White House had applauded the Chinese company’s efforts to foster the development of carbon capture and storage in both countries.

260,260,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/28/opposition-reacts-with-fury-to-parliament-suspensi/,Right,"LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked Queen Elizabeth II on Wednesday to suspend Parliament, a maneuver that outraged his critics because it will give the opposition even less time to block a no-deal Brexit before the scheduled Oct. 31 withdrawal.

Though Johnson previously had refused to rule out such a move, the timing of the decision took lawmakers — many of whom are on vacation — by surprise.

Lawmakers reacted with fury, including John Bercow, speaker of the lower House of Commons, who was not told in advance of Johnson’s plan.

“Shutting down Parliament would be an offense against the democratic process and the rights of parliamentarians as the people’s elected representatives,” Bercow said. “Surely at this early stage in his premiership, the prime minister should be seeking to establish rather than undermine his democratic credentials and indeed his commitment to Parliamentary democracy.”

The main opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn wrote to the queen to protest “in the strongest possible terms on behalf of my party and I believe all the other opposition parties are going to join in with this.”

The House of Commons will convene from Sept. 3-10 and then was scheduled to go on a break until Oct. 9 — though lawmakers had suggested they might cancel that break and stay at the House of Commons because of the national crisis. But Johnson said he has decided to ask the queen to give her speech that outlines the government’s legislative agenda on Oct. 14.

Since Parliament is normally suspended before her speech, the decision means opposition lawmakers would be unlikely to have enough time to pass laws blocking the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union without a negotiated deal on Oct. 31.

The pound plunged on the news, down to $1.2196 from almost $1.2300 the previous day.

The EU is adamant that it will not renegotiate the agreement struck with former Prime Minister Theresa May on the terms of Britain’s departure and the framework of future relations. Without such a deal, Britain faces a chaotic Brexit that economists warn would disrupt trade by imposing tariffs and customs checks between Britain and the bloc, send the value of the pound plummeting and plunge the U.K. into recession.

Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s chief Brexit official, called Johnson’s move “sinister.”

“As a fellow parliamentarian, my solidarity with those fighting for their voices to be heard,” he tweeted. “Suppressing debate on profound choices is unlikely to help deliver a stable future EU-UK relationship.”

On Tuesday, opposition lawmakers declared that they would work together to try to stop a departure from the EU without an agreement, setting up a legislative challenge to Johnson and his promise to complete the divorce by Oct. 31.

Some 160 lawmakers have signed a declaration pledging “to do whatever is necessary” to prevent Johnson from bypassing Parliament in his plans.

Johnson has told EU officials it won’t be possible to agree a deal on Britain’s departure from the bloc without the removal of controversial language on a “backstop,” aimed at avoiding the return of a border between EU member Ireland and Britain’s Northern Ireland. He said at the close of the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, Monday that he was “marginally more optimistic,” of progress.

Scott Lucas, a professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham, said Johnson’s maneuver touched off the biggest crisis since the abdication of King Edward VIII to marry the divorced American socialite, Wallis Simpson.

“This is biggest constitutional crisis since the 1930s,” Lucas said. “Even World War II didn’t present a constitutional crisis because the coalition government and Parliament agreed the rules of the game.”

Mr. Pence flew from an airport near Mr. Trump’s golf club in Doonbeg, on the west coast, to meet with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and other dignitaries 180 miles away in the east-coast capital.

The vice president and second lady are scheduled to fly back to Doonbeg later Tuesday, raising eyebrows from Democrats who are worried that President Trump is profiting from the presidency.

“You took an oath to the Constitution, not to @realDonaldTrump,” Rep. Ted Lieu, California Democrat, tweeted. “Funneling taxpayer money to @POTUS by staying at this Trump resort is sooooooo corrupt.”

Mr. Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, dismissed the criticism, saying the odd logistics were a byproduct of Mr. Trump dispatching Mr. Pence to Poland at the last minute because of Hurricane Dorian.

Mr. Pence initially planned to finish a European swing at Doonbeg to explore his family roots. His team had to rearrange the order of stops and find an overnight hotel for his entourage ahead of the Dublin meetings, according to Mr. Short.

Mr. Trump and family members stayed at their Doonbeg residence on official business recently, so the property had been fully vetted.

The president did not order Mr. Pence to stay at his property, according to Mr. Short.

“I don’t think it was a request, like a command,” he told reporters. “I think that it was a suggestion. … It’s like, ‘Well, you should stay at my place.’ “

Yet Mr. Trump didn’t waive the bill. Taxpayers are still paying the tab, though Mr. Pence is personally paying for his mother and sister, who came along.

Mr. Trump insists he is losing money as president, because he can’t explore blockbuster deals, though Democrats worry he hasn’t properly accounted for visits from foreign dignitaries to his hotels and clubs. Critics also find it unseemly that he spends so much time at his golf clubs while president.

House Democrats last week said they will investigate Mr. Trump’s pitch to hold next year’s Group of Seven summit at his Florida club, Trump National Doral Miami.

Mr. Pence, meanwhile, is scheduled to discuss Brexit negotiations with Irish leaders.

Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, on Monday said Ireland respects the U.K.’s decision to leave the European Union, but they fear “disruption” at the northern border. He said Ireland cannot return to a hard border full of inspections, calling it a “huge issue.”

Mr. Pence thanked Mr. Coveney for “his candor” and said the U.S. will work with the U.K. to ensure that any Brexit deal does not violate the Good Friday agreements between the British and Irish governments.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last month called the agreement the “bedrock of peace in Northern Ireland and as a beacon of hope for the entire world.”

“Whatever form it takes, Brexit cannot be allowed to imperil the Good Friday Agreement, including the seamless border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, especially now, as the first generation born into the hope of Good Friday 21 years ago comes into adulthood,” she said. “We cannot go back.”

289,289,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/30/obama-widens-lead-confidence-against-romney-voters/,Right,"DENVER — President Obama has opened a sizable lead over Mitt Romney in polling ahead of the election as both Democrats and Republicans are increasingly convinced that he is going to win re-election, according to The Washington Times/Zogby Poll released Sunday.

In the latest poll, Mr. Obama drew 49.7 percent support while the Republican nominee garnered 41.1 percent. The previous Times/Zogby polls showed the race a dead heat — including just before the national party conventions, when they were tied with 45.7 percent of the vote each. Even with third-party candidates added to the mix, the results barely changed.

Mr. Obama’s support is growing even as voters are split on whether they are better off than they were four years ago — the key question Mr. Romney poses on the campaign trail — and even as voters said they weren’t happy with the president’s handling of the attacks on U.S. diplomatic posts three weeks ago.

“If Obama were running against himself, ‘Would you vote for Obama, yes or no,?’ this would be a much closer race. To a great degree, it’s all about Mitt Romney right now, and the judgment today is he doesn’t appear to be a suitable alternative, including for people who don’t want to vote for Obama,” said John Zogby, the pollster who conducted the survey.

“Now, it’s not over — oh, absolutely, it’s not over. No prediction here. But [Mr. Romney] is on the ropes,” he said.

The poll of 800 likely voters, taken Thursday through Saturday, has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. Those who didn’t have a definitive choice for president were asked which way they leaned, and those were included in the head-to-head tally.

The survey, which was weighted for demographic purposes, tracks with other national surveys that show Mr. Obama gaining momentum as the election nears, and shows Mr. Romney’s window closing.

Indeed, 57 percent of voters now say they expect Mr. Obama to cruise to re-election, which is up 10 percentage points from just before the parties’ national conventions. The higher expectations hold true across the ideological spectrum, with Democrats, Republicans and independents becoming more convinced of Mr. Obama’s success.

Analysts said Mr. Obama got an initial bump out of his convention in early September, and then Mr. Romney stumbled for several weeks, particularly with the release of a video of him telling a closed-door group of donors this year that 47 percent of voters are dependent on government and see themselves as “victims.” He said he didn’t expect to win the support of those people.

Asked in the poll, 41 percent of voters agreed with Mr. Romney — about equal to the support he is getting overall.

Meanwhile, 40 percent of voters, including 68 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of independents, “strongly disagreed” with Mr. Romney’s remark.

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan said Mr. Romney had been “inarticulate” with the comment, but added that Republicans believe the president has fostered an atmosphere of dependence on the federal government.

“Here and there, we have not been able to frame that choice as clearly [as we have wanted],” he said. “I really believe that by the end of this day, people are going to understand what they’ve got and the choices that they have.”

The Times/Zogby poll had good news for Mr. Obama across the board. He led Mr. Romney in each of five areas: jobs and the economy, national security, immigration, energy and foreign affairs.

In fact, Mr. Obama has gained ground on every one of those areas since The Times/Zogby poll last asked about them in May, including an 8-percentage-point leap when voters are asked who would do better on jobs and the economy. In May, Mr. Romney led that category 52 percent to 46 percent, but Mr. Obama now leads 49 percent to 44 percent.

Mr. Romney also is hurting because of the number of voters who feel they don’t know him as well as Mr. Obama.

The poll asked voters to rank how well they felt they knew Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama on a scale of one to five, with five being “very well.” About 42 percent ranked Mr. Romney a four or five, while 71 percent ranked Mr. Obama a four or five.

Mr. Zogby said that is both a problem and a potential opportunity, particularly when the two men face off Wednesday in the first debate of the season.

“Essentially, Romney still has a net negative in terms of favorable-unfavorable; however, there’s still a considerable number of people who know him or don’t know him,” he said. “This race should be closer than it is, and perhaps it will be. But right now, Wednesday night couldn’t possibly be more important for a candidate than this Wednesday is for Romney.”

Voters were split on whether they are better off now than four years ago, with 46 percent saying they are and 49 percent saying they aren’t. The rest were unsure.

Female voters were most likely to say they were better off, while married women were least likely to say their lot has improved. Those making more than $100,000 and those making less than $35,000 a year were most likely to say they were better off.

Voters also seemed slightly less likely to want to vote for Mr. Obama after his handling of the attacks on U.S. diplomatic posts last month.

Four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, were killed in the attack in Benghazi, Libya, and administration officials have struggled to explain the attack, have provided differing accounts of its cause and their knowledge, and took more than two weeks to say publicly that the attack was linked to al Qaeda.

Asked about the Libya attack and other assaults on U.S. embassies throughout the Muslim world, 39 percent of voters said they were less likely to vote for Mr. Obama, versus 24 percent who said his handling of the situation made them more likely to back him.

Most of those responses came from Republicans already inclined to oppose Mr. Obama, or Democrats who back him. Among independents, there was a slight reticence based on his handling.

328,328,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/sep/4/carrie-lam-hong-kong-leader-withdraws-extradition-/,Right,"HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced Wednesday the government will formally withdraw an extradition bill that sparked months of demonstrations, bowing to one of the protesters’ demands in the hope of ending the increasingly violent unrest.

But lawmakers warned that the bill’s withdrawal was not enough to end the turmoil, which has increasingly focused on alleged police brutality against protesters and democratic reforms.

The bill would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China for trials. It has prompted massive protests since June that disrupted transport links and caused the airport to shut down earlier this month.

Lam said the government would not accept other demands including an independent inquiry into alleged police misconduct and the unconditional release of those detained. Instead, she named two new members to a police watchdog agency investigating the matter.

“The government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns,” she said in a recorded television message.

She said the persistent violence is damaging the rule of law and that moves to vandalize the national flag and emblem were a direct challenge to the “one country, two systems” policy and had put Hong Kong in a “highly vulnerable and dangerous situation.”

“Our foremost priority now is to end violence, to safeguard the rule of law and to restore order and safety in society,” she added, vowing to “strictly enforce the law against all violent and illegal acts.”

Lam said it was clear that public frustration has gone far beyond the bill and that her government will seek a dialogue with aggrieved groups to “address the discontent in society and to look for solutions.”

She said she will also invite community leaders, professionals and academics to examine deep-seated problems in the society and advise the government on solutions.

“Let’s replace conflicts with conversations, and let’s look for solutions,” she said.

Lam made the announcement after meeting with pro-government lawmakers and members of the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.

Lawmaker Michael Tien, who was at the meeting, said the move would not change public sentiment if it isn’t accompanied by other concessions.

“It is too little, too late. The focus now has completely shifted. Most people do not remember what the bill is about but are more concerned about the escalating violence and alleged police heavy-handedness against protesters,” he said.

He said Lam rejected his call during the meeting for an independent inquiry which would have the power to summon witnesses, on the ground that it would overlap with the police watchdog probe.

Pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said the protesters are adamant that all their demands, including calls for direct elections, are fulfilled. She mocked Lam’s bid to seek dialogue to address public grievances.

“She has been fast asleep these three months, this is just absurd,” Mo said. “The scars and wounds are still bleeding, and she thinks she can just use some garden hose to put out the hill fire. That is not acceptable.”

Pro-establishment lawmaker Starry Lee, however, urged protesters to accept the government’s olive branch so the city can move forward.

The Hong Kong stock market soared 4%, boosted by reports of the bill’s withdrawal.

Lam has come under withering criticism for pushing the extradition bill, which many in Hong Kong see as an example of the city’s eroding autonomy since the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.

She was elected as Hong Kong’s chief executive by a pro-Beijing committee of Hong Kong elites, and the mainland government has spoken in support of her government and the city’s police force throughout the protests.

Clashes between police and protesters have become increasingly violent, with demonstrators throwing gasoline bombs and rods at officers in protests last weekend. Authorities in turn have employed water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets and batons. More than 1,100 people have been detained.

The mostly young protesters say that a degree of violence is necessary to get the government’s attention after peaceful rallies were futile. In Beijing, the mainland office responsible for Hong Kong has warned that China will “not sit idly by” if the situation worsens.

The prolonged protests have hurt Hong Kong’s economy amid a slowdown in the Chinese economy and its trade war with the United States.

Hong Kong and foreign companies have also been under intense pressure to support China’s ruling Communist Party against the protesters.

The chairman of Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways resigned Wednesday, becoming the second top figure to leave the airline since the protests erupted.

Cathay said John Slosar was retiring from the airline, one of Hong Kong’s most prominent businesses. It comes less than one month after Cathay’s CEO, Rupert Hogg, resigned following pressure by Beijing over participation by some of the carrier’s employees in protests.

348,348,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/2/judge-blocks-pas-new-voter-id-requirement/,Right,"Dealing a blow to Republicans’ hopes of carrying Pennsylvania in the presidential election, a judge Tuesday blocked the state from enforcing its GOP-backed voter identification law in November.

Commonwealth Court Judge Robert Simpson, a Republican, cited concerns over “disenfranchisement,” saying there wasn’t enough time for state officials to make sure everyone who needs a photo ID would have one by Nov. 6.

Judge Simpson said in his ruling that poll workers could still ask voters to produce a photo ID on Nov. 6, but they will be allowed to vote without one. The court did not strike down the law altogether; the judge rejected efforts by opponents of the law to stop state officials from educating voters about the photo ID requirement.

Republican Gov. Tom Corbett’s administration argued in favor of the law, saying other states have enacted similar statutes that have been upheld on appeals.

The ruling could still be appealed, but the law — approved last spring — will not take effect until next year at the earliest.

The judge upheld the statute in August after hearing testimony. But the state Supreme Court last month told Judge Simpson to reconsider and to focus on whether the state had done enough to ensure “liberal access” to photo ID cards.

Judge Simpson said in his opinion Tuesday, “I expected more photo IDs to have been issued by this time. For this reason, I accept petitioners’ argument that in the remaining five weeks before the general election, the gap between the photo IDs issued and the estimated need will not be closed.”

He added: “I am not still convinced in my predictive judgment that there will be no voter disenfranchisement arising out of the Commonwealth’s implementation of a voter identification requirement for purposes of the upcoming election.”

The law is one of at least 11 across the country — largely backed by Republican legislators — requiring voters to show photo identification such as a driver’s license or passport. Republicans say the laws are necessary to prevent election fraud.

A recent Franklin & Marshall College poll found that nearly 3 in 5 registered Pennsylvania voters favor the photo identification requirement.

But Democrats argued it would prevent mostly poor and minority voters in the state from voting. Democrats were joined in their challenge to the law by the AARP and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, Maryland Democrat and ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said the Pennsylvania law should be struck down in its entirety.

“I am encouraged that citizens in Pennsylvania will have the opportunity to exercise their right to vote this November without the politically motivated restrictions that Republicans tried to impose,” Mr. Cummings said in a statement.

“Voting is a right that should be encouraged for all eligible Americans, not a privilege reserved for a select few. While today’s ruling is a tremendous victory for the fair democratic process, I believe the law should be invalidated in its entirety, and I am hopeful that the appellate court will do so.”

After Republican legislators approved the law last spring without any Democratic support, House Majority Leader Mike Turzai, Allegheny Republican, boasted the measure would enable Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney to carry Pennsylvania. Democratic candidates have won the state in the past five presidential elections.

At a campaign stop in Pennsylvania last week, Mr. Romney predicted he would win Pennsylvania. Despite Mr. Romney’s confidence, his campaign hasn’t been airing ads in the state.

In 2008, Barack Obama won the state by 10 percentage points over Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican. A Quinnipiac/New York Times/CBS News poll last week showed Mr. Obama ahead there by 12 points.

A survey by The Philadelphia Inquirer earlier this year estimated that nearly 10 percent of state residents, or 1.3 million people, lacked proper photo ID. The percentage was even higher in Philadelphia, where Democrats outnumber Republicans about 6-to-1.

Ten candidates will be on hand to have their say. Voters are not keen on the idea.

“Most voters — including a majority of Democratic primary voters — still believe there will be too many candidates on the stage,” reports a new Politico/Morning Consult poll released Wednesday.

It found that 54% of all voters say that the number of White House hopefuls “is more than enough.” The survey found that 53% of Democratic voters agree with that.

There is some tolerance here, though. A third of Democratic primary voters say the debate stage will have “just the right amount of candidates.”

The stage likely will be more crowded in the future.

“Voters already unhappy with the size of the debate stage on Thursday are set to be disappointed: Eleven candidates have already qualified for the next debate in October, with several more on the fringes,” noted a Politico analysis of the future event.

“This virtually ensures that there will be either a larger stage or a second night of debates, as the DNC has previously said it does not plan to feature more than 10 candidates on the same debate stage,” the analysis said.

375,375,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/sep/18/israels-2-main-political-parties-deadlocked-after-/,Right,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s two main political parties were deadlocked Wednesday after an unprecedented repeat election, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing an uphill battle to hold on to his job.

The election’s seeming political kingmaker, Avigdor Lieberman, said he’ll insist upon a secular unity government between Netanyahu’s Likud and Benny Gantz’s Blue and White parties, who based on partial results are currently tied at 32 seats each out of the 120 in parliament.

Without Lieberman’s endorsement, both parties appear to have fallen well short of securing a parliamentary majority with their prospective ideological allies.

With results still pouring in, Lieberman insisted the overall picture was unlikely to change. He also demanded a secular “liberal” government shorn of the religious and ultra-Orthodox allies the prime minister has long relied upon.

“The conclusion is clear, everything we said throughout the campaign is coming true,” he said outside his home in the West Bank settlement of Nokdim. “There is one and only option: a national unity government that is broad and liberal and we will not join any other option.”

That could spell serious trouble for the continuation of Netanyahu’s lengthy rule.

Gantz, a former military chief, has ruled out sitting with a Netanyahu-led Likud at a time when the prime minister is expected to be indicted on corruption charges in the coming weeks. It raised the specter of an alternate Likud candidate rising to challenge Netanyahu, though most of its senior officials have thus far pledged to stand solidly behind their leader.

Netanyahu, the longest-serving leader is Israeli history, had desperately sought an outright majority with his hard-line and ultra-Orthodox allies in hopes of passing legislation to give him immunity from his expected indictment.

Israel’s attorney general has recommended charging Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three scandals, pending a long-awaited hearing scheduled in the coming weeks. A formal indictment would increase the pressure on Netanyahu to step aside if he does not have immunity.

The partial results released Wednesday by the Central Election Commission were based on a tally of 56% of the potential electorate. Overall turnout was 69.4%.

According to the partial results, Likud with its natural allies of religious and ultra-nationalist parties mustered just 56 seats - or five short of the needed majority.

Gantz’s Blue and White and its center-left allies garnered 55 seats, placing Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu and its nine seats in the middle as the deciding factor.

The only precedent for a unity government in Israel came after the 1984 election and saw a rotating premiership between the heads of the two largest parties.

The joint list of Arab parties, who have never sat in an Israeli government, also finished strong, with results indicating they had earned 12 seats to become the third-largest party in parliament. Should a unity government be formed, its leader Ayman Odeh, would become the country’s next opposition leader, an official state position that would grant him an audience with visiting dignitaries, a state-funded bodyguard, monthly consultations with the prime minister and a platform to rebut his speeches in parliament.

Addressing his supporters early Wednesday, Netanyahu refused to concede defeat and vowed to form a new government that excludes Arab parties, continuing his campaign rhetoric of questioning the loyalty of the country’s Arab minority - a strategy that drew accusations of racism and incitement.

“There neither will be nor can there be a government that relies on anti-Zionist Arab parties. Parties that reject the very existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. Parties that vaunt and praise bloodthirsty terrorists who murder our soldiers, citizens and children,” he said.

In his first comments Wednesday morning outside his home, Gantz said he had already begun working toward forming a “unity government” but urged patience until the final results were announced, likely on Thursday.

Focus will then shift toward Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, who is tasked with selecting the candidate he believes has the best chance of forming a stable coalition. Rivlin is to consult with all parties in the coming days before making his decision. Lieberman’s recommendation will carry a lot of weight regarding who will be tapped as the prime minister designate.

The candidate would then have up to six weeks to form a coalition. If that fails, Rivlin could give another candidate for prime minister 28 days to form a coalition. And if that doesn’t work, new elections would be triggered yet again. Rivlin has said he will do everything possible to avoid such a scenario and Lieberman has ruled it out as well.

Lieberman’s primary stated goal is to push out what he sees as the excessive power of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and have wide a coalition that can effectively tackle Israel’s most pressing security and economic challenges. But Netanyahu accused his former ally of plotting to oust him from office out of personal spite.

Behind the two is decades of a roller-coaster relationship. Lieberman, once Netanyahu’s chief of staff, has held a series of senior Cabinet posts and was often a staunch partner. But he’s has also been a rival, critic and thorn in Netanyahu’s side.

The Moldovan-born Lieberman started as a top Netanyahu aide in the 1990s before embarking on a political career of his own as a nationalist hard-liner and champion of immigrants like the former Soviet Union like himself. But he resigned last year as defense minister because Netanyahu kept blocking his plans to strike hard against Gaza militants.

Lieberman passed up the chance to return to the post following April’s election, refused to join Netanyahu’s emerging coalition and forcing the do-over vote. Assuming he sticks to his guns this time as well, Netanyahu could be done as Israel’s prime minister.

Liberman is now “the linchpin,” wrote Nahum Barnea, a prominent columnist in the Yediot Ahronot daily.

“I don’t think that anyone is prepared to risk a third election, not even for Netanyahu,” Barnea added. “Maybe the time has come to say goodbye.”"
390,390,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/sep/22/donald-trump-joe-biden-discussed-ukraine-call/,Right,"President Trump confirmed Sunday that he spoke about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden in a midsummer call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but said he did nothing wrong, as Democrats warned these latest charges may have “crossed the Rubicon” and into impeachment territory.

Leaving the White House on Sunday, Mr. Trump insisted the conversation that has consumed Washington for several days was “largely congratulatory.”

But, he added, “it was largely corruption — all of the corruption taking place. It was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.”

Mr. Trump didn’t say whether he pressed Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden, the front-runner to become his Democratic rival in the 2020 election, or other members of the Biden family during the July 25 call.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Mr. Trump urged Mr. Zelensky “about eight times” to cooperate with his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani on investigating Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden over a possible nexus between the son’s business interests and the vice president’s push in 2016 to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor.

The conversation is believed to be at the heart of a whistleblower complaint that the Trump administration is keeping out of the hands of Congress, sparking yet another investigation into whether Mr. Trump used foreign actors for political gain.

SEE ALSO: Lindsey Graham calls for Biden-Ukraine Justice Department probe

Rep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Sunday that Congress needs to know whether Mr. Trump held up $250 million in aid to Ukraine as part of an attempt to extract dirt on Mr. Biden. The aid was released Sept. 12, but an unusual delay coincided with Mr. Trump’s interest in Mr. Biden’s activities.

If Mr. Trump demanded such a quid pro quo, then impeachment “may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,” said Mr. Schiff, who long has pushed impeachment investigations against Mr. Trump.

“This would be, I think, the most profound violation of the presidential oath,” Mr. Schiff told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We may very well have crossed the Rubicon here.”

The inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community, who received a complaint about Mr. Trump’s interactions with the Ukrainian leader, deemed it an “urgent concern,” yet acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire won’t turn over the complaint to lawmakers.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, urged Republicans on Sunday to join Democrats in calling for Mr. Maguire to “obey the law” and turn over the whistleblower’s complaint when he testifies before Congress at midweek.

The law requires Mr. Maguire to turn over the complaint, she said, so failure to do so would endanger national security and have a chilling effect on future whistleblowers.

“We must be sure that the president and his administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the president’s personal or political interest,” Mrs. Pelosi said in a “dear colleague” letter that she sent to both Democrats and Republicans.

Many Republicans have rallied to defend Mr. Trump, either by questioning the whistleblower’s motives or calling on the media to investigate Mr. Biden.

Yet Sen. Mitt Romney, Utah Republican, said he needs to learn more about Mr. Trump’s conduct.

“If the president asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme,” he tweeted. “Critical for the facts to come out.”

Another Senate Republican, Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, didn’t criticize Mr. Trump directly but did suggest it would be wrong for a president to seek a political leg up from a foreign nation.

“Look, it is not appropriate for any candidate for federal office, certainly, including a sitting president, to ask for assistance from a foreign country,” Mr. Toomey told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “That’s not appropriate. But I don’t know that that’s what happened here.”

The president, traveling in Texas, said he will consider ways to release details about his call with Mr. Zelensky.

He also said he would have “no problem” with Mr. Giuliani testifying to Congress about his recent meetings with Ukrainians. He called his attorney a “straight shooter.”

But Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said forcing the president to hand over a full transcript of the Zelensky call would set a poor precedent regarding presidential power and diplomatic confidentiality.

“These are confidential discussions between world leaders,” he said.

Mr. Trump questioned the whistleblower’s motives, saying presidents should speak freely with foreign leaders and “you can’t have people doing this.”

He tried to flip pressure back onto Mr. Biden, pointing to the former vice president’s claim that he never spoke about business with his son despite evidence to the contrary.

“This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did, and then he said he never spoke to his son. Does anybody believe that one?” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Trump also highlighted a statement from the Ukrainian foreign minister, who said his country did not feel pressured by the U.S. during the midsummer call.

“It was a beautiful, warm, nice conversation. It was put out last night also by Ukraine,” Mr. Trump said.

Democrats say they cannot rely on that statement because Ukraine is in an awkward diplomatic position and is beholden to the Trump administration for aid money for at least one year and possibly five.

Sen. Christopher Murphy, Connecticut Democrat, said Mr. Trump put Ukraine through a nervous ordeal by holding back expected aid this summer.

Mr. Zelensky was “really worried about these overtures he was getting, from particularly from Rudy Giuliani, and he didn’t understand whether this was an official government position, these requests to investigate the former vice president,” Mr. Murphy told NBC’s “Meet the Press,” recounting a visit to Kyiv.

Mr. Trump released the aid to Ukraine on Sept. 12 and even extended $140 million more.

The president downplayed the delay by saying he was worried that the U.S. was shouldering too much of the financial burden.

“I backed Ukraine from the beginning, but I’m very upset that other countries aren’t doing the same,” Mr. Trump said. “Germany should be spending much more, France, all of the European Union should be spending money. Why are we spending money and they’re not? Or at least they’re spending very little by comparison, so I’m not happy about that.”

The White House confirmed that Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet with Mr. Zelensky on Wednesday on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly in New York, a meeting that is sure to fan the flames of the saga.

A senior administration official said Mr. Trump will focus on “congratulating President Zelensky on his election victories and the incredible energy and success President Zelensky has put forward in implementing the reform and anti-corruption efforts.”

General Assembly was a dash on Sunday through two key political states with two world leaders at events that felt like his raucous campaign rallies.

In Wapakoneta, Ohio, Trump and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison visited a recycled paper factory being opened by Anthony Pratt, an Australian businessman who is investing billions of dollars in the United States to create thousands of manufacturing jobs. Ohioans crowded into a hot factory chanted “U.S.A. U.S.A” when Trump talked about products emblazoned with the words “Made in America.”

“This great state of Ohio is open for business,” Trump told the cheering crowd at a new Pratt Industries plant still under construction.

“If it wasn’t for your presidency, this mill would not be here today,” Pratt said, praising the Trump administration’s economic and tax policies.

Earlier, in Texas, Trump joined Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to highlight the growth of U.S. exports to India and billions of dollars spent by India on U.S. defense equipment. Neither mentioned trade tensions. Deafening drums marked the entrance of Trump and Modi as they clasped hands and walked across the stage in a packed Texas stadium, sending a message of unity between the world’s two largest democracies.

The president also discussed border security, an important campaign issue for Texas, which shares a border with Mexico.

“We are taking unprecedented action to secure our southern border and stop illegal immigration,” Trump said.

About 50,000 Indian Americans attended the “Howdy Modi!” rally in Houston, where the crowd chanted “Modi! Modi! Modi!” as he took the stage to introduce Trump as “my friend, a friend of India, a great American president.”

Modi even used Trump’s political slogan to say the president had a strong resolve to “make America great again.”

“When I met him for the first time, he said to me ‘India has a true friend in the White House,’” Modi said. “Mr. President, this morning in Houston, you can hear the heartbeat of this great partnership in this celebration of the world’s two largest democracies.”

The event had the feel of one of Trump’s campaign rallies, complete with a packed venue and a roaring crowd, and Trump treated it that way at times.

He ticked off his accomplishments in office, highlighted a drop in the unemployment rate among Indian Americans and extolled their contributions to the U.S. as he pitched for their vote in a traditionally Republican state that Democrats have visions of pulling into their column next year.

Trump said Modi invited him to the rally - one of the largest U.S. gatherings of the Indian diaspora in history - when they met last month in France, and Trump seemed to explain his decision to attend by saying “I love India.”

Earlier this year, Modi won the biggest reelection India has seen in years and his support for Trump could help the president at the polls next year. The two are to meet Tuesday on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly.

Trump is also scheduled to meet this week with Pakistani leader Imran Khan, who recently solicited the president’s help mediating the Pakistan-India conflict over Kashmir. India’s government has stripped the disputed Himalayan region of its semi-autonomy and launched a security crackdown last month.

Trump said U.S.-India bonds are expanding despite tensions over India’s trade surplus with the U.S. In June, the U.S. canceled special trade privileges that had allowed India to export certain goods with lower tariffs. India responded by slapping tariffs on more than two dozen U.S. goods.

The U.S. and India are discussing ways to negotiate at least a partial trade deal, which would let the president score a victory as he campaigns for reelection in November 2020. A partial deal could include Washington reinstating India’s special tariff status in exchange for concessions related to access to Indian markets, possibly in dairy and medical devices. Other issues are thwarting efforts to sign a larger trade deal.

In an address in Hindi to “my family,” Modi briefly mentioned the trade talks and expressed hope that an announcement can be made while he and Trump participate in the U.N. gathering.

Modi said that while Trump has called himself a “tough negotiator,” he has learned a few things from Trump about the art of making deals. After the speeches, Modi asked Trump to walk hand-in-hand around the perimeter of the stadium floor, looking up to the stands of cheering fans.

In Texas, Trump also was briefed on recent storm flooding in the southeastern part of the state when he stopped at a nearby U.S. Coast Guard station.

Hundreds of homes and other buildings across a region extending eastward from Houston and across the Louisiana border were damaged by Imelda, as the one-time tropical storm slowly churned across the Gulf region, dumping more than 40 inches (102 centimeters) of rain in some areas.

Authorities blame the storm for at least five deaths.

Trump will spend most of the week in New York participating in the U.N. General Assembly .

408,408,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/2/presidential-debate-ritual-is-a-great-equalizer-fo/,Right,"Call it the built-in gravitas gap: President Obama flies the country in a grand 747, cruises in plush limousines adorned with American flags, and speaks from the White House Rose Garden, while his campaign opponent, Mitt Romney, flies in a smaller MD-83 passenger jet, rides in nondescript SUVs and makes speeches at factories and strip malls.

But on Wednesday that gap is closed, even if just for 90 minutes, when voters see the two men stand on the same stage together and go head-to-head in the first presidential debate of the campaign.

“Debates are an equalizer for challengers because there are no office trappings on stage,” said Darrell M. West, director of Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution. “It is two people answering questions, and voters can reach their own impressions without outside filtering.”

That can’t come soon enough for the Republican presidential nominee, who after running neck-and-neck with Mr. Obama in the polls has now fallen behind.

Mr. Obama also has a lead in nearly every battleground state, according to Real Clear Politics’ averages of polls, including those taken in Colorado, which plays host to Wednesday’s debate at the University of Denver.

Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said that he has “never known a challenger that didn’t long for debates.”

“It is the only chance to go toe to toe with the incumbent and look just as presidential as he can,” Mr. Sabato said.

That helped Sen. John F. Kerry close a gravitas gap in 2004 with incumbent President George W. Bush, who was running as a wartime leader with troops in both Afghanistan and Iraq.

Mr. Kerry’s camp said after the first debate that being on stage with the president helped elevate the Democratic candidate because Mr. Kerry was able to handle the same questions and engage in a back-and-forth with the president.

With that experience, Mr. Kerry has been helping Mr. Obama prepare for the debates, playing the role of Mr. Romney in practice.

Mr. Romney has tapped Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a former trade ambassador and White House budget chief under Mr. Bush, to play the role of Mr. Obama.

Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have hunkered down over the past couple of days to prepare — Mr. Obama in Henderson, Nev., and Mr. Romney already in Denver — but each candidate has managed to squeeze in time away from their practice sessions.

Mr. Obama, whose camp has said he hasn’t had as much time to prepare as he would have liked, took a tour of the Hoover Dam and marveled at his guide’s revelation that most of the electricity produced goes to power Southern California.

For his part Mr. Romney snagged a burrito bowl with Mr. Portman at a Chipotle Mexican Grill in the outskirts of Denver, where the company is headquartered.

On Wednesday, both candidates will do private walkthroughs of the debate site beforehand, then likely lay low until the evening affair — 90 minutes in front of the same audience, facing the same television cameras and fielding questions from the same moderator — in this case PBS newsman Jim Lehrer.

“Debates are the only opportunity voters have to see these candidate mano y mano,” said Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based Democratic strategist. “You don’t ever see them together other than in the debates. It is one of the only chances for voters to see how their candidate stacks up against the incumbent. In that respect, Mitt Romney has an invaluable opportunity.”

Mr. Romney could use the equalizer, because the campaign trail is anything but equal.

All the pomp of the presidency follows Mr. Obama’s trips aboard Air Force One, while Mr. Romney’s plane — dubbed “Air Romney” by some reporters — has broken down on the tarmac at a Virginia airport.

“The MD-83 is an old, old technology, while Air Force One has all the bells and whistles in it the way that any up-to-date airplane would,” said Capt. Richard “Rick” Dake, a consultant for Aero Consulting Experts, who has flown planes for 40 years. “Air Force One would be like the Park Avenue of airplanes and Romney is on the Motel 6.”

Or take the trappings of major events.

Last month, after the assault on the U.S. compound in Libya that left four Americans dead, Mr. Obama strode out to the Rose Garden to stand with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton at his side and deliver a statement.

Mr. Romney, meanwhile, tossed together a last-minute press conference at his Jacksonville, Fla., campaign headquarters, which is located in strip mall next to a shop — called Blazin’ Reptiles — that bills itself as the city’s “cleanest and finest exotic pet store.”

Mr. Sabato said that day underscores the built-in advantages an incumbent has.

“It is amazing that even when the economy is weak, incumbency can carry a president along. We are seeing it this fall,” he said. “If a president can remain likable, some voters will forgive him a lot.”

The jury, though, is still out on whether the debates will significantly move the needle for either of the candidates.

Some say the debates are less important than in the past because voters are so familiar with the candidates, thanks to the 24-hour news cycle and length of the presidential campaign, which for Mr. Romney started 18 months ago when he announced at a farm in New Hampshire that he would make a second run for the presidency.

“Debates are less important this year than in the past for two reasons,” said H.W. Brands, a historian. “They are old hat and therefore will attract fewer viewers than in the past, [and] both candidates are well known: Obama by virtue of being president, Romney from the two dozen Republican debates.

“Unless one or the other commits a great gaffe, these debates are unlikely to change many minds,” Mr. Brands said.

436,436,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/2/house-democrats-subpoena-white-house-ukraine-probe/,Right,"House Democrats are threatening to subpoena the White House in their fight for more documents related to President Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The chairs of the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees sent a memo to the White House demanding the key documents they need.

“Over the past several weeks, the committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with — or even respond to — the committees,” they wrote.

Last week, the administration released both a transcript of the phone call, the whistleblower complaint and the inspector general’s report on the matter.

The administration has until Friday to comply with the requests before the committee chairs send out the subpoena.

The summer phone call, during which House Democrats say Mr. Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Democratic presidential front-runner Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter, has united Democrats on Capitol Hill and is now at the center of an impeachment inquiry launched by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week.

The flurry of subpoenas shows how quickly the Democrats have escalated their impeachment inquiry. So far, the three committees have subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, scheduling depositions for State Department staffers, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney.

Wednesday’s action marks the first time Democrats have threatened to subpoena the White House.

Democrats’ subpoena comes on the same day Steve Linick, the State Department’s inspector general, is scheduled to brief lawmakers about “urgent” material he says is relevant to the Ukraine investigation.

Details on what Mr. Linick intends to reveal remain scant.

Mrs. Clinton, who served as secretary of state in the Obama administration before losing to Mr. Trump in the 2016 presidential election, weighed in on the controversy during an appearance with her daughter Chelsea on the “Late Show” with Stephen Colbert. The comedian asked her, “How many times when you were secretary of state did you have to say to Obama, ‘You can’t extort foreign countries to get dirt on your political enemies?’ “

Mrs. Clinton laughed and said, “Yeah, that never happened.”

“I think if the secretary of state was on the call, as it is now being reported, he should have been one of the very first people to, you know, just say, ‘Wait a minute, we have got to clean this up, you can’t let that stand,” she said. “But we don’t know what he did.”

The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Mr. Pompeo listened in on the Trump-Ukraine call that has led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch a formal impeachment inquiry.

Mrs. Clinton said she supported Mrs. Pelosi’s decision and said Mr. Trump’s behavior falls into the definition of impeachable offenses.

Mr. Colbert also got a laugh from Mrs. Clinton when he asked whether it was time to “Lock him up?” — alluding to the “Lock her up!” chants that became a hallmark of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign rallies.

448,448,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/3/fact-check-presidential-debate-missteps/,Right,"(EDITOR’S NOTE — An occasional look at political claims that take shortcuts with the facts or don’t tell the full story.)

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney spun one-sided stories in their first presidential debate, not necessarily bogus, but not the whole truth.

They made some flat-out flubs, too. The rise in health insurance premiums has not been the slowest in 50 years, as Obama stated. Far from it. And there are not 23 million unemployed, as Romney asserted.

Here’s a look at some of their claims and how they stack up with the facts:

OBAMA: “I’ve proposed a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. … The way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 in additional revenue.”

THE FACTS: In promising $4 trillion, Obama is already banking more than $2 trillion from legislation enacted along with Republicans last year that cut agency operating budgets and capped them for 10 years. He also claims more than $800 billion in war savings that would occur anyway. And he uses creative bookkeeping to hide spending on Medicare reimbursements to doctors. Take those “cuts” away and Obama’s $2.50/$1 ratio of spending cuts to tax increases shifts significantly more in the direction of tax increases.

Obama’s February budget offered proposals that would cut deficits over the coming decade by $2 trillion instead of $4 trillion. Of that deficit reduction, tax increases accounted for $1.6 trillion. He promises relatively small spending cuts of $597 billion from big federal benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid. He also proposed higher spending on infrastructure projects.

___

ROMNEY: Obama’s health care plan “puts in place an unelected board that’s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I don’t like that idea.”

THE FACTS: Romney is referring to the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a panel of experts that would have the power to force Medicare cuts if costs rise beyond certain levels and Congress fails to act. But Obama’s health care law explicitly prohibits the board from rationing care, shifting costs to retirees, restricting benefits or raising the Medicare eligibility age. So the board doesn’t have the power to dictate to doctors what treatments they can prescribe.

Romney seems to be resurrecting the assertion that Obama’s law would lead to rationing, made famous by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s widely debunked allegation that it would create “death panels.”

The board has yet to be named, and its members would ultimately have to be confirmed by the Senate. Health care inflation has been modest in the last few years, so cuts would be unlikely for most of the rest of this decade.

___

OBAMA: “Over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up — it’s true — but they’ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we’re already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you’re already getting a rebate.”

THE FACTS: Not so, concerning premiums. Obama is mixing overall health care spending, which has been growing at historically low levels, and health insurance premiums, which have continued to rise faster than wages and overall economic growth. Premiums for job-based family coverage have risen by nearly $2,400 since 2009 when Obama took office, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. In 2011, premiums jumped by 9 percent. This year’s 4 percent increase was more manageable, but the price tag for family coverage stands at $15,745, with employees paying more than $4,300 of that.

When it comes to insurance rebates under Obama’s health care law, less than 10 percent of people with private health insurance are benefiting.

More than 160 million Americans under 65 have private insurance through their jobs and by buying their own policies. According to the administration, about 13 million people will benefit from rebates. And nearly two-thirds of that number will only be entitled to a share of it, since they are covered under job-based plans where their employer pays most of the premium and will get most of the rebate.

___

ROMNEY on the failure of Obama’s economic policy: “And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we’ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can’t find work.”

THE FACTS: The number of unemployed is 12.5 million, not 23 million. Romney was also counting 8 million people who are working part time but would like a full-time job and 2.6 million who have stopped looking for work, either because they are discouraged or because they are going back to school or for other reasons.

He got the figure closer to right earlier in the debate, leaving out only the part-timers when he said the U.S. has “23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work.” But he was wrong in asserting that Obama came into office “facing 23 million people out of work.” At the start of Obama’s presidency, 12 million were out of work.

His claim that half of college graduates can’t find work now also was problematic. A Northeastern University analysis for The Associated Press found that a quarter of graduates were probably unemployed and another quarter were underemployed, which means working in jobs that didn’t make full use of their skills or experience.

___

OBAMA: It’s important “that we take some of the money that we’re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America.”

THE FACTS: This oft-repeated claim is based on a fiscal fiction. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were paid for mostly with borrowed money, so stopping them doesn’t create a new pool of available cash that can be used for something else, like rebuilding America. It just slows down the government’s borrowing.

___

ROMNEY: “At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up.”

THE FACTS: He’s right that the average price has doubled, and a little more, since Obama was sworn in. But presidents have almost no influence on gasoline prices, and certainly not in the near term. Gasoline prices are set on financial exchanges around the world and are based on a host of factors, most importantly the price of crude oil used to make gasoline, the amount of finished gasoline ready to be shipped and the capacity of refiners to make enough to meet market demand.

Retail electricity prices have risen since Obama took office — barely. They’ve grown by an average of less than 1 percent per year, less than the rate of inflation and slower than the historical growth in electricity prices. The unexpectedly modest rise in electricity prices is because of the plummeting cost of natural gas, which is used to generate electricity.

___

OBAMA: “Gov. Romney’s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut — on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts, that’s another trillion dollars — and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn’t asked for. That’s $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.”

THE FACTS: Obama’s claim that Romney wants to cut taxes by $5 trillion doesn’t add up. Presumably, Obama was talking about the effect of Romney’s tax plan over 10 years, which is common in Washington. But Obama’s math doesn’t take into account Romney’s entire plan.

Romney proposes to reduce income tax rates by 20 percent and eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. The Tax Policy Center, a Washington research group, says that would reduce federal tax revenues by $465 billion in 2015, which would add up to about $5 trillion over 10 years.

However, Romney says he wants to pay for the tax cuts by reducing or eliminating tax credits, deductions and exemptions. The goal is a simpler tax code that raises the same amount of money as the current system but does it in a more efficient manner.

The knock on Romney’s plan, which Obama accurately cited, is that Romney has refused to say which tax breaks he would eliminate to pay for the lower rates.

___

ROMNEY: “What would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they pass it: Is the program so critical it’s worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?”

THE FACTS: China continues to be portrayed by Romney and many other Republicans as the poster child for runaway federal deficits. It’s true that China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt, but it only represents about an 8 percent stake. And China has recently been decreasing its holdings, according to the Treasury Department. Some two-thirds of the $16 trillion national debt is owed to the federal government, with the largest single stake the Federal Reserve, as well as American investors and the Social Security Trust Fund.

___

OBAMA: “Independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Gov. Romney’s pledge of not … adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families. The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.”

THE FACTS: That’s just one scenario. Obama’s claim relies on a study by the Tax Policy Center, a Washington research group. The study, however, is more nuanced than Obama indicated.

The study concludes it would be impossible for Romney to meet all of his stated goals without shifting some of the tax burden from people who make more than $200,000 to people who make less.

In one scenario, the study says, Romney’s proposal could result in a $2,000 tax increase for families who make less than $200,000 and have children.

Romney says his plan wouldn’t raise taxes on anyone, and his campaign points to several studies by conservative think tanks that dispute the Tax Policy Center’s findings. Most of the conservative studies argue that Romney’s tax plan would stimulate economic growth, generating additional tax revenue without shifting any of the tax burden to the middle class. Congress, however, doesn’t use those kinds of projections when it estimates the effect of tax legislation.

___

ROMNEY on cutting the deficit: “Obamacare’s on my list. … I’m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. … I’ll make government more efficient.”

THE FACTS: Romney has promised to balance the budget in eight years to 10 years, but he hasn’t offered a complete plan. Instead, he’s promised a set of principles, some of which — like increasing Pentagon spending and restoring more than $700 billion in cuts that Democrats made in Medicare over the coming decade — work against his goal. He also has said he will not consider tax increases.

He pledges to shrink the government to 20 percent of the size of the economy, as opposed to more than 23 percent of gross domestic product now, by the end of his first term. The Romney campaign estimates that would require cuts of $500 billion from the 2016 budget alone. He also has pledged to cut tax rates by 20 percent, paying for them by eliminating tax breaks for the wealthiest and through economic growth.

To fulfill his promise, then, Romney would require cuts to other programs so deep — under one calculation requiring cutting many areas of the domestic budget by one-third within four years — that they could never get through Congress. Cuts to domestic agencies would have to be particularly deep.

But he’s offered only a few modest examples of government programs he’d be willing to squeeze, like subsidies to PBS and Amtrak. He does want to repeal Obama’s big health care law, but that law is actually forecast to reduce the deficit.

___

ROMNEY: “Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.”

OBAMA: “That’s what we’ve done, made some adjustments to it, and we’re putting it before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan.”

THE FACTS: At first, the president did largely ignore the recommendations made by his deficit commission headed by Democrat Erskine Bowles and Republican Alan Simpson. He later incorporated some of the proposals, largely the less controversial ones. He did not endorse some of the politically troublesome recommendations, such as trimming popular tax deductions like the one for home mortgage interest.

460,460,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/3/donald-trump-sign-order-enhancing-medicare-heads-f/,Right,"President Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at improving the Medicare program for seniors, hoping to redirect the 2020 campaign conversation from his failure to overhaul President Obama’s program to his step-by-step efforts to stamp out health crises and stiff-arm Democrats pushing government-run care.

Speaking in The Villages, Florida, a massive retirement community, the president renewed his 2016 pledge not to touch Medicare while in office.

“As long as I am president, no one will lay a hand on your Medicare benefits,” he told a crowd of people who rely on the federal insurance program for Americans 65 and older.

Officials said Mr. Trump’s order will increase seniors’ choices, help them access their health data and expand “telehealth” services that allow patients and doctors to interact from afar.

It promotes Medicare Advantage plans, which are run by private companies that contract with the government, by offering to let enrollees share in savings from better health outcomes. And it ensures that consumers aren’t steered into the traditional “fee-for-service” program over Medicare Advantage.

Democrats slammed the campaign-style push, noting Mr. Trump’s own budget proposals would curtail spending on Medicare.

Mr. Trump mainly used his speech to contrast his broader approach with Democratic plans to expand coverage through ideas such as government-run “Medicare for All,” which his administration views as a “socialist” push to upend health plans that millions of people know and enjoy.

“These people on the other side, these people are crazy, by the way. They want to take it away, give you lousy healthcare,” Mr. Trump said in freewheeling remarks that touched on Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, the 2020 Democratic primary and “open borders.”

Mr. Trump tried to find common ground with the senior crowd, saying retirement looks pretty good.

“I should be in this audience, clapping,” he said. “But I didn’t trust anybody to be standing here [at the podium], because I know what you have.”

Mr. Trump swept into office pledging to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a health plan that offered “insurance for everybody,” though his GOP allies were unable to send a bill to his desk in 2017.

The president settled for incremental changes. He expanded access to cheaper, bare-bones coverage and pushing Congress to zero out the “individual mandate” penalty for shirking insurance as part of congressional Republicans’ broad tax overhaul.

Mr. Trump says he would like to take another run at replacing the 2010 Affordable Care Act, though he is punting major decisions and votes until after the 2020 election.

“If the Republicans take back the House, keep the Senate, keep the presidency, we’re going to have a fantastic plan,” he said.

The administration has shifted its rhetoric away from Obamacare in recent months, favoring Mr. Trump’s push to tackle “surprise” medical billing, speed the approval of generic drugs and explore ways to safely import cheaper drugs from Canada.

Mr. Trump said he’s being so bold that health care lobbyists might be behind the Democrats’ impeachment bid.

“I would be very surprised if the hoax didn’t come a little bit from the people that we’re taking on,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if it was from some of these industries that we take on, like pharma.”

Democrats are working with Mr. Trump on some of his health care efforts but say bigger action is needed.

Liberals pushing a single-payer system say their model will enhance the Medicare program for seniors while extending government-sponsored care to Americans of all ages, as millions continue to go uninsured or struggle with medical debt.

“Every single Medicare for All and public option proposal put forward by members of Congress would provide more Americans more health care — increasing the number of people with coverage, lowering out-of-pocket costs, and expanding benefits,” said Maura Calsyn, managing director of health policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.

But Trump officials argue government-run programs would restrict choice, rob millions of people of private insurance and weaken a program that’s working for seniors.

Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, dubbed Mr. Trump “the great protector” of Medicare. She said proposals such as Medicare for All or a public option to compete with private plans are immoral and would “demote American seniors to little better than second-class status.”

Sensing the risky politics of single-payer, candidates such as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden are running on plans to patch up Obamacare and enhance it.

Mr. Trump is seizing on any vulnerability he can, however, pointing to some Democrats’ push to subsidize health coverage for immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally.

“They put them way ahead of American citizens like you, who obey our laws,” Mr. Trump told the Floridians.

474,474,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/7/trump-ordered-turn-tax-returns-over-ny-grand-jury/,Right,"A federal judge decided Monday that President Trump must turn over his tax returns to a New York grand jury — though the ruling was halted to give the president a chance to have his appeal heard.

Judge Victor Marrero said Mr. Trump’s attempt to shield himself from complying with the grand jury investigation was “extraordinary,” and would set a dangerous precedent if allowed to stand.

“The interest the president asserts in maintaining confidentiality of certain personal financial and tax records that largely relate to a time before he assumed office, and that may involve unlawful conduct by third persons and possibly the president, is far outweighed by the interests of state law enforcement officers and the federal courts in ensuring the full, fair and effective administration of justice,” ruled Judge Marrero, a Clinton appointee to the court.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers immediately filed an appeal with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and the judges there issued an administrative stay on Judge Marrero’s ruling, giving the president a reprieve — for now.

But the ruling is a major hurdle for the president, who has determinedly refused to release his taxes, defying decades of custom for presidents and major party candidates.

Judge Marrero said what Mr. Trump is asking for is a total immunity that would protect not only a president but also associates from criminal investigation while in office.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers say Judge Marrero rejected decades of Justice Department policy in nixing claims of presidential immunity, and they urged the 2nd Circuit to step in.

“This case presents momentous questions of first impression regarding the presidency, federalism and the separation of powers,” wrote Patrick Strawbridge, the president’s attorney, in asking the appeals court for a careful consideration.

Democrats both inside and outside Washington believe there is embarrassing information in the returns that Mr. Trump doesn’t want voters to know — including potential evidence of crimes — and they’ve gone to great lengths to try to pry the returns loose.

House Democrats have issued a subpoena to the IRS and the Treasury Department for the returns. The administration has refused, saying Democrats don’t have a “legitimate” interest in seeing the information.

California, meanwhile, enacted a new law this year requiring presidential candidates to reveal their taxes in order to appear on ballots. A judge struck that law down last week.

In New York, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. says he’s looking into whether the president broke the law by paying hush money to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal during the presidential campaign.

He’s seeking eight years of personal and corporate tax returns from Mr. Trump and his associated businesses, and issued a grand jury subpoena to Mazars USA, the president’s accounting firm, for the documents.

The women said they had affairs with Mr. Trump years before he was a presidential candidate.

He has denied the affairs, and at first expressed ignorance over the payments. But he has since admitted to them — though he has denied the claims by his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen that the payments constitute a campaign contribution.

After Mr. Trump’s appeal Monday, Mr. Vance asked the 2nd Circuit to speed the case, saying he wanted briefings and oral argument this week.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers and the Justice Department asked for a slower pace stretching at least through next week.

The court, in an evening scheduling order, agreed with Mr. Trump’s request, with briefs due over the next two weeks and oral argument to be heard after that.

488,488,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/13/trump-massacre-church-fake-news-parody-video-shown/,Right,"WASHINGTON — A graphically violent parody video, shown at a meeting of President Trump’s supporters at his Miami resort, depicted a likeness of the president shooting and stabbing his opponents and members of the news media in a church, The New York Times reported Sunday.

In the video, Trump’s critics and media members are portrayed as parishioners fleeing his gruesome rampage. The fake Trump strikes the late Sen. John McCain in the neck, hits and stabs TV personality Rosie O’Donnell in the face, lights Sen. Bernie Sanders’ head on fire and shoots or otherwise assaults people whose faces are replaced with news organization logos.

The video was shown last week at an American Priority conference at Trump’s Doral Miami resort, the newspaper said. Trump was not there. Event organizer Alex Phillips told The Times the video was played as part of a “meme exhibit” and was not associated with or endorsed by the conference “in any official capacity.” “American Priority rejects all political violence,” he said, and is looking into the matter.

The video includes the logo for Trump’s 2020 campaign but Tim Murtaugh, spokesman for the reelection organization, told The Times the “video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence.”

The setting for the massacre is the “Church of Fake News,” capturing Trump’s familiar refrain about news stories and organizations that he considers to be fake news.

In the video, Trump’s face is superimposed on a killer’s body as he shoots people in the face and otherwise assaults them. Among the targets: former President Barack Obama, Black Lives Matter, Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Rep. Adam B. Schiff, who as Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is leading the impeachment inquiry of Trump.

CNN, The Washington Post, BBC, PBS, NBC and Politico are among the news organizations depicted as victims of the fake Trump’s violent fury.

499,499,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/15/elizabeth-warren-takes-heat-democratic-debate/,Right,"WESTERVILLE, Ohio — Sen. Elizabeth Warren got a first taste of what it is like to be the front-runner on the debate stage Tuesday when her rivals ganged up on her and questioned whether her tax-the-rich rhetoric was too “punitive” for an already polarized nation.

The more moderate 2020 Democratic hopefuls took aim at Ms. Warren’s far-left agenda and plans for a wealth tax to finance a host of new benefits from tuition-free college to universal childcare.

“We need to be focused on lifting people up and sometimes I think that Sen. Warren is more focused on being punitive or putting some part of the country against the other,” said former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas.

Ms. Warren was baffled by his charge. “I am shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I am punitive,” she said.

The aggressive challenges to the Massachusetts senator, coupled with deferential treatment of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, underscored Ms. Warren’s new status as the leader in the race.

In going after Ms. Warren, the Democrats clashed on familiar ground during the party’s fourth primary debate, including how far to go toward a government-run “Medicare for All” health care system.

Mr. Biden batted away questions about his son Hunter’s sweetheart foreign business deals by saying in the Democratic debate Tuesday that President Trump’s corruption was the real issue.

The other top Democratic presidential hopefuls cooperated, giving Mr. Biden a wide berth to avoid the questions of nepotism and corruption involving Hunter Biden. Instead, they piled on in demonizing Mr. Trump and trying to one-up one another on how strongly they vouched for the constitutional necessity not just to impeach him but also remove him from office.

“This is about Trump’s corruption. That is what we should be focused on,” Mr. Biden said. “What I think is so important is that we speak of how important it is to remove this man from office.”

Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey, who is struggling in the polls, came to Mr. Biden’s defense. He said the only person enjoying watching Mr. Biden answer for his son’s lucrative overseas paydays was Mr. Trump.

“He should not have to defend himself,” said Mr. Booker, appearing as if he was auditioning for a spot on a Biden ticket.

Hunter Biden’s lucrative business deals in Ukraine and China while his father was vice president now dog the elder Mr. Biden’s campaign. His $600,000-a-year job on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company is also at the center of the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump is accused of abusing his office when he asked the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens.

While going after Ms. Warren in the party’s fourth primary debate, the Democratic contenders often clashed on familiar ground, such as how far to go toward a government-run Medicare for All health care system.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg took Ms. Warren to task over her reluctance to say whether she will raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her Medicare for All vision.

“I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,” Ms. Warren said when asked directly whether her plan would lead to middle-class tax increases.

Mr. Buttigieg frequently took on a more forceful tone, contrasting with past low-key debate performances. He is considered in the best position to the race to emerge as the more moderate alternative to Ms. Warren should Mr. Biden’s campaign collapse.

Turning to Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg said voters are fed up with elected leaders that are unwilling to answer “yes-or-no” questions, pressing her to say whether she’d raise taxes as Sen. Bernard Sanders admits will be necessary for Medicare for All.

“This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular,” Mr. Buttigieg said to Ms. Warren. “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this.”

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang slammed her proposed wealth tax. He warned that the idea failed when tried in other countries.

“The problem is that it has been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden and all those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they projected,” he said. “If we can’t learn from the failed experience of other countries, what can we learn from?”

The candidates found agreement on the impeachment question.

Ms. Warren said House Democrats’ impeachment push wasn’t a distraction from the party’s agenda.

“Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that is the case with this impeachment inquiry,” she said.

Mr. Sanders agreed and called Mr. Trump the “most corrupt president” in the nation’s history.

“This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous,” Mr. Sanders said.

While popular among Democrats, the impeachment question is not a slam dunk among all Americans.

A Quinnipiac Poll this week showed that 46% of Americans approve of impeachment and removal of Mr. Trump, compared to 48% who say he should not be impeached and removed from office.

Shortly before the candidates joined in an impeachment frenzy on the debate stage, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the decision to launch an impeachment inquiry would not be put to a vote. The announcement fueled Republican criticism that the inquiry was an unfair partisan exercise.

Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren stood shoulder to shoulder at center stage on the campus of Otterbein University, flanked by 10 of their rivals in the largest primary debate in history.

The showdown was the first to play out since the House launched an official impeachment inquiry, Mr. Sanders of Vermont suffered a heart attack and Ms. Warren emerged as Mr. Biden’s top rival.

Ms. Warren has been on the rise in polls, sprinting past Mr. Biden in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that host the opening contests in February.

Mr. Biden has struggled to match the appeal Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have with far-left activists, and he has trailed them and Mr. Buttigieg in the latest fundraising reports, fueling more doubt about his staying power and cutting into the initial belief that he is the most electable candidate.

Mr. Biden, meanwhile, has become Mr. Trump’s top target after the bombshell whistleblower complaint accusing the president of using U.S. military assistance to pressure Ukraine’s president to investigate the business dealings of Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Trump has spun the accusation into an attack against Mr. Biden, saying the Democrat and his family are the corrupt ones and running with that message in attack ads.

Hunter Biden has tried to stop the bleeding by announcing he is leaving the board of a Chinese private equity company and forgoing all foreign work if his father becomes president. The former vice president says Mr. Trump is afraid of facing him in the general election.

The showdown in the Columbus suburbs was viewed as a make-or-break opportunity for some of the lower-tier candidates. The Democratic National Committee heightened the fundraising and polling thresholds to qualify for the fifth debate in Georgia next month.

As of Tuesday, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mr. O’Rourke were in jeopardy of missing the cut.

The DNC is requiring candidates to get at least 5% in at least two approved polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina or 3% in at least four national or early-state polls.

The decision to hold Tuesday’s debate in the Columbus suburbs fueled speculation over the role Ohio will play in the 2020 election.

Barack Obama carried Ohio in 2008 and 2012, and Mr. Trump carried the state by 8 percentage points in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

The Trump campaign, meanwhile, launched a pre-emptive strike against the candidates by flying a 35-by-105-foot banner over the city that read in all capital letters: “Socialism destroys Ohio jobs. Vote Trump.”

“While Democrats will use the debate stage to paint a glamorous view of their socialist agenda, Team Trump is here to expose the truth behind their job-killing policies and remind Ohioans what’s at stake in 2020,” said Tim Murtaugh, Trump campaign spokesman.

541,541,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/22/trump-compares-impeachment-drive-lynching/,Right,"President Trump called the House Democrats’ push for impeachment a “lynching” Tuesday as he pushed Republicans to rally around him amid the inquiry.

Mr. Trump used the incendiary language as he tested a new line of attack, reasoning that Democrats should be careful what they wish for because he feels they are watering down the standard for impeachment.

“So some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights,” he wrote. “All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here — a lynching. But we will WIN!”

Washington observers winced at Mr. Trump’s use of the word, since it evoked horrific crimes against black Americans in the U.S. South.

Rep. Barbara Lee, California Democrat, said the comments exhibited ignorance and will further harm Mr. Trump’s standing with the black community.

“Of course, he has no understanding of this horrific history, I assume. And for him to say something like that was disgusting,” Ms. Lee said. “It hurts. It’s painful, and he should apologize.”

Democratic leaders continued to condemn Mr. Trump through the morning, though said they are not looking to formally rebuke him through a resolution.

The Southern Poverty Law Center said Mr. Trump’s comment showed “a complete disrespect” for thousands of murdered black Americans, though the White House insisted Mr. Trump wasn’t trying to draw comparisons.

“The president is not comparing what’s happened to him with one of the darkest moments in American history. He’s just not,” White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said. “What he’s explaining clearly is the way he’s been treated by the media since he announced for president.”

Some Capitol Hill lawmakers said Mr. Trump should at least remove his online posting.

“You think this impeachment is a LYNCHING? What the hell is wrong with you?” Rep. Bobby L. Rush, Illinois Democrat, tweeted.

“Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet.”

House Majority Whip James Clyburn, South Carolina Democrat who is African American, said the president “has always been pretty loose with his words, and this is another indication of that.”

“I really believe this man is prone to inflammatory statements,” he told CNN, “and that is one word that no president ought to apply to himself.”

Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Illinois Republican, urged Mr. Trump to retract his comment immediately, though Sen. Lindsey Graham, an ardent Trump supporter who pushed back on the president’s Syrian policy, said the term was apt, according to multiple Capitol Hill reporters who interviewed him.

“This is a lynching in every sense,” the South Carolina Republican said.

The move enraged Democrats, who said as part of their protest the Republican lawmakers carried electronics into the secure area, creating a potential security lapse. They demanded the 30 or so Republican protesters face ethics charges.

GOP lawmakers brushed those complaints aside, saying the hearing they disrupted, involving Defense Department official Laura Cooper, was not classified, and saying Democrats have broken the rules of fairness by shutting them out of the impeachment process.

“House Democrats are bypassing constitutional norms and basic standards of due process with their impeachment obsession,” said Rep. Mark Walker, North Carolina Republican. “The president is not above justice. But, as you know, neither is he below it.”

Another Republican, Rep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona, was more direct.

“This is an outrage,” she said.

QUIZ: Can you pass this World Series trivia test?

The Democrats’ impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump’s communications with Ukraine over former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a political opponent, is not following any of the precedents for impeachment proceedings.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers have been denied the chance to see evidence or call their own witnesses, and Republicans have been denied subpoena power. The work of the impeachment committees has been restricted, even from some Republican members of those committees.

Wednesday’s protest involved lawmakers who aren’t on the impeachment committees but who say under House rules they have a right to see what’s going on.

Democrats counter that Republicans on the committees can participate and ask questions, and that is good enough.

“This investigation is being conducted by the Intelligence Committee, and members of the Republican side were there if they chose to be during the depositions and they certainly were permitted to ask whatever questions they wanted to,” said Rep. Val Demmings Florida Democrat. “They have access to transcripts and information that were available.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat, threatened to bring ethics charges against the Republican protesters, and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson asked the sergeant at arms to probe the breach of the room, known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility or SCIF.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, California Democrat, said the problem was that lawmakers brought in electronic devices, which are usually banned.

“And they not only brought in their unauthorized device, they may have brought in the Russian and Chinese with electronics in a secure space,” Mr. Swalwell said.

Ms. Schiff shut down the questioning of Ms. Cooper during the GOP protest, which turned into an hours-long sit-in.

Ms. Cooper ultimately did testify, five hours after she was scheduled to begin.

Members on both sides were mum on the details of what she said.

Her testimony comes a day after a former U.S. diplomat to Ukraine told lawmakers that Mr. Trump made the release of military aid to Ukraine contingent on that country probing Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of directors of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

That diplomat, William Taylor, said he uncovered an “irregular” backchannel managed by Mr. Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani to push Ukraine into investigating the Bidens and 2016 election interference.

Republicans said Mr. Taylor’s testimony was “contradicted” by other witnesses who said there was no quid pro quo.

“Much of what Mr. Taylor said yesterday was second- and third-hand information,” said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican.

In the wake of Mr. Taylor’s testimony, the committees leading the impeachment probe issued a new demand for State Department documents, including text messages from witnesses and any memos regarding efforts to press Ukraine to open investigations.

Meanwhile, three Democratic senators filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Justice Department for documents related to Ukraine.

And a federal judge ordered the State Department to begin releasing Ukraine-related documents within 30 days. Those documents include communications between Mr. Giuliani and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper, an Obama appointee, issued the ruling in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by American Oversight, a left-leaning government watchdog organization.

562,562,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/5/romney-jobs-growth-not-enough-reelect-obama/,Right,"WEYERS CAVE, Va. — The jobs picture improved in September, but Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said the fall in the nation’s jobless rate still is not enough to justify giving President Obama another term in office.

“This is not what a real recovery looks like,” Mr. Romney said in a statement, pointing to what he said was a downward trend of job-creation. “We created fewer jobs in September than in August, and fewer jobs in August than in July, and we’ve lost over 600,000 manufacturing jobs since President Obama took office.”

The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ key jobs survey said the economy added 114,000 new jobs in September, and BLS said the unemployment rate dipped to 7.8 percent — a drop of three-tenths of a percent.

That means the rate is now back down to what it was in January 2009, when Mr. Obama took office, inheriting a recession from President George W. Bush.

BLS also revised July and August job numbers upward by a combined 86,000, suggesting a slightly better jobs picture over the summer than was reported at the time.

The jobs news comes just two days after Mr. Romney seemed to be gaining momentum from a strong debate performance.

The Republican presidential nominee loses a major talking point from the campaign trail, where he regularly talked about the streak of consecutive months the unemployment rate had remained above 8 percent.

Mr. Romney on Friday said the jobs picture is still bleak — particularly because of the millions who have dropped out of the market altogether.

“If not for all the people who have simply dropped out of the labor force, the real unemployment rate would be closer to 11 percent,” Mr. Romney said in his statement. “The results of President Obama’s failed policies are staggering — 23 million Americans struggling for work, nearly one in six living in poverty, and 47 million people dependent on food stamps to feed themselves and their families. The choice in this election is clear. Under President Obama, we’ll get another four years like the last four years. If I’m elected, we will have a real recovery with pro-growth policies that will create 12 million new jobs and rising incomes for everyone.”

572,572,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/27/katie-hill-resign-congress-reports-say/,Right,"Rep. Katie Hill on Sunday announced her resignation from Congress amid a House Ethics Committee investigation into her alleged involvement in a bisexual love triangle and an affair with a member of her congressional staff.

“It is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress,” Ms. Hill said in a statement. “This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.”

The freshman California Democrat is embroiled in a messy divorce, which led to the revelations of the office romance, which is prohibited under House rules.

The House Ethics Committee last week announced the investigation following news reports that she was involved in a three-way relationship with her husband and a female campaign staffer, even as she had an affair with a male staffer in her official congressional office.

As reported by Red State, a conservative website, Ms. Hill was involved with a 22-year-old campaign staffer and her husband in a “throuple” relationship.

The ethics probe of Ms. Hill was among a series of investigations into sex scandals involving Democratic House members caught up in the ban on romantic relationships with staff members. The ban was recently implemented as part of Congress’ response to the #MeToo movement, aiming to protect congressional staff from predatory bosses.

The Ethics panel last week also announced an investigation into allegations that Democrat Michael F.Q. San Nicolas, the non-voting member from Guam, had a sexual relationship with a member of his congressional staff.

Ms. Hill’s husband was apparently OK with that arrangement but felt the line was crossed when he learned Ms. Hill, 32, was also having another relationship with her male office employee.

“I didn’t file for divorce bc she was bi! I just didn’t know she opened our relationship. Lol,” Kenny Heslep, Ms. Hill’s estranged husband, wrote on Facebook.

Red State published text messages it said were from the relationship between Ms. Hill and the 22-year-old campaign staffer.

Ms. Hill on Tuesday denied having a relationship with the staffer in her office, calling the allegation “absolutely false.” She blamed her husband, who she said was “abusive,” for the revelations.

“This coordinated effort to try to destroy me and people close to me is despicable and will not succeed. I, like many women who have faced attacks like this before, am stronger than those who want me to be afraid,”

The congresswoman said she had asked the U.S. Capitol Police to investigate the leak of photos, including one published by Red State showing her undressed and brushing another woman’s hair.

Ms. Hill last year defeated Republican incumbent Steve Knight in the race to represents California’s 25th district, which includes parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said Ms. Hill came to Congress with a bright future.

“She has acknowledged errors in judgment that made her continued service as a Member untenable. We must ensure a climate of integrity and dignity in the Congress, and in all workplaces,” Ms. Pelosi said

578,578,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/8/romney-sees-retreat-obamas-foreign-policy/,Right,"LEXINGTON, Va. — Mitt Romney vowed Monday to “recommit” the United States to a two-state solution between the Israelis and Palestinians, to put “clear conditions” on U.S. assistance to Egypt and to ensure Syrian opponents get access to needed weapons as he sought to define key foreign policy differences with President Obama.

While putting some meat on the foreign policy bones his advisers have been outlining for months, the Republican presidential nominee also accused Mr. Obama of “passivity” on the international stage, which he said is damaging the interests of the U.S. and its allies.

“Hope is not a strategy,” Mr. Romney said at the Virginia Military Institute, asserting that the Obama administration has left people around the world wondering, “Where does America stand?”

Mr. Romney said that if he is elected, the world will see clear and predictable behavior from the White House.

But critics from the Obama camp and beyond said the address served only to bolster perceptions that the former Massachusetts governor is long on platitudes but short on substance when it comes to clear differences with the president on foreign policy.

“I would like to ask Gov. Romney or his advisers exactly what he would do differently and how he would operate and how he truly understands what is going on in the Arab world and how deal with it,” former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said Monday in a conference call arranged by the Obama campaign.

Mr. Romney laid out differences in what he called “bedrock principles” toward the Middle East, and said the U.S. must adhere to them in order to give American allies the certainty a stable world needs.

“No friend of America will question our commitment to support them, no enemy that attacks America will question our resolve to defeat them, and no one anywhere, friend or foe, will doubt America’s capability to back up our words,” Mr. Romney said.

“I will champion free trade and restore it as a critical element of our strategy, both in the Middle East and across the world,” he said. “The president has not signed one new free-trade agreement in the past four years. I will reverse that failure.”

On Iran, which is widely thought to be trying to acquire nuclear weapons, Mr. Romney remained vague on whether he would support a pre-emptive military strike, saying instead that “we must make clear to Iran through actions — not just words — that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated.”

He said U.S. aid to Egypt must come with new conditions that would push the new regime there to respect democracy and to live up to its peace treaty commitments with Israel.

Just weeks after a video surfaced showing him sharing his doubts with donors about the viability of a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, Mr. Romney punctuated Monday’s speech with a pledge to “recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel.”

“On this vital issue, the president has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations. In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new president will bring the chance to begin anew,” he said.

When it comes to Syria, where opposition forces are in a bloody stalemate with the regime of Bashar Assad, Mr. Romney said the U.S. must do more to get arms into the hands of the rebels — at least those whom the U.S. trusts.

“I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad’s tanks, helicopters and fighter jets,” Mr. Romney said. “Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them. We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran — rather than sitting on the sidelines.”

Critics said Mr. Romney tried to carve out differences but didn’t articulate a dramatically different vision from the president’s.

“When push comes to shove, it seems to me in this speech that Romney’s a realist and so is Obama,” said Gordon Adams, an international relations professor at American University who served on President Clinton’s national security staff during the mid-1990s.

“When it comes to defining exactly what Romney would do, whether it’s toward Iran or Egypt, or Libya or Syria or Israel, it’s pretty much the same thing when the rubber hits the road that Obama’s already doing,” Mr. Adams said. “And where it’s not, it’s manifestly unrealistic.”

He added that when it comes to overall U.S. foreign policy, “The elusiveness of strategy in the 21st century is intense, and it’s particularly intense in the region that Romney chose to focus on.

“You need to be aware of the fact that not everybody looks to the United States to shape their course of events, and this is particularly true in the Mideast.”

On the issue of standing up countering Iranian nuclear ambitions, Mrs. Albright said, “Short of immediate military action, [Mr. Romney] can’t specify what he’d do differently on Iran than the president.”

U.S. assistance to Egypt, the former secretary of state added, is “already conditioned on many of the things that he listed, like Egypt meeting its obligations to its — the peace treaty with Israel and to proceed with its transition to democracy.”

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Joe Biden’s done it again.

He inadvertently said exactly what was rattling around in his old head, which is the cardinal sin of any politician and particularly egregious when your mind contains the peculiar thoughts of Vice President Joseph R. Biden and President Obama.

Musing about the Republican attack that Team O’Biden wants to raise your taxes by $1 trillion, Mr. Biden took a starkly different tack from his boss. Mr. Obama has made strenuous efforts to paint the claim as an outright, slanderous canard. Remember how they ran their 2008 campaign on the promise of tax cuts? And they are still promising to cut taxes.

But in just three words — a record low for the loquacious veep — Mr. Biden undid all of Mr. Obama’s protests.

“Obama and Biden want to raise taxes by $1 trillion,” he growled in a mock accusatory Republican voice.

“Guess what?” he said, returning to his own voice and leaning over the podium for dramatic effect. “Yes, we do!”

Instant Biden classic!

Mr. Obama gave us “You didn’t build that,” which is hard to beat since it is such a complete synopsis of Mr. Obama’s loathsome disregard for private American enterprise.

“Yes, we do!” should become a shuddering reminder of exactly what these guys aim to do to taxpayers if they get another shot at us.

If you think they ran roughshod over the Constitution in their first term, if you think they squandered your money in their first term, just imagine what they will do in their second term once they will never again be answerable to voters.

“More flexibility,” I think Mr. Obama described it a few months back in whispered voice to the Russians.

This ticket has become so sinister and gloomy and divisive and deceptive, it is hard to even remember Mr. Obama’s last campaign. That one was so hopeful and bright and unifying.

Today, with $16 trillion in debt, real unemployment hovering north of 10 percent and welfare rolls exploding, we are seeing an entirely different campaign. It is one that is entirely devoid of hope and optimism.

“You didn’t build that.” And, “Yes, we do.” Yes, we do want to take another trillion dollars out of the economy and sink it into a sprawling, wasteful government. Yes, we do want to keep on spending money we do not have. And yes, we do want to keep enrolling people onto every form of welfare imaginable.

No wonder so many voters today fear that another four years of this crowd will completely destroy America.

597,597,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/31/pelosis-impeachment-inquiry-more-partisan-clinton-/,Right,"Democrats’ first official step toward impeachment got off on a deeply partisan foot Thursday, leaving House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her team already lagging behind the 1998 move to impeach President Bill Clinton.

The 232-196 vote to launch an impeachment inquiry of President Trump was almost exactly split along party lines. Every Republican and just two Democrats voted “no.” That is a stark break with the Clinton case, the last time Congress worked to impeach the president, when 31 Democrats sided with all Republicans in a 257-176 vote to begin proceedings.

The lack of bipartisan support this time could taint the inquiry and hinder Democratic hopes of ousting Mr. Trump in an eventual Senate trial.

“The vote today, like the entire impeachment effort, is more about Speaker Pelosi remaining speaker than it is about removing the president from office,” one White House official told The Washington Times. “That’s clear to everyone, which is why no Republicans chose to cross the aisle.”

Republicans were unified partly because they think the process Mrs. Pelosi is leading is unfair.

The resolution approved Thursday grants the lead role to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, relegating the Judiciary Committee — which usually heads these sorts of proceedings — to a secondary spot.

SEE ALSO: House approves impeachment inquiry

Republicans said the resolution also denies the minority party the kinds of access to documents and subpoena powers granted to Democrats, who were in the minority in 1998.

“Today’s resolution shows a Democratic House failing to give these same protections to a Republican president,” said Rep. Tom Cole, Oklahoma Republican. “Without those protections, this will be seen as just another partisan exercise.”

But Rules Committee Chairman James P. McGovern, Massachusetts Democrat, insisted that Republicans were being treated fairly — and in fact better than Mr. Clinton or President Nixon, who faced impeachment in 1974.

Mr. McGovern said the inquiry officially launched Thursday, after a month of secret proceedings, will eventually allow for open hearings and does give the minority subpoena power, as long as at least some members of the Democratic majority concur.

“I don’t think there is any process that we can propose that Republicans, who prefer to circle the wagons around this president and prevent us from getting to the truth, can accept,” Mr. McGovern said.

Both the Clinton and Trump inquiries envisioned subpoena powers for the minority, but the presumption was more favorable to the president and his party in 1998 than it is in the current inquiry.

SEE ALSO: White House hits ‘unhinged’ Democrats for moving forward with impeachment probe

Mr. McGovern chided Republicans for focusing on the impeachment process and said they should instead be questioning Mr. Trump’s behavior.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, said the lack of bipartisan support “betrays” Mrs. Pelosi’s promise at the beginning of this Congress that she would not pursue impeachment unless there was overwhelming bipartisan consensus.

“What has changed since those words have been spoken?” Mr. McCarthy wondered.

One of the Democrats to vote against the inquiry was Rep. Collin C. Peterson, a Minnesota Democrat who was in Congress in 1998 and was one of the 31 Democrats who voted for the inquiry into Mr. Clinton.

On Thursday, Mr. Peterson called Mrs. Pelosi’s effort “hopelessly partisan” — for many of the reasons Republicans gave.

“I have some serious concerns with the way the closed-door depositions were run and am skeptical that we will have a process that is open, transparent and fair,” he said. He added that he is undecided on whether he would support impeachment should it come to a vote.

Rep. Ron Kind, Wisconsin Democrat, also backed the 1998 Clinton inquiry, but he broke with Mr. Peterson and voted for this week’s inquiry into Mr. Trump.

More than 40 other Democrats who excused Mr. Clinton’s behavior in 1998 voted to investigate Mr. Trump. Meanwhile, 14 Republicans who supported the Clinton inquiry voted against the Trump investigation.

Mr. Clinton went on to be impeached by the House on charges of perjury, on a 228-206 vote, and obstruction of justice, on a 221-212 vote.

A trial was held in the Senate, where it takes a two-thirds vote to convict and remove the president from office. Mr. Clinton was acquitted when just 50 senators voted to convict for obstruction and 45 for perjury.

One major difference — and a warning sign for Mr. Trump — is that the president has significantly less support than Mr. Clinton did at this point.

A Gallup poll taken the week after the House approved the impeachment inquiry in 1998 showed 55% of likely voters disapproved of impeachment. By contrast, a plurality of 48% support impeachment now, according to the FiveThirtyEight.com average of polling.

Mr. Trump’s approval rating is underwater, whereas Mr. Clinton held a 65% approval rating and a majority of voters said they wanted him to have more say in the direction of the country.

The impeachment effort aimed at Nixon was even more bipartisan than Mr. Clinton’s. The House approved that inquiry by a 410-4 vote.

During the February 1974 floor debate that laid out subpoena powers, not a single member rose to defend Nixon. Instead, both Democrats and Republicans intoned on the seriousness with which they pursued the case.

Rep. John J. Rhodes, the House Republican leader at the time, took to the floor to say he trusted Democrats’ promises to conduct the inquiry fairly.

Democrats said they had to deviate from that bipartisan and open process because this inquiry is different.

In 1974, and again in 1998, they said special prosecutors already had completed investigations. Now, the Justice Department has cleared Mr. Trump of wrongdoing, so House Democrats say they are conducting their own investigation.

“That work has necessarily occurred behind closed doors because we have had the task of finding the facts ourselves,” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the intelligence committee who has become the Democrats’ chief impeachment prosecutor.

Democrats said their resolution will eventually have Mr. Schiff make public the secret evidence he has amassed against Mr. Trump.

They also promised eventual public hearings.

In the letter obtained by CNN and posted on its site, Andrew Bakaj told White House Counsel Pat Cipollone that Mr. Trump might bear responsibility “should anyone be physically harmed as a result of his, or his surrogates’, behavior.”

Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked the person who complained to an inspector-general about the president’s phone call to his Ukrainian opposite number, calling him a coward and a partisan.

“I am writing to respectfully request that you counsel your client on the legal and ethical peril in which he is placing himself,” Mr. Bakaj wrote.

Mr. Bakaj also threatened legal repercussions against Mr. Trump if he did not stop his public criticism, including calls for media outlets to print the whistleblower’s name.

“I submit that it is in your client’s best interest to cease and desist in calling for the public disclosure of my client’s identity and to cease in rhetoric that may endanger their life and the lives of their family. Should anyone be physically harmed, my co-counsel, Mark Zaid, and I will not hesitate to take any and all appropriate action against your client,” Mr. Bakaj warned.

The letter was cc’d to the members of Congress who constitute the “gang of eight” on intelligence matters — the leaders of each party in both chambers, and the chairmen and ranking members of the two intelligence committees.

661,661,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/10/bidens-debate-aim-reclaim-edge-after-obamas-subpar/,Right,"With President Obama looking to an unpredictable and gaffe-prone Joseph R. Biden to get his campaign back on track in Thursday’s debate, the pressure on the vice president couldn’t be greater.

Vice presidential match-ups usually don’t have the power to change the course of the election, but this year could be different. Mr. Biden is acutely aware that Mr. Obama’s dismal performance in his first faceoff with Republican rival Mitt Romney largely erased Mr. Obama’s lead in several key battleground states, ratcheting up the stakes for his performance Thursday night at Centre College in Danville, Ky.

As Mr. Obama’s No. 2, Mr. Biden doesn’t have the burden of looking presidential, so can bare some teeth and punch hard against Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Mr. Romney’s running mate. But getting too loose and looking angry against Mr. Ryan, a budget expert 27 years his junior, could easily backfire on the vice president, leading him to veer off script and reminding viewers of Sen. John McCain’s grumpy 2008 debate performance against Mr. Obama, who remained calm and collected.

With this in mind, Mr. Biden has been assiduously preparing for his prime-time clash with Mr. Ryan. Holed up for much of the week in a hotel in Wilmington, Del., the vice president has been scrutinizing videos of Mr. Ryan’s speeches and interviews, and holding mock debates against Rep. Chris Van Hollen, Maryland Democrat, who is playing Mr. Ryan in debate preparation, as well as David Axelrod, a senior adviser in the Obama campaign.

Mr. Biden’s frequent gaffes on the campaign trail have given Republicans plenty of campaign fodder, but the vice president seemed keenly focused on trying to keep his tongue in check Thursday.

“I don’t want to say anything in the debate that’s not completely accurate,” he told reporters late last week.

Though Mr. Biden has created a few headaches for Mr. Obama throughout the election, Mr. Biden is a seasoned debate veteran who has run for president twice and delivered a strong performance against then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in 2008.

Relatively untested, Mr. Ryan is more of a blank slate. His aides say he has participated in a debate only once — when he first ran for Congress 14 years ago. Mr. Ryan also has been hunkered down in debate preparation over the past week, spending days at a resort in the Blue Ridge Mountains 150 miles southwest of Washington, where he was joined by former Solicitor General Ted Olson, who played the role of Mr. Biden in mock debates.

Four years ago, Mr. Biden approached the debate against Mrs. Palin cautiously, careful not to get too rough with the newcomer to the national stage. But after Mr. Obama’s lethargic showing last week, Mr. Biden is expected to come out swinging.

“I expect the vice president to come at me like a cannonball,” Mr. Ryan told reporters earlier this week. “He’ll be in full attack mode, and I don’t think he’ll let any inconvenient facts get in his way.”

If what Mr. Biden has been saying on the campaign trail is any indication, he will likely try to force Mr. Ryan to defend Mr. Romney’s proposals on taxes and spending — and seize any opportunity to tie Mr. Romney to Mr. Ryan’s Medicare plan, which includes caps on future spending and a plan to partially privatize it.

Just last week, Mr. Biden and Mr. Ryan sparred over the Democrats’ desire to let the Bush-era tax rates for households making $250,000 and up expire at the end of the year. Even though the call for a tax hike on top earners wasn’t new, Mr. Biden’s blunt language admitting that he and Mr. Obama want a $1 trillion tax increase gave Mr. Ryan an opportunity to go on the attack.

Campaigning in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Mr. Biden said Mr. Romney and other Republicans often say, “‘Obama and Biden want to raise taxes by a trillion dollars.’ Guess what? Yes, we do, in one regard: We want to let that trillion-dollar tax cut expire so the middle class doesn’t have to bear the burden of all that money going to the super-wealthy. That’s not a tax raise. That’s called fairness where I come from.”

Mr. Ryan pounced on the quote at a campaign stop in Virginia last Thursday.

“What we don’t need is a trillion-dollar tax increase,” he said. “What we don’t need is a tax increase on our successful job creators that will cost us 700,000 jobs in just two years.”

When Mr. Romney picked Mr. Ryan, Medicare became a major issue in the campaign, and Mr. Biden is likely to do everything he can to score points on the topic during the debate.

Polls have given Mr. Obama the edge when it comes to handling Medicare. The most recent CNN survey had Mr. Obama leading Romney-Ryan on Medicare, 53 percent to 44 percent, and ABC News had Mr. Obama up 4 points on the issue.

In early September, while campaigning in Mr. Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin, Mr. Biden said the Romney-Ryan ticket would turn Medicare into “voucher-care.”

“We are for Medicare. They are for voucher care,” he said. “It’s basic.”

But Mr. Ryan has not tried to run away from the Medicare issue, memorably joined by his 78-year-old mother, Betty Douglas, when he delivered a speech on Medicare reform in The Villages, Fla., a large retirement community in mid-September.

During the address, he accused Mr. Obama of siphoning off hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare to pay for his 2010 health care overhaul.

“Medicare should not be a piggy bank for Obamacare,” he said, reassuring seniors that he is committed to protecting the Medicare guarantee for current seniors and for generations to come.

It’s a line Mr. Romney used repeatedly during last week’s debate against Mr. Obama, pointing out that Mr. Obama is responsible for shifting $716 billion out of Medicare to pay for his health care law.

But after the debate, Democrats said Mr. Ryan protected those cuts in his budget and fact-checkers have deemed the charge that Mr. Obama robbed Medicare of the amount as “mostly false” — a point Mr. Biden will undoubtedly try to hammer home Thursday night.

663,663,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/10/team-obama-renews-war-women-attacks-romney/,Right,"DELAWARE, Ohio — With President Obama losing his advantage among female voters, his campaign aides Wednesday resurrected attacks on Mitt Romney over abortion and women’s rights, claiming the Republican nominee is hiding his true positions.

Mr. Romney is pro-life but doesn’t emphasize his position on the campaign trail, preferring to focus on economic issues. The swiftness of the Obama campaign’s attack, calling in Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards to criticize Mr. Romney, underscored the concern in the president’s camp about the shifting attitudes of female voters since the first presidential debate on Oct. 3, in which the president performed poorly.

Viewers of the debate rated Mr. Romney as the undisputed winner, and even some single women, who make up a key part of the president’s support, favored the Republican. A month ago, Mr. Obama enjoyed an 18-point advantage over Mr. Romney among female voters in a Pew Research Center poll, 56 percent to 38 percent. But in a Pew survey conducted after the debate, Mr. Obama’s lead among women had evaporated, with the candidates tied at 47 percent in the eyes of female voters.

Given those developments in the past week, the president’s surrogates seized Wednesday on a comment that Mr. Romney gave in an interview with the Des Moines Register, in which he said “there’s no legislation with regards to abortion that I’m familiar with that would become part of my agenda.”

“We’re not saying that he’s changed his mind on these issues,” said deputy Obama campaign manager Stephanie Cutter. “We’re saying he’s trying to cover up his beliefs. Women simply cannot trust Mitt Romney.”

Ms. Richards accused Mr. Romney of hiding his positions on abortion. “This isn’t about flip-flopping; this is about distancing himself from positions he’s taken repeatedly,” she told reporters in a conference call arranged by the Obama campaign.

Ms. Richards said she has taken a temporary leave from Planned Parenthood to campaign for the president’s re-election.

At a campaign stop in Delaware, Ohio, on Wednesday, Mr. Romney defended his remarks in the Des Moines newspaper and said he hasn’t changed his stance.

“I think I’ve said time and again, I’m a pro-life candidate,” Mr. Romney said. “I’ll be a pro-life president. The actions I’ll take immediately are to remove funding for Planned Parenthood. It will not be part of my budget. And also I’ve indicated I’ll reverse the Mexico City position of the president. I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy.”

The Mexico City Policy, initiated by President Reagan in 1984, bans federal funds from being used by private groups to pay for abortions. Mr. Obama rescinded the policy within days of taking office.

The president also weighed in Wednesday, telling ABC News’ Diane Sawyer that his opponent’s interview in the Des Moines paper “is another example of Gov. Romney hiding positions he’s been campaigning on for a year and a half.”

“Is it a lie?” Ms. Sawyer asked.

“No, I actually think … when it comes to women’s rights to control their own health care decisions, you know, what he has been saying is exactly what he believes,” Mr. Obama said. “[Mr. Romney] thinks that it is appropriate for politicians to inject themselves in those decisions.”

Romney: No changes

Mr. Romney campaigned during the Republican primary season on a pro-life platform, and a campaign spokeswoman reiterated Wednesday that Mr. Romney hasn’t changed that position.

“Mitt Romney is proudly pro-life, and he will be a pro-life president,” campaign spokesman Andrea Saul said.

Surrogates for Mr. Romney rushed to his defense Wednesday, saying he is more focused on putting Americans back to work.

“The reality is, it’s no surprise that President Obama would want to talk about anything but the economy,” Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said at a campaign stop in Virginia.

Mr. Jindal made the remarks after he and Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell visited a barbecue restaurant in Chester. Mr. McDonnell said that Mr. Romney was sending a message that his presidential agenda “isn’t focusing on social issues.”

“Having read those comments from Gov. Romney,” Mr. McDonnell said of the Register interview, “what he was saying is, his overwhelming priority is going to be creating jobs, getting the economy back on track.”

The governor’s record

The former Massachusetts governor generally doesn’t talk about a pro-life agenda at his campaign rallies. Mr. Romney’s position on abortion has evolved over his political career, starting in 1994 with his failed U.S. Senate bid against Democrat Edward M. Kennedy in Massachusetts. At the time, Mr. Romney said he personally opposed abortion, but that his commitment to keeping abortions legal stemmed from having a relative who died from an illegal abortion.

“I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country,” Mr. Romney said at the time. “I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years that we should sustain and support it.”

He touted a similar message during his 2002 gubernatorial bid, vowing to “preserve and protect a woman’s right to choose” and saying that he is “devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.”

However, his stance changed in 2005 after he announced in a Boston Globe editorial that he is “pro-life” and said that he supports a reversal of Roe v. Wade.

The shift haunted Mr. Romney in this year’s GOP primary, where he was on the receiving end of attacks from former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and struggled to win over evangelical voters who questioned his pro-life credentials.

An unexpected fight

A fight over female voters is one of the last battles that Mr. Obama’s advisers thought they would be waging this late in the campaign. Women voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 by a margin of 56 percent to 43 percent over Republican candidate John McCain. Unmarried women went for the president in an especially lopsided result, 70 percent to 29 percent. Married mothers gave Mr. Obama a slight edge.

But in a Bloomberg News poll released Wednesday, married mothers in the crucial battleground states of Ohio and Virginia gave Mr. Romney the edge, saying they preferred the Republican for dealing with the nation’s economic challenges, even though they side with the president on reproductive rights.

Married mothers in Ohio supported Mr. Romney 50 percent to 44 percent; in Virginia, they favored Mr. Romney by 50 percent to 45 percent.

In Ohio, the Bloomberg poll found that married mothers backed Mr. Romney, although 55 percent favored the federal government’s auto bailout, which Mr. Romney opposed. They said they think Mr. Romney also will do a better job than the president on handling gas prices and reviving the housing market.

There are 2½ times as many single women as married mothers in the U.S., and Mr. Obama continues to hold an advantage with them.

673,673,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/11/obama-campaign-claims-lead-early-vote-indicators/,Right,"Led by a surge in Hispanic voters, President Obama’s campaign said Thursday that Democrats are leading the party registration fight in nearly every battleground state this fall as campaign officials try to combat disillusionment among Democrats after last week’s presidential debate.

The Obama campaign also said that with the exception of Colorado, Democrats are doing better this year than in 2008 in every battleground state that allows voting by mail.

“At this point in 2008, Republicans had an absentee-ballot-request advantage of 259,000 ballot requests in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina and Nevada. In 2012, Democrats have cut that margin by 75 percent to just 64,000,” Jeremy Bird, the Obama campaign’s national field director, said in a memo Thursday. In 2008, Mr. Obama wound up sweeping those five states.

Mr. Bird said new voter registration since Aug. 1 has overwhelmingly come in demographics favorable to Democrats, including women, those under 30 and minorities.

In Pennsylvania, for example, 67 percent of new registrants were under age 30, and 22 percent were women or minorities over that age.

In Florida, Hispanics have accounted for all of the growth in voter registration.

But Republicans said last week’s debate energized their voters, who have been signing up to volunteer with the campaign and are now more energized.

They also said that, in some of the biggest counties in Ohio, registered Republicans generally make up less than a quarter of voters but are accounting for as much as 45 percent of absentee ballots and early votes.

“Our early vote numbers are outperforming voter registration in battleground states, demonstrating the strength of our ground game and the excitement for the Romney/Ryan ticket,” said Rich Beeson, the campaign’s political director. “Not only are we keeping pace with the vaunted Obama machine, but we believe our ground game will put us over the finish line on Election Day.”

Talking with reporters Thursday afternoon, Jim Messina, manager of the Obama campaign, said his team has a number of different paths to win the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House, and said, thanks to last month’s huge fundraising number, it doesn’t have to withdraw from any state it is now contesting.

“We have the ability financially to compete wherever we want to compete, and that’s what we’re going to do,” he said.

Meanwhile, new research shows that despite a closely contested Republican primary earlier this year, turnout for presidential and Senate primaries was the lowest on record, with just 15.9 percent of eligible citizens voting.

“Turnout reached record lows for presidential election years in 15 of 41 states which held statewide primaries in both parties,” said the report by the Center for the Study of the American Electorate. “Democratic turnout dropped to record lows in 26 of 41 primaries. In the 46 states where Republican primaries were held, there were eight record lows and three record highs.”

The findings run counter to the common-sense notion that a close election means high turnout.

Curtis Gans, the center’s director, said the November election has the potential to be akin to the 1948 race, a very close race in which Harry Truman “slipped back into office in the second-lowest-turnout contest since women were given the vote in 1920.”

715,715,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/nov/18/house-democrats-probe-whether-trump-lied-mueller-r/,Right,"President Trump battled his political foes’ legal assaults on two fronts Monday.

The Supreme Court issued a temporary stay allowing Mr. Trump to keep his tax returns away from prying House Democrats, at least for now.

And across town, an attorney for House Democrats demanded access to the grand jury materials underlying former special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, saying it is part of a probe into whether the president committed perjury.

The Supreme Court order halts a lower-court ruling requiring Mr. Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, to turn over the president’s tax returns and financial documents to Democrats in their impeachment probe.

The president’s legal team last week petitioned the high court to put on hold a ruling from the lower courts siding with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which issued a subpoena for the documents.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. granted the administration’s request to stay the ruling against Mr. Trump “until further order.” He did not say when the high court will rule, but did request that House Democrats respond by Thursday to the president’s petition.

Known as an administrative stay, the court’s action is not an indication of how it might rule in the legal fight. It merely gives the court more time to mull legal arguments.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers have pushed for the House subpoena to be thrown out. They have claimed the president is immune from a criminal investigation while in office and upholding the subpoena would create open season on presidents.

“Given the temptation to dig up dirt on political rivals, intrusive subpoenas into personal lives of presidents will become our new normal in times of divided government — no matter which party is in power,” his lawyers wrote last week

House Democrats have argued the material is pertinent to their investigation into whether the president committed financial fraud. The committee is investigating hush-money payments made to two women who alleged affairs with Mr. Trump.

On a separate front, a lawyer for House Democrats told a federal judge the impeachment inquiry now includes an investigation into whether Mr. Trump lied to Mr. Mueller’s investigators.

House general counsel Douglas Letter told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia the probe underscores the need for the Mueller grand jury materials.

“Did the president lie? Was the president not truthful in his responses to the Mueller investigation?” Mr. Letter asked the judge.

The inquiry follows last week’s bombshell testimony from former Trump deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates. Mr. Gates testified in the trial of former Trump confidant Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress to stonewall the Russia probe.

Mr. Gates testified that the president and Mr. Stone talked on the phone in late July 2016 during a car ride. Upon ending the Stone phone call, Mr. Trump said “more information would be coming,” which Gates took as an apparent reference to WikiLeaks releasing stolen Democratic emails.

That testimony appears to contradict Mr. Trump’s 2018 written answers to the Mueller team. Mr. Trump wrote that he could not recall Mr. Stone or other campaign associates “having any discussions, directly or indirectly, with WikiLeaks … regarding the content or timing or release of hacked emails.”

But others who testified during the Stone trial said the longtime political operative was viewed as the campaign’s key conduit to WikiLeaks.

“I think it was generally believed that the access point or potential access point to WikiLeaks was Roger Stone,” former Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon testified.

The Justice Department has argued against releasing the grand jury materials to the Democrats. Department attorneys have argued that impeachment trials are not judicial proceedings and that the courts should not be involved.

735,735,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/17/post-debate-candidates-court-womens-vote/,Right,"Trying to regain a clear lead among female voters, President Obama and Democrats said Wednesday that Mitt Romney’s second debate performance showed the Republican presidential nominee will not stand up for women’s rights and mocked him for saying he brought “binders full of women” as job candidates with him when he became Massachusetts governor.

Mr. Romney, meanwhile, countered that millions of women have suffered under Mr. Obama’s watch, warning that another four years would yield more of the same.

“Why is it there are 3.6 million more women in poverty today than when the president took office?” Mr. Romney said at a rally in Chesapeake, Va. “This president has failed America’s women. They’ve suffered in terms of getting jobs; they’ve suffered in terms of falling into poverty.”

By the time the day was done, the Obama forces had accused Mr. Romney of not appointing enough women to his gubernatorial Cabinet, and the Romney forces had highlighting news reports of Mr. Obama nurturing a “boys’ club” environment at the White House that marginalized women.

The back-and-forth began a night earlier in the town hall debate between the two men at Hofstra University in New York. When a voter asked how they would handle pay disparities between men and women, both men attacked, arguing the other has been a failure for women.

It served as clear reminder that both candidates recognize the importance of appealing to female voters.

A September poll from the Pew Research Center showed that Mr. Obama led Mr. Romney by 18 points among women. But that storyline changed dramatically in a later Pew poll — released after Mr. Obama’s widely panned first debate performance — that found Mr. Romney had pulled even. A USA Today/Gallup poll released this week also showed that Mr. Romney trailed Mr. Obama by a single percentage point among women in a dozen swing states.

That would be a bad omen for Mr. Obama, who held a 13 percentage-point advantage among women in the 2008 election, according to exit polling. Mr. Obama’s 1-point victory among men in 2008 was only the second time in 30 years a Democrat didn’t lose the male vote.

“To the extent that President Obama can exploit the gender gap, he has a very good chance of being re-elected. And to the extent that Mitt Romney can mitigate the gap, his electoral prospects are more positive,” said professor Jennifer L. Lawless, director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University.

She said Mr. Obama’s performance at Tuesday’s debate likely “rebuilt any gender gap that might have been lost over the course of the last week and a half.”

Over the course of 90 minutes, Mr. Obama reminded voters that the first bill he signed into law, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, granted women more time to file pay-discrimination lawsuits.

He also criticized Mr. Romney for refusing to take a stand on that law, accused him of supporting legislation that would have allowed employers not to cover contraception in their health-insurance plans. He also said Romney-backed Republican efforts to stop taxpayer dollars from being spent on Planned Parenthood would hurt women in more ways than one.

Mr. Romney pushed back, arguing that the president mischaracterized his positions. He said his business-friendly stances will make it easier for women to find good jobs and earn more pay.

Mr. Romney also sought to reassure a young woman at the debate that he understood the issue of pay equity, sharing the story of how he brought “binders full of women” with him to his job as Massachusetts governor.

“We took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our Cabinet. I went to a number of women’s groups and said, ‘Can you help us find folks?’ And I brought us whole binders full of — of women,” he said.

Mr. Obama ridiculed the comment during a campaign stop in Iowa on Wednesday, saying, “We don’t have to collect a bunch of binders to find qualified, talented, driven young women, ready to learn and teach” right now in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math.

743,743,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/nov/22/steve-doocy-fox-friends-co-host-challenges-donald-/,Right,"President Trump was called into question Friday morning by Fox News personality Steve Doocy when he apparently held forth a bogus claim about U.S. cybersecurity company CrowdStrike and Ukraine.

Mr. Trump was speaking live on “Fox & Friends” when Mr. Doocy, one of the show’s co-hosts, interjected to cast doubt on a debunked conspiracy theory being spread by the president.

“They have the server from the DNC, Democratic National Committee,” Mr. Trump said about CrowdStrike near the start of a live telephone interview that lasted nearly an hour.

“They gave the server to CrowdStrike or whatever it is called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian. And I still want to see that server. You know, the FBI has never gotten that server. That’s a big part of this whole thing.” Mr. Trump insisted. “Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company?”

CrowdStrike was contracted by the DNC after the latter’s computers were compromised leading up the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The company is not Ukrainian, however; it is actually headquartered in California and publicly traded on Nasdaq.

Mr. Doocy subsequently scrambled to make room for the president to walk back the remarks, asking: “Are you sure they did that? Are you sure they gave it to Ukraine?”

“Well, that’s what the word is,” Mr. Trump replied.

The U.S intelligence community has assessed that Russian government hackers compromised the DNC and other victims during the course of a sprawling effort to interfere in the 2016 election to the Democratic Party’s disadvantage, and the Department of Justice has filed related criminal charges against several Russian intelligence officers accused of involvement. That assessment was announced after the government considered evidence including digital copies of computers that CrowdStrike had analyzed as part of the company’s own investigation into the DNC breach.

“We’ve provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI related to the DNC investigation as requested,” CrowdStrike said in a statement previously.

Mr. Trump has expressed doubts about Moscow’s involvement in his election, and he is among Republicans who have recently begun questioning whether Russia’s neighboring adversary Ukraine interfered in the race — a baseless theory panned by a former member of the president’s National Security Council hours earlier.

“Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country — and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves,” Fiona Hill, a former NSC expert on European and Russian affairs for the Trump administration, testified during an open impeachment hearing held Thursday in the House of Representatives.

Democrats controlling the House initiated the impeachment inquiry after a member of the intelligence community raised concerns regarding a July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr. Trump mentioned CrowdStrike and its purported Ukrainian connection in that conversation moments before asking Mr. Zelensky to investigate Joseph R. Biden, a front-runner seeking the Democratic nomination to run for the White House in 2020, while the U.S. withheld military assistance needed for Ukraine to combat Russian aggression.

Intelligence officials recently briefed Senators about a yearslong Russian effort to falsely blame Ukraine for interfering in the 2016 race, The New York Times reported Friday.

“His wrongdoing strikes at the very heart of our Constitution,” said Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat.

She formally requested that the House Judiciary Committee move forward with articles of impeachment based on allegations that Mr. Trump abused the power of his office and invited foreign interference in the 2020 election.

“The president leaves us no choice but to act because he’s trying once again to corrupt the election for his own benefit,” she said.

Early Thursday morning, Mr. Trump called on the Democrats to move faster on impeachment so it can proceed to the Republican-controlled Senate.

“Therefore I say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business,” he tweeted. “We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is. I was elected to ‘Clean the Swamp,’ and that’s what I am doing!”

Democrats have just entered phase two of the impeachment proceedings with Wednesday’s House Judiciary Committee hearing on high crimes and misdemeanors.

Mrs. Pelosi did not offer a timeline for when the House will vote on articles, but many of her members are hoping to move through this step quickly and reach a decision before the end of the year.

Despite the packed legislative schedule that Democrats have for the rest of December, Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer told reporters Wednesday that if the Judiciary Committee brings forward articles of impeachment quickly, then there will be time to get a vote before Congress leaves for the holiday break.

The next big question for Democrats is what exactly will be included in the articles of impeachment.

The allegations that the president pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner, and his son Hunter Biden will be at the forefront of the articles.

But the question remains what, if anything, else will be added.

When she formally launched the impeachment inquiry in September, Mrs. Pelosi described it would work in an “umbrella approach” with the Ukraine investigation at the center but involving the investigations from five other committees, including the probes into alleged violations of the emoluments clauses and the president’s tax returns.

On Wednesday, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jarrold L. Nadler said that the issues Democrats raised during their Mueller report probe could be included.

Democrats are debating how far they should go — knowing that it could split support on some charges.

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Mrs. Pelosi and the Democrats “should be ashamed.”

She tweeted that Mr. Trump “has done nothing but lead our country - resulting in a booming economy, more jobs & a stronger military, to name just a few of his major accomplishments.”

“We look forward to a fair trial in the Senate,” she said.

Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said Democrats are trying to interfere with next year’s election.

“We are less than a year away from Election Day 2020 and Democrats can’t possibly explain to the American people why they want to take the decision of who should be president out of the hands of voters,” Mr. Parscale said. “But impeaching the president has always been their goal, so they should just get on with it so we can have a fair trial in the Senate and expose The Swamp for what it is.”

He said Mrs. Pelosi, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff and Hunter Biden should testify, “and then we can get back to the business of our country.”

806,806,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/dec/6/us-gains-a-robust-266000-jobs-unemployment-falls-t/,Right,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Hiring in the United States jumped last month to its highest level since January as U.S. employers shrugged off global trade conflicts and added 266,000 jobs.

The unemployment rate declined to 3.5% from 3.6% in October, matching a half-century low, the Labor Department reported Friday. And wages rose a solid 3.1% in November compared with a year earlier.

The healthy job gain runs against a widespread view that businesses are struggling to find workers with unemployment so low. Persistent hiring should help keep consumers spending - a key engine of growth as businesses have cut their investment spending and exports have stalled.

Monthly job growth has in fact accelerated since this summer, averaging 205,000 over the past three months, up from just 135,000 in July.

Steady hiring has helped reassure consumers that the economy is expanding and that their jobs and incomes remain secure, which, in turn, has helped fuel spending. Consumer spending has become an even more important driver of growth because the Trump administration’s trade conflicts have reduced exports and led many businesses to cut spending.

Renewed concerns that trade will continue to hamper the U.S. economy drove stock prices lower earlier this week, after President Trump said he was willing to wait until after the 2020 elections to strike a preliminary trade agreement with China. With the two sides still haggling, the administration is set to impose 15% tariffs on an additional $160 billion of Chinese imports beginning Dec. 15.

Both sides have since suggested that the negotiations are making progress, but there is still no sign of a resolution.

Hiring in the United States has remained mostly healthy this year despite the trade war. Even so, Trump’s combative use of import taxes, combined with retaliatory tariffs by China and Europe, has stalled job growth in manufacturing.

Employers have been hiring at a solid enough pace to absorb new job seekers and to potentially lower the unemployment rate, though the pace of job growth is down from last year.

The holiday shopping season has begun later this year compared with previous years, a fact that some economists think might have delayed hiring by retailers and shipping firms last month.

With tariffs hobbling manufacturing, the job market this year has underscored a bifurcation in the economy: Service industries — finance, engineering, health care and the like — have been hiring at a solid pace, while manufacturers, miners and builders have been posting weak numbers.

Despite the raging trade tensions, most analysts say they remain hopeful about the economy and the job market. The economy grew at a 2.1% annual rate in the July-September quarter, and the annual pace is thought to be slowing to roughly 1.5% to 2% in the final three months of the year — sluggish but far from recessionary.

Consumer confidence has slipped in recent months but remains at a decent level, helping boost sales of expensive purchases, such as autos and appliances.

With inflation surprisingly low, the Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark short-term interest rate three times this year. Those rate cuts have helped support the housing market. Sales of existing homes have risen nearly 5% in the past year. Sales of new homes have soared by one-third."
811,811,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/dec/9/jerrold-nadler-boils-down-impeachment-case-against/,Right,"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler on Monday put a fine point on Democrats’ impeachment case against President Trump, arguing that the president put himself before the country.

“We surely agree that no public official, including and especially the president of the United States, should use his public office for private gain,” he said at the opening of an evidentiary hearing before his committee.

Based on the evidence presented, the committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump.

Mr. Nadler, New York Democrat, called the process a “solemn and serious undertaking” that Congress must engage in to address serious threats to America’s institutions, such as “free and fair elections.”

He said both sides should be able to agree on the fact of the case if Republicans would remove “their blinders.”

“We agree that no president should put himself before the country,” Mr. Nadler said. “The Constitution and his oath of office, his promise to American citizens, require the country’s president to put the country first.”

SEE ALSO: Trump impeachment hearing becomes a shouting match

Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and denounced the House impeachment drive as a partisan “sham.”

The articles of impeachment are expected to include charges of abuse of power, bribery and obstructing the congressional probe, all of which stem from Mr. Trump asking Ukraine to investigate political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter.

Republicans argue that Mr. Trump’s action, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality. They’ve also vouched for the legitimacy of investigating Hunter Biden, who landed a $50,000-a-month job on a Ukraine natural gas company, while his father was the point man for Obama White House policy in that graft-riddled country.

The impeachment case stems from a July 25 phone call in which Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for a “favor” in investigating the Bidens and Ukraine meddling in the 2016 election.

A whistleblower, who is believed to be a CIA official assigned to the White House, accused the president of abusing his power for personal gain on the call, including withholding $391 million of U.S. military aid from Ukraine as leverage.

A rough transcript of the call the White House released in late September did not show the president present a quid pro quo deal for the investigations, but Democrats have argued the threat was understood and part of an ongoing pressure campaign of “shadow” foreign policy conducted by Mr. Trump’s private lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.

The quid pro quo, a Latin term meaning a transaction of “this for that,” is the crux of the Democrats’ case that Mr. Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme that warrants impeachment.

The Judiciary Committee is reviewing evidence gathered by an inquiry led by the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Much of the evidence was presented in two weeks of public hearings last month.

The most powerful testimony yet in the inquiry came from Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, who said he offered a quid pro quo of a prized White House visit for the newly-elected Mr. Zelensky for the investigations. But Mr. Sondland said he “presumed” that was what Mr. Trump wanted.

In his only conversation with the president about it, Mr. Trump told him that there was “no quid pro quo,” Mr. Sondland testified.

None of the witnesses in the impeachment inquiry linked the holdup of military assistance to the investigations or provided a reason for the holdup. The aid was delayed for about two months, before the money started to flow to Ukraine on Sept. 11, two days after the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community informed Congress of the whistleblower complaint.

Mr. Trump has acknowledged that he wanted an investigation into alleged corruption involving Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, who landed a high-paying job on the board of Ukraine natural gas company Burisma Holdings in 2014. At the time, his father was the point man for Obama White House policy in the country, which is notorious for corruption, especially in the energy industry.

The elder Mr. Biden recently boasted of forcing Ukraine leaders to fire the country’s chief prosecutor in spring 2016 by threatening to block a $1 billion U.S. loan guarantee. The prosecutor was widely viewed as not doing enough to combat corruption. But the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, also had looked into corruption allegations against Burisma and Mykola Zlochevsky, the Ukraine oligarch running the company.

Mr. Trump also wanted Ukraine to look into a missing Democratic National Committee server that was hacked by Russia during the 2016 presidential campaigns. An American cybersecurity company called CrowdStrike examined the server to probe the hack but the server disappeared before it got to the FBI.

Mr. Trump subscribes to an unsubstantiated theory that the server ended up in Ukraine.

820,820,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/dec/11/michael-horowitz-ig-says-fbis-trump-probe-was-fail/,Right,"Inspector General Michael Horowitz said Wednesday the FBI should have disclosed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court the known political biases of an ex-British spy whose salacious and unverified dossier was used to obtain a wiretap on a key Trump campaign aide.

“Any evidence of bias is supposed to be disclosed to the court” Mr. Horowitz said in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

“I don’t think the Department of Justice fairly treated these FISAs and [Carter Page] was on the receiving end of them,” he continued.

The FBI used the dossier compiled by former spy Christopher Steele alleging damaging ties between Russia and the Trump campaign to secure a warrant to monitor Carter Page, a campaign official.

Mr. Horowitz said he would not have submitted the same FISA application to the court, calling it “misleading.”

Mr. Horowitz declined to say if top officials at the FBI, including former Director James Comey and ex-Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, should have known the bureau bungled the FISA application.

SEE ALSO: Horowitz ‘surprised’ by Durham pushback, says U.S. attorney offered no evidence to change findings

“We don’t have a clear record of what they were told,” he said.

But he also called the FBI’s investigation to the Trump campaign’s alleged links to Russia a “failure” by the bureau’s “entire chain of command,” adding top officials failed to conduct proper oversight.

“It is incumbent upon the entire chain of command, including senior officials to take the necessary steps to ensure that they are sufficiently familiar with the fact and circumstances and potentially undermining a FISA application in order to provide effective oversight consistent with their level of supervisory responsibility,” Mr. Horowitz will say according to his prepared remarks.

In addition, Mr. Howoritz said that he did not receive “satisfactory explanations” for why agents withheld potentially exculpatory information that could have cleared the Trump aide, Carter Page, of wrongdoing.

“We found that offered explanations for these serious errors did not excuse them or the repeated failures to ensure the accuracy of information presented to the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court],” Mr. Horowitz said.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said what started off as a few irregularities into the Carter Page wiretap application became “a criminal conspiracy” to defraud the FISA court, illegally monitor an American citizen and open an investigation into a sitting president.

“What happened here is not a few irregularities, what happened here is the system failed,” the South Carolina Republican said. “People at the highest level of government took the law in their own hands.”

Mr. Graham also detailed documented evidence of animosity toward the president by those involved in the investigation, including a slew of anti-Trump texts from bureau officials and lovebirds Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.

“Trump’s time will come and go, but I hope we understand that what happened here can never happen again,” he said.

“Trump’s time will come and go, but I hope we understand that what happened here can never happen again,” he said in a nearly 40-minute opening statement.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, pointed to Mr. Horowitz’s conclusions that the Russia probe was justified and that he could not find documented evidence of anti-Trump bias among members of the investigative team.

“This is not a politically motivated investigation,” the California Democrat said. “There is no deep state.”

Mr. McConnell said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, wants to add to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff’s “sloppy work” by calling more witnesses than what the House chose to pursue.

“The House chose this road — it’s their duty to investigate,” Mr. McConnell said on the chamber floor.

The Kentucky Republican said the House failed to go to court to pursue “useful witnesses” and that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues didn’t want to wait for due process.

“They threatened to impeach the president if they had to go to court at all,” Mr. McConnell said, adding that the House’s articles of impeachment as they stand now appear “inadequate to prove what they want to allege.”

“So now the Senate Democratic leader apparently wants our chamber to do House Democrats’ homework for them,” Mr. McConnell said.

His remarks come after Mr. Schumer published a letter to the majority leader and held a press conference earlier this week, demanding live testimony from four key witnesses.

Mr. Schumer said he wants White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, his senior adviser Robert Blair, former National Security Adviser John R. Bolton and his associate deputy director Michael Duffey to give live testimony during the impeachment trial.

He said they all have direct knowledge about Mr. Trump’s decision making in regards to withholding aid to Ukraine.

“To conduct a trial without the facts is saying we are afraid. We have something to hide,” Mr. Schumer said.

The two leaders are expected to meet “soon” to agree to rules and procedures for the trial, which is expected to begin next month.

“The question is now whether Senator McConnell will allow a fair trial in the Senate,” House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff said. “A trial that should be fair to the president, yes, but should be fair also to the American people.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the next step for the House — naming impeachment managers — cannot occur until they know what the process will look like in the next chamber. It’s unclear how long Democrats will hold the articles in the House.

“We cannot name managers until we see what the process is on the Senate side. … So far, we haven’t seen anything that looks fair to us,” the California Democrat said.

A delay in sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate raises a host of questions.

The House has the power to impeach, but it takes a Senate trial to convict and remove a president from office.

SEE ALSO: Donald Trump impeached by House in party-line vote

It was unclear how, or even whether, a delay would pressure the Senate to adopt Democrat-friendly procedures for a trial.

The move also appeared to run afoul of the Constitution that Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, said she was protecting when pushing through the impeachment of Mr. Trump.

The Constitution says the Senate “shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.”

While House Democrats wouldn’t detail all of their criteria for how the Senate proceedings should unfold, Mrs. Pelosi said it’s not a fair process right now as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is coordinating and “in cahoots” with the White House.

Both President Trump and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer have called for an extended trial with witnesses called to testify, but Mr. McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Lindsey Graham prefer to have a streamlined process.

The comments from Mrs. Pelosi and her committee chairs came immediately after Democrats voted to impeach the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

“I could not be more proud or more inspired by the moral courage of House Democrats. We never asked one of them how they were going to vote. We never whipped this vote,” the speaker said.

925,925,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/25/obama-auto-bailout-strategy-running-fumes-ohio/,Right,"DAYTON, Ohio — The Obama campaign is counting on the auto-industry bailout to carry the president to a victory in Ohio, but it ultimately may hold little sway with voters across the state who are still out of work and struggling to stay solvent.

The bailout package undoubtedly saved thousands of jobs in places such as Lordstown, Toledo and elsewhere, but in Ohio as a whole, a weak economy and poor job prospects trump the car company rescue.

For voters like Rick and Jared Sargent, the bailout is of secondary importance, while prolonged periods of unemployment drove their decisions to support Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

Mr. Obama “has destroyed this country in the last year. His whole campaign slogan is ‘forward,’ but for the last four years my family has just gone backward,” said Jared Sargent, 21, of Dayton, just after he and his father cast early votes for Mr. Romney.

“I’ve been out of work. … I can’t find a job making more than $8 an hour,” he said. “I’m terrified. If this country keeps going the way it’s been going, I wouldn’t want to bring a kid into this world.”

Like many Ohioans, the Sargents felt the repercussions of the U.S. auto industry’s troubles four years ago, but saw none of the benefits of the bailout. Jared Sargent said his mother was laid off in 2009 from a manufacturing job related to the car industry, a job that was eliminated after General Motors Co. closed its massive facility in nearby Moraine.

Since then, she has struggled to find a job, while her husband, Rick, battles health problems and also remains unemployed.

“His record has shown what it’s shown,” Rick Sargent said of Mr. Obama, as he and Jared sat at a picnic table in downtown Dayton.

“These deficits have got me scared to death,” he said, speaking in hushed tones, while his son spoke of the family’s continued struggle to find work with a mixture of anger and sorrow.

Even the president’s supporters think the auto rescue will take his re-election effort only so far, and that the job market in parts of Ohio remains stagnant.

“I can’t say that [the auto bailout] did much around here. It may have been good for people in other parts of the country, but not so much here,” said Elay Lewis III, 38, of Dayton, a former GM employee who also lost his job after the Moraine plant was shuttered. He cast a vote for Mr. Obama on Wednesday morning, but said the economy has shown him little signs of improvement.

“I do whatever I can to pay the bills,” he said, detailing how he holds down temporary, part-time jobs as a security guard and freelance musician. “Compared to what I was making at GM, now I’m probably making one-third of that.”

Similar stories of hardship can be found throughout Ohio, but there are also many instances of jobs saved through the administration’s continuation of the auto bailout, which began during the Bush administration. An estimated 850,000 Ohio jobs are tied to the car industry, many of which likely would have disappeared if GM and Chrysler LLC went out of business for good.

The Obama camp has latched onto that narrative and continues to tout the auto rescue throughout the state, promoting it in commercials and during campaign stops. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, has done the same, positioning himself as a strong supporter of the bailout and therefore responsible for saving tens of thousands of Ohio jobs.

Both campaigns are focusing hard on Ohio as the state that could decide the election. All four men at the top of the two national tickets were in Ohio for at least part of the day, either Wednesday or Thursday.

Polling numbers in the past two weeks show the presidential race in Ohio exceedingly close. The Real Clear Politics poll average had Mr. Obama ahead by 2.1 percentage points — 47.9 percent to 45.8 percent. Although the momentum has been with Mr. Romney since late September, several surveys have shown Mr. Obama with a slight or statistically insignificant lead while none has done the same for the Republican hopeful.

However, a survey last week by the Democrat-leaning Public Policy Polling firm suggests that the auto bailout issue isn’t hurting Mr. Romney much. In the poll of 532 likely Ohio voters, the respondents said they trusted Mr. Romney more on the economy, by a margin of 51 percent to 47 percent. The survey had Mr. Obama maintaining an overall lead of 49 percent to 48 percent.

When asked in surveys, Ohio voters follow the rest of the nation in consistently naming the economy in general as the top issue. A CBS poll from late August, for example, cited 59 percent of Ohio voters as calling the economy “extremely important” in determining their vote, with only health care among other issues managing to top 45 percent.

Still, Mr. Obama has used the auto issue to disparage Mr. Romney, saying that if the Republican had gotten his way, the U.S. car industry would have crumbled.

“If we had taken your advice, Gov. Romney, about our auto industry, we’d be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China,” Mr. Obama said at Monday’s third and final presidential debate.

In making the charge, the Obama campaign typically cites a November 2008 op-ed in the New York Times headlined “Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.”

In it, Mr. Romney wrote that he favored a “managed bankruptcy” that would give Detroit a “path to the fundamental restructuring the industry needs.” This was more or less what eventually happened — GM and Chrysler did go bankrupt and restructured, albeit under government auspices. Contrary to what Mr. Obama has said, Mr. Romney never proposed the liquidation of GM or Chrysler.

Mr. Romney didn’t mention the auto rescue during a campaign stop in Cincinnati on Thursday, but his campaign continues to push back against the president. Mr. Romney’s Ohio campaign manager, Scott Jennings, pointed to Ohioans — like the Sargents and Mr. Lewis — who got the short end of the stick as a result of the bailout.

“The fact is Obama picked winners and losers inside this deal — and many Ohioans were on the losing end. Delphi retirees lost their pensions. Many dealerships closed. And now we hear Jeep is thinking of moving production from Toledo to China,” Mr. Jennings said. “Mitt Romney is a car guy, a son of Detroit. To argue he would do anything other than help support American automakers is just ridiculous.”

The two campaigns’ sparring over the bailout may be good action for political pundits, but the average Ohio voter is instead looking at the economy as a whole, and that is driving many of them to Mr. Romney.

Judy Gierl, a community volunteer from Cincinnati, said she voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and still agrees with him on many social issues, yet can’t support his re-election.

“I think he’s a great guy, but the economy is the most important issue to me, and I’ve been disappointed on the economy,” she said Thursday morning as she stood outside the Romney rally in Cincinnati.

945,945,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/4/iran-proved-vital-al-qaedas-safe-passage-lead-911-/,Right,"Iran “facilitated” the movement of al Qaeda terrorists through its country, including September 11, 2001 attackers and for years was a critical channel for money and arms, according to the 9-11 commission report and internal Osama bin Laden documents.

Experts say the late Qassem Soleimani surely knew of and directed the terror partnership since he has headed since 1998 Iran’s Quds Force. It is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization and an arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps which dominates Iranian society. On Jan. 3, Maj. Gen. Soleimani was killed in Baghdad by a U.S. drone missile attack on his car on orders of President Trump.

“There is strong evidence that Iran facilitated the transit of al Qaeda members into and out of Afghanistan before 9/11, and that some of these were future 9/11 hijackers,” said the commission, known formally as The National Commission on Terror Attacks Upon the United States.

Osama bin Laden called Iran “our main artery” for men and money.

Michael Rubin, a Middle East scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said none of this would have happened without Gen. Soleimani’s blessings.

“Qassem Soleimani was the second most powerful man in Iran after the Supreme Leader,” Mr. Rubin told The Washington Times. “He didn’t just run overseas operations and those involving Iranian relations with terror groups, he formulated and developed them. There was not a single operation of any significance which he did not approve if not oversee.”

“This extends backwards not only into Iran’s support for proxies in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, but also to its ties to Al Qaeda,” Mr. Rubin added.

“Simply put, the 9/11 hijackers never would have been able to train in Afghanistan had it not been for Soleimani’s support and Iranian free-passage. The same holds true for Iran’s subsequent safe-haven to senior Al Qaeda operatives in IRGC bases inside Iran.”

Al Quds creates and aligns with other terror groups in the region, training, financing and directing them as it is today in Iraq.

The 9-11 Commission’s 2004 report paid close attention to how bin Laden’s terrorists moved in and out of Afghanistan, its headquarters in an alliance with the now-ousted Taliban regime.

Its report said Iranian border officials were under orders not to stamp the visas of al Qaeda travelers.

One commission source was Tawfiq bin Attash (known as Khallad), who bombed the destroyer USS Cole in 2000.

“Khallad and other detainees have described the willingness of Iranian officials to facilitate the travel of al Qaeda members through Iran, on their way to and from Afghanistan,” the report said. “For example, Iranian border inspectors would be told not to place telltale stamps in the passports of these travelers. Such arrangements were particularly beneficial to Saudi members of al Qaeda.”

Two other commission sources were the jailed Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the 9-11 master player, and an associate, Ramzi bin al-Shibh.

“KSM and Binalshibh have confirmed that several of the 9/11 hijackers (at least eight, according to Binalshibh) transited Iran on their way to or from Afghanistan, taking advantage of the Iranian practice of not stamping Saudi passports.” the report says. “They deny any other reason for the hijackers’ travel to Iran.”

The report said that evidence didn’t show that Iran knew of the pending attack on the World Trade Center and targets in Washington. But it also called for the government to investigate this link further.

The commission also said that al Qaeda terrorists received training from Hezbollah, the Iran-created terror army in southern Lebanon which works closely with Gen. Soleimani.

There is more evidence of an Iran-al Qaeda working relationship. It is found in millions of pages of documents seized by Navy SEALs when they raided bin Laden’s Pakistan hideout and killed him in May 2011.

The papers show Iran was a vital safe passage for al Qaeda members to move in and out of the Pakistan-Afghanistan region, with many on their way to kill Americans in Iraq

Gen. Soleimani was particularly active in 2005-11, sending his Quds operatives into Iraq to train Shiite militia members, like the ones operating in Iraq today, on how to target and blow up U.S. troops. The U.S. says Gen. Soleimani was responsible for 603 American deaths and thousands wounded.

In a letter to Abu Ayyub al-Masri, leader of al Qaeda in Iraq in 2007, bin Laden warn him not to attack Iran for its assistance to Shia militia, some of whom fought Masri’s terrorists.

“You did not consult with us on that serious issue that affects the general welfare of all of us,” bin Laden wrote Masri, who had made public threats. “We expected you would consult with us for these important matters, for as you are aware, Iran is our main artery for funds, personnel, and communication, as well as the matter of hostages.”

Masri was killed in 2010 by U.S. troops. He was succeeded by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who fled to Syria and founded the brutal Islamic State terror army. Once U.S. troops left under orders of President Barack Obama, ISIS invaded Iraq, taking swaths of territory in northern and western Iraq.

Mr. Trump, who approved the strike on Gen. Soleimani, also OK’d the Army Delta Force raid in November that resulted in al-Baghdadi’s death by suicide bomb.

Iran helped al Qaeda in other ways. It provided a home for one of bin Laden’s sons, Saad and for Said al Adel, an al Qaeda military leader under indictment for the 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa.

The U.S. killed Saad in a 2009 air strike.

The picture adds up to two organs of terror, Shia Iran and Sunni al Qaeda, cooperating in their shared hatred of the Untied States.

“That supports the conclusion that bin Laden’s relations with Iran’s dictatorship were convoluted, a mix of cooperation, competition, distrust and opportunistic collusion,” James Phillips, a Heritage Foundation Middle East expert, said at the time bin Laden papers were released in 2016.

The grumbling in the ranks puts pressure on Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, who has stood by Mrs. Pelosi’s decision to withhold charges against the president in an attempt to get Senate Republicans to guarantee witnesses will be called during the trial.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell used the crack in the ranks Wednesday to call on Mr. Schumer to break Mrs. Pelosi’s impasse.

Mr. Schumer did not heed the call. Instead, he continued to stress the need for more witness testimony.

“The Senate is not a creature of the House,” Mr. McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said on the chamber floor. “Stand up for the Senate. Stand up for our institutions. Stand up for the country.”

An impeachment trial in the Senate cannot begin until the upper chamber receives the charges from the House, according to precedent.

Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, has kept the two articles since they were voted on Dec. 18, an unprecedented move that Republicans say runs afoul of the Constitution, which dictates that the Senate conduct impeachment trials.

Sen. Doug Jones, a vulnerable 2020 Democrat from the red state of Alabama, is one of the rank-and-file lawmakers ready to get the process started.

“I’m hoping they will come over here soon. I think most people are ready to get moving on this,” he told CNN.

Still, he said it’s important for a fair trial with witness testimony to be held in the Republican-controlled Senate, echoing Mr. Schumer’s demands.

Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, and Sen. Angus King, Maine independent, have all said they are ready to have Mrs. Pelosi transmit the articles, according to multiple reports.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters she does not see what good the delay does.

On the other side of the Capitol, House Democrats stood firm behind Mrs. Pelosi, including a few members from swing districts in Trump-won districts such as Rep. Andy Kim, New Jersey Democrat, who said he hasn’t heard anything from his constituents about impeachment.

“I’ve just been 100 percent focused on the Middle East crisis,” he said. “I’m not thinking about that process at all right now.”

Mrs. Pelosi was in a meeting about impeachment Tuesday night when Iran launched misiles at U.S. military bases in Iraq, shifting House Democrats’ focus.

Meanwhile, Rep. Jamie Raskin, Maryland Democrat, disagreed with the handful of his Senate colleagues who wanted to move on with the process.

“We are behind the speaker and we think she will have the best sense of when the Senate will stop their threats of nullifying the whole process,” he said.

House Democrats impeached Mr. Trump in a party-line vote Dec. 18, and after returning to the Capitol Tuesday after a two-week holiday break, Mrs. Pelosi has remained publicly mum on the subject.

The president was impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, charges that stem from Mr. Trump’s July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president in which he requested a probe into a political rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.

Mr. Schumer had wanted assurances that more witnesses and evidence would be available during the Senate trial. He expressed hope that at least four moderate Republican senators would join his request, giving Democrats the 51 votes needed to prevail in a floor vote.

He particularly wants former national security adviser John Bolton and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to testify.

But Senate Republicans have remained united behind Mr. McConnell’s demand for a trial process that would mirror the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.

The 1999 process would leave the decision on calling additional witnesses until after House Democrats’ impeachment managers and the president’s legal team present their cases.

“What was good enough for President Clinton is good enough for President Trump,” Mr. McConnell said this week.

The GOP unity has given Mr. McConnell the upper hand in negotiations as Democrats appear to be backing off their pre-trial demands.

But House Democrats argue the Clinton impeachment precedent is different because it stemmed from a more than year-long special counsel probe.

“The entire context is so dramatically different,” Rep. Dan Kildee, Michigan Democrat, said Tuesday. “The Ken Starr investigation, all the work leading up to the impeachment of Clinton, was so dramatically different that there’s not really apples-to-apples comparison. The fact is in front of us right now we have witnesses that have information that is relevant to the determination that the Senate is going to have to make.”

1022,1022,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/13/inside-the-beltway-divided-democrats-drama-in-des-/,Right,"NEWS AND OPINION:

The first Democratic presidential debate of 2020 is in Des Moines on Tuesday night, less than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses. Gone is the big crowd of 20 cheerful hopefuls who gathered on a glittering stage in Miami over two nights for the very first Democratic debate seven months ago, strutting their stuff and shaking hands before a mesmerized media.

The debate would be “the largest gathering of liberals since Woodstock,” predicted Ross Baker, a distinguished political science professor at Rutgers University — and he was right.

But time marches on, competition is keen. This time around, there’s a slim cast of just six hopefuls at the CNN-hosted event: Sens. Bernard Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar; former Vice President Joseph R. Biden; Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana; and billionaire Tom Steyer. Things may not be so cordial. Reality has set in.

“The narratives have been morphing over the past few days as the rift grows between Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Both candidates seem to have realized that there’s a chance they could split the progressive vote and hand a victory to Joe Biden if they can’t consolidate a solid base,” writes Nate Ashworth, editor of Election Central.

“Tuesday debate is a battle for heads, not hearts,” declares The Washington Post.

“Tight polls, impeachment, billionaire wild cards: Uncertainty reigns in run up to Tuesday’s Democratic debate,” advises The Los Angeles Times.

In other words, the election is now underway. For real. The Democratic hopefuls are foes and rivals now, not friends.

GOOD GUY WITH A GUN

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has presented the Governor’s Medal of Courage — the Lone Star State’s highest civilian award — to Jack Wilson.

The former reserve deputy sheriff took out a shooter who opened fire in a Fort Worth church in late December, felling the gunman with a single round within six seconds after the shooting began. The congregation numbered 240 people; two members of the church were killed. Mr. Wilson, 71, heads up the church’s volunteer security squad.

“I had a clear shot and I took the shot, and the shooter went down. I don’t see myself as a hero. I see myself as doing what needed to be done to take out the evil threat,” Mr. Wilson told reporters in the aftermath.

FIRST AMENDMENT IN MILWAUKEE

President Trump will stage yet another splendid rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday, one in a long sequence of campaign rallies that make up his successful voter outreach. But there’s always drama afoot, and the Milwaukee rally is no exception.

This rally takes place in the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena, a detail which caused so much consternation among students that chancellor Mark Mone had to explain that the campus had naming rights for the venue — but neither owns the site nor controls who appears there. Young critics had deemed the Trump gathering a “hate” rally.

“I have frequently spoken about our unwavering commitment to your safety, inclusivity, equity and respect. We are proud that we educate the most diverse population of any campus in the state with more under-represented minority students and veterans than any other Wisconsin campus. Our campus community is further enriched by our first-generation, LGBT, and non-traditional students. Diversity is further enhanced by critical conversations that can help others see life through their fellow human beings’ lens,” Mr. Mone wrote in a letter to students and faculty.

“Our diversity is also vital in creating an environment that welcomes and encourages the open exchange of ideas and civil, intellectual challenge. This free expression will at times be logical and at other times, highly emotional. Most of us cherish the right to say what’s on our minds. At the same time, each of us is — and will continue to be — confronted with hostile speech and words that challenge our sense of morality and justice. This type of speech is also a right and is protected by the First Amendment,” Mr. Mone advised.

TRUMP COVERAGE 93% NEGATIVE

It is a tradition that continues: Almost all the broadcast coverage about President Trump has been negative in recent months.

“In the first 100 days since House Democrats began their impeachment push on September 24, ABC, CBS and NBC have aggressively aided the effort. A Media Research Center analysis finds the Big Three evening newscasts have battered the President with 93% negative coverage and promoted impeachment at the expense of nearly all other Trump news,” write Rich Noyes and Bill D’Agostino, who evaluated 1,053 comments about Mr. Trump which aired on the networks from Sept. 24 to Jan. 1.

“The broadcast networks donated at least 124 hours of wall-to-wall live coverage as they pre-empted regular programming in favor of House Democrat-led impeachment activities,” the analysts said.

Three-fourths of the coverage was devoted to impeachment, which earned 849 minutes of airtime — compared to the fight against ISIS, which got 78 minutes, North Korea (19 minutes), immigration (17 minutes) and the economy (9 minutes). Democratic candidates were also compromised, Mr. Trump drew a total of 1,143 minutes, Joseph R. Biden got 107 minutes, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernard Sanders got 24 minutes each, and Pete Buttigieg had 8 minutes.

“While most citizens would want their media to be even-handed in their coverage of candidates, the networks seem poised to be as lopsidedly negative in their coverage of Trump’s 2020 campaign as they have been in their coverage of his presidency,” the analysts concluded.

1030,1030,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/nov/6/election-2012-romney-takes-early-lead-kentucky-win/,Right,"President Obama won re-election to the White House on Tuesday night, holding together enough of his hope-and-change coalition to repeat his historic 2008 election and surviving a sluggish economy and a fractured electorate that desired a change but failed to find Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney a credible alternative.

His renewed lease on the White House gives him a chance to see his health care law take full effect in 2014, another opportunity to push for the tax increases he declared to be part of his campaign mandate, and pressure to deliver on his promise of immigration reform.

“Tonight in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come,” a ebullient president said at his victory rally in Chicago as the clock neared 2 a.m. on the East Coast.

Mr. Obama painted his re-election as the latest chapter in America’s 200-year-old quest “of perfecting our union” and vowed to turn his attention to trying to forge bipartisan compromises on immigration, energy and the deficit.

“Whether I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you, I have learned from you, and you made me a better president,” he said. “And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever.”

He and Mr. Romney combined to spend about $2 billion in their fight for the White House, essentially killing the public campaign financing system. That figure doesn’t include the hundreds of millions spent by congressional candidates or outside groups.

The presidential race was called about 11:15 EST, just minutes after West Coast states closed their polls and after Ohio was called for Mr. Obama, eliminating Mr. Romney’s path to victory.

Still, Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden enter their second terms somewhat wounded. Mr. Obama becomes only the second president in history to win a second term with fewer Electoral College votes than his first win — meaning he returns to the White House with a limited mandate.

He also will be facing a divided Congress, where Republicans kept control of the House and Democrats maintained their majority in the Senate.

House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, said the split results meant voters backed the GOP’s vision.

“We offered solutions, and the American people want solutions, and tonight they responded by renewing our Republican House majority,” Mr. Boehner said at a victory party.

He also took aim at Mr. Obama’s claim that his re-election would clear the path for tax increases on the wealthy, with the speaker saying flatly “there’s no mandate for raising taxes.”

But with Democrats on the brink of not only holding the Senate but possibly expanding their majority, Mr. Boehner and his GOP troops remain isolated.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, urged the GOP to work with him.

“Now that the election is over, it’s time to put politics aside and work together to find solutions,” Mr. Reid said. “The strategy of obstruction, gridlock and delay was soundly rejected by the American people. Now, they are looking to us for solutions.”

But voters, in returning a Democrat to the White House, Democrats to a majority in the Senate and Republicans to control of the House, appeared to be asking for a do-over after two years of gridlock in the least productive Congress since records began to be kept after World War II.

Mr. Obama eked out his popular-vote victory with a late-campaign surge that appeared powered in part by his response to Hurricane Sandy, which polls showed appeared to sway some late support his way. The storm also pushed both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney off the campaign trail for several days last week, potentially undercutting the Republican’s momentum.

Mr. Romney conceded the race just before 1 a.m. Wednesday morning to several thousand people at the Boston Convention Center.

He said that he called President Obama to congratulate him on his victory and wished him good luck going forward.

“I wish all of them well, but particularly the president, the first lady and their daughters,” Mr. Romney said. “This is a time of great challenges for America, and I pray the president be successful in guiding our nation.”

Mr. Obama won by taking advantage of what amounted to a never-ending campaign that picked up right after he won office in 2008.

That meant he took a phenomenal “ground game” of volunteers and local campaign offices into Tuesday’s election, and it appeared to pay off across the country, where he kept states such as North Carolina and Virginia close, and easily outdistanced Mr. Romney in states such as Pennsylvania, denying the Republican a chance to expand the playing field.

“Mitt Romney has done a better job with their ground game than [Republican nominee John] McCain did in ‘08, but they’ve generally given very short shrift to their ground game, really focusing on their ground game only in the last few weeks,” said Democratic National Committee spokesman Brad Woodhouse. “We’ve had a very strong ground game since 2007, and I think that’s bearing fruit tonight.”

In Congress, voters again opted for division.

That Senate result marks a major win for Democrats and a huge disappointment for Republicans, who earlier this year had eyed as many as a half-dozen pickups which would have given them a majority.

The divided Congress is likely to make life difficult for all sides.

“It’s going to be complicated under any scenario,” said Darrell M. West, a political analyst at the Brookings Institution. “Neither side is going to want to do things that’s going to help the other.”

In the nation’s statehouses, the GOP said it netted at least one governorship, giving them 30 of the country’s 50 chief executives.

Exit polls showed about 60 percent of voters rated the economy as the top issue, though only about 40 percent said they saw progress on that front.

The exit polls also showed voters still blamed President George W. Bush more than Mr. Obama for the continued economic troubles.

Mr. Obama, 51, a former U.S. senator who makes his home in Chicago, made history in 2008 by becoming the first black man to win the White House. His inauguration drew a giant crowd, and he took office amid hope that he could unite a fractured country after President Bush and right an economy reeling from the Wall Street collapse just months before his election.

He had major legislative accomplishments during his first two years: With huge majorities in Congress, Democrats passed the economic stimulus, new financial market regulations and the health care reform that has become Mr. Obama’s signature achievement.

But a voter backlash in 2010, which Mr. Obama deemed a “shellacking,” gave the GOP control of the House, curbed Democrats’ majority in the Senate and left conservatives pushing for deep spending cuts to try to contain the red ink that spilled across government balance sheets.

The country ran trillion-dollar deficits all four years Mr. Obama was in office, and the overall national debt topped $16 trillion.

Amid that playing field, Mr. Romney, 65, a former one-term governor of Massachusetts who made his personal fortune at the helm of Bain Capital, vowed to bring bipartisanship and a businessman’s can-do know-how to Washington.

He also promised big ideas, including an overhaul of Medicare and Medicaid to try to cap the rising costs of entitlements, which threaten to crowd out all other federal spending in coming decades.

Mr. Romney underscored his commitment by picking as his running mate Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, whose budget plans have deeply divided Congress over the past two years.

But Mr. Ryan at least was able to say that his fellow Republicans in the House passed a budget.

Not so for the Senate, where Democrats have failed for three straight years to pass a blueprint for spending.

Passing a budget is just one of the challenges awaiting the election victors.

The next Congress will be sworn in on Jan. 3, and Mr. Obama retakes the oath of office Jan. 20.

The government is poised to run another trillion-dollar deficit in 2013, and the gross federal debt has topped $16 trillion. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high, but Washington has left few tools untried in its push to spur job creation.

Some work won’t even wait for the new year, however.

Congress returns next week for a lame-duck session to grapple with the Bush-era tax cuts, which expire Jan. 1, and/or the $110 billion in automatic spending cuts, which are due to take effect Jan. 2.

With the election so narrowly decided, the winner was unlikely to carry much of a mandate into the next term. Combined with a split Congress, that meant there was little chance of easy answers to the items stacked up on the agenda.

1039,1039,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/13/senate-republicans-reject-impeachment-articles-dis/,Right,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans signaled they would reject the idea of simply voting to dismiss the articles of impeachment against President Trump as the House prepares to send the charges to the chamber for the historic trial.

“I think our members, generally are not interested in the motion to dismiss. They think both sides need to be heard,” Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who is part of GOP leadership, said Monday.

It will be only the third presidential impeachment trial in American history, a serious and dramatic endeavor coming amid the backdrop of a politically divided nation and the start of an election year.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not set the timing for the House vote that will launch the Senate action. Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House last month on charges of abuse of power over pushing Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden and obstruction of Congress in the probe. Democrats said the vote could be Wednesday.

With the impeachment trial starting in a matter of days, senators are still debating the rules of the proceedings. GOP senators are conferring privately about whether to allow a motion to dismiss the charges against the president or to call additional witnesses for testimony.

Trump suggested over the weekend he might prefer simply dismissing the charges rather than giving legitimacy to charges from the House, which he considers a “hoax.”

It was an extraordinary suggestion, but one being proposed by Trump allies with support from some GOP senators, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

But it is clear McConnell does not have the votes needed from his GOP majority to do that.

One key Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said she, too, would oppose a motion to dismiss the charges.

Collins is leading an effort among some Republicans, including Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, to ensure the ground rules include plans to eventually consider voting to call witnesses.

“My position is that there should be a vote on whether or not witnesses should be called,” Collins said.

Romney said he wants to hear from John Bolton, the former national security adviser at the White House, who others have said raised alarms about the alternative foreign policy toward Ukraine being run led by Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.

“I’ve said I’d like to hear from John Bolton,” Romney told reporters Monday. “I expect that barring some kind of surprise, I’ll be voting in favor of hearing from witnesses after those opening arguments.”

Democrats have been pushing Republicans, who have the majority in the Senate, to consider new testimony, arguing that fresh information has emerged during Pelosi’s monthlong delay in transmitting the charges.

McConnell is drafting an organizing resolution that will outline the steps ahead. Approving it will be among the first votes senators take after they are sworn as jurors by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts for the Court of Impeachment.

Republicans control the chamber, 53-47, and are all but certain to acquit Trump. McConnell is hesitant to call new witnesses who would prolong the trial. He prefers to model Trump’s trial partly on the process used for then-President Bill Clinton’s trial in 1999.

It takes just 51 votes during the impeachment trial to approve rules or call witnesses. Just four GOP senators could form a majority with Democrats to insist on new testimony. It also would take only 51 senators to vote to dismiss the charges against Trump.

Most Republicans appear willing to go along with McConnell’s plan to start the trial first then consider witnesses later, rather than upfront, as Democrats want.

Collins is pushing to have at least the promise of witness votes included in the organizing resolution. She and the others appear to be gathering support.

“I’ve been working to make sure that we will have a process that we can take a vote on whether or not we need additional information, and yes, that would include witnesses,” Murkowski told reporters.

McConnell is expected to huddle privately with senators at their weekly lunch Tuesday.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters the House vote might come Wednesday. “Could be,” he said.

1049,1049,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/nov/7/fiscal-cliff-nudges-deal-making-talk/,Right,"House Speaker John A. Boehner offered the first olive branch Wednesday in what is expected to be a frenetic spate of postelection deal-making to avert the looming “fiscal cliff,” saying the GOP will let the government collect more tax revenue if President Obama will drop his plan to raise tax rates on the wealthy.

Voters on Tuesday re-elected Mr. Obama and expanded Democrats’ majority in the Senate, while keeping Republicans in charge of the House — albeit with fewer numbers.

With the needle tilting slightly but decidedly toward Democrats, Mr. Boehner’s overture sets the stage for the lame-duck session of Congress, which begins next week, and for the full 113th Congress, which opens in January.

“By working together and creating a fairer, simpler, cleaner tax code, we can give our country a stronger, healthier economy. A stronger economy means more revenue, which is what the president seeks,” the Republican speaker said.

A day after the election, leaders on all sides said the message they took from voters was that Congress and the White House must work together to find a solution to the tax increases and automatic spending cuts that are looming in early January.

“I know how to fight. I know how to dance. I don’t dance as well as I fight, but I’d much rather dance anytime,” said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat who said he approached negotiations with an open mind and wouldn’t draw any lines in the sand.

Still, the outlines of stalemate were emerging.

Mr. Reid said he read Tuesday’s election as a mandate for raising taxes on the wealthy — something Mr. Obama ran on as a centerpiece of his campaign.

“Look at all the polling. The vast majority of the American people — rich, poor — everybody agrees that the rich — richest of the rich — have to help a little bit,” Mr. Reid said.

Mr. Boehner, though, said Republicans in the House won’t accept increases in tax rates. His own proposal relies on cutting out tax loopholes, which would bring in more revenue, then using that money to lower income tax rates for everyone. He argues that the resulting tax code would be better for economic growth, which he said would produce more money for the federal government in the long run.

Missing from the public conversation Wednesday was Mr. Obama, who is once again the key player in negotiations. He placed private calls to Mr. Reid and Mr. Boehner, as well as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, in which he pleaded for a “balanced” approach to cutting the deficit.

But Mr. Obama did not make any public statements, instead leaving Vice President Joseph R. Biden to talk with reporters.

“On the issue of the tax issue, there was a clear, a clear sort of mandate about people coming much closer to our view about how to deal with tax policy,” he said, adding that he expects “some real soul searching” on the part of Republicans to decide where they are willing to cooperate.

Part of the problem is that the tools for cutting big deals in Congress have calcified in recent years, and would need to be restored. The Senate hasn’t passed a budget in three years, and House Republicans this year have run into trouble in trying to pass big legislation such as the farm bill. Each side seems to have concluded that dealing with the other is tantamount to political death.

Mr. Biden said one way to do “a little confidence building” between the two sides was to tackle something easier. He said that could come on corporate tax rates, which all sides agree are too high and riddled with exceptions.

But the bigger problems loom with the “fiscal cliff.”

Unless Congress takes action, the George W. Bush-era tax cuts are slated to expire Jan. 1, and a day later $110 billion in automatic spending cuts — the result of last year’s debt deal — also will take effect.

Together, they would plunge the U.S. into a short but deep double-dip recession — though they also would leave the federal budget in much better shape and would produce a stronger economy by the end of the decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Both sides in Congress, though, say the tax increases and spending cuts are simply too much to stomach right now.

Democrats on Tuesday expanded their majority to at least 54-45 in the Senate, with one senator, Maine independent Angus King, not saying with which party he will caucus. In the House, the Republican majority dropped, though 10 seats were still to be decided as of Wednesday evening.

In the race for the White House, Mr. Obama’s 2008 margins dropped in the popular vote and the Electoral College — and Florida was still too close to call Wednesday. But even without Florida, Mr. Obama has won another four years in office to try to fulfill his election promises.

Mr. Boehner said any deal with Mr. Obama must have the White House agree to lower spending on entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which take up an ever-increasing share of government spending.

Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, which sponsors an influential no-new-taxes pledge to which many Republicans are beholden, said the revenue deal Mr. Boehner is offering passes muster.

“I heard the speaker say again and again, let’s not raise taxes, let’s have economic growth,” Mr. Norquist told The Washington Times. He said raising growth to 4 percent a year, up from the 2 percent that he said Mr. Obama has struggled to hit, would mean an additional $5 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years.

He said that comes without raising tax rates, but still would give Mr. Obama solid revenue numbers to point to — though it’s unlikely the CBO, which keeps official score of legislation, would calculate it that way.

“We’re trying to get the president to actually put something down in writing and to engage in governing So let’s take it a step at a time. This is new to him,” Mr. Norquist said.

Mr. Obama ran for re-election on a call to raise income tax rates on Americans with the highest incomes, while holding rates low for everyone else. Republicans, though, said raising taxes on the wealthy amounted to a tax increase on small businesses.

Mr. Boehner pointed back to discussions he had with Mr. Obama last year, during the height of the debt showdown, when he said they talked about a deal that would lower tax rates but close enough loopholes to bring in more money into federal accounts.

1058,1058,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/22/senate-adopts-rules-impeachment-trial-ends-13-hour/,Right,"The Senate early Wednesday approved rules for the impeachment trial of President Trump, wrapping up a marathon session that marked the first day of arguments in the historic proceedings.

The GOP-proposed rules package passed in a party-line vote, 53-47. The same tally that decided nearly every Democratic challenge to the rules in the 13 hours of arguments that lasted until nearly 2 a.m.

The back-and-forth at trial over calling witnesses followed weeks of Democrats demanding more evidence for the upper chamber’s hearing. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held on to the two articles of impeachment — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress — for about a month in an attempt to influence the process.

Democrats failed in each attempt to require more administration documents and administration witness at the trail, where senators are the jury that decides the House impeachment case.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and his Republican conference were united about following the same procedures used for President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999, which put off votes on witnesses until later.

Back then, the Senate unanimously agreed to the rules for Mr. Clinton.

Mr. McConnell unexpectedly bowed to criticism of his proposal to give each side 24 hours over two days to make their case. That timeline could have extended each trial day until 1 a.m. and prompted critics to label the majority leader “Midnight Mitch.”

The rules resolution adopted gives each side 24 hours over three days, the same timeline used in Mr. Clinton’s trial.

Mr. McConnell’s office said the change was made after discussions with his GOP members.

Following the 48 hours of arguments, the rules give senators 16 hours to submit questions.

The issue of witnesses or other new evidence would follow the questions. It would take 51 senators to call a witness.

Republicans currently hold 53 seats in the upper chamber. The Democratic caucus controls 47.

1088,1088,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/nov/23/joe-biden-picks-alejandro-mayorkas-architect-daca-/,Right,"Presumed President-elect Joseph R. Biden said Monday he wants Alejandro Mayorkas to lead the Homeland Security Department, tapping an Obama-era mainstay who helped create the DACA program that protected “Dreamers,” but was also part of the team that expanded family detention.

Mr. Mayorkas, born in Cuba, would be the first Hispanic person and first immigrant to head the department, created in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

He brings extensive experience at DHS, having served as chief at the legal-immigration agency and then deputy secretary for the entire department.

But his more than seven years in office also saw their share of controversy, with an inspector general finding he delivered favors in granting immigration visas at the request of high-powered Democrats. That’s likely to draw attention from Republicans.

He also was deputy secretary, under Secretary Jeh Johnson, when the department grappled with the first surge of migrant children and families in 2014 and 2015. The department dramatically expanded family detention — from 100 beds to 3,000 — and built the chain-link fence pens, now derided as “cages,” used to hold immigrants who were in the country illegally at the border.

Mr. Mayorkas was part of Mr. Biden’s first list of nominations, which also included Antony Blinken as secretary of state, Linda Thomas-Greenfield as ambassador to the U.N. and Avril Haines as director of national intelligence.

Mr. Biden said he expects Mr. Mayorkas to be able to straddle both the humanitarian and security sides of the job at Homeland Security.

“He will play a critical role in fixing our broken immigration system and understands that living up to our values and protecting our nation’s security aren’t mutually exclusive — and under his leadership, they’ll go hand-in-hand,” Mr. Biden said.

At least so far, he doesn’t have to worry about any pushback from his left flank.

Despite aiming fierce criticism at the Obama administration for its actions in 2014 and 2015, immigration activists said they’re eager to see Mr. Mayorkas win the job.

“The nomination of Mayorkas represents a bold and inspired pick,” said Gustavo Torres, executive director of CASA, a major Hispanic-rights group in the Washington region.

Foremost, activists expect him to revive the full Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that is protecting hundreds of thousands of “Dreamers” from deportation. “Dreamers” are immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children. President Trump has spent three years trying to end the program, but that has been stalled by the courts.

Mr. Mayorkas was head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2012 when DACA was created, and he oversaw the implementation that not only allowed for deportation protections and work permits, but also allowed an indirect pathway to citizenship for thousands of DACA recipients through a policy known as advance parole.

Chris Newman, general counsel at the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said his group was one of the toughest critics of the Obama administration, but he said Mr. Mayorkas was “quite good” on DACA and also on working with sanctuary cities.

Late in the Obama years, as sanctuary policies expanded, Homeland Security sought to reach accommodations with them to share some data. Mr. Mayorkas met with officials across the country and, Mr. Newman said, he was willing to strike deals that protected many lower-level offenders.

“He was accommodating of the local jurisdictions that were the engines of revolt against the Obama deportation policy,” Mr. Newman said.

Mr. Mayorkas was U.S. attorney in Los Angeles in the latter Clinton years, then won unanimous confirmation to lead USCIS in 2009 under President Obama.

Those good feelings had eroded by 2013, when he was up for the job of deputy secretary, winning confirmation on a 54-41 vote. He likely would have been blocked had Democrats not triggered the nuclear option a month earlier and defanged the filibuster as a tool for obstructing presidential nominees.

Republicans opposed Mr. Mayorkas because of an ongoing investigation into his oversight of a key visa program for wealthy investors during his time at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the matter — now concluded — is certain to come up in his confirmation hearings.

“I’m surprised that Biden would select Mayorkas, since his nomination will inevitably raise anew the questions about how he used his position as USCIS director under Obama to do favors for Harry Reid and Terry McAuliffe,” said Rosemary Jenks, vice president at NumbersUSA, which argues for stricter immigration limits. “I’m equally surprised that Mayorkas would want to face those questions in a Senate confirmation process.”

Mr. Mayorkas was accused of stepping in to aid several high-powered Democrats, including Mr. Reid, then majority leader in the Democrat-led Senate, and Mr. McAuliffe, former Democratic National Committee chairman and Virginia governor.

Both had asked him to intervene to help in clearing visas for some of their associates under the EB-5 program, a scandal-plagued visa that allows wealthy foreigners to buy a pathway to citizenship as long as they invest hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The Homeland Security inspector general in 2015 released a report dinging Mr. Mayorkas for going “outside of the normal adjudicatory process” to intervene in those cases “in ways that benefited the stakeholders.”

“Mr. Mayorkas’ conduct led many USCIS employees to reasonably believe that specific individuals or groups were being given special access or consideration in the EB-5 program,” the inspector general said.

He said “an extraordinary number” of employees had flagged the behavior.

Mr. Mayorkas vehemently rebutted the charges, saying he got involved in the three cases because the system was breaking down, not because he was trying to aid important Democrats.

He said the employees who complained didn’t have the “complete context” of the situation and he was trying to get to “the right result” in the cases where he intervened. He said he was asked to step in by other employees, members of Congress and stakeholders.

Mr. Johnson, the department secretary and Mr. Mayorkas’s boss, said his deputy broke trust with USCIS employees, but rejected calls to discipline Mr. Mayorkas at the time, saying he was too valuable to suspend.

1097,1097,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/feb/11/obamas-state-union-highlight-plusses-progressive-p/,Right,"Progressive policies are great: That’s the gist of what President Obama will suggest during Tuesday’s State of the Union speech, according to various leaks, analyses and outright guesses.

The focus on a “course correction” and return to a focus on progressivism, as The Daily Caller describes it, comes amid a long-term economic lag that is being answered by Democrats and the White House with a call for more tax increases. By comparison, Mr. Obama highlighted in his last major speech — January’s inaugural address — on social policy and equal rights for gays.

Meanwhile, the White House said Sunday the president is due for more campaign-type activities, starting with a Wednesday kickoff on a public relations push on “strengthening the economy for the middle class and those striving to get there,” The Daily Caller reports.

NBC reports similarly. Mr. Obama’s speech is going to be more of the same of the past four years and promise boosts in jobs and the economy — but with a ramped-up progressive tone that targets the middle class.

1107,1107,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/nov/30/arizona-certifies-biden-winner-over-trump-teams-ob/,Right,"Arizona and Wisconsin certified presumptive President-elect Joseph R. Biden as winning those states Monday, even as President Trump’s attorneys urged Republican state legislators to override Mr. Biden’s victory and choose presidential electors for Mr. Trump.

In Georgia, state officials announced a limited investigation into allegations of voter fraud, although they said it was unlikely to overturn Mr. Biden’s win there.

Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, certified that Mr. Biden won the state by 0.3 percentage points, or 10,457 votes. She also certified that Democrat Mark Kelly defeated Republican Sen. Martha McSally. Mr. Kelly will be sworn in Wednesday to serve the final two years of the six-year term of the late Sen. John McCain, a Republican who died in 2018.

The certification process was overseen by three Republicans: Gov. Doug Ducey, Attorney General Mark Brnovich and state Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert Brutinel.

The certification triggers the appointment of Arizona’s electors, who will cast 11 Electoral College votes for Mr. Biden on Dec. 14, unless a court steps in.

Mr. Trump took to Twitter to accuse Mr. Ducey of “rushing” to certify the result.

“Why is he rushing to put a Democrat in office, especially when so many horrible things concerning voter fraud are being revealed at the hearing going on right now,” the president tweeted. He warned that “Republicans will long remember.”

Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani told Republican legislators at a hearing in Phoenix on Monday that the state Legislature must overturn the election results because of suspected fraud in mail-in ballots.

“This is probably the wrong tactic, but we’re down near the end,” Mr. Giuliani told the legislators in a hotel ballroom. “I’m going to ask you to implore other members of the Legislature to stand up to this. Do not be bullied. Do not be frightened.”

Mr. Trump also phoned in during the hearing and thanked witnesses for coming forward to detail election irregularities they witnessed in the battleground state.

He also took another jab at Mr. Ducey for certifying the results instead of waiting for the president’s attorneys to present their witnesses. The hearing lasted more than seven hours.

“What is that all about with Ducey? He couldn’t go fast enough,” the president said during his phone call.

Mr. Giuliani argued that the Legislature, which is controlled by Republicans, has the power to choose presidential electors regardless of popular vote totals.

“You can take it back,” he said. “Every dishonest vote disenfranchises the decent people who cast an honest vote. Have the courage to do that.”

Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis also urged the legislators to choose the presidential electors for Mr. Trump, who won the state in 2016. She said it is not a case of overturning the popular vote, but of making sure “the corruption does not stand.”

“We are going to ask you as legislators to reclaim that authority,” she said.

Outside the hearing room, Trump supporters held a “Stop the Steal” rally. One speaker vowed that they would support primary opponents in 2022 and 2024 against any Republican elected official who doesn’t stand with Mr. Trump now.

“These rallies are the American people rising up,” said conservative speaker Nick Fuentes.

State Rep. Mark Finchem, Oro Valley Republican, said he called the hearing as an “objective forum” to assess any evidence of election irregularities.

“We are caught between the desire to trust the process and the suspicion that it has failed the people of Arizona,” Mr. Finchem said.

“We’ve asked for an audit,” Mr. Finchem said on PSCP.tv during a break in the hearing. “We’re going to take whatever remedies we can ferret out.”

He said the group of Republican legislators will propose a resolution to the full Legislature within two days but couldn’t say what action they will seek.

Republican state Sen.-elect Nancy Barto, currently a state House member, said the hearing was needed because “there’s a lack of confidence in our election system. We need to restore confidence.”

State Senate Majority Whip Sonny Borrelli said of the event, “We are here for clarity and transparency.”

The hearing, which did not involve a committee of the Legislature and lacked subpoena power, was livestreamed on the internet but was not aired by major cable news networks. The president tweeted while the hearing was underway, “Why isn’t @FoxNews covering the Arizona hearings?”

Mr. Trump has been urging his followers on social media to boycott the network ever since it declared Mr. Biden the winner of Arizona on Nov. 3.

Mr. Giuliani questioned witnesses, including retired Army Col. Phil Waldron, a specialist on information warfare, who said voting machines made by Dominion Voting Systems are vulnerable to manipulation.

“Your vote is not as secure as your Venmo account,” Mr. Waldron said.

But Mr. Giuliani noted that he hasn’t been able to show fraud in Arizona’s voting machines because the Trump team hasn’t been able to conduct what Mr. Waldron called a “forensic audit.”

Mr. Waldron also cited an anonymous email to the Justice Department alleging that 35,000 fraudulent votes were added to each Democratic candidate on the ballot in Pima County. He said he was unable to identify the sender of the email.

“We hoped this individual would come forward and issue this as an affidavit,” he said.

Mr. Giuliani said the presidential election “was the subject of a conspiracy that goes back before the election … hatched by the crooked leaders of the Democratic Party” to exploit the increasing use of mail-in ballots.

“The very, very top of the Democratic Party has been corrupted since [Bill] Clinton,” Mr. Giuliani said. “[Mr. Trump] threatens them with destroying the corrupt system they have been enjoying in Washington since Bill Clinton got there.”

Several legislators expressed concern that as many as 36,000 illegal immigrants could have voted in the election in Arizona despite being ineligible.

The Trump legal team held a similar hearing before Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania last week with witness testimony, including from Mr. Waldron, who estimated that 1.2 million votes were altered in that swing state.

Sidney Powell, who is not on the president’s legal team but is filing pro-Trump lawsuits, sued officials in Michigan and Georgia alleging Dominion Voting Systems software switched tens of thousands of votes for Mr. Trump to Mr. Biden.

A hearing in the Georgia lawsuit has been scheduled for Friday.

White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, referring to the president’s numerous challenges to the election, said Monday in a post on Twitter, “74,000,000 Americans stood with @realdonaldtrump in this election and he will not forget them. We are fighting to the end. Count every LEGAL vote and stand up to corruption!”

Dominion is not listed as a defendant in the cases, but the company has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or that its machines were manipulated in the election.

“Sidney Powell’s wild and reckless allegations are not only demonstrably false, they have led to stalking, harassment, and death threats to Dominion employees,” the company said in statement. “This criminal activity has been duly reported to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, and we intend to hold Ms. Powell, and those aiding and abetting her fraudulent actions, accountable for any harm that may occur as a result.”

Four weeks after the election, Mr. Trump appears far from his goal of reversing the projected outcome.

The most likely path to victory for Mr. Trump would have been through Pennsylvania. If somehow he still prevailed there, he would also need to reverse projected losses in at least two other states to reach the 270 electoral votes required to win the White House.

The campaign fought to make up ground in Wisconsin, with a recount in two of the state’s largest counties, but that recount wrapped up Sunday without flipping the results and Mr. Biden ended up netting a few dozen more votes.

Ms. Ellis said the recount, though, revealed issues with absentee ballots.

“The recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties have revealed serious issues regarding the legality of ballots cast. As we have said from the very beginning, we want every legal vote, and only legal votes, to be counted, and we will continue to uphold our promise to the American people to fight for a free and fair election,” she said.

Wisconsin certified its results Monday evening with a Biden win by about 20,700 votes.

Mr. Trump plans to file a lawsuit over that result Tuesday.

In Georgia, the Trump campaign requested that Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger perform an audit of the November election to review signatures on absentee ballot envelopes.

It is the fifth time that Mr. Raffensperger, a Republican, has been asked to perform such a review. According to the president’s campaign, 38,250 to 45,626 mail-in ballots were cast unlawfully.

In a six-page letter to Mr. Raffensperger with several exhibits attached, the campaign noted that the 2016 general election had a rejection rate of 2.9% for faulty absentee ballots. Despite an increase in absentee ballots from the presidential election four years ago, the rejection rate significantly decreased to 0.34% in 2020.

“Until the signatures are matched, the vote count in Georgia is a complete fraud,” said Mr. Giuliani. “There is no way of knowing which ballots are honest and which ballots are fraudulent.”

Georgia officials certified the election for Mr. Biden after a hand recount. The Trump campaign is pushing to have the certification reversed.

Mr. Biden defeated Mr. Trump by about 12,600 votes, or a 0.2 percentage point margin. The certification awards Mr. Biden the state’s 16 electoral votes.

Despite defending the results, Mr. Raffensperger announced Monday that there are investigations into allegations of voter fraud, including groups working to register voters ahead of the Jan. 5 Senate runoff.

A spokesperson for his office told reporters, though, that the 250 cases being examined likely aren’t enough to flip the presidential results.

State voting systems manager Gabriel Sterling said the state is investigating a charge that there were more absentee mail ballots than there are ballot envelopes in Gwinett County.

1112,1112,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/nov/30/justices-take-dim-view-trump-effort-cut-illegal-im/,Right,"The government’s lawyer told the Supreme Court on Monday that it may be impossible to subtract illegal immigrants from the 2020 census count, undercutting President Trump’s hopes of shifting political power away from the large Democratic-leaning states where illegal immigrants are concentrated.

Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall said there is no chance the Census Bureau can identify and eliminate all 10 million to 12 million illegal immigrants believed to be in the U.S.

He said the bureau should be able to identify thousands who were in detention as of April 1, or Census Day, but there is a wide gulf between tens of thousands and 10 million. He said the Census Bureau has no clue where the number would land or whether it would make a meaningful dent in the final tally.

“We just don’t know at this point,” Mr. Wall told the high court during oral arguments conducted by telephone, as has been the practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Justices across the ideological spectrum expressed incredulity with the administration’s inability to say what is possible and suggested that even making an attempt may not survive legal scrutiny.

“A lot of the historical evidence and the long-standing practice really cuts against your position,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett told Mr. Wall.

Mr. Trump over the summer signed a directive ordering the Census Bureau to produce two numbers from the 2020 count. The first is the usual tally of all people living in the U.S. on April 1, and the second would try to subtract those without permission to be in the country.

The first number, broken down by state, usually is submitted to Congress in order to divvy up the 435 seats in the U.S. House according to population. Mr. Trump wants Congress to use the second number, which could reduce the political clout of states such as California with a large number of illegal immigrants.

The president’s opponents say he is trying to sweep illegal immigrants back into the shadows by denying them a presence in the count and curtailing their political power.

“Millions of undocumented immigrants have lived here for decades and have substantial community ties,” New York Solicitor General Barbara Underwood told the court. “Their undocumented status doesn’t erase their presence.”

“Undocumented” is the term immigrant rights activists use to refer to illegal immigrants. They argue that it’s pejorative to call a person “illegal.” U.S. law uses the term “illegal alien,” as did Mr. Wall and many of the justices during Monday’s argument.

The census count has been completed, though some Democrats on Capitol Hill say too many people were missed and are pushing for a restart.

What’s at issue now is who counts as an inhabitant for the purposes of apportioning the House.

Under prodding by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., Ms. Underwood said foreign diplomats on a three-year tour of the U.S. shouldn’t count. Neither would someone with a temporary tourist visa, she said.

But she said migrants who came on a visitor visa but overstayed, becoming illegal immigrants, should be counted because they are “now outside the realm of [when] we expect them to leave.”

Justice Alito said he wanted to ask about three other categories, but Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. cut him off for going over his time limit for questions.

The court rushed the case onto the docket this year to speed a decision before the Dec. 31 deadline for the Commerce Department, which oversees the census, to send its report to Mr. Trump, and before his January deadline for submitting an apportionment number to Congress.

Mr. Wall said the court should wait for Mr. Trump’s next move. He said the number of illegal immigrants who can be excluded could be so small that it wouldn’t change any state’s seat count, so the whole fight would be for naught.

He said illegal immigrants who have sneaked into the U.S. without triggering any notice by federal authorities can’t be deleted from the number.

Meanwhile, the thousands who were in government custody on April 1 are easy to identify, he said.

Justice Elena Kagan said agencies do have records on some 800,000 recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, 200,000 who have been ordered deported but are still in the U.S., and 3.2 million who are in deportation proceedings.

Mr. Wall said the Census Bureau would have to be able to match each of those people against a specific record from this year’s census, and the bureau doesn’t know whether it can do that.

“Until we actually take the census master file and these various administrative records, once they’re all cleaned up and ready to go, and we actually run the models in a few weeks or, you know, whenever it is, we won’t actually know how many people we pick up,” he said.

Several justices, noting all the unknowns Mr. Wall laid out, said it might make sense to wait until after the president delivers his number to Congress before ruling on the matter.

Ms. Underwood and Dale Ho, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union who also argued Monday against Mr. Trump, said the organization would be willing to wait.

“I’d agree that that short of a wait wouldn’t be disruptive,” Mr. Ho said.

Mr. Wall, though, said it’s not clear what timeline the Census Bureau will be able to meet.

He said the bureau is “not currently on pace” to get the report to Mr. Trump by the law’s deadline of the end of the year.

Even then, he said, Mr. Trump has to decide whether he has the “legal discretion” to exclude each of those categories.

If the decision is pushed beyond Jan. 20, then it would likely fall to presumptive President-elect Joseph R. Biden, who has criticized Mr. Trump’s move and would almost certainly squelch the effort.

Monday’s case is the third Trump census tussle to reach the high court.

Last year, the justices shot down the president’s attempt to shoehorn a citizenship question into the full 2020 questionnaire. Earlier this year, the court sided with his administration and blocked a lower-court ruling that imposed a one-month overtime in conducting the in-person count because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In his speech to Congress on Tuesday night, Mr. Obama is certain to demand more tax revenue, part of his “balanced” approach to deficit reduction, even though he won a battle with Congress last month for a tax increase on wealthier households. He also will push for more spending to fund his job-creation proposals and education plans.

“He will focus on the proposals that are necessary to help the middle class grow and help the economy grow,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday. “We need more investment that helps the key industries of the 21st century take root here in the United States. We are not done, not even close.”

Along with higher taxes and bigger government, Mr. Obama will renew his call for gun-control measures and immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship. Many Democrats expect the president to call attention again to climate change as part of his clean-energy agenda.

As for Republicans’ goals of cutting spending, curbing the growth of entitlement programs and reducing the size of government? Most observers don’t expect the president to give those subjects more than the briefest of lip service.

“Don’t hold your breath,” said Ron Haskins, a senior fellow in economic studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution. “Why would he? He’s in great political shape. I don’t think he’s going to do anything serious [on spending]. He has every reason to sit tight and play to his base.”

(SEE RELATED: State of Union response carries risk for Marco Rubio)

The day after delivering his agenda, Mr. Obama will begin a series of trips to sell his initiatives to the public in North Carolina, Georgia and Illinois.

The danger in failing to reach out to Republicans on deficit reduction, some analysts say, is that the Republicans have the power to block Mr. Obama’s top priorities such as immigration reform. If the president takes too combative a posture with Republicans, it will “doom” much of his agenda, said Alice Rivlin, another senior fellow at Brookings who served on Mr. Obama’s debt commission.

“We have a long-run problem, and if he’s seen as not addressing it by much of the country and by the Republican opposition, he will doom his other agenda to bickering,” she said.

Since winning re-election handily Nov. 6, Mr. Obama and his team have been giving every indication that they think they have the Republican Party on the run. They say their hand was strengthened when they won the “fiscal cliff” showdown Jan. 1, pushing through a tax-rate increase on families earning more than $450,000, and when Republican lawmakers temporarily backed away from a threat to block an increase in the nation’s borrowing limit. Many Republicans view the debt ceiling as one of their few remaining options to force Mr. Obama to address spending.

As the president pursues an unabashedly liberal agenda, Democrats are simultaneously trying to exploit a rift in the Republican Party, as evidenced by a memo circulated Monday by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on gun control.

“On the eve of a major grass-roots push in favor of gun violence prevention, it’s clear that Tea Party House Republicans will maintain their out-of-touch approach and obstruct sensible reforms to reduce gun violence that most Americans support — undermining their party’s appeal, hurting their candidates and endangering suburban Republican seats,” the memo states.

Michael Franc, vice president of government studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he expects Mr. Obama to lay out the broad liberal philosophy that supports his initiatives.

“The redistribution philosophy; the sense that government spending creates wealth, not detracts from it; the sense that the agents of government are smart enough to make a lot of decisions about our daily lives — those core instincts guide the philosophy,” Mr. Franc said. “One of the consequences of the president being a lame duck is that he becomes ‘progressive unplugged.’ So we’re seeing the true Barack Obama right now, and it’s an unapologetic and very proud progressive.”

Although White House aides weren’t tipping the president’s hand, Democrats also are hoping that Mr. Obama expands on his inaugural address with a new push to make it easier to vote, including federal legislation mandating early voting in all 50 states. In his inaugural speech, Mr. Obama said, “Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.”

Mr. Obama will devote much of his speech to the economy, a theme he previewed for House Democrats last week.

“I’m going to be talking about making sure that we’re focused on job creation here in the United States of America,” Mr. Obama said. “It means that we’re focused on education and that every young person is equipped with the skills they need to compete in the 21st century. It means that we’ve got an energy agenda that can make us less dependent on foreign oil, but also that we’re cultivating the kind of clean-energy strategy that will maintain our leadership well into the future.”

As for deficit reduction and the looming fiscal crisis?

“We’ll talk about that stuff,” Mr. Obama said, “but all from the perspective of how are we making sure that somebody who works hard in this country — a cop, or a teacher, or a construction worker, or a receptionist — that they can make it if they work hard, and that their kids can make it and dream even bigger dreams than they have achieved.”

In other words, deficit reduction will take a back seat to jobs programs and more spending. Although Mr. Carney rejected the notion Monday that the president was again “pivoting” back to the economy, a poll shows Americans are still deeply concerned about the lack of jobs.

The survey by Quinnipiac University found that 53 percent of respondents think the U.S. is still in a recession, even though economists have said the economic downturn ended in July 2009. Given that, Mr. Obama is expected to revive long-standing proposals for more federal spending on infrastructure, manufacturing, clean energy and education.

The president told House Democrats that he asks himself the same question when evaluating the worthiness of administration proposals: “Is this helping to make sure that everybody has got a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody is playing by the same rules?

“Because I believe that is a growth agenda — not just an equity agenda, not just a fairness agenda — that is a growth agenda. That is when we have grown fastest.”

The first State of the Union address of President Obama’s second term is shaping up as a conservative’s nightmare come true.

In his speech to Congress on Tuesday night, Mr. Obama is certain to demand more tax revenue, part of his “balanced” approach to deficit reduction, even though he already got a tax increase on wealthier households last month.

1134,1134,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/dec/3/us-jobless-claims-remain-high-at-712000-as-virus-e/,Right,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week to a still-high 712,000, the latest sign that the U.S. economy and job market remain under stress from the intensified viral outbreak.

Thursday’s report from the Labor Department said that initial claims for jobless aid dropped from 787,000 the week before. Before the virus paralyzed the economy in March, the number of people applying for unemployment benefits each week had typically amounted to roughly 225,000. The chronically high pace of applications shows that nearly nine months after the pandemic struck, many employers are still slashing jobs.

The total number of people who are continuing to receive traditional state unemployment benefits declined to 5.5 million from 6.1 million. That figure is down sharply from its peak of nearly 23 million in May. It means that some jobless Americans are finding jobs and no longer receiving aid. But it also indicates that many of the unemployed have used up their state benefits, which typically expire after six months.

With layoffs still elevated and new confirmed viral cases in the United States now exceeding 160,000 a day on average, the economy’s modest recovery is increasingly in danger. States and cities are issuing mask mandates, limiting the size of gatherings, restricting restaurant dining, closing gyms or reducing the hours and capacity of bars, stores and other businesses.

Most experts say the economy won’t be able to sustain a recovery until the virus is brought under control with an effective and widely used vaccine.

Many jobless Americans are now collecting checks under two federal programs that were set up this year to ease the economic pain inflicted by the pandemic. But those programs are set to expire the day after Christmas. When they do, benefits will end completely for an estimated 9.1 million unemployed people.

The number of people collecting aid under one of those programs - the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which offers coverage to gig workers and others who don’t qualify for traditional benefits -fell by 339,000 to 8.9 million for the week ending Nov. 14.

But the number of people receiving aid under the second program - the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, which provides 13 weeks of federal benefits to people who have exhausted their state aid - rose by 60,000 to 4.6 million.

All told, roughly 20.2 million people are now receiving some type of unemployment aid. (Figures for the two pandemic-related programs aren’t adjusted for seasonal variations.)

Congress has failed for months to agree on any new stimulus aid for jobless individuals and struggling businesses after the expiration of a multi-trillion dollar rescue package enacted in March. This week, though, efforts to forge some limited short-term rescue package have intensified. Democrats have scaled back their demands for a $2 trillion-plus measure by more than half in hopes of breaking the logjam.

Democratic leaders have lent their support to a nearly $1 trillion package as a “basis” for discussions. This plan would establish a $300-a-week jobless benefit, send $160 billion to help state and local governments, boost schools and universities, revive “paycheck protection” subsidies for businesses and bail out transit systems and airlines. So far, though, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been unwilling to abandon a $550 million Senate Republican plan that failed twice this fall.

President-elect Joe Biden lent his support to the bipartisan effort Wednesday, saying the developing aid package “wouldn’t be the answer, but it would be the immediate help for a lot of things.” Biden said he wants a relief bill to pass Congress now, with more aid to follow next year.

Regardless of what happens on Capitol Hill, the promise of a vaccine could help ease the health and economic crises in coming months. In the meantime, with the virus still raging, the economic damage has become increasingly visible. The data firm Homebase reports that its measures of job market health - employees working, hours worked and businesses open - have deteriorated from where they stood in the summer.

“We expect conditions to worsen, placing increased pressure on Main Street as small businesses continue to struggle to survive,″ Homebase researchers wrote.

Likewise, the data firm Womply estimates that 21% of small businesses were shuttered at the start of November, up from June’s 16% rate. Womply also said that consumer spending at local businesses declined 30% last month from a year earlier, marking a deterioration from a 20% year-over-year decline in October.

Americans are bracing for the picture to worsen: Thirty percent of adults surveyed by the Commerce Department from Nov. 11 to 23 reported that they or someone in their household expected to lose income in the next four weeks, up from 23% of those surveyed from Sept. 30 to Oct. 12."

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

The state of our union, President Obama now tells us with “renewed” confidence, is “stronger.”

Stronger than what, exactly? The deepest bowels of a recession?

“There is much progress to report,” he says, dreamily.

Tell that to the millions of Americans who are still unemployed.

Tell that to the broken taxpayers who have shouldered the burdens of all his bailouts and government schemes-gone-bust.

SEE ALSO: Obama goes 8 for 20 from last year’s State of Union pledges

Tell that to the generations to come, for whom the American Dream has been sold downriver in order to pay for trillions of dollars in debt with which he has saddled them.

Even with all the damage already done, a president without an agenda is a dead duck.

And this president could not imagine an agenda that didn’t cost a fortune of your money.

So he ticked off his list of projects to tackle in his second term from gun control to global warming to immigration to raising the minimum wage.

In case you are one of those mathy types out there wondering how much further into debt Mr. Obama will fling us to accomplish all this — well, don’t you worry your silly little heads.

“Nothing I’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime,” Mr. Obama explained. “It’s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.”

So, there you have it.

Of course, when it comes to math, you got to watch what Mr. Obama says. Especially when it is your money he is playing with.

Remember four years ago when he promised that his plans would cut the deficit in half during his first term?

“This will not be easy,” he warned at the time. “It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we’ve long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay – and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.”

So, instead of cutting the deficit in half, he grew the debt by more than half. Which is why it now stands at about $16 trillion as opposed to the roughly $10 trillion when he took office.

Like I said, your money. Not his concern.

Now he’s got yet another big new plan for the government to create jobs. It must, he told Congress during his State of the Union address, “be the North Star that guides our efforts.”

This guy is so delusion, he still thinks the North Star is following him around.

It got so thick in the chamber that even Mr. Obama’s vice president had a hard time keeping it together.

John Boehner looked downright stoic sitting next to Joe Biden, who kept wiping tears from his eyes as Mr. Obama kept dropping whopper after whopper.

Finally, just to keep up, Mr. Biden whipped out a pair of rose-colored glasses. He put them on and smiled.

1194,1194,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/feb/13/mccain-demands-answers-benghazi-before-hagel-vote/,Right,"Democrats pressed ahead Wednesday with Chuck Hagel’s nomination to be secretary of defense, scheduling a showdown vote for Friday even as top Republicans signaled that they need more information before confirming him for the Pentagon’s top civilian post.

He is one of several top administration nominees facing roadblocks as Republicans demand to know more from President Obama on various topics, such as the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and threaten to hold up his appointments as leverage.

Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, said Wednesday that he would hold up Mr. Obama’s pick to head the CIA, John O. Brennan, until the White House releases more information about the secret drone execution program.

Democrats bristled at the delay over Mr. Hagel, accusing the Republicans of unprecedented obstructions.

“This is the first time in the history of our country that a presidential nominee for secretary of defense has been filibustered,” Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “What a shame. But that’s the way it is.”

Republicans said Mr. Reid was rushing Mr. Hagel’s nomination through the chamber and that there is a long history of filibustering nominations as a way to try to pry information loose.

“We haven’t gotten the information that we want,” said Sen. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee.

Mr. Hagel, a former Republican senator whom Mr. Obama tapped to be his independent voice at the Defense Department, will need to muster 60 votes Friday or else his confirmation will be delayed until later this month.

He suffered through a rocky confirmation hearing two weeks ago, and Republicans said he has not disclosed all of the foreign clients for whom he has worked in the four years since he left the Senate.

Freshman Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, made a plea for that information, wondering at Tuesday’s committee meeting whether Mr. Hagel might have taken money from governments that aren’t friendly to the U.S.

“We do not know, for example if he received compensation for giving paid speeches at extreme or radical groups,” he said Tuesday.

Sen. David Vitter, Louisiana Republican, said he needs more time to pore over Mr. Hagel’s recent speeches.

Sen. John McCain, an influential Republican from Arizona, signaled Wednesday that he is among those seeking more answers from Mr. Obama about the White House’s response to the attack in Benghazi.

“I’m looking for an answer,” Mr. McCain said, specifically on “where the president was that night and what he did.”

Mr. McCain would not disclose whether he plans to block a vote on the nomination if Mr. Obama does not supply the information he wants.

“I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it,” he told reporters outside the Senate chamber. “My position right now is I want answers to the questions.”

Chairman Carl Levin, Michigan Democrat, said Mr. Hagel has cooperated with the committee’s rules and is qualified for the job.

“The president needs to have a secretary of defense in whom he has trust, who will give him unvarnished advice, a person of integrity and one who has a personal understanding of the consequences of decisions relative to the use of military force,” Mr. Levin said on the Senate floor.

Mr. Levin said Mr. Hagel has the full support of five previous defense secretaries and that he served courageously in the Vietnam War. Mr. Hagel would be the first former enlisted man to serve as defense secretary.

Although they may seem arcane, document requests can be powerful weapons against nominees.

Americans for a Strong Defense, a group that opposes Mr. Hagel’s nomination, accused Senate Democrats of hypocrisy Wednesday for insulating the nominee from Republicans’ request for records, noting the party employed a wide range of delay tactics to thwart some of President George W. Bush’s nominees.

They pointed to successful efforts to block John R. Bolton as ambassador of the United Nations, after Mr. Bush submitted his name to keep him on the job in 2006.

Miguel A. Estrada, an accomplished lawyer known to possess conservative views, withdrew his name from consideration for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia after senators stirred controversy from 2001 to 2003 by calling for legal memos that Mr. Estrada composed during his time at the Department of Justice.

“There’s certainly a history of calling for disclosure for nominees that have gone before the Senate,” said Ryan Williams, the organization’s spokesman.

Despite these precedents, “it’s very unusual to do this with a major nomination,” said Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

As of now, Mr. Hagel and Mr. Brennan face roadblocks — and Jacob “Jack” Lew, Mr. Obama’s nominee to be the Treasury Department secretary, could also may have to overcome obstacles if he doesn’t provide more information about his investment history.

Mr. Hagel’s nomination was cleared through the Armed Services Committee on Tuesday on a party-line vote.

Two Republicans have said they would support his nomination, while others have said they would vote against him but wouldn’t take part in a filibuster.

“I wish that President Obama had made a different choice for this critical position, but he is entitled to have this nominee receive a direct vote on the Senate floor,” said Sen. Susan M. Collins, Maine Republican.

1217,1217,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/dec/10/brandon-bernard-executed-despite-appeals-kim-karda/,Right,"A Texas man convicted of killing married youth ministers before setting their car on fire while they were inside was executed Thursday night, despite last-minute appeals from Democratic officials and Kim Kardashian West.

Brandon Bernard, 40, was pronounced dead at 9:27 p.m. after getting a lethal injection at the federal prison complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. He is the ninth federal inmate executed this year.

The execution came after the Supreme Court denied last-minute legal challenges from Bernard’s attorneys, who had argued that newly-discovered evidence suggested he did not play an active role in the murder of Todd and Stacie Bagley in Killeen, Texas.

Although the Supreme Court refused to postpone the execution, Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, saying had the new evidence been presented to a jury, Bernard would have most likely been spared the death penalty.

The evidence defense attorneys say was withheld by prosecutors was the testimony of an expert who was prepared to testify that Bernard was a low-level member of a gang that killed the Bagleys and he did not plan the carjacking and robbery that led to their deaths.

“Many things went wrong to put Brandon on death row, including egregious government misconduct in concealing evidence and misleading the jury, which the courts refused to remedy,” Bernard’s attorney Robert C. Owen said in a statement after his death.

“Brandon’s execution is a stain on America’s criminal justice system,” he continued.

In a statement, the family of Stacie Bagley said their lives were changed forever with her death.

“I pray that Brandon has accepted Christ as his Savior, because if he has, Todd and Stacie will welcome him into Heaven with love and forgiveness. God will forgive us of our sins, but the consequences of our sin will always play out,” her father, Charles Woodward, said.

Todd Bagley’s mother, Georgia, asked Bernard’s supporters to remember her family’s pain and suffering.

“When someone deliberately takes the lives of others, they suffer the consequences of their actions,” she said. “This senseless act of unnecessary evil was premeditated and had many opportunities to be stopped at any time during a 9-hour period. This was torture, as they pleaded for their lives from the trunk of their own car.”

Earlier Thursday, a federal appeals court also denied a last-minute emergency request to halt the execution, the ninth inmate death sentence carried out this year by the Trump administration.

In a brief, one-page order, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the request without explanation.

Bernard’s case attracted attention from Democratic lawmakers and celebrity activists, who pleaded with President Trump to commute his sentence to life in prison.

Since the Trump administration resumed federal executions after a 17-year hiatus, Democrats have largely been mum about the eight federal inmates put to death so far. But they say Bernard’s case is different because of the newly uncovered evidence.

In a joint statement, Democratic Sens. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois called on the president to commute Bernard’s sentence.

“Since he was sentenced to death, new evidence has come to light and a number of deficiencies in his initial defense have been exposed,” they said. “Mr. Bernard’s post-conviction attorneys have continued to seek legal relief in the courts and Mr. Bernard should be allowed to keep pursuing available legal avenues to challenge his death sentence.”

Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts Democrat, flanked by Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and noted death-penalty activist, urged supporters to petition the White House to stop Bernard’s execution.

“We need to fight for Brandon like he is our own son,” Ms. Pressley said in a media appearance with The Appeal. “We need to fight for him like he is a member of our family because he is. We are all one human family.”

“Murdering Brandon will only further the cycles of trauma and harm,” she continued.

Lawmakers aren’t the only ones advocating for Bernard. Kim Kardashian West also issued a public plea aimed at Mr. Trump to commute the sentence.

On Thursday night, she detailed her final moments on the phone with Bernard before he was killed.

“Just spoke to Brandon for what will likely be the last time. Hardest call I’ve ever had,” she tweeted. “Brandon, selfless as always, was focused on his family and making sure they are OK. He told me not to cry because our fight isn’t over.”

Although Bernard was not involved in the carjacking, he participated in burning the vehicle while the Bagleys were inside it.

Mr. Bagley’s death came as a result of gunshot wounds, but Mrs. Bagley died of smoke inhalation while unconscious from the gunshot wound, according to autopsies.

Bernard and his three accomplices were convicted, but two have been released. A third, Christopher Vialva, was executed earlier this year.

1249,1249,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/dec/21/ralph-northam-virginia-gov-robert-e-lee-statue-rem/,Right,"Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam announced Monday that the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee has been removed from the U.S. Capitol.

The life-sized bronze monument is to be moved to the Virginia Museum of History and Culture in Richmond after having stood for 111 years in Washington.

State Attorney General Mark Herring tweeted Monday that the statue removal “is long overdue.”

“We must start telling our complete history and remove these monuments that venerate individuals who fought to maintain slavery in this country,” tweeted Mr. Herring, a Democrat.

Sculptor Edward Valentine gifted the statue to the collection in 1909 as a commemoration of the general who commanded the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia from 1862 until he surrendered in 1865, according to the Architect of the Capitol website.

Mr. Northam, a Democrat, established the Commission for Historical Statues in the U.S. Capitol earlier this year to look into the removal and replacement of the monument.

The commission was created following a wave of Confederate statue removals nationwide sparked by protests over racism and police brutality after George Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis in May.

State Sen. Louise Lucas, Virginia Democrat and commission chairwoman, along with seven other members, voted unanimously this summer to recommend the statue be removed.

“Confederate images do not represent who we are in Virginia, that’s why we voted unanimously to remove this statue,” Ms. Lucas said Monday in a statement. “I am thrilled that this day has finally arrived, and I thank Governor Northam and the Commission for their transformative work.”

Each state is allowed to display two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection, so the commission voted 6-1 to replace the Lee statue with one of Barbara Rose Johns, who died in 1991 at the age of 56. In 1951, the then-16-year-old led a student walkout at a high school in Virginia to protest the conditions at the all-Black school compared to those of a nearby all-White school.

Her protest caught the attention of NAACP attorneys who filed a lawsuit that became part of the five suits reviewed by the Supreme Court in the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka case. The case led to the 1954 landmark ruling that declared segregation unconstitutional.

The General Assembly must approve replacing the statue before the commission can choose a sculptor to create it.

If the replacement is approved, Johns would become the only teenager to be depicted in the historical collection. She would stand with George Washington as Virginia’s second statue contribution in the U.S. Capitol.

Mr. Northam has proposed $500,000 in state funds to pay for the replacement, and he applauded the removal of the monument in a statement Monday.

“The Confederacy is a symbol of Virginia’s racist and divisive history, and it is past time we tell our story with images of perseverance, diversity, and inclusion,” Mr. Northam said. “I look forward to seeing a trailblazing young woman of color represent Virginia in the U.S. Capitol, where visitors will learn about Barbara Johns’ contributions to America and be empowered to create positive change in their communities just like she did.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed the governor’s sentiments in a statement Monday and said that the removal is “welcome news.”

“The halls of Congress are the very heart of our Democracy, and the statues within the Capitol should embody our highest ideals as Americans,” said Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat. “The Congress will continue our work to rid the Capitol of homages to hate, as we fight to end the scourge of racism in our country. There is no room for celebrating the bigotry of the Confederacy in the Capitol or any other place of honor in our country.”

The House speaker championed legislation this summer to clear the Capitol of other monuments of Confederate leaders and representatives of bigotry, and to strip Confederate leaders’ names from military bases and other structures.

But it’s up to the states to determine which of their historical figures to display at the Capitol. Jefferson Davis, a former senator from Mississippi who was president of the Confederate States of America, is represented by one of two statues from that state.

1252,1252,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/dec/21/house-passes-covid-relief-bill/,Right,"Democrats and Republicans linked arms Monday and rushed to pass a new round of coronavirus relief, saying they were delivering a measure of hope to families grimly confronting the holidays and new year amid a new round of shutdowns.

The bill, which also included full funding for all other government operations in 2021, cleared both chambers with strong bipartisan support late Monday night. It now needs to be signed into law by President Trump.

The package passed with less than 20 minutes to spare before the midnight deadline, but Congress also passed a weeklong funding measure to give the deal time to be formally processed, giving them a bit more breathing room.

The deal made by top party leaders on Capitol Hill ends an eight-month logjam, during which the virus went through two new surges, U.S. deaths attributed to COVID-19 topped 300,000, and the jobs picture began to slump again.

The breakthrough came earlier this month when a group of centrist Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate announced that they had worked out a $900 billion deal, forcing those on their right and left to come back to the table.

Monday’s relief package tracked closely to the size of the centrists’ proposal, though many of the details were rewritten and big sticking points, such as aid to local governments and liability protections for businesses reopening amid the pandemic, were put off for future negotiations.

“Our consensus bill was the foundation of this final package and we applaud Congressional leadership for finishing what we started,” the centrists said in a statement Sunday, as the leaders’ deal was announced.

Monday’s bipartisan votes offered hope not only that assistance was on the way for the virus, but also that next year could usher in more bipartisan deal-making.

President-elect Joseph R. Biden has called this bill a down payment and said he will come back to Congress to ask for more next year. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, said tops on that list will be the state and local funding she was forced to drop from this bill.

“While we have recognized the urgent need for resources to crush the virus so we can open our economy and schools safely, we must also recognize that more needs to be done,” she said in a letter to her Democratic House colleagues.

Asked if he would come back for another bite at the apple, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters “We’ll see next year.”

The Kentucky Republican said this bill could have been done months ago, but for Mrs. Pelosi’s insistence throughout the summer and fall for more at least $2 trillion in spending.

“But a few days ago, with a new president-elect of their own party, everything changed. Democrats suddenly came around to our position that we should find consensus, make law where we agree and get urgent help out the door,” Mr. McConnell said.

Lawmakers were left struggling to digest the massive bill, which spanned 5,593 pages and $2.3 trillion in total spending when the 2021 government operations legislation is combined with the virus relief package.

A computer glitch delayed the release of the bill text until about 2 p.m., and the first procedural votes on the package occurred in the House a little after 5 p.m.

“It’s not good enough to hear about what’s in the bill. Members of Congress need to see and read the bills we are expected to vote on,” Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat, tweeted. “I know it’s ‘controversial’ and I get in trouble for sharing things like this, but the people of this country deserve to know. They deserve better.”

The final deal includes another round of stimulus checks, though at $600 — half the amount of the checks that went out last spring. But officials said the money could reach Americans’ hands faster.

“People are going to see this money [at] the beginning of next week,” Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said during an interview with CNBC on Monday morning. “Much-needed relief — and just in time for the holidays.”

Adults making $75,000 or less will qualify for the full $600 payment, with higher earners getting tapered amounts and payments capped for those making more than $99,000. Families will receive an additional $600 per child.

Illegal immigrants will not be eligible, but the bill will alter a provision from last spring that denied some U.S. citizens benefits because they are married to a noncitizen who lacks a Social Security number.

The deal also has roughly $284 billion for another round of Paycheck Protection Program loans, $25 billion in rental assistance, an extension of the eviction moratorium, and $82 billion for schools and colleges grappling with reopening and distance learning.

Another round of federal unemployment benefits is also included, beginning Dec. 27 and running through early March. The checks, which are in addition to state assistance, will total $300 per week — half the $600-a-week benefits that were part of the relief package last spring.

Both parties celebrated the billions of dollars being pumped into vaccine distribution, testing and contact tracing.

Biden on Monday said he is looking for ways that the Senate could hold an impeachment trial for President Trump while working on the new administration’s agenda.

Mr. Biden has been in touch with “folks in the Senate” on potentially splitting the floor time that would be required for an impeachment trial with time for his early legislative and staffing priorities, he said.

“Can you go a half day on dealing with impeachment and a half day getting my people nominated and confirmed in the Senate as well as moving on the [coronavirus] package?” he said. “So that’s my hope and expectation.”

He said he wasn’t sure about the logistics behind such an arrangement.

Mr. Biden waded into the impeachment fray talking to reporters in Delaware after receiving a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. He previously shied away from the question of whether Mr. Trump should be impeached over the U.S. Capitol attack, saying he was focused on the presidential transition.

Mr. Biden has carefully ridden the political currents in Washington for nearly 50 years. Political strategists noted that Mr. Biden, as he prepared to take the top job in the White House, was again playing it safe.

“He doesn’t really want to touch this because he doesn’t know how it’s going to go,” said Republican consultant Keith Naughton. “Impeachment and trial is Congress’ responsibility, so why stick your fingers into something that isn’t your responsibility?”

Democratic lawmakers likely will have hell to pay with their base if impeachment blows up in their faces.

“They’ve always detested Trump, and now that’s at a fever pitch,” Mr. Naughton said. “So if Biden gets involved in impeachment and Trump doesn’t get convicted, then he gets the blowback over it.”

House Democrats introduced an impeachment article on Monday accusing Mr. Trump of inciting insurrection by firing up supporters shortly before a pro-Trump mob invaded the U.S. Capitol.

The House is expected to pass the article this week. Lawmakers suggested not sending it to the Senate until Mr. Biden is in office for a few months to avoid early disruptions to his term.

Impeachment was not on the list of subjects he discussed in phone calls Friday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York, according to a readout of the calls.

Last week, incoming White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Mr. Biden expects congressional leaders to do their jobs and declined to say whether the impeachment push would impede the early days of his administration.

“He has a job to do — that is preparing to take the reins,” Ms. Psaki said. “I don’t think I’m going to weigh into the game of [whether it’s] helpful or hurtful.”

A precondition to bringing the country together is getting Mr. Trump out of office, she said, reiterating that the fastest way to make that happen is through Mr. Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20.

Sen. Chris Coons, a top Biden ally, said a Senate impeachment trial just as Mr. Biden is entering office could hamper efforts to get the coronavirus pandemic under control.

“I understand the concerns that just as President Biden takes over responsibility for leading our nation through this tragic pandemic that we might be distracted by weeks in the Senate by a Senate trial,” the Delaware Democrat said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

It takes a simple majority in the House to impeach and a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict. The upper chamber soon will be split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, with Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris as the tie-breaking vote as president of the Senate. A conviction would require more than a dozen Republicans siding against the president.

Democrats have talked about voting to bar Mr. Trump from ever holding federal office again, but such a vote would likely occur only if and when the Senate votes to convict the president of an offense.

The Democrat-led House already voted to impeach Mr. Trump in December 2019, accusing the president of strong-arming Ukraine into digging up dirt on Mr. Biden.

The Republican-led Senate acquitted Mr. Trump in February 2020.

1480,1480,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/25/mitch-mcconnell-move-forward-power-sharing-after-f/,Right,"Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that he’s now satisfied the filibuster, a defining feature of the Senate, won’t be erased, so he will lift his blockade and allow Democrats to finish organizing as the majority party.

The Kentucky Republican has been holding up Democrats’ ability to take control of committees, using that as leverage to try to win an ironclad agreement from Democrats that they would not trigger the nuclear option and nix the filibuster.

He didn’t win that concession, but he said two Democrats have come out forcefully in rejecting any changes, and in a 50-50 Senate their opposition makes him confident the critical but controversial tool remain.

“Today two Democratic Senators publicly confirmed they will not vote to end the legislative filibuster. They agree with President Biden’s and my view that no Senate majority should destroy the right of future minorities of both parties to help shape legislation,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement.

The two Democrats who reaffirmed the value of the filibuster are Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.

Democrats took control of the Senate on Jan. 20 when three new senators were sworn in, along with Vice President Kamala Harris, whose tie-breaking vote gives the edge to Democrats in the 50-50 Senate.

But since the chamber is a “continuing body,” Republicans still have control of the committees based on their majority before Jan. 20. The Senate must pass a new organizing resolution to officially transfer control to Democrats.

Mr. McConnell had been blocking any new resolution as he sought assurances on the filibuster, a tool both parties have used to derail each other’s priorities.

Newly minted Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer had balked at giving those assurances, saying to do so would embolden Mr. McConnell to flex the filibuster more than ever.

There is a roadmap for a 50-50 Senate from 20 years ago, when the GOP held the majority by dint of Vice President Dick Cheney’s tie-breaking vote.

Mr. McConnell said Monday that the Senate will use that arrangement as a template for a power-sharing deal this year.

It takes a three-fifths vote of senators — usually 60 votes, when all 100 seats are filled — to overcome a filibuster.

That high bar has doomed everything from abortion legislation to gun bills to immigration changes, on both sides of the ideological divide.

Democrats weren’t shy about using the filibuster to derail President Trump’s priorities.

Now, though, with a Democratic president and control of the House, the filibuster stands in the way of the liberal wish list laid out by the party’s more left-leaning members.

That’s sparked a rethink among even some former supporters of the filibuster.

Sen. Chris Coons, who while Mr. Trump was in office led a bipartisan statement defending the primacy of the filibuster, changed his mind last year and said he could vote to end the practice if it meant getting Mr. Biden’s agenda through a deeply divided Senate.

1607,1607,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/15/house-votes-let-americans-keep-health-plans-39-dem/,Right,"Nearly 40 House Democrats defied President Obama and helped the Republican majority pass a bill Friday that lets Americans keep, for one year, health plans that do not comply with Obamacare.

The defections from 39 members of Mr. Obama’s party highlighted the pressure on Congress to help people who lost coverage because of the president’s signature law, as balky websites keep a veil over alternative plans and pressure mounts on the Democrat-led Senate to forge a remedy.

“Let’s face it, millions of people right now have a cancelled policy,” Rep. Ron Barber, Arizona Democrat, said before voting for the Keep Your Health Plan Act.

The House passed the bill, 261 to 157, despite a veto threat from Mr. Obama and objections from Democrats who said the legislation was an insidious attempt to rot the Affordable Care Act from the inside out.

Four Republicans voted against the bill, perhaps because it could be viewed as an attempt to smooth over Mr. Obama’s controversial reforms.

Rep. Fred Upton, Michigan Republican, offered the bill at the height of furor over Mr. Obama’s oft-repeated promise that people who liked their health plans could keep them. Millions of Americans received cancellation notices because their plans did not meet the health care law’s coverage requirements, forcing the president to apologize as vulnerable Democrats scrambled to find a legislative solution.

Rampant glitches on the HealthCare.gov website — a federal portal that connects 36 states with plans under Obamcare — have intensified the problem, because people losing their policies cannot explore their options.

Mr. Barber said some Arizonans are “beside themselves.”

“Because by December 31 they don’t have health coverage, and they can’t get on the exchange to find out what’s available,” he told reporters.

Mr. Obama announced an administrative remedy on Thursday that permits insurers to offer a one-year renewal to people who hold noncompliant plans, and Senate Democrats are pushing legislation that would let existing enrollees hold onto their plans indefinitely.

The Republican-led bill goes further, allowing new enrollees to gain current health plans that do not comply with Obamacare.

Democratic opponents of the bill said the GOP offered a hocus-pocus fix that amounts to yet another attempt to repeal Mr. Obama’s signature law.

“It basically allows them to sell low-quality 2013 plans all through 2014, nothing else,” Rep. Frank Pallone, New Jersey Democrat, said.

Rep. Jim McGovern, Massachusetts Democrat, deemed it a “colossal waste of time.”

The White House said Mr. Obama would veto the House bill because it would likely increase the number of people with barebones plans, undermining Obamacare’s attempts to offer better protections through state-based insurance markets.

If too many young and healthy people keep noncompliant plans, a high proportion of sicker consumers on the exchanges — people with preexisting conditions can no longer be denied — would cause premiums to rise and spoil Mr. Obama’s overhaul.

“The Administration supports policies that allow people to keep the health plans that they have,” the White House said in a statement of administration policy. “But, policies that reverse the progress made to extend quality, affordable coverage to millions of uninsured, hardworking, middle class families are not the solution.”

The House voted shortly before Mr. Obama met with insurance company executives at the White House.

The president made no mention of his renewal proposal in remarks before the meeting. Instead, he said they would be “brainstorming” ways to make Americans aware of their coverage options.

“Because of choice and competition, a whole lot of Americans who’ve always seen health insurance out of reach are going to be in a position to purchase it,” he said.

But Mr. Obama’s administrative decision has some state insurance commissioners worried. The logistics of grabbing back people who received cancellation notices are murky, they said, and it may prevent customers from contributing to a robust exchange in their respective states.

Rep. John Fleming, Louisiana Republican, said Mr. Obama’s fix “really only offers political cover for Democrats. It doesn’t really do anything substantial.”

He said the Upton bill is a step in the right direction, but he is working on legislation that lets Americans “meet the individual mandate as long as you purchase insurance that you like that you’re comfortable with.”

“What I’d like to do is actually put in effect rules and regulation and laws that actually allow that [individual] market to come back together again,” he said, an idea that would surely roil Mr. Obama’s plans to build balanced exchanges through his law.

GOP lawmakers insisted they like to scrap the whole law, despite their vote to amend Obamacare’s problems.

“It is merely to stop the bleeding,” Rep. Michael Burgess, Texas Republican, said.

With the administration unlikely to meet its Nov. 30 deadline for making the website fully operational, President Obama’s aides offered the new explanation that some consumers never would have signed up online anyway. Therefore, they said, 80 percent enrollment would be a success.

“I think the way to look at that figure is that of, say, 10 who go on the system, roughly two won’t get through the system,” said White House press secretary Jay Carney. He said the 20 percent who can’t enroll includes people who aren’t “comfortable” signing up online or have personal circumstances that are too “complex” to use the website.

“There are reasons that have nothing to do with the functionality of the website,” Mr. Carney said. “Some Americans may go online, start the process and decide, either because of the complexity of their personal or family situation or for other reasons … that they would rather engage a live person, either through a call-in center or in person. That was of course always going to be the case.”

The administration said only about 27,000 people nationwide enrolled on the federal healthcare exchange in its first month of operation, far short of its goal of signing up 3.3 million people by the end of next month.

1615,1615,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/21/enough-enough-obama-backs-new-senate-rules/,Right,"President Obama on Thursday expressed strong support for Senate Democrats’ move to enact the so-called “nuclear option” and alter congressional rules to clear the way for judicial and other executive nominees.

“Enough is enough,” the president said during remarks in the White House press briefing room. “I’m a former senator. So is my vice president. We both value any senator’s duty to advise and consent. It’s important we take that very seriously. But a few now refuse to treat that duty of advise and consent with the respect it deserves. … What’s at sake here is not my ability to fulfill my constitutional duty. What’s at stake is the ability of any president to fulfill his or her constitutional duty. Public service is not a game. It is a privilege.”

The nuclear option changes Senate rules and eliminates the possibility of a filibuster for presidential nominees, clearing the way for the White House to flood the chamber with prospective officials who, thus far, have been blocked by Republicans.

The Senate voted 52-48 earlier Thursday to move forward with the controversial change, with GOP leaders vehemently objecting and casting the step as a power grab by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat.

The nuclear option does not extend to Supreme Court nominees, though Republicans quickly moved to include those judicial picks and vowed they’ll use the new rules to push through their own high-court picks next time a Republican occupies the White House.

The Senate rules fight also gives the White House the opportunity to change the conversation away from the botched rollout of Obamacare, which has consumed Washington for the past month. Mr. Obama, who as a senator opposed the idea of the nuclear option, said Thursday’s step will help the gears of government work more effectively and should end some of the gridlock that’s gripped Washington in recent years.

“We can’t let it become normal,” Mr. Obama said of the tactic of blocking his nominees through filibuster. “So I support the step a majority of senators today took to change the way that Washington is doing business. More specifically, the way the Senate does business.”

1618,1618,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/25/obama-heckled-over-immigration-rebukes-protester/,Right,"Immigrant-rights protesters confronted President Obama on Monday, interrupting his speech in San Francisco and demanding he use executive authority to halt all deportations, but he rebuked them and told them he doesn’t have that kind of power.

The confrontation is the latest sign of growing tension between Mr. Obama and some on his political left who say he can do more to push the issue of immigration, even as he argues that the roadblock is actually Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Hours before Mr. Obama’s immigration speech, protesters chained themselves to the gates of a detention center for illegal immigrants in Adelanto, Calif., to call attention to deportations and what the activists said is inhumane treatment of those awaiting removal from the country.

“You have a power to stop deportation for all undocumented immigrants in this country,” a man, identified by news reports as Ju Hong, shouted from the stage directly behind Mr. Obama, then helped lead a chant of “Stop deportation!” that was taken up by others in the crowd.

“Actually, I don’t, and that’s why we are here,” Mr. Obama replied.

As action on immigration has stalled in Congress, Mr. Obama and activists are increasingly at odds over the question of how much authority he does have.

SEE ALSO: Obama’s star falls: 56 percent of Americans don’t admire him now

Mr. Obama raised expectations with his broad policy last year of granting tentative legal status to young illegal immigrants who were brought to the country as children and call themselves “dreamers.” Under Mr. Obama’s policy they have been granted work permits and authorization to remain in the U.S. without fear of deportation.

Earlier this month, the administration also announced a policy allowing illegal immigrant relatives of U.S. troops and veterans to apply for “parole in place,” which would also exempt them from being removed from the country.

The activists say those moves show Mr. Obama has authority to stop deportations for most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.

Not so, the president counters.

“If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing the laws in Congress then I would do so. But we’re also a nation of laws, that’s part of our tradition,” he said. “The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. What I’m proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve.”

Security personnel were about to remove the protesters from the event, but Mr. Obama stopped them.

SPECIAL COVERAGE: Immigration Reform

“These guys don’t need to go. Let me finish. No, no, he can stay there,” the president said, drawing cheers from the audience for his act.

Mr. Obama has said his decision to stop deporting young illegal immigrants was an exercise of “prosecutorial discretion.” It’s a power Mr. Obama has flexed repeatedly — including earlier this month when the White House said it wouldn’t enforce part of the new health care law’s requirements that make many existing health plans illegal.

But in the case of immigration, Mr. Obama has told interviewers that stopping all deportations would go beyond discretion and cross the line into ignoring the law.

It’s unclear how many people the president has already placed out of reach of deportation.

The youth exemption alone has been granted to more than 450,000 people as of Aug. 31, which is the most recent data available. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had been updating those numbers monthly, but it has been more than two months since the last figures were released.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, Alabama Republican, said the GOP shouldn’t accept any immigration bill until Mr. Obama rescinds his nondeportation policies and lets immigration agents do their jobs.

“During his time in office, the president has systematically dismantled interior enforcement, handcuffing immigration officers and bypassing Congress,” Mr. Sessions said. “No agreement should be entered into while such lawlessness continues.”

Both Mr. Obama and congressional Republicans are facing increasing heat from activists. Monday’s detention center blockade was the latest in a string that has included several locations in Arizona, as well as New Orleans, Atlanta and Chicago.

Meanwhile, protesters have staked out House Speaker John A. Boehner’s house and, last week, some were arrested outside the office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.

Not every protest is as confrontational. Activists are maintaining an ongoing prayer fast at a tent on the Mall in the District — an event that drew a nod of approval from Mr. Obama in his speech Monday.

The president also repeated his new stance that he is willing to accept an immigration deal from Congress that comes in pieces, rather than the broad single bill that passed in the Senate.

“It’s Thanksgiving — we can carve that bird into multiple pieces,” Mr. Obama said. “But as long as all the pieces get done, soon, and we actually deliver on the core values we’ve been talking about for so long, I think everybody is fine with it. They’re not worried about the procedures, they just want the result.”

Mr. Obama says any final deal must include a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, along with whatever new border security and interior enforcement measures Congress wants.

Many Republicans, though, argue that border security should come first, and legalization later. Many of those Republicans also object to a full special pathway to citizenship, saying that amounts to amnesty.

Instead of a single bill, House Republicans are working on a series of bills, and Mr. Boehner has said he will not enter into negotiations with the Senate on its massive legislation.

Mr. Boehner, though, also said last week that he remains committed to getting something done on immigration, and doesn’t consider it a dead issue in this Congress.

The activists conducting the prayer fast on the Mall urged Mr. Boehner to put that vow into action.

“It’s time Speaker Boehner and the House of Representatives address America’s moral crisis — a dysfunctional immigration system that has continuously undermined the integrity of our national values and the unity of our families,” the activists said in a statement.

Mr. Obama said he and his family will spend the holiday at the White House “just like many of you — sitting down with family and friends to eat some good food, tell stories, watch a little football, and most importantly, count our blessings.”

Among those blessings, he said, are America’s men and women in uniform.

“We give thanks for the freedoms they defend — the freedom to think what we want and say what we think, to worship according to our own beliefs, to choose our leaders and, yes, criticize them without punishment,” the president said. “People around the world are fighting and even dying for their chance at these freedoms. We stand with them in that struggle, and we give thanks for being free.”

The president also called on Americans to remember people who need a helping hand.

“We give thanks to everyone who’s doing their part to make the United States a better, more compassionate nation — who spend their Thanksgiving volunteering at a soup kitchen, or joining a service project, or bringing food and cheer to a lonely neighbor,” he said. “That big-hearted generosity is a central part of our American character. We believe in pitching in to solve problems even if they aren’t our problems. And that’s not a one-day-a-year belief. It’s part of the fabric of our nation.”

Only four of 10 Americans think the president is an effective leader, CNN said. Fully 53 percent think he’s dishonest, untrustworthy — the first time a clear majority thought this about the president. And perhaps worse, given this was the president’s strongest asset: Fifty-six percent say they don’t even admire him as a person any longer.

More results: 56 percent say he doesn’t exactly inspire confidence, and 53 percent don’t see him as a strong or decisive leader. What’s most significant about these numbers is that they’re firsts for Mr. Obama in CNN polls. Six months ago, for example, 52 percent thought Mr. Obama was an effective leader of the federal government.

“A lot of attention has focused on the president’s numbers on honesty in new polling the past three weeks, but it looks like the recent controversy over Obamacare has had a bigger impact on his status as an effective manager of the government, and that may be what is really driving the drop in Obama’s approval rating this fall,” CNN polling director Keating Holland said, in CNN.

And just how big a deal is honesty, anyway?

“Just ask Bill Clinton, whose overall approval ratings remained high during and after the Monica Lewinsky scandal because three-quarters of all Americans thought he could get things done, even though only about one in five said he was honest,” Mr. Holland said, in CNN.

1632,1632,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/26/supreme-court-decide-obamacare-birth-control-manda/,Right,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday set up another showdown over President Obama’s health care law, agreeing to decide whether the government may force for-profit companies to insure birth control as part of their health plans, even if it violates the owners’ religious beliefs.

The justices said they will hear appeals of two related cases — one in which the lower court ruled in favor of an employer, and one in which the lower court upheld the Obama administration’s contraception mandate. The conflicting rulings made it an easy decision for the justices to accept the cases.

“I really don’t think they had any alternative than to take this up,” said Holly Lynch, a health policy and bioethics specialist at Harvard Law School.

The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments and release its opinion before the end of its term in June. That decision would come just two years after the court, in a divided 5-4 ruling, upheld the law’s individual mandate as constitutional under Congress’ taxing authority.

In all, nearly 40 companies filed suit over the mandate, with particular objections to insuring so-called morning-after contraception pills that they equate with abortion. The company owners say they face the impossible choice of violating their beliefs by complying with the rule or dropping health coverage for their employees.

Fines for flouting the mandate would cripple their businesses, owners said in court filings.

“This legal challenge has always remained about one thing and one thing only: the right of our family businesses to live out our sincere and deeply held religious convictions as guaranteed by the law and the Constitution,” said David Green, founder and CEO of the Oklahoma City-based Hobby Lobby crafts chain, which won its lower court challenge. “Business owners should not have to choose between violating their faith and violating the law.”

The 41-year-old company describes itself as a “biblically founded business” and is closed on Sundays. The Green family, Hobby Lobby’s owners, also owns the Mardel Christian bookstore chain.

The company in the other case before the Supreme Court is Conestoga Wood Specialties, a Pennsylvania company whose owners are Mennonites. The furniture company lost its appeal of the contraception mandate in a separate lower court ruling.

Clashing values

Supporters of the mandate say contraception use is widespread, but at times unaffordable, for many women. They argue that corporations are not “persons” under the law who can claim religious freedoms and that owners of for-profit companies are not entitled to impose their personal moral beliefs on the diverse array of people they employ.

“As a general matter, our policy is designed to ensure that health care decisions are made between a woman and her doctor,” the White House said in a written statement. “The president believes that no one, including the government or for-profit corporations, should be able to dictate those decisions to women.”

SPECIAL COVERAGE: Health Care Reform

In court filings, the plaintiffs frequently cited their First Amendment rights and the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which is supposed to prohibit laws that unduly burden an individual’s exercise of religion, in support of their clams. Federal appeals judges on the Hobby Lobby case referred to the Supreme Court’s campaign-finance decision in Citizens United to suggest that if companies can exercise free speech, they can claim religious freedoms and prerogatives as well

Ms. Lynch said the outcome is a particularly hard one to predict. But she thinks the court will dispense with the constitutional claims and focus more heavily on religious-freedom protection in RFRA.

While the mandate is certainly a burden, she said it may be a tough sell for the plaintiffs to prove it is a “substantial burden,” because of the distinction between what an employer must do — ensure that an insurer covers the services — and the employees’ role in acquiring and using them.

Exempted

And yet, she said, the Obama administration’s decision to exempt certain faith-based employers could work against them.

Dozens of religiously-affiliated nonprofits — including hospitals, charities and religious schools such as Washington’s Catholic University — sued over the mandate, too, and the Obama administration tried to accommodate them by allowing some employers to divorce themselves from managing or paying for the coverage. Instead, an insurer or third-party administrator would offer a separate policy to the employee that covers birth control.

Some institutions accepted the administration’s terms, while others decried it as an unacceptable “accounting trick.”

Reproductive rights groups and the American Civil Liberties Union have lined up in support of the administration, saying a decision in favor of employers would mark a major shift in the role of secular companies.

“The right to religious freedom belongs to individuals, not for-profit institutions,” said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, adding, “The U.S. Supreme Court should use this opportunity to strongly reinforce the bedrock principles of individual liberty on which this nation was founded, and to establish clear limits on the assertion of corporate rights in defiance of federal law and individual rights.”

Meanwhile, Republican critics of Mr. Obama’s health reforms hailed the Supreme Court’s decision to take up the case, rallying around business owners to promote religious liberty and condemn what they view as a green light for abortion-causing drugs.

By taking up two of the challenges, the Supreme Court leaves many companies waiting in the wings to see how it could affect their claims.

“Although we will not get a chance to argue our specific case before the Supreme Court, we are hopeful that the Court will decide in favor of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp, thus supporting the religious liberty of business owners who oppose the HHS mandate, including our family,” said John Kennedy, president and CEO of the Autocam company in Michigan.

1639,1639,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/11/kibbe-another-republican-budget-surrender/,Right,"OPINION:

On Tuesday night, the House and Senate Budget Committees reached a bipartisan budget deal. Congress hasn’t passed a budget in five years, but this new deal is hardly good news. The Ryan-Murray budget deal increases spending on domestic programs by $45 billion in 2014 and $18 billion in 2015, totaling $63 billion over the next two years. It blows through the caps set by the Budget Control Act while promising spending reductions down the road over the next 10 years.

Personally, I am wary of accepting a spending increase now for deficit reductions we may not see until 2024, if at all. How can leadership credibly promise spending cuts later, after agreeing to a plan that rolls back the sequestration savings promised two debt increases ago? There’s a predictable pattern here, and it always leaves citizens footing the bill.

Republican leadership argues that conservatives should keep calm because these new spending increases will be offset by fees, including $12.6 billion in higher security fees for airline passengers. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, announced he is “proud” of the deal, saying it reduces the deficit without raising taxes and imposes smart spending cuts that avert the indiscriminate approach of the sequestration.

You’ll be paying more for an airplane ticket, but don’t worry — it’s not a tax. No matter what they call it, the fact remains that government is planning to take more money from you to cover their unsustainable spending habits.

Rather than standing on principle when it counts, Republican leadership has once again sided with the Democrats to increase spending and taxes for short-term political relief, leaving “we the people” to foot the bill.

To add insult to injury, House Speaker John A. Boehner directed his fire away from the big spenders and toward fiscally conservative groups who are actually committed to reducing the debt. In his news conference Wednesday morning, Mr. Boehner lashed out at conservative grass-roots organizations such as FreedomWorks, saying, “They’re using our members, and they’re using the American people, for their own goals,” calling opposition to the deal “ridiculous.”

Mr. Boehner’s real problem here isn’t with conservative groups like FreedomWorks — it’s with millions of individual Americans who vote Republican because they were told the GOP was the party of small government and fiscal responsibility.

After two years of failed negotiations and failed supercommittees, Republicans have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory once again by surrendering the sequestration, the backup plan to their original budgetary-negotiation backup plan.

Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, Washington Democrat, hailed the deal, saying it shows “we can do something without another crisis lurking around the corner.”

While deal-making for the sake of deal-making isn’t a particularly compelling argument for grass-roots conservatives, Mrs. Murray was right about one thing: We have to stop making policy decisions on a crisis-by-crisis basis.

The root of America’s spending problem is the failure of Congress to pass a real budget for five years. Ramming through a bad budget deal in the 11th hour might stave off the immediate, if overblown, threat of a government shutdown in January. However, any budget that gives government more leeway to keep spending is a bum deal for the American people, and merely sets the country up for a bigger crisis down the road.

This budget deal is nothing more than another short-term fix. With more than $17 trillion in national debt, Congress needs to make the necessary long-term cuts and changes now, or future generations will have to face the consequences. That’s why FreedomWorks and other conservative groups have pushed back against the Ryan-Murray budget disappointment, and we will continue driving thousands of messages to Congress to demand a budget that contains serious long-term spending cuts and entitlement reform.

A series of delays and exemptions by the White House have watered down and pushed back key deadlines for the individual mandate. Despite its heavy campaigning for enrollment, the administration has been reluctant to brandish the threat of penalties under the Affordable Care Act for those who don’t comply.

“You have not heard them say that at all,” said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Avalere Health, a Washington-based consultancy.

Obamacare’s authors included the annual penalty to ensure enough healthy Americans enter the market and pay premiums to offset the costs incurred by those with pre-existing conditions who no longer can be denied insurance coverage.

The mandate was the most contentious part of the law for several years and became a major issue in the 2012 Republican presidential primary campaigns.

Also in 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that the mandate was a tax and therefore constitutional.

Now, the nuts-and-bolts decisions about coverage have overtaken the philosophical conversations — at least for those rushing to sign up.

When applicants flooded the D.C. health care exchange ahead of New Year’s Day, no one said they were signing up to be in compliance with the mandate.

“I’ve never heard that, actually,” said Mila Kofman, executive director of D.C. Health Link.

Don’t expect that to last.

As the three-month grace period begins, officials said, they will make consumers aware of the legal obligation to have health care coverage.

“We will be putting a bit more emphasis on the penalty in our messaging during the next three months, to make sure people are fully aware of it,” said Gwenda Bond, a spokeswoman for Kentucky’s state-run exchange, known as Kynect.

PHOTOS: So long 2013, and to the famous faces we said goodbye to in the past year

“That said, we have expected all along that it will take a few years for people to understand the ACA’s impact, including the mandate, and to get the uninsured population insured,” she said.

Delaying the pain

A major reason for giving little attention to the mandate this week is that the administration has imposed so many delays and exemptions as it struggles to implement the law.

One of those moves was a six-week delay of the deadline, until March 31, for Americans to prove that they have signed up for coverage in time to avoid the penalty for going at least three months without insurance.

The original provisions also included exemptions for illegal immigrants, prisoners, those with religious conscience objections, and people who pay for one another’s medical costs through health care “sharing ministries.”

Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Tuesday granted another exemption for an organization that objected to the contraception mandate tied to Obamacare, saying a group of Colorado nuns who sued over the rule on religious grounds should not have to comply with it until the high court considers the case on its merits this term.

The administrative rule requires large employers to insure birth control as part of their health care plans, including morning-after pills that some religious groups equate with abortion. Republican critics of the law insist that both the contraception and the individual mandate be eliminated. Their own plans for health care reform incorporate some of the Obamacare concepts, but not the mandates. Even a few Democrats are questioning the rule, particularly given the troubles many applicants have experienced.

Sen. Joe Manchin III, West Virginia Democrat, has pushed for a one-year delay of the mandate, saying 2014 should be a “transitional year” for Mr. Obama’s signature reform.

On Monday, former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said the mandate “doesn’t really matter that much” but could be politically damaging to Democrats in the midterm elections.

The White House brought some of these doubts on itself in recent weeks by sapping the strength of the mandates.

Under political pressure, the administration said people who lost bare-bones plans because of the law’s coverage requirements could apply for hardship exemptions and acquire basic plans that cover only catastrophic illnesses. The move undercut the administration’s own premise — that low-level plans on the individual market were junk and that the insurance exchanges would provide better, more affordable coverage.

Mr. Mendelson said the move should have a “very small effect” because consumers are likely to find the lowest-tier “bronze plans” on the Obamacare exchange that are similar in price yet offer better coverage than catastrophic plans.

Those who think they do not need health insurance have another reason to procrastinate: The fine for violating the mandate doesn’t have much teeth until the second year.

A single adult who flouts the rule in 2014 must pay $95 or 1 percent of adjusted gross income, whichever is higher. The baseline penalty climbs in 2015 to $325 or 2 percent of adjusted income. In 2016, it will be $695 or 2.5 percent.

The penalties are among a series of taxes and fees designed to pay for the reforms, including government-subsidized plans on the health care exchanges and the state-by-state expansion of Medicaid, which is now optional.

A mandate on large employers was supposed to take effect alongside the individual mandate, but it has been delayed until 2015. Other taxes took effect from 2010 to 2013, and a tax on health insurers takes effect in 2014 — right alongside the individual mandate.

“The mandate is there,” Mr. Mendelson said. “It exists.”

1680,1680,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/30/obamacare-supervisor-retires-second-official-leave/,Right,"An Obama administration official who supervised the balky rollout of the health care law is retiring, the nation’s Medicare agency said Monday.

Michelle Snyder served as chief operating officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and oversaw the development and debut of HealthCare.gov, the federal Obamacare website that suffered from rampant glitches in October and November before its turnaround by early December.

“I regret to announce that, after 41 years of outstanding public service, CMS Chief Operating Officer Michelle Snyder is retiring at the end of 2013,” CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner said. “While we celebrate her distinguished career, we are also sadly saying farewell to a good friend and a key member of the agency’s leadership team.”

Ms. Tavenner said Ms. Snyder was ready to retire at the end of 2012, but she stayed on to help her with “the challenges facing CMS in 2013.”

Ms. Snyder’s deputy, Tim Love, will serve as acting chief operating officer.

Ms. Snyder is the second top CMS official to depart since the disastrous debut of Obamacare’s insurance markets on Oct. 1. The agency’s chief information officer, Tony Trenkle, left in November for a job in the private sector.

Before Congress in November, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius named Ms. Snyder as a key person responsible for the HealthCare.gov project.

But, she added, “Hold me accountable for the debacle.”

Rep. Darrell Issa, California Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, offered a few parting shots for Ms. Snyder, saying she gave the troubled Obamacare website the green light despite red flags about its security.

“Documents and interviews indicate Michelle Snyder’s involvement in bypassing the recommendation of CMS’ top security expert who recommended delaying the launch of HealthCare.gov after independent testers raised concern about serious vulnerabilities from a lack of adequate security testing,” he said. “Americans seeking health insurance are left to shoulder the risk of a website that’s still an all-around work in progress because of the cult-like commitment officials had to the arbitrary goal of launching on Oct. 1.”

“For decades, Republicans and Democrats have put partisanship and ideology aside to offer some security for job-seekers,” Mr. Obama said in his weekly address. “Instead of punishing families who can least afford it, Republicans should make it their New Year’s resolution to do the right thing and restore this vital economic security for their constituents right now.”

Next Tuesday, Mr. Obama — who comes back Sunday from an lengthy holiday vacation in Hawaii — will host a White House meeting with some of the 1.3 million Americans who saw their unemployment insurance expire on Dec. 28.

The meeting is the latest step in the administration’s ongoing effort to push, prod and shame Congress into extending those benefits, which have become something of a political lightning rod as congressional Republicans demand budget offsets to pay for any extension.

But the White House isn’t focusing on the costs, estimated to be about $6.5 billion for a three-month extension, as is currently being proposed in the Senate.

Instead, Mr. Obama and other administration officials are casting an extension as the right, American thing to do.

“We make this promise to one another because it makes a difference to a mother who needs help feeding her kids while she’s looking for work; to a father who needs help paying the rent while learning the skills to get a new and better job,” Mr. Obama said. “And denying families that security is just plain cruel. We’re a better country than that. We don’t abandon our fellow Americans when times get tough. We keep the faith with them until they start that new job.”

The counter-argument, offered by some congressional Republicans and others, is that extending unemployment benefits yet again actually makes it less likely that out-of-work Americans will go out and find “that new job,” as the president put it.

Still, it’s politically treacherous for the GOP to be seen as standing in the way of financial help for those still looking for work in a down economy. That’s led some Republicans to seek a bipartisan solution.

A Senate bill to extend benefits for three months, sponsored by Sen. Dean Heller, Nevada Republican, and Sen. Jack Reed, Rhode Island Democrat, could come up for a vote as soon as Monday.

Senate leaders, however, reportedly aren’t sure it will garner the needed 60 votes to proceed.

The past several days have seen an all-out push from the administration and congressional Democrats ahead of next week’s possible vote. In addition to the president’s address, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and other officials hosted a conference call Friday focused on the economic consequences of of not extending jobless benefits.

He argued that past Congresses routinely extended unemployment benefits without demanding offsets elsewhere in the budget.

“There is a long, proud, bipartisan history of expanding emergency unemployment benefits during times like this, dating back decades, whether it was the recession of 1981 or as recently as four years ago, when President Bush was president,” Mr. Perez said on MSNBC’s “The Daily Rundown.”

Congressional Democrats held their own conference call and focused on the same issue. They touted a new analysis, conducted by House Ways and Means Committee Democrats, showing that more than $400 million has bled out of the economy since benefits expired last week.

Subpoenas went out to key senior staffers in Mr. Christie’s official office and his 2013 re-election campaign, as well as to Bridget Anne Kelly, the former deputy chief of staff whose email seemingly ordering the traffic problems in Fort Lee led to the scandal.

The subpoenas specifically listed the governor’s office itself, and Christie for Governor Inc., his 2013 campaign, as targets.

The subpoenas were issued Thursday, just hours after the New Jersey Assembly voted to create a special investigative committee and give it subpoena authority. Democrats, who control the assembly, issued the subpoenas but withheld the names of the targets until they were all served.

1706,1706,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/17/obama-continue-modified-nsa-meta-data-gathering-pr/,Right,"President Obama on Friday will announce some changes to how data gathered by the National Security Agency is stored but will allow the collection of that information to continue, according to multiple media reports.

In a widely anticipated speech to be delivered from the Justice Department, the president is expected to recommend that a third party retain the “meta-data” now housed by the federal government, and that the government only be allowed access to that data after a judicial finding in its favor.

The changes come after Mr. Obama’s own hand-picked review panel in December delivered 46 specific recommendations on how U.S. surveillance and data-collection programs could be overhauled to increase transparency and better protect the privacy of Americans.

But privacy advocates don’t believe the changes Mr. Obama is expected to unveil on Friday will make much of a difference and cast them as cosmetic fixes primarily designed to appease critics. Allowing third parties to store data on millions of Americans “won’t solve the problem. It would just outsource it,” said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.

If phone companies ultimately are the ones to hold the data, that presents a whole new set of problems, Ms. Goitein said, adding it would set a “dangerous precedent” for the government to “launder its surveillance activities through private parties. “It would turn these service providers into agents of the intelligence community,” she said.

1707,1707,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/16/congress-passes-11-trillion-spending-bill/,Right,"WASHINGTON — Congress sent President Barack Obama a $1.1 trillion government-wide spending bill Thursday, easing the harshest effects of last year’s automatic budget cuts after tea party critics chastened by October’s partial shutdown mounted only a faint protest.

The Senate voted 72-26 for the measure, which cleared the House a little more than 24 hours earlier on a similarly lopsided vote. Obama’s signature on the bill was expected in time to prevent any interruption in government funding Saturday at midnight.

The huge bill funds every agency of government, pairing increases for NASA and Army Corps of Engineers construction projects with cuts to the Internal Revenue Service and foreign aid. It pays for implementation of Obama’s health care law; a fight over implementing “Obamacare” sparked tea party Republicans to partially shut the government down for 16 days last October.

Also included is funding for tighter regulations on financial markets, but at levels lower than the president wanted.

The compromise-laden legislation reflects the realities of divided power in Washington and a desire by both Democrats and Republicans for an election-year respite after three years of budget wars that had Congress and the White House lurching from crisis to crisis. Both parties looked upon the measure as a way to ease automatic spending cuts that both the Pentagon and domestic agencies had to begin absorbing last year.

All 53 Democrats, two independents and 17 Republicans voted for the bill. The 26 votes against it were all cast by Republicans.

Shortly before the final vote, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, delivered a slashing attack on Senate Democrats, accusing them of ignoring the problems caused by the health care law. “It is abundantly clear that millions of Americans are being harmed right now by this failed law,” Cruz said.

Unlike last fall, when he spoke for 21 straight hours and helped force the government shutdown over defunding “Obamacare,” this time he clocked in at 17 minutes and simply asked the Senate to unanimously approve an amendment to strip out Obamacare funding. Democrats easily repelled the maneuver.

The 1582-page bill was really 12 bills wrapped into one in negotiations headed by Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., and Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., respective chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations committees, and their subcommittee lieutenants. They spent weeks hashing out line-by-line details of a broad two-year budget accord passed in December, the first since 2009.

The bill, which cleared the House on a vote of 359-67, increases spending by about $26 billion over fiscal 2013, with most of the increase going to domestic programs. Almost $9 billion in unrequested money for overseas military and diplomatic operations helps ease shortfalls in the Pentagon and foreign aid budgets.

The nuts-and-bolts culture of the appropriators is evident throughout the bill. Lower costs to replace screening equipment, for example, allowed for a cut to the Transportation Security Administration. Lawmakers blocked the Agriculture Department from closing six research facilities. And the Environmental Protection Agency is barred from issuing rules on methane emissions from large livestock operations.

Another provision exempts disabled veterans and surviving military spouses from a pension cut enacted last month. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, signaled in a brief hallway conversation with The Associated Press that he would oppose a broader drive to repeal the entire pension provision, which saves $6 billion over the coming decade by reducing the annual cost-of-living adjustment for working age military retirees by 1 percentage point.

The National Institutes of Health’s proposed budget of $29.9 billion falls short of the $31 billion budget it won when Democrats controlled Congress. Democrats did win a $100 million increase, to $600 million, for so-called TIGER grants for high-priority transportation infrastructure projects, a program that started with a 2009 economic stimulus bill.

Civilian federal workers would get their first pay hike in four years, a 1 percent cost-of-living increase. Democrats celebrated winning an addition $1 billion over last year for the Head Start early childhood education program and excluding from the bill a host of conservative policy “riders” advanced by the GOP.

Rogers won two provisions backed by the coal industry. One would block the EPA and Corps of Engineers from working on new rules on “fill material” related to the mountain top removal mining. Another would keep the door open for Export-Import Bank financing of coal power plants overseas.

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, a tea party favorite, didn’t mention the measure’s funding of Obamacare in a floor speech earlier in the week; instead he complained at length that the measure dropped funding of a federal program that sends payments to Western states in which much of the land is owned by the federal government and therefore can’t be taxed by local governments."
1710,1710,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/21/mcdonnell-wife-indicted-federal-corruption-charges/,Right,"Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were indicted Tuesday on federal corruption charges stemming from their relationship with a wealthy businessman in a case sure to test the ethical boundaries between friendship and political influence.

Former health supplement company executive Jonnie R. Williams Sr. plied the McDonnells with gifts and loans and, in return, received access in order to peddle his products, charging documents filed Tuesday claim.

Mr. McDonnell on Tuesday night reiterated that he did nothing wrong — Virginia law does not require the disclosure of gifts to family members — and insisted that the gifts were motivated by nothing more than friendship.

But now the former governor and first lady face 14 federal charges, including conspiracy to defraud citizens of Virginia and obtaining property under color of official right.

Mr. McDonnell also was charged with giving a false statement to a credit union for neglecting to mention a $50,000 loan from Mr. Williams. Mrs. McDonnell faces a charge of obstructing an official proceeding for attempting to return to Mr. Williams some items of clothing he bought for her after an investigation had begun.

The McDonnells were scheduled to make an initial court appearance in U.S. District Court in Richmond on Friday. If convicted, each could face a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines.

SEE ALSO: Farewell speech: McDonnell apologizes to Assembly

The 43-page indictment also seeks the forfeiture of more than $140,000 as well as dozens of gifts received by the McDonnells, including a silver Rolex watch engraved with the phrase “71st Governor of Virginia,” several pairs of high-end Louis Vuitton shoes, a slew of golf apparel and equipment and 30 boxes of Anatabloc — the signature product of Star Scientific.

Prosecutors said that, in exchange for gifts and loans, Mr. McDonnell arranged meetings for Mr. Williams with Virginia government officials, hosting and attending events at the governor’s mansion designed to promote Mr. Williams’ product among government officials and industry researchers.

A defiant Mr. McDonnell on Tuesday night addressed the charges before reporters at a Richmond law firm, presenting himself as someone who has been “falsely and wrongly accused and whose public service has been wrongly attacked.”

“While I deeply regret accepting these legal gifts and loans from Mr. Williams, all of these now have been returned or repaid with interest,” he said in a seven-minute statement. “I have apologized for my poor judgment and I accept full responsibility for accepting these legal gifts and loans.”

The former governor cited two “independent and nonpolitical investigations have confirmed that Mr. Williams and Star Scientific received nothing from the state.” He said the charges stem from a “misguided” legal theory that would suggest that facilitating an introduction or arranging a meeting is a federal crime if it involves a political donor or someone who gave someone a gift.

He also said he intends to fight the charges.

“I will use every available resource and advocate that I have for as long as it takes to fight and prevail against these false allegations and the unjust overreach of the federal government,” said Mr. McDonnell, who appeared alongside his wife and daughter and did not take questions afterward.

The indictment put Mrs. McDonnell firmly at the center of the case, facilitating contact between the governor and the wealthy businessman. It details how, after Mr. Williams dropped more than $18,000 on an April 13, 2011, shopping trip for her in New York City, she ensured that Mr. Williams was seated next to the governor during a Union League Club event that evening.

The indictment also spotlighted Mrs. McDonnell’s request that Mr. Williams foot the bill for an Oscar de la Renta dress to wear at her husband’s January 2010 inauguration.

A McDonnell staffer expressed concern over the prospect of Mr. Williams purchasing the dress for Mrs. McDonnell, causing her to decline the offer but to take a “rain check.”

The first lady responded in an email that contained a candid disclosure of the McDonnells’ personal financial situation as they moved into the governor’s mansion.

“I need to talk to you about Inaugural clothing budget. I need answers and Bob is screaming about the thousands I’m charging up in credit card debt,” Mrs. McDonnell wrote to the unidentified staffer. “We are broke, have an unconscionable amount in credit card debt already, and this Inaugural is killing us!!”

Over the course of the next two years, the first couple continued to publicly support Star Scientific. Mrs. McDonnell flew on Mr. Williams’ private jet to a Star Scientific event in Florida within weeks of striking a deal for the family to borrow $50,000 from Mr. Williams. During the same period, Mr. Williams provided the family $15,000 to pay for wedding expenses for the McDonnells’ daughter, the indictment states.

Mr. Williams is not named in the indictment, but descriptions of a “JW” match publicly known accounts of his relationship with the McDonnells.

The charges were the outgrowth of an investigation into the former executive mansion chef, who was fired in early 2012 after he was accused of stealing food from the mansion kitchen. The chef, Todd Schneider, countered by saying he was told to take food as payment for catering events.

In response to the charges filed Tuesday, Mr. McDonnell’s attorneys immediately filed a motion requesting the disclosure of recordings of the prosecutors’ statements to the grand jury about the legal validity of the accusations.

“Bob McDonnell is an innocent man,” the 27-page filing begins.

It goes to call Mr. McDonnell’s actions “routine political conduct” and draws comparisons to activities of the president and Mr. McDonnell’s predecessor, Democrat Tim Kaine.

“The government’s rickety legal foundation, moreover, underlies a precarious factual case, built largely from immunized testimony purchased with under-the-table promises to a key witness who would otherwise face criminal liability and massive financial penalties,” the motion states, referring to Mr. Williams’ cooperation with investigators.

Mr. McDonnell said repeatedly that he never attempted to hide his friendship with Mr. Williams and that neither Mr. Williams nor his company got special benefits out of their close-knit relationship, though the indictment hints at ways that Mr. Williams appeared to be seeking influence.

The court papers note that Mr. Williams proposed the idea of having Virginia government employees use Anatabloc as a control group for research studies. He also sought to influence an outside party, first the Virginia Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalization Commission and later state universities, to provide either grants or research for the study of anatabine — the active ingredient in the company’s products.

Star Scientific was featured prominently at the Governor’s Mansion, once during the launch of the company’s Anatabloc product and a second time during a 2012 reception for health care leaders in the state.

Many people inside and outside the state were stunned that Mr. McDonnell, once considered a potential vice presidential pick or Cabinet selection, ended up mired by the scandal over lavish gifts and loans from Mr. Williams.

The Republican leadership in Virginia’s House of Delegates issued a statement expressing its disappointment, while highlighting Mr. McDonnell’s public service and saying the legal process should be allowed to run its course.

Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, issued a statement saying he was “obviously troubled” by the developments.

“As this case progresses, it is my sincerest hope that justice will be served and that Virginians get the answers to which they are entitled,” he said.

The 1,532-page bill, which funds the government for fiscal year 2014, also demands the NSA report on all of its other bulk data collection programs, which could expose some of the email tracking programs the government has reportedly run.

Together, they mark the first major swipes Congress will have taken against the NSA since the secretive agency’s snooping programs were revealed by former government contractor Edward Snowden.

The bill doesn’t contain any restrictions on the NSA, but rather requires the agency to detail its activities. Those details have been coming out in bits and pieces, prompted by Mr. Snowden’s leaks.

The new spending bill, which House and Senate negotiators finalized Monday night and which is expected to pass Congress this week, requires the NSA to describe the terrorist plots it believes have been disrupted through its telephone snooping program.

1722,1722,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/26/obama-to-focus-state-of-the-union-address-on-incom/,Right,"President Obama’s State of the Union address Tuesday night is shaping up as an election-year rallying cry to his Democratic base to fight for income equality in America, even as the gap between rich and poor grows during his presidency.

Mr. Obama’s nationally televised speech to a joint session of Congress at 9 p.m. will strike themes intended to fire up Democratic voters for the midterm elections, including proposals for a nearly 40 percent hike in the federal minimum wage and an extension of long-term unemployment benefits.

Aides say Mr. Obama also will remind lawmakers that he intends to issue more executive orders in this “year of action” after criticizing the 2013 Congress as one of the most unproductive in history. He is expected to announce executive actions on job training and retirement security.

Mr. Obama also will renew the call for comprehensive immigration reform, one of the few legislative issues on which there still appears to be room for compromise between the president and House Republicans.

Lawmakers in both parties are intent to learn whether Mr. Obama will call for fast-track authority to complete trade deals in Asia and Europe, although a majority of House Democrats oppose the move in allegiance with their labor base. Tea party conservatives also oppose the move.

But the president is expected to focus on economic “fairness” issues, such as the minimum wage, as part of his push to reverse increasing income disparity in America, which he calls “the defining issue of our time.”

SEE ALSO: Obama to use State of the Union address to showcase his use of executive action

Rich man, poor man

That income gap also has helped define Mr. Obama’s presidency. After-tax corporate profits in America are at their highest levels since World War II, while workers are receiving a smaller share of economic output than at any other time since 1952.

In 2012, the richest 10 percent of Americans earned their largest share of income since 1917, said Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. Meanwhile, Census Bureau statistics showed that real average income among the poorest 20 percent of families continued to fall each year from 2009 to 2011.

Lance Roberts, a Houston economist, said policies during Mr. Obama’s presidency have exacerbated the gap between rich and poor. He cited the Federal Reserve’s rounds of “quantitative easing,” which have pumped trillions of dollars into Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities as economic stimulus. The pumping, he said, resulted in higher stock prices as investors were forced out of the bond markets.

“Seventy-six percent of people in this country live paycheck to paycheck,” said Mr. Roberts, CEO of STA Wealth Management. “They don’t have any money in the market. So you’ve had this massive surge in profits and this massive surge in asset prices, but none of that has filtered down to Main Street America. They don’t see the economy being a lot better.”

The debt ceiling deal that Mr. Obama struck with congressional Republicans in 2011, which set into motion the sequestration budget cuts last year, also tended to hurt lower-income people, Mr. Roberts said.

SEE ALSO: White House’s Pfeiffer: Obama ready to take action with or without GOP

“It didn’t affect the top 10 percent of the population at all,” he said.

Mr. Obama’s aides say he has promoted policies such as expanded child tax credits that have lifted millions of people out of poverty. One of the president’s first acts in office was to sign the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which made it easier for workers to file lawsuits alleging paycheck discrimination.

But as the president has tried to strengthen the recovery from the Great Recession of 2007-2009, evidence suggests his policies are not closing the gap. A record 23 million households received food stamps last year, a jump of 51 percent since 2009. The Agriculture Department said a total of 47.6 million people were on food stamps last year, an increase of 1 million from 2012.

Focusing on income inequality does give the president a popular, poll-tested campaign issue in a year when he needs to avoid being a drag on his party, which is in danger of losing the Senate.

“He’s been very partisan on almost every major occasion where he gives speeches on inequality,” said Ron Haskins, a specialist on welfare issues at the left-leaning Brookings Institution. “Democrats love this agenda.”

Changing the subject

Saddled with a weak economy, low job approval ratings and the persistent problems of his health care law, Mr. Obama has good reasons to change the subject.

“This whole promotion about income inequality is about diverting your attention from the real problem,” said Mr. Roberts of Houston. “The real issue is the impact of the Affordable Care Act this year as it hits consumers.”

White House press secretary Jay Carney dismissed criticism that Mr. Obama is changing the public discourse, saying the president has been focused on improving economic opportunities for all since his first day in office.

“That’s been his central preoccupation since he first thought about running for the Senate and then the presidency,” Mr. Carney said. “And you can certainly expect that that will be the focus of what he talks about not just [Tuesday] but throughout the rest of his presidency.”

Economic fairness polls well. The George Washington University battleground poll found last week that 79 percent of respondents believe income inequality is either a “big problem” or “somewhat of a problem.” Among undecided voters, 84 percent shared those views.

Democratic pollsters Celinda Lake and Alex Dunn, in their review of the survey, said elections last year in New Jersey, Washington state and New York City proved that Democratic voters were motivated by raising the minimum wage and by other economic “fairness” issues.

“Democrats are poised to harness this energy through their charge to raise the federal minimum wage and provide economic help for working class Americans still struggling to find a place in the new economy,” they wrote. “Voters will reward an economic vision relying on policy prescriptions that offer relief to struggling middle-class families by leveling the playing field.”

But they said Republican voters appear to be more energized than Democrats this year and that there are concerns about low turnout in November among young voters, Hispanics and single white women — key blocs for Democrats.

“Consolidating and turning out young voters (and other key progressive constituencies such as unmarried women, African American voters, and Latinos) in November rests on Democrats’ ability to connect with their core values and make 2014 a year that can produce positive change in their lives,” said Ms. Lake and Mr. Dunn. “African Americans, Democrats, and liberals disproportionately want a State of the Union speech that addresses income inequality.”

Skeptical Republicans

Republican pollsters Ed Goeas and Brian Nienaber said Mr. Obama is trying to overcome persistently strong opposition to Obamacare and public dissatisfaction with his job results.

“With Obamacare struggling to garner support, President Obama and the Democrats have indicated that they want to return to a more reliable political play — class warfare — and have been telegraphing their strategy to push ‘income inequality’ as their rally cry,” they wrote.

But they noted that voters are evenly split in the GW poll about the preferred solution for addressing income inequality; 45 percent favor cutting taxes and reducing regulations, while 43 percent favor “closing the gap.”

Republican lawmakers have voiced opposition to raising the minimum wage this year, and the president’s liberal supporters are urging him to sign an executive order that would raise the minimum wage for federal contractors as an alternative.

It’s just one example of ways that Mr. Obama could try to bypass Congress with a renewed emphasis on executive action. At a White House reception last week for the nation’s mayors, the president promised to take more unilateral steps to help cities.

But at the same event, Vice President Joseph R. Biden unintentionally defined the limits of executive action when he urged the mayors to confer with Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, a former mayor of Charlotte, N.C., about their infrastructure needs.

“He doesn’t have all the money in the world, but he’s ready to help,” Mr. Biden said, inadvertently reminding everyone in the room that Congress, not the president, controls the nation’s purse strings.

Chris Christie was aware of the lane closures when they happened.

Alan L. Zegas, who is representing David Wildstein, the official who ordered the lane closures and resigned as a result last year, said in a letter to the legal counsel for the Port Authority that there is evidence “tying Mr. Christie to having knowledge of the lane closures, during the period when the lanes were closed, contrary to what the Governor stated publicly.”

“Mr. Wildstein contests the accuracy of various statements that the Governor made about him and he can prove the inaccuracy of some,” said the attorney, Alan L. Zegas.

The new allegations surfaced as part of an ongoing spat over whether the Port Authority should cover the legal expenses of Mr. Wildstein, and raise new questions about what Mr. Christie knew about the mid-September lane closures on the George Washington Bridge.

Emails seemed to indicate the traffic jams were orchestrated by members of Mr. Christie’s inner circle and his allies at the Port Authority, including Mr. Wildstein, and were done so apparently to get back at a local Democratic mayor who refused to endorse his re-election bid.

Mr. Christie vehemently denied any wrongdoing on his part and said he did not know about his aides’ decision to exact retribution. He apologized, fired a deputy chief of staff and ousted a top adviser.

1746,1746,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/5/republicans-increasingly-pessimistic-immigration-b/,Right,"Conservative Republicans said Wednesday that they don’t believe their chamber will tackle an immigration bill this year, saying that while they welcomed the House GOP leaders’ principles as a start to a conversation, it’s premature to try to pass a bill.

Speaking at a Heritage Foundation event, Republican House members said they don’t trust President Obama enough to follow through on the strict security measures the GOP would write into any bill, and said that must come first.

Rep. Raul Labrador, an Idaho Republican who last year was part of a group working on a broad immigration bill but who dropped out, scuttling the effort, said Mr. Obama should spend this year proving himself and then Republicans will act in 2015 if they win control of the Senate.

“We need to have the trust with this administration and that trust is not there, and until we have that trust there will be no immigration reform and it would be a mistake for leadership to push that,” Mr. Labrador said.

House Speaker John A. Boehner last week released principles that called for more security but also called for illegal immigrants getting legal status, and for young adult illegal immigrants to have a specific pathway to citizenship.

But Mr. Boehner himself said Tuesday that Republicans still haven’t decided whether to move forward with a bill this year.

Rep. Joe Barton, Texas Republican, said that while it’s not the right time to actually move a broad bill, the principles themselves are helpful to “begin a dialogue with the Hispanic community on conservative principles.”

The Senate passed a broad bill in June that includes citizenship rights for most illegal immigrants, clearing the measure on a bipartisan 68-32 vote. But even that legislation has run into problems.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, who voted against the Senate bill, said Tuesday that he doesn’t think there’s any way to match that legislation up with what the House is talking about.

“I don’t see how you get to an outcome this year with the two bodies in such a different place,” he said.

Democrats had hoped the release of the principles would pave the way for an agreement this year.

But the two sides are still far apart on big questions.

House Republicans have insisted the issue be tackled in a series of bills, while the Senate passed one massive measure. House Republicans also have insisted border security must come first, while the Senate bill grants quick legal status to most illegal immigrants while concurrently working to add more manpower and technology to the border.

The biggest sticking point, however, is the questions of citizenship. The Senate bill would offer a new specific pathway that would let most illegal immigrants get citizenship in about 13 years. House Republicans’ principles call for illegal immigrants to get some form of legal status, but only specifies a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants, the so-called Dreamers brought to the U.S. by their parents, who are considered the most sympathetic cases.

1749,1749,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/4/cbo-obamacare-push-2m-workers-out-labor-market/,Right,"Obamacare will push the equivalent of about 2 million workers out of the labor market by 2017 as employees decide either to work fewer hours or drop out of the job market altogether, according to estimates released Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office.

The analysis set off a furious debate in Washington. The White House argued that the reduction is positive because it means Americans will forgo jobs or extra work to stay home with their children or strike out on their own as entrepreneurs. Republicans, however, said the report amounted to an “I told you so” moment and that subtracting the equivalent of 2 million workers can’t be good for the economy.

The CBO said the number of workers dropping out of the labor force will grow from 2 million in 2017 to 2.5 million by 2024.

Although part of those numbers are attributed to job cuts, the vast majority represent workers who decide it makes more sense to stay home or work fewer hours, weighing the higher taxes they pay in the workforce versus their qualifications for benefits if they drop out.

“CBO estimates that the ACA will reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 to 2 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor — given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive,” the nonpartisan tax agency said in its economic outlook.

The CBO also said the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges will enroll 6 million people by the first deadline in March, which is 1 million fewer than earlier projections. But by the end of the decade, the number of people without insurance coverage will have dropped from 45 million today to 30 million, the agency said in its annual update on the economic and budget outlook.

Powered by spending cuts, higher taxes and a slowly improving economy, the federal deficit will drop to less than a half-trillion dollars next year but then begin a steady climb to more than $1 trillion a year by 2022, according to CBO projections.

Slower recovery

The CBO said the economic recovery from the deep recession from December 2007 to June 2009 is taking longer and won’t be as strong as previous recoveries. Analysts say the labor market’s fundamentals have shifted.

Obamacare is one part of that because it rearranges incentives for businesses and workers.

White House chief economic adviser Jason Furman said the health care law is about giving workers more choices. He compared it to Social Security and Medicare, which he said gave senior citizens the incentives and financial wherewithal to retire.

In this case, he said, the CBO’s numbers show that the health care law will let younger workers make decisions about whether to remain in the workforce.

“Maybe a spouse who wanted to be part-time so they could spend more time with their family now is able to do that,” Mr. Furman told reporters. “Somebody else who wanted to start a business and become an entrepreneur and was terrified of doing it because they’d lose their health insurance, is now able to do that too, and switch and take a chance on creating jobs and growing the overall economy. So there’s a lot of new choices that this will facilitate.”

At the same time, Mr. Furman said he doesn’t agree with the CBO’s numbers. He argues that agency analysts didn’t take into account lower health care costs and higher worker productivity that would create hundreds of thousands of jobs a year.

Republicans, though, used the jobs number to attack Senate Democrats seeking re-election in November.

“This is one of the perverse incentives in this terrible law. It actually encourages able-bodied people to not work,” said Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming Republican. “We should be doing all that we can to increase labor force participation. The health care law actually pushes it in the opposite direction.”

Deficit progress

Taking the budget as a whole, the CBO said Congress has made substantial headway on cutting spending and raising taxes, which will reduce the deficit to $514 billion this year and $478 billion in 2015.

But it will rise by 2016 and steadily grow to more than $1 trillion in 2022.

The CBO report said the economy isn’t rebounding as fast as is typical after a recession and that poor growth means less revenue for the Treasury. That means the cumulative deficit over the next decade will be $1 trillion more than projected last year.

National debt, which is the accumulation of annual deficits, is at its highest level since the aftermath of World War II. The CBO said debt held by the public will represent 80 percent of gross domestic product by 2024, the end of the budget window.

The report will give ammunition to those who argued that tax increases or spending cuts should have been delayed while the government pursued more economic stimulus over the past few years.

But the CBO suggested that the problems are more structural, given the aging U.S. population and women’s participation in the labor force.

The report said the labor market for the rest of this decade will recover more slowly than analysts predicted last year.

The analysts said that at the deepest part of the recession, GDP was 7.5 percent below the economy’s potential output. By the end of 2013, just half of that gap had been closed, meaning the economy still has plenty of room to improve.

“With output growing so slowly, payrolls have increased slowly as well — and the slack in the labor market that can be seen in the elevated unemployment rate and part of the reduction in the rate of labor force participation mirrors the gap between actual and potential GDP,” the CBO study said.

1751,1751,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/5/specter-of-welfare-state-jolts-democrats/,Right,"The White House and congressional Democrats are trying to limit the fallout from the politically damaging conclusion in a Congressional Budget Office report that the Obamacare entitlement creates a major incentive for some people not to work.

While some critics focused on a finding by the CBO that Obamacare will result in 2.5 million fewer workers over a decade, conservatives said the bigger fundamental issue highlighted in the report is one familiar to the welfare state — that taxpayer-funded government subsidies provide disincentives for full-time work.

“People used to be stuck in jobs because they needed the health insurance,” said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a practicing physician and a specialist on health care policy at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. “Now they’re going to be prevented from taking jobs because they need the subsidies.”

The CBO forecast continued to reverberate across Capitol Hill on multiple issues. The nonpartisan budget agency’s prediction that the U.S. jobless rate likely will stay above 6 percent through 2016 was revealed as Senate Democrats were preparing a push for another extension of benefits to the long-term unemployed, raising the prospect that the government will face much higher benefit costs over the coming years.

The Senate is expected to stage a test vote Thursday on extending the long-term jobless benefits.

Reviving the argument over the perils of an entitlement program in Obamacare is the last thing Democrats want in this election year, when they were already contending with the public’s anger over Obamacare’s botched rollout and reports of canceled insurance policies.

President Obama, who has been huddling with congressional Democrats about election strategy this week, encountered fresh concern during a meeting at the White House with lawmakers Tuesday when Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, New Hampshire Democrat, told the president that he should fire someone over the mistakes.

Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska and some other Democrats don’t want Mr. Obama to appear with them on the campaign trail. Mr. Begich said after the president’s State of the Union address, “I don’t need him campaigning for me — I need him to change some of his policies.”

Asked whether many Democratic incumbents are avoiding the president, White House press secretary Jay Carney replied Wednesday, “The president is assisting Democrats in ways that they ask him to and, obviously, ways that he can as president.”

Senate Democrats met with Mr. Obama on Wednesday at Nationals Park as part of their annual issues retreat and also got a pep talk from former President Bill Clinton. The president has often relied on Mr. Clinton, who remains popular in states where Mr. Obama is a political liability, to explain the benefits of Obamacare to audiences in easy-to-understand terms.

As Democrats gear up for the November elections, the public’s unhappiness with the health care law remains high. A Gallup survey released this week found that 51 percent of Americans disapprove of the law and 41 percent approve of it.

Most Americans in the Gallup poll said they believe the law has had no effect (64 percent) or a harmful effect (19 percent) on their families. Only 24 percent of those polled said they believe that in the long run, the law will improve their families’ health care situations.

The CBO report noted that the health care law’s insurance subsidies are gradually taken away as income rises, “creating an implicit tax on additional earnings.” Dr. Gottlieb said that means some middle-class and lower-income people will decide that the government subsidies are more attractive than working more and paying higher taxes.

“They’re going to lose more in subsidies than it’s worth what they’re making in income,” he said. “So it remakes the whole wage-labor relationship, and that’s what I think CBO is starting to recognize. We’ve never subsidized the middle class like this. This is going to have a much different effect on the labor force than anything we’ve ever done.”

Mr. Carney argued Wednesday that the law is providing consumers with more choices, not a disincentive to work.

“The [Affordable Care Act] is benefiting our economy; it’s providing access to health insurance to millions of people who didn’t have it, and is giving families across the country and individuals across the country the freedom and choice and opportunity that they lacked before it passed,” Mr. Carney said.

But partisans on both sides increasingly are looking at the potential for a battle in the midterm elections over the growth of entitlements.

“The headline is awful [for Democrats],” Dr. Gottlieb said. “And I think the spin from the White House that they’re giving people more discretion back is a very hard argument to make.”

1771,1771,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/13/comcast-acquisition-deal-for-time-warner-primed-to/,Right,"Comcast Corp.’s blockbuster $45.2 billion deal to acquire top rival Time Warner Cable will further transform the cable landscape, creating the first national cable network and presenting new challenges for rivals, regulators and viewers from Los Angeles to New York City.

The Comcast offer of $158.82 per share for Time Warner would combine the nation’s No. 1 and No. 2 cable systems and upend a hostile takeover attempt by Charter Communications, a smaller rival backed by cable mogul John Malone, which offered Time Warner $132.50 per share.

Comcast, with 21.7 million subscribers, is seeking to consolidate its power by buying its closest cable rival, with 11.6 million subscribers. The deal adds the prized Manhattan and Los Angeles markets to the Comcast empire now concentrated in the mid-Atlantic region.

If shareholders and regulators approve the deal, the combined cable giant would tower over its closest competitor, DirecTV, which has about 20 million video customers. Although the company would control 30 percent of the U.S. market, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts Thursday rejected the idea that the merger would hurt competition or give his company too much power.

“We do not operate in any of the same ZIP codes,” he told security analysts Thursday in a conference call. “We believe this transaction is approvable. It is pro-consumer, pro-competitive and strongly in the public interest.”

But consumer advocates were mobilizing against the deal, which must be cleared by the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission. Craig Aaron, president of the media advocacy group Free Press, noted that the deal would give Comcast control of a third of the U.S. pay-TV market and more than half of the market for bundled video-voice-Internet services.

“In an already uncompetitive market with high prices that keep going up and up, a merger of the two biggest cable companies should be unthinkable,” Mr. Aaron said.

News of the merger sent Time Warner’s stock up $9.50 — more than 7 percent — to 44.81. Comcast’s stock was down $2.28, or 4.12 percent, to $52.97.

If successful, the deal will mark the second time in a little more than a year that Comcast has helped reshape the U.S. media landscape. Last year, it acquired NBC Universal for $17 billion.

Mr. Roberts, who was credited for stealthily snatching Time Warner away from Charter and Mr. Malone, has been an outspoken advocate for consolidation in the cable industry. He said the deal will create a “world-class company” with the capability to grow, while generating $1.5 billion in operating efficiencies.

“It looks like Brian Roberts is getting the last laugh on John Malone and Charter. The lion fails to get his prey,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst with the investment firm BTIG.

Comcast said it will divest 3 million subscribers to avert potential problems with antitrust regulators at the Department of Justice and the FCC.

Federal regulators are likely to scrutinize the deal despite assurances from Mr. Roberts and Time Warner chief executive Robert D. Marcus that they believe it will be approved.

The move is a big defeat for Mr. Malone’s Liberty Media, which acquired a 27 percent stake in Charter Communications in the hopes of turning it into a “horizontal acquisition machine” to consolidate the cable industry and fight higher programming fees.

Mr. Malone has said the cable industry will have to scramble to fend off formidable competition from Netflix, Apple and Google, global megacorporations that are creating their own broadcast content and providing entertainment through online venues that threaten to render obsolete cable’s live-TV domain.

Charter, which has a large debt load, was unable or unwilling to boost its offer to Time Warner and played into Comcast’s hands. In its aggressive pursuit of Time Warner, Charter nominated a potential slate of directors for the cable company’s board this week in anticipation of a takeover.

The defeated suitor did not comment directly on the Comcast coup. In a statement Thursday, it said, “Charter has always maintained that our greatest opportunity to create value for our shareholders is by executing our current business plan, and we will continue to be disciplined in this and any other [merger and acquisition] activity we pursue.”

Although Mr. Roberts may steal Mr. Malone’s claim to be “King of Cable,” some analysts doubted that the merger would blunt the threats to the cable industry’s basic business model from Netflix and others.

“Consolidation of distribution doesn’t help the balance of power between content and distribution,” said MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson.

But Mr. Nathanson’s partner, Craig Moffett, noted the obvious boon for Comcast as it acquires the lucrative New York City market, the “crown jewel” of Time Warner’s empire.

“Only Comcast is positioned to think generationally about cable’s future. And New York City, the system we have always called TWC’s ‘Boardwalk,’ was the missing piece of the puzzle,” he said.

Regulatory approval of the deal is not seen as a slam-dunk, despite Mr. Roberts’ confidence. The Obama administration has not been shy about challenging deals on antitrust grounds, forcing major changes in deals in the beer and the airline industries before giving its approval. The deal is also likely to be the subject of hearings on Capitol Hill.

1776,1776,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/18/minimum-wage-hike-would-kill-half-million-jobs-cbo/,Right,"Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour will cost the U.S. economy a half-million jobs by 2016 but will substantially boost wages for most low-income workers, according to a Congressional Budget Office report released Tuesday that adds a significant hurdle to Democrats’ push for an increase.

Stung by the findings, the White House, which is still facing a sluggish job picture five years after the recession, scrambled for a response. It praised the nonpartisan agency’s finding that low-wage workers’ income would rise but said the CBO job numbers “do not reflect the overall consensus view of economists.”

Republicans predicted that the CBO report will bolster opposition on Capitol Hill, where the issue is likely to come up for votes in the next few weeks.

“Raising the minimum wage would slash jobs and harm an already fragile workforce,” said Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican. “Whether it’s Obamacare, a minimum wage hike, or a trillion-dollar stimulus bill charged to the nation’s credit card, the bottom line is the president’s big-government experiment kills jobs.”

The report marks the second time this month that the CBO has caused headaches for President Obama’s domestic agenda. A previous report found that by 2017, Obamacare would create economic incentives that would cause 2 million people to drop out of the labor force.

In Tuesday’s report, the CBO said that raising the hourly minimum wage to $10.10, phased in over the next three years — the proposal Mr. Obama and other Democrats are pushing — would cost about 500,000 jobs.

“Once fully implemented in the second half of 2016, the $10.10 option would reduce total employment by about 500,000 workers, or 0.3 percent,” the nonpartisan scorekeepers said.

The report added that the uncertainty is substantial and the loss could be anywhere from “very slight” to as much as 1 million jobs.

The CBO said a wage increase would cause some businesses to cut the number of jobs to contain labor costs, although most of the working poor would benefit and many would be lifted above the poverty line.

Overall, income would be transferred from the wealthy to the poor, CBO said.

“Once the other changes in income were taken into account, families whose income would be below six times the poverty threshold under current law would see a small increase in income, on net, and families whose income would be higher under current law would see reductions in income, on net,” the analysts reported.

With most of the big spending and debt issues settled for this year, and with Republicans focusing on attacks to Obamacare, Democrats are countering with a campaign on income inequality. The two chief prongs have been an effort to extend long-term federal unemployment benefits and the push to raise the minimum wage.

Mr. Obama has mentioned it repeatedly in recent days, and Senate Democrats have said they will force a vote in the near future. House Democrats, who are in the minority in their chamber, emerged from their annual policy retreat last week to announce that they will undertake an official petition drive to try to force the issue to the House floor over the Republican majority’s objections.

White House economists tried to pick apart the CBO analysis, saying economic scholars have found that minimum wage increases don’t cause major job losses.

Betsey Stevenson, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said while that goes against traditional economic teaching, there is plenty of evidence that boosting wages also increases productivity and job stability.

“I’ve been also looking at minimum wage studies since my very first days in graduate school, and I really do believe that both the profession and the literature has moved towards thinking over the last couple of decades towards thinking the employment effects are small,” she said.

Several black leaders raised the issue with Mr. Obama in an hourlong meeting at the White House on Tuesday.

“The minimum wage has not kept pace with inflation,” said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League. “The minimum wage has not kept pace with the productivity of low-income workers. The minimum wage makes good sense.”

The leaders said they didn’t talk about the CBO report with Mr. Obama but afterward discounted it, saying previous studies have shown that raising the minimum wage does not cost jobs. They also said that may be beside the point.

“What must be weighed in any analysis, CBO and others, is that blacks suffer disproportionately from having to do work and not get the kind of wages that we need,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton.

“We had full employment in the black community during slavery,” Mr. Sharpton said. “We just didn’t have wages. So we don’t want just a job, we want a job that pays, and pays so that we can take care of our families.”

The $10.10 minimum wage increase that the CBO analyzed involved raising the rate in three steps from $7.25 an hour to the full $10.10 on July 1, 2016. That increase would be indexed to inflation thereafter, and wages based on tips also would be raised.

The CBO also looked at option to raise the minimum wage to $9 in two phases, in 2015 and 2016. That option didn’t index for inflation.

The last time the minimum wage was increased was late in President George W. Bush’s term. After Democrats won control of the House and Senate, Congress pushed through a gradual rise from $5.15 to the current $7.25 level.

Some states have enacted higher minimum wages, and Mr. Obama this month signed an executive order mandating that federal contractors pay their workers a minimum wage of $10.10 an hour.

A minimum wage increase would have effects throughout the economy, the CBO said. Some workers who make near the proposed minimum wage of $10.10 an hour could receive raises as well so employers could differentiate their lowest-paid workers from others.

The federal budget would be affected by the decrease in real income to those pushed out of jobs and by increases in taxes paid by those whose incomes rise. Some of those workers no longer would be eligible for food stamps, which would save federal money.

The CBO said it’s unclear whether the net effect on the federal budget would be a small increase or a small decrease in deficits.

Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that finding was compelling.

“There are still substantial income gains for the bottom and middle of the population, and these income gains are achieved at virtually no budgetary cost,” he said. “When you look at the numbers in the report, the positives using all of CBO’s own numbers substantially outweigh the negatives.”

1777,1777,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/14/drought-ravaged-california-obama-sounds-alarm-clim/,Right,"While touring areas of California ravaged by a historic drought, President Obama on Friday sounded an ominous warning and said that even if the federal government takes meaningful action to combat climate change, much of the damage already has been done.

“Unless and until we do more to combat carbon pollution that causes climate change, this trend is going to get worse, and the hard truth is even if we do take action on climate change, carbon pollution has built up in our atmosphere for decades. The planet is slowly going to keep warming for a long time to come,” Mr. Obama said while touring a farm in Los Banos. “We’re going to have to stop looking at these disasters as something to wait for. We’ve got to start looking at these disasters as something to prepare for, to anticipate.”

Mr. Obama and many Democrats, along with their supporters in the environmental community, have held up extreme weather events such as California’s drought, Hurricane Sandy and others as proof that global warming is wreaking havoc all across the planet.

But the issue remains bitterly divisive, and many lawmakers believe Mr. Obama’s dire warnings are grossly overstated.

The heated debate over climate change has led to near gridlock on Capitol Hill, with Republicans and some Democrats standing in staunch opposition to major legislative proposals to address the issue. That opposition helped kill the controversial 2010 cap-and-trade bill, which would have put a limit on carbon emissions nationwide.

In lieu of congressional action, the Obama administration has taken a number of executive steps. The most notable were the ambitious automobile fuel standards, which call for American cars and trucks to average 54.5 mpg by 2025, and the Environmental Protection Agency’s strict new rules limiting carbon emissions from power plants.

SEE ALSO: Obama to launch $1 billion ‘climate resilience’ fund

The White House on Friday also announced that in the president’s new budget proposal, due out next month, Mr. Obama will ask Congress to create a new $1 billion “climate resilience” fund to spur new research into how communities and infrastructure can be better prepared for the impacts of climate change.

The initiative, if approved, also would fund new technologies “that will make us more resilient in the face of changing climate,” the White House said in a statement.

Moving forward, the president said, such efforts will become more critical — especially in states such as California, which will have to deal with longer, more severe droughts and less water as the climate situation worsens.

“Everybody, from farmers to residential areas to the north of California and the south of California and every place in between, as well as the entire Western region, are going to have to start rethinking how we approach water for decades to come,” the president said.

While in California, the president also attended a town hall meeting with the state’s Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, both Democrats, and other state and local officials.

Mr. Obama will spend the rest of the weekend in California. Later on Friday, he’ll hold a bilateral meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan at a private retreat in Rancho Mirage.

1790,1790,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/11/house-votes-raise-debt-ceiling/,Right,"The House passed a “clean” debt ceiling increase Tuesday granting President Obama power to borrow as much as the government needs for the next 13 months, after House Republican leaders surrendered on their long-standing demand that debt hikes be matched with spending cuts.

Unable to muster his own troops, Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republicans, had to turn to Democrats to provide the necessary votes. The bill, which cleared on a 221-201 vote, now goes to the Senate.

The legislation must be approved by the end of the month, when the Treasury Department says it will run out of borrowing room.

Even as he advanced the bill and voted for it, Mr. Boehner washed his hands of the blame.

“It’s the president driving up the debt and the president wanting to do nothing about the debt that’s occurring,” the speaker said. “So let his party give him the debt-ceiling increase that he wants.”

Democrats hailed the vote as a victory and heaped praise on Mr. Boehner, who they said he put the country ahead of the tea party wing of the GOP by holding the vote.

Just 28 Republicans joined 193 Democrats in voting for the increase. Two Democrats and 199 Republicans voted against it.

“Once again, the Republican Party and their caucus has shown they’re not responsible enough to be ruling and governing here,” said Rep. Joseph Crowley, New York Democrat.

Business groups, worried about the effects of bumping up against the limit, urged Congress to act.

But conservative and tea party groups warned of dire political consequences for Republicans who voted for the increase.

For the past century, Congress has imposed a borrowing limit on the federal government. As the government has run up record deficits under President George W. Bush and Mr. Obama, lawmakers have repeatedly raised the limit — though it’s often been a major battle.

As of Monday, the gross debt stood at $17.259 trillion. It was $10.629 trillion when Mr. Obama was inaugurated in 2009.

SEE ALSO: Conservative group calls for House Speaker John Boehner’s head

Under the new debt policy, the government’s borrowing limit would be suspended until March 15, 2015, meaning whatever debts are incurred until then would be tacked onto the legal limit.

It’s impossible to predict how much debt would accumulate, but the government has added more than $800 billion in gross debt in the past 13 months.

For Republicans, the vote was a major retreat. When he became speaker in 2011, Mr. Boehner vowed to use debt increases as leverage to extract spending cuts. He set a goal of matching debt increases “dollar for dollar” with cuts.

In 2011, during the first debt fight of his tenure, he won a deal that has cut overall spending for two consecutive years — the first time that has been achieved since 1950.

Since that peak, though, Republicans have struggled to win concessions on three successive debt votes and has reversed its push against spending. Indeed, December’s budget deal offset some of the cuts Republicans won in the 2011 budget agreement.

On Tuesday, Republicans said they were left with little choice.

With so many Republicans opposed to any debt increase, leaders were unable to come up with the votes to pass a plan that would halt parts of Obamacare or build the Keystone XL pipeline in exchange for a debt increase.

Most of the 28 Republicans who voted in favor of the clean debt increase were leaders, chairmen of committees or members of the Appropriations Committee.

Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican who voted against the debt increase, said Mr. Boehner had no options, but he added that the result of agreeing to a third straight increase with no major cuts attached is that Republicans lose leverage in any future debt negotiations.

“I understood the previous times, but I think we’re slipping into a bad habit,” he said. “I’m not here condemning people for what they did — they’ve done it to try and deal with the immediate situation, but I think long term, we need to rethink how we do it and a lot of Democrats would like to get rid of the whole debt ceiling idea altogether. I think that’s a mistake, personally.”

Mr. Obama and congressional Democrats remained united throughout the battle for a clean debt increase. That left Mr. Boehner with no negotiating partner and no offer of his own.

“We don’t have 218 votes. And when you don’t have 218 votes, you have nothing,” the speaker told reporters ahead of the vote, explaining his lack of leverage.

Just a single Republican — Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp of Michigan — spoke during the floor debate.

Most Republican lawmakers seemed eager to move on and saw the vote as a way to “clear the decks” of a thorny political problem and resume attacks on Obamacare and Mr. Obama’s other policies.

Democratic leaders were eager to debate the bill. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California said it proved that Democrats were the ones interested in upholding the Constitution’s directive that the validity of the debt never be questioned.

“The full faith and credit of the United States of America is not in doubt,” Mrs. Pelosi said.

Five years ago this week, President Obama jump-started the economy, leading to the greatest period of sustained growth in history. No, we haven’t seen it, either, but that was what he said would happen when he signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. A trillion dollars later, we’re no better off.

The housing bubble burst and stock portfolios lost trillions of dollars in value at the onset of the Great Recession in 2007. Those were dark times, and the country naturally thought it was time for a change.

As his first major act in office, Mr. Obama signed what he called “the most sweeping economic-recovery package in our history.” It was certainly sweeping, and one of the single largest checks written in history, but there was no recovery.

The value of “shovel-ready” jobs was $830 billion, by the reckoning of the Congressional Budget Office. The true cost proved far greater. Once the money was spent, the number was baked into the federal budget baseline, making the “temporary” spending permanent.

Thus, Mr. Obama has spent $3 trillion more than George W. Bush did in his last year in office.

What did we get for that enormous sum? Mr. Obama promised his scheme “will create or save 3.5 million jobs over the next two years.” By his own math, the government would spend $200,000 for each of those jobs. He thought that was a good deal.

He couldn’t buy jobs even at such an absurd price. “Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected,” Mr. Obama admitted in 2011.

Though the job creation was illusory, the impact on the economy of government borrowing has been all too real. “To the extent that people hold their wealth in government securities rather than in a form that can be used to finance private investment,” the Congressional Budget Office explained, “the increased debt tends to reduce the stock of productive private capital.”

When there’s no private capital, companies can’t invest in their business, expand operations and hire new employees. It shows. Today, fewer people than ever are working.

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, last year the economy grew 1.9 percent. The “Recovery Summer” that Joe Biden kept saying was just around the corner never arrived. We have yet to see the corner.

It’s not too late to reverse course. American entrepreneurs have been held back, and they’re anxious to get to work. Paying cronies for temporary hires on the taxpayer dime hasn’t worked.

If we instead cut back federal spending, curtail Obamacare and put a moratorium on new red tape, we might have something to celebrate five years on."
1795,1795,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/25/obama-karzai-us-troops-prepping-leave/,Right,"Tuesday brought a fresh reminder that the more-than-decade-long conflict in Afghanistan will not conclude on U.S. terms, with the Obama administration revealing it’s planning for a complete withdrawal from the troubled country at the end of the year.

The administration had hoped to leave behind a residual force of several thousand troops post-2014 for training and anti-terror operations, but Afghan President Hamid Karzai thus far has refused to sign a bilateral security agreement with the U.S. and, in the process, created a sense of confusion around America’s future role.

On Tuesday morning, President Obama — who made an end to the Afghan war a key part of his 2012 re-election campaign — called Mr. Karzai and told him the Pentagon has begun to craft a “contingency” plan should Afghanistan refuse American help moving forward. The U.S. currently has about 33,600 troops in the country.

“We have been calling on the Afghan government to complete that, to sign that agreement, which was negotiated in good faith, and to do so promptly,” White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters after the Obama-Karzai phone call.

“The president has tasked the Pentagon with preparing for the contingency that there will be no troops in Afghanistan beyond 2014. But we’re also remaining open to the possibility of a post-2014 troop presence, should the bilateral security agreement be signed later in the year.”

The discussion comes as Mr. Karzai, who has served as his country’s president since December 2001 and been a familiar yet sometimes unsteady American ally in the years since, prepares to leave office. Elections to choose his successor will be held in April.

While the White House concedes it’s “unlikely” Mr. Karzai will sign the agreement during his final weeks in office, there remains hope the next Afghan president will embrace an ongoing American presence.

Regardless of who the next Afghan leader is, congressional leaders such as House Speaker John A. Boehner will press the administration to secure a deal before the end of the year or risk seeing the nation fall into chaos.

“It is imperative that we reach a bilateral security agreement with the Afghan government before the end of the year to help ensure that the gains we have made are not jeopardized like they have been in Iraq,” Mr. Boehner, Ohio Republican, said in a statement.

At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Tuesday the U.S. military’s “force posture” over the next several months “will provide various options for political leaders in the United States and NATO.”

“During this time, [the Department of Defense] will still continue planning for U.S. participation in a NATO-led mission focused on training, advising, and assisting Afghan security forces, as well as a narrowly focused counterterrorism mission,” Mr. Hagel said.

NATO defense ministers are expected to meet in Brussels, Belgium, on Wednesday to discuss the alliance’s future military presence in Afghanistan. Mr. Hagel said that he will discuss his planning efforts with NATO allies this week.

The White House hasn’t set a firm date for when a security agreement must be signed, but officials made clear Tuesday the more time that goes by, the less the U.S. will be involved in future years.

“The longer we go without a bilateral security agreement, and we’ve been making this clear, the more challenging it will be to plan and execute any U.S. mission,” Mr. Carney said. “Furthermore, the longer we go without a signed bilateral security agreement, the more likely it will be that any post-2014 U.S. mission will be smaller in scale and ambition.”

If the administration ultimately fails to reach an agreement with Afghanistan, House GOP leaders and other critics appear ready to place much of the blame on the White House.

“There are times when we must come to terms with the burden of our values. Afghanistan is one of those moments. Do we step back and abandon Afghanistan to the wolves? Do we still have a moral responsibility to the people there?” said retiring U.S. Rep. Howard P. “Buck” McKeon, California Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, during a speech at the National Press Club on Monday.

1802,1802,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/22/editorial-no-more-racial-tinkering/,Right,"OPINION:

The Supreme Court on Tuesday restored common sense as well as the word of the Constitution by upholding Michigan’s ban of racial preferences in state college admissions. Michigan voters had put the ban in their state constitution, ordering state colleges and universities not to “discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin.”

This was clear, straightforward language that even a judge could understand, and the vote as an unequivocal 6 to 2, with the liberal Justice Stephen Breyer joining the usual five conservative justices. They understood George Orwell’s point, in his novel “1984,” that proclaiming that war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength — and, in this case, colorblindness is racism — does not make it so.

After decades of affirmative-action nonsense the public understands that however well-intentioned such policies may be, affirmative action reinforces the notion that minorities can’t succeed on their own merits. Sometimes, when they do, accomplishment means little.

When white applicants for admissions are rejected to favor less-qualified minorities, it invariably fuels racial resentment. The quota system once used by the University of California at Berkeley meant that highly qualified Asian students were rejected to favor other minorities so admissions could create a “desirable” and arbitrary “mix.”

In his concurring opinion Tuesday, Justice Antonin Scalia called it folly to divide Americans into racial blocs. “Does a half-Latino, half-American Indian have Latino interests, American-Indian interests, both, or half of both?”

The decision was further a victory for the rights of the states. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy concluded that the courts did not have the authority to set aside the Michigan law. “This case is not about the debate how the debate over racial preferences should be resolved,” he said. “It is about who may resolve it. Michigan voters used the initiative system to bypass public officials who were deemed not responsive to the concerns of a majority of the voters with respect to a policy of granting race-based preferences that raises difficult and delicate issues.”

By Any Means Necessary, a coalition of the left that sought to overturn the Michigan amendment, demands admissions based on racial calculus. The group’s spokesman called Tuesday’s ruling in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action “racist” and said that “this court is declaring its intention to uphold white privilege and to create a new Jim Crow legal system.”

In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor bought into the convoluted reasoning that banning the use of racial preferences unfairly targets minorities. “Today’s decision eviscerates an important strand of our equal-protection jurisprudence,” she wrote, joined only by the hopelessly liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Most of all, the decision was a victory for common sense. School administrators shouldn’t be in the position of treating the student body like a television set where it can be lightened or darkened with the turn of a knob. It makes only good sense to say that a qualified student is welcome, regardless of his — or her — race or creed."
1805,1805,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/25/russian-jets-cross-into-ukraine-airspace/,Right,"Russian warplanes have entered Ukraine airspace several times within the past 24 hours, conducting what one Pentagon official describes as “small probes.”

Pentagon spokesman Army Col. Steve Warren said Friday evening that the Russians have made “a handful of incursions” into Ukranian airspace. Col. Warren told The Washington Times that the Pentagon is asking Russia “to take immediate steps” to reduce tension along the Ukraine border.

“We call on the Russians to help deescalate the situation and not contribute to the deepening of this crisis,” he said.

Earlier Friday, Mr. Warren said that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has attempted to contact Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu regarding the uptick in tension between the two countries but to no avail.

Mr. Shoigu raised concern among Defense Department officials after he announced Thursday that Russia planned to engage in a new series of military exercises near the Ukraine border. The military move, Mr. Shoigu said, is in response to ongoing NATO training exercises in Poland and the death of at least two pro-Russia insurgents in eastern Ukraine.

Currently, the country has “a broad array of forces aligned along the Ukranian border,” Col. Warren said.

Meanwhile, Ukraine’s acting Defense Minister Mikhail Koval is saying that neither Russian troops nor aircraft have crossed into Ukraine during a military exercise. He made the comment while speaking to reporters on Saturday, the InSerbia Network Foundation website reported.

A separate Defense Department official said Saturday that the Pentagon had no comment on Mr. Koval’s contradicting statement.

The Daily Beast is reporting that high-level contact between the Obama administration and the Kremlin has come to an abrupt halt. The last time President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to one another was on April 14, according to The Daily Beast.

But Col. Warren told The Times that the relationship between the United States and Russia has not frozen over yet. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey spoke with his counterpart, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia Gen. Valery Gerasimov, just yesterday, he said.

1811,1811,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/21/holder-overhaul-clemency-guidelines/,Right,"In a move that could result in the prison release of hundreds or thousands of low-level drug offenders, the Justice Department said Monday that it will advise President Obama to widen his guidelines for granting clemency.

The announcement, immediately praised by advocates for reform of the criminal justice system, is part of the administration’s effort to reduce the nation’s prison population and address racial disparities in drug sentencing.

It remains unclear how effective the approach will be and whether the president is prepared to move forward on what may be an unprecedented wave of pardons and commutations.

“Nobody knows the scope and depth yet. I applaud the spirit, and I applaud what I think is going to happen. But I just don’t know. There are thousands of cases ripe for action. … We don’t know if we’re talking about a couple dozen, a couple hundred, or a couple thousand,” said former Maryland Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a Republican and leading advocate for criminal justice reform and changes to how nonviolent drug offenders are punished.

Before the announcement Monday, the administration’s record on clemency was widely criticized. A deputy legal director with the American Civil Liberties Union told Yahoo News that the record is “abysmal.”

More than five years into his tenure, Mr. Obama is on pace to grant far fewer pardons and commutations than his recent predecessors, despite the White House’s stated position that drug sentencing is frequently unfair and often handed down under a system compromised by ingrained racial bias.

Mr. Obama has granted 52 pardons and nine commutations. President George W. Bush gave 189 pardons and 11 commutations during his eight years in office. President Clinton issued 189 pardons and 61 commutations.

But the administration has shown signs that it is prepared to do more, especially for nonviolent drug offenders serving lengthy sentences.

In December, Mr. Obama commuted the sentences of eight men and women serving considerable prison terms for convictions related to crack cocaine.

They were convicted and sentenced before the president signed into law the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, designed to reduce racial disparities in cocaine-related prison sentences.

Before the act, the law treated 1 gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of 100 grams of powder cocaine. That standard led to an increased number of black inmates compared with white because crack cocaine users tend to be poor or black, and powder cocaine users are more often upper-class or white.

Those sentenced before the act went into effect have little recourse other than to seek clemency from the president.

The U.S. Sentencing Commission this month adopted a recommendation to reduce prison terms for certain nonviolent drug offenders. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. has lobbied heavily for such action.

Deputy Attorney General James Cole will release the new clemency guidelines this week. In January, he appealed to state bar associations to help identify low-level, nonviolent drug offenders who may be candidates for clemency.

Mr. Holder is expecting an onslaught of requests from offenders and the need for dozens of additional lawyers to review their cases.

“Once these reforms go into effect, we expect to receive thousands of additional applications for clemency,” he said. “There are still too many people in federal prison who were sentenced under the old regime — and who, as a result, will have to spend far more time in prison than they would if sentenced today for exactly the same crime.”

The guidelines could revamp how business is conducted inside the office of the Justice Department’s pardon attorney, said Mary Price, general counsel with Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a nonprofit organization advocating changes to sentencing laws.

When it comes to clemency, Ms. Price said, the pardon attorney’s office must evolve “from its culture of ‘no’ to a culture of ‘yes,’ or at least ‘maybe.’”

“It’s terrific that the administration is taking a serious look at the clemency power, using it to do some justice in individual cases where our sentencing laws have produced unjust results,” she said. “You see voices from the left and the right coming together to support these initiatives.”

Indeed, many Democrats and Republicans such as Mr. Ehrlich support large-scale changes in drug sentencing and clemency for some incarcerated offenders.

The reason it’s taken so long for the issue to get the attention it deserves is a lack of public pressure on elected leaders, said Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas Law School and a former federal prosecutor.

“We haven’t asked the right questions. … We have to really hold their feet to the fire on this,” he said.

1812,1812,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/26/lawyer-congressman-grimm-faces-federal-charges/,Right,"NEW YORK (AP) - The attorney representing Republican U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm maintains that the congressman has done nothing wrong but says he’s not surprised his client is facing criminal charges from federal prosecutors.

Grimm has been dogged by allegations of campaign violations since his first campaign for Congress in 2009 and 2010. A House Ethics Committee announced in November that Grimm was under investigation for possible campaign finance violations.

“After more than two years of investigation plagued by malicious leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy, and strong-arm tactics, the U.S. Attorney’s Office has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges against Congressman Grimm,” Grimm’s attorney, William McGinley, said in the statement Friday. “When the dust settles, he will be vindicated.”

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn said Friday he couldn’t confirm, deny or comment on the case. The FBI’s New York office, which handles investigations, also declined to comment.

After the House Ethics Committee announced last fall that Grimm was under investigation, the panel said it would defer its inquiry because of a separate Department of Justice investigation.

Grimm made headlines in January after confronting a New York City cable news station reporter who tried to question him about a long-running FBI investigation into campaign finance on a balcony in the Capitol.

After reporter Michael Scotto finished his report, Grimm stormed back, leaned into him and said, “Let me be clear to you. If you ever do that to me again, I’ll throw you off this (expletive) balcony.”

Scotto, who was asking about fundraising during Grimm’s first campaign, protested, saying he was asking “a valid question.”

During that race, Grimm has acknowledged receiving $250,000 to $300,000 in contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto. Some members of Pinto’s congregation subsequently said they made tens of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions, including gifts passed through straw donors.

Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, and the FBI hasn’t accused him of any wrongdoing. The Israeli businessman who had served as Grimm’s liaison to Pinto’s followers, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty in August to an immigration fraud charge.

Three days after that guilty plea, the FBI filed a sealed criminal complaint accusing a Houston woman named Diana Durand, who had been romantically involved with Grimm, of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions.

On Friday, Durand was indicted in Brooklyn on those charges. She also was charged with making false statements to the FBI when she said she didn’t reimburse straw donors for their contributions to Grimm’s campaign.

Attorney Stuart Kaplan said Durand would plead not guilty to the charges. Kaplan, who said Durand and Grimm met in Texas before Grimm ran for Congress, said he was hopeful prosecutors wouldn’t join the two cases.

“When you take out their relationship, there’s no evidence to connect either one with respect to complicity, violating the law by acting in concert or doing something as a criminal enterprise,” he said.

A spokesman in Grimm’s Washington office, Nick Iacono, did not immediately return emails or a telephone message seeking comment Friday.

A House member who has been indicted does not lose any rights or privileges under federal law or the chamber’s rules, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.

Rules used by the two major political parties require indicted committee or subcommittee chairmen, or members of a party’s leadership, to temporarily step aside. Grimm is not a chairman or a member of the leadership.

1814,1814,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/28/obama-sets-new-round-sanctions-against-russia-over/,Right,"The Obama administration Monday imposed a new round of targeted economic sanctions against cronies of Russian President Vladimir Putin and 17 companies in response to Russia’s involvement in the crisis in Ukraine.

The White House said the new limited sanctions are hitting seven Russian government officials, including two members of Mr. Putin’s inner circle, including a freeze on any U.S. assets and a ban on travel to the U.S.

The actions are being taken because Russia “has done nothing” since it agreed in Geneva on April 17 to reduce tensions in Ukraine by refraining from provocative and violent actions.

“Russia’s involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable,” said White House press secretary Jay Carney.

President Obama said earlier Monday in the Philippines, where he is wrapping up a tour of Asia, that the U.S. is holding off on broader sanctions that would further harm the Russian economy. The European Union is also expected to add about 15 new targets to its Russia sanctions list on Monday.

“We are keeping in reserve additional steps that we could take should the situation escalate further,” Mr. Obama said, acknowledging that he did not know if the measures he has ordered so far will work.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the sanctions are intended to compel Russia to deescalate the situation in Ukraine.

“Russia’s dangerous and inflammatory actions against Ukraine are illegal and illegitimate,” Mr. Lew said. “Today’s targeted actions, taken in close coordination with the [European Union], will increase the impact we have already begun to see on Russia’s own economy as a result of Russia’s actions in Ukraine and from U.S. and international sanctions.”

He said the sanctions are hurting the Russian economy and that the U.S. is prepared to take additional action against “individuals and entities in specific sectors if Russia continues to press forward.”

Jeb Bush can win the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, dismissing the notion that conservatives wouldn’t elect an “establishment” candidate by pointing to the party’s standard bearer the past two presidential cycles.

“See John McCain; see Mitt Romney,” Mr. Pawlenty, who ended his 2012 presidential campaign in the summer of 2011, said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “In McCain’s case, a very compelling personal story and a gritty performance; in Mitt Romney’s case, obviously a man of great talent but also someone with a tremendous amount of campaign resources and infrastructure.”

“Jeb can do that,” Mr. Pawlenty continued. “But it’s not going to be uncontested, assuming he runs, and there’s a bunch of people who are going to get in the race [who will] have something to say about it.”

Mr. Pawlenty went on to say the party has “shifted” and that it’s not so much a manifestation of the tea party as it is a Libertarian wing on the right represented by people like Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.

“You wouldn’t have predicted McCain or Romney won last time — they did,” he said.

Mr. Bush’s last name could present a problem for him if he chooses to run, said a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.

Sixty-nine percent agree with former first lady Barbara Bush’s statement that “there are more than two or three families who should run for high office in America.”

Ten percent of people who agreed said it applied more to Mr. Bush, 7 percent who agreed said it applied more to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, and 50 percent who agreed said it applied equally to both.

Compared to about a year ago, Americans also view Mr. Bush less favorably.

Twenty-one percent view him positively and 32 percent have a negative view. Eleven months ago, 26 percent had a positive view of him, and 23 percent had a negative view.

Trey Gowdy.

White House press secretary Jay Carney said Republicans’ motivation for the inquiry is political, and he dodged questions on whether the administration will fully cooperate, saying the investigation is fundamentally flawed.

“There is a problem when you have so many conspiracy theories that get knocked down by the facts and the adherents to those theories only become more convinced that the facts aren’t what they so clearly are,” he said

Republicans announced Monday that Mr. Gowdy, a second-term Republican congressman and former federal prosecutor from South Carolina, will head up the select investigative committee.

“Trey Gowdy is as dogged, focused, and serious-minded as they come,” said GOP House Speaker John A. Boehner.

Mr. Boehner reversed himself last week and embraced the creation of the investigative committee, saying that new information called into question how cooperative the administration had been in turning over documents related to how the 2012 attack and public relations aftermath were handled.

Mr. Carney struggled last week to explain why a key email wasn’t turned over until months into the investigation.

House Democrats are still pondering how to approach the special committee. One option would be to refuse to appoint Democratic members to the investigation.

It also remains to be seen what sort of investigative powers the House will give to the committee.

Mr. Boehner, in his statement Monday, signaled he wants the investigators to have broad powers, saying he wants them to have “the strongest authority possible to root out all the facts.”

Mr. Gowdy, 49, has gained a reputation as a relentless investigator despite his short time on Capitol Hill. He was the lawmaker who pushed to declare that former IRS employee Lois G. Lerner had waived her right against self-incrimination during her appearance before the House Oversight Committee last year.

Mr. Gowdy’s investigation will supersede those by several regular committees that had already been investigating. Foremost among those is the House Oversight Committee, led by Rep. Darrell Issa.

Mr. Issa, California Republican, praised Mr. Gowdy’s selection as chairman of the special investigative panel.

“Trey has been an integral contributor to the Oversight Committee investigation and takes the knowledge we have gained, through subpoenas and individual testimony, to his new role leading the new Select Committee,” Mr. Issa said.

For his part, Mr. Issa has issued a subpoena demanding Secretary of State John F. Kerry appear before his committee on May 21 to explain why what he deems a key email was only turned over to the panel last week.

But the State Department said Monday that Mr. Kerry will be in out of the country that day, and will not change his plans to answer the subpoena.

Mr. Obama will appear at five fundraisers in California to raise millions for Democratic congressional candidates, at parties hosted by the executives of Disney studios, Yahoo and the former chairman of Qualcomm. The events are among more than 20 fundraisers that the president has committed to attend this year as Democrats try against the odds to keep control of the Senate and pick up seats in the House.

With his job-approval ratings near the lowest point of his presidency, Mr. Obama managed to joke at the annual White House Correspondents’ Dinner Saturday about Democrats avoiding him.

“Folks are saying that with my sagging poll numbers, my fellow Democrats don’t really want me campaigning with them,” Mr. Obama said. “And I don’t think that’s true — although I did notice the other day that [daughter] Sasha needed a speaker at career day, and she invited Bill Clinton. I was a little hurt by that.”

Mr. Obama’s first stop on the trip will involve one of those red-state Democrats who’s kept his distance from the president, Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas. Running for a third term in a close race against Republican Rep. Tom Cotton, Mr. Pryor is telling voters that he’s “the most independent senator in Washington.”

His appearance with Mr. Obama is not a campaign event; Mr. Pryor will accompany the president to tour tornado damage and meet with the families of victims. Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe, a Democrat, and Rep. Tim Griffin, a Republican, also will be part of Mr. Obama’s tour.

From Arkansas, Mr. Obama will fly later Wednesday to Los Angeles to participate in a joint fundraiser to benefit House and Senate Democratic candidates. He will also receive an “Ambassador for Humanity” award from Steven Spielberg at a Holocaust memorial event sponsored by the University of Southern California’s Shoah Foundation, which was founded by the director.

When Mr. Spielberg announced the award, he cited Mr. Obama’s “commitment to democracy and human rights.” He also said Mr. Obama’s appointment of the nation’s first special envoy for Holocaust Survivor Services “demonstrates his staunch commitment to honoring the past while building a better future.”

The Holocaust event and another “official” energy-related event Friday in San Jose ensure that taxpayers will cover much of the cost of the president’s trip, even though it’s mostly devoted to politics.

On Thursday, the president will attend four fundraisers in Southern California. His fundraising hosts include Walt Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn, billionaire and former Qualcomm Chairman Irwin Jacobs, and Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer. Current Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs, Irwin’s son, has been active in promoting Mr. Obama’s immigration reform plan, and Ms. Mayer has lobbied the administration to allow more transparency about the information requests her company receives from the National Security Agency.

Tickets for the events range from $1,000 per person to $64,800 per couple, depending on the event and the level of access to Mr. Obama.

Irwin Jacobs was the second-biggest donor to Mr. Obama’s 2012 campaign, contributing well over $2 million to the president’s re-election effort.

Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate (53 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the party), but they are defending 21 of the 36 seats contested in November. Many political analysts believe the GOP is within reach of picking up the net six seats needed to regain control of the Senate. In the House, Democrats would need a net gain of 17 seats to take the chamber, a goal that most political strategists believe the party cannot achieve.

Democrats are leading in the 2014 money race of “hard” contributions, which are subject to federal limits. But Republicans are believed to be benefiting more from spending by outside groups that don’t need to disclose their contributions.

1835,1835,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/8/holder-schools-must-enroll-children-illegals/,Right,"Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that all schools must enroll illegal immigrants as students, citing “troubling reports” that some districts are discriminating against the children of undocumented parents.

“Public school districts have an obligation to enroll students regardless of immigration status and without discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin,” Mr. Holder said in a statement released Thursday by the Justice Department. He said the department will do “everything it can” to make sure schools meet this obligation.

Mr. Holder was joined by Education Secretary Arne Duncan in issuing the new guidance to school administrators, telling them to be more flexible in accepting some documents from illegal parents and not to require others that may prove a child’s age and residence. The guidance is an update to earlier guidelines the Justice Department issued to school systems in 2011.

Although schools have a right to establish a child’s residency in a district, they don’t need to require the parents to have state-issued driver’s licenses or Social Security cards to prove they are in the country legally, the new guidelines state. Parents can produce a utility bill or a lease as a substitute.

The guidance is based on a 1982 Supreme Court decision that says children of illegal immigrants have a right to a public education. In Plyler v. Doe, the court struck down a Texas statute that denied funding for education to the children of illegal immigrants and a school district’s attempt to charge undocumented persons an annual $1,000 tuition fee for each illegal immigrant student.

Some states and school boards have challenged the ruling, most notably California in 1994, when voters approved a referendum to deny all state-funded benefits — including education — to illegals. The courts later struck down the referendum.

In 1996, Congress tried to pass immigration legislation that would have allowed states to deny public education benefits to certain illegal aliens or to charge them tuition. But it was withdrawn after President Bill Clinton threatened to veto it.

School boards then began to take action against illegal immigrants by requiring Social Security numbers or driver’s licenses. The also employed practices such as proposing separate schools for immigrant students and requiring paperwork designed to identify immigration status.

Today, schools in New York, New Jersey and Arizona, among others, routinely inquire into immigration status as part of the enrollment process, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

In Alabama, public schools must determine the immigration status of children and parents during enrollment, and then can report the undocumented persons to immigration authorities.

The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights has received 17 complaints related to enrollment policies since it first issued guidance in 2011, Mr. Duncan said. Complaints were from Ohio, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C.,among others.

That’s in addition to a number of undisclosed complaints filed in the Justice Department. In Georgia, the Justice Department evaluated the enrollment policies of more than 200 school districts and helped them resolve issues, authorities said.

“We have continued to hear troubling reports of actions — being taken by school districts around the country — that have a chilling effect on student enrollment, raising barriers for undocumented children and children from immigrant families who seek to receive the public education to which they are entitled,” Mr. Holder said.

The ACLU applauded the new guidelines.

“Today’s updated guidance reaffirms the longstanding principle, established by the Supreme Court over 30 years ago, that all children living in our country have a right to equal access to public education,” ACLU Legislative Counsel Joanne Lin said in an e-mail. “School districts must adhere to this guidance, and meet their constitutional obligations to ensure that no child is locked outside the schoolhouse door.”

1840,1840,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/8/boko-harem-kidnap-followed-us-first-effort-public-/,Right,"U.S. officials have told The Washington Times that by mid-2012, a debate was raging behind the scenes at the State Department about how to publicly define the Boko Haram threat and how what exactly Washington should be doing to respond to the mounting violence in Africa’s top oil-producing nation.

Several analysts and officials speaking anonymously with The Times said there was resistance at the time to adding Boko Haram to Washington’s official terrorist organizations lists out of concern that doing so would bolster the group’s stature on the world stage and — as a result — enhance its ability to grow and recruit new members.

Now, the terror outfit commands a global stage after kidnapping more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls.

But back in June 2012, the State Department moved to designate three Boko Haram leaders as “global terrorists” with “close links” to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghrab.

Despite the designations, and mounting claims by regional experts that Boko Haram was gaining increasing access through AQIM to such military hardware as rocket-propelled grenades from jihadist smuggling networks in Mali and Libya, the Obama administration continued to resist labeling the entire group as a global terrorist organization.

Alternatively, the administration appeared to be acquiescing to a strategy being pushed during 2012 by the Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan to create an amnesty program in which Boko Haram members might avoid prosecution in exchange for laying down their weapons.

A similar approach during the late-2000s had succeeded in taming militant activity in Nigeria’s Christian south. But the effort yielded no significant results in the nation’s predominantly Muslim north — and was complicated because the Jonathan government’s security forces were running rampant in Northern Nigeria.

A Human Rights Watch report in October 2013 cited the implication of the security forces in such “serious human rights violations” as execution-style killings of detainees.

That report, along with the rapidly devolving situation in Northern Nigeria, served as backdrop for the State Departments sudden move in November 2013 to officially designate Boko Haram as a terrorist organization, ending what had been a heated debate over the group’s status.

What remains to be seen is whether the dispatching of U.S. and British officials to aid Nigerian authorities in attempting to rescue the 276 school girls recently kidnapped by Boko Haram will be followed by a deepening U.S. involvement in the situation.

1851,1851,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/16/opposition-leader-narendra-modi-be-indias-next-pri/,Right,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Opposition leader Narendra Modi will be India’s next prime minister, winning the most decisive election victory the country has seen in more than a quarter century and sweeping the long-dominant Congress party from power, partial results showed Friday.

Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party was winning in enough seats in the lower house of Parliament to exceed the 272-seat majority needed to create a government without forming a coalition with smaller parties, the Election Commission said.

Full results were expected later in the day but Modi’s win was all but assured.

As his victory became clear, Modi appeared before a crowd of cheering supporters and noted that he is the first Indian prime minister born after independence from Britain in 1947.

“I would like to reassure the nation that while we did not get to fight and die for independence … we have the honor of living for this nation,” he said.

The outcome was a crushing defeat for the Congress party, which is deeply entwined with the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty that has been at the center of Indian politics for most of the country’s post-independence history.

Modi’s slick and well-financed campaign promised a revival of economic growth and took advantage of widespread dissatisfaction with the scandal-plagued Congress party. Although he has focused strongly on the economy, Modi has given some hints of his foreign policy leanings, saying the BJP wants to strengthen India’s strategic partnership with the U.S. and build on the foundations laid by the last BJP prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

Vajpayee, who governed from 1998 to 2004, rode a bus across the border from India to Pakistan during his term, in what was seen as a bold step in trying to mend ties with India’s longtime enemy.

The last time any single party won a majority in India was in 1984, when an emotional nation gave Congress a staggering victory of more than 400 seats following the assassination of then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

The overwhelming victory gives Modi, a 63-year-old career politician, a strong mandate to govern India at a time of deep social and economic change. India is in the throes of rapid urbanization and globalization just as the youth population skyrockets — with many new voters far less deferential to traditional voting patterns focused on family lineage and caste.

For the young Indian voters, the priorities are jobs and development, which Modi put at the forefront of his campaign.

Congress, which has been in power for all but 10 years of the country’s history since independence, has been plagued by repeated corruption scandals. Friday’s results showed Congress leading in only 42 seats, its worst showing ever.

The leader of the Congress campaign, 43-year-old Rahul Gandhi, failed to inspire public confidence. He was seen as ambivalent at best over winning a job held previously by his father, grandmother and great-grandfather.

“I wish the new government all the best,” Rahul Gandhi told reporters Friday afternoon, adding that he held himself responsible for the party’s losses.

Immediately after his appearance, his mother, Sonia Gandhi, the president of the party, took the microphone and said she assumes responsibility.

The two took no questions after their brief remarks and Rahul trailed his mother off the stage.

Rahul Gandhi, who first won a seat in Parliament in 2004, has been viewed as prime-minister-in-waiting for his entire political career, though he never appeared comfortable in the role. When he finally gave the first television interview of his political career earlier this year it made for dull, uninspiring viewing full of vague promises.

In sharp contrast, Modi was quick to publicly mock the Gandhi scion, often referring to the Congress as a “mother-son” government.

There was a record turnout in the election, with 66.38 percent of India’s 814 million eligible voters casting ballots during the six-week contest, which began April 7 and was held in stages across the country. Turnout in the 2009 general election was 58.13 percent.

“In the history of independent India, no political party has defeated the Congress party with such a wide margin,” BJP President Rajnath Singh told a news conference that opened with the blowing of a conch shell, a traditional start to most Hindu rituals.

Modi’s campaign was seen by many as a media and marketing coup for a man whose background ties him to bloodshed in Gujarat, where communal rioting in 2002 left more than 1,000 people dead, most of them Muslims. Modi is accused of doing little to stop the rampage, though he denies any wrongdoing and has never been charged with a crime.

Modi was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 for alleged complicity in the riots, although as prime minister he would be virtually assured a visa.

The Obama administration started mending fences in February, when, for the first time in Modi’s decade-long tenure as the top official in Gujarat state, the U.S. ambassador met with him. Still, Modi, a Hindu nationalist, is widely seen as a divisive figure and critics have often questioned whether he can be a truly secular leader in a country with many faiths.

But Modi focused on promises of a revival in economic growth, taking advantage of widespread dissatisfaction with the Congress party.

At one point Friday, the benchmark Sensex stock index rose as much as 6.1 percent on news of the BJP’s strong showing before closing 0.9 percent higher than Thursday.

Sreeram Chaulia, a political analyst and dean of the Jindal School of International Affairs, said the BJP’s image as a purely capitalist, pro-business party resonated across India. That image contrasts with Congress, which is considered more of a welfare party, mixing capitalist reforms with handouts for the poor.

“A lot of ordinary people believed in (Modi’s) message and wanted to give him the strong mandate he was seeking, to see if he could really change things in India,” Chaulia said. “There has been growth in the middle class, so of course why have they punished the incumbents? Because they want more, obviously, something more than subsistence. They want upward mobility.”

Modi managed to hammer away at Gandhi — specifically the perception that he is nothing more than a feudal prince from a family that views ruling the country as its birthright.

In sharp contrast to the street parties outside the BJP office, a sober scene played out in front of Congress headquarters, where few showed up despite barricades erected to protect supporters from passing road traffic.

Jairam Ramesh, India’s rural development minister, lamented his party’s defeat but said Congress will survive.

“I admit that in 2014, the result is worse than our worst-case scenario,” he said. “But the Congress party has a deep reservoir of strength.”

Just 15 percent of Americans told the pollsters that they are supporters of the tea party movement today, which is less than half the level of support at its peak of 31 percent in November 2010 shortly after the midterm election when the movement fueled a landslide Republican win to take majority control of the House.

That’s also the lowest level of support gauged by the poll since it began asking about the tea party in February 2010.

The polls findings were released the day after primary elections in which Republican establishment candidates beat tea party-backed opponents in key races, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell trouncing tea party-backed Matt Bevin in Kentucky.

The poll found that the tea party had lost significant support among its core constituency: Republicans.

About 32 percent of self-identified Republicans now consider themselves supporters of the tea party, down 10 points from February and a drop of 23 points from July 2010, the summer before the GOP’s historic midterm win.

Mr. Obama will use a helicopter and motorcade for his visit to the Tappan Zee Bridge in Tarrytown, N.Y., one of the busiest spans on the East Coast. The 3-mile-long bridge is undergoing a $3.9 billion replacement project, financed mostly by bonds funded by higher tolls.

Mr. Obama is expected to blame congressional Republicans for blocking a new transportation bill.

1857,1857,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/30/issa-releases-kerry-commitment-testify-benghazi/,Right,"While accusing Secretary of State John F. Kerry of trying to “squirm his way” out of a commitment to appear before his committee, House Oversight and Government Reform (OGR) Committee Chairman Darrell E. Issa said Friday he will no longer try to force Mr. Kerry to testify on Benghazi at a June 12 hearing.

Mr. Issa, California Republican, had subpoenaed Mr. Kerry twice to appear before committee. After some jockeying over scheduling, the State Department implied that Mr. Kerry would appear before either Mr. Issa’s committee to testify about the Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attack or a select committee on Benghazi chaired by GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina — but not both.

Mr. Issa said in a statement Friday that Mr. Kerry and others’ attempts to use the June 12 hearing as a “shield” against the select committee meant it was time to reassess.

“It’s been disappointing to watch a long serving former senator, like Secretary Kerry, squirm his way to what I’m doing today — releasing him from the upcoming hearing commitment he made only after we issued him a subpoena,” Mr. Issa said.

Mr. Issa said no matter how long it takes, getting the truth about what happened in the attack, which claimed the lives of four Americans, is what matters and that the select committee “is the House of Representatives’ commitment to getting this truth.”

“While Speaker [John] Boehner and I had both originally concluded that Secretary Kerry needed to promptly testify and explain why his Department had withheld subpoenaed documents, neither of us immediately recognized how opponents of congressional oversight would use this as an opportunity to distract from the Select Committee’s effort,” Mr. Issa said.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Friday the department was “mystified by the decision to cancel the briefing and also mystified by the language in the press release that was just issued.”

“Our view is that these issues have been pored over in depth to an extensive degree, and our focus, as you’ve heard the secretary say, should be on what we can do together with Congress to protect the men and women serving overseas,” she said.

She said they haven’t received a specific request from the select committee yet but remain committed to being cooperative, and that Mr. Kerry values the role of oversight.

Another State Department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said last week that Mr. Kerry was prepared to testify before Mr. Issa’s committee on either June 12 or June 20 and that the department believed there were more appropriate witnesses but was trying to be cooperative.

“We have been clear that we’re willing to work with the committee despite the fact that the Benghazi oversight has been consolidated under the select committee,” she said. “We believe the secretary’s appearance before [oversight] will eliminate any need for the secretary to appear a second time before the select committee.”

The charges are historic; NBC News reported that it’s the first time in history that the United States has formally filed accusations over cyber espionage against another country.

Attorney General Eric Holder is due to detail the charges on Monday.

But NBC said that the charges actually name several Chinese government workers.

“They used military and intelligence facilities to commit cyber espionage against U.S. companies,” one official said, to NBC.

The names of the companies that were reportedly hit by the espionage haven’t yet been released. But one source close to the investigation told NBC that the companies are believed to be in the manufacturing and energy fields.

1910,1910,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/30/house-passes-va-reform-compromise/,Right,"House lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to overhaul the VA health care system, hoping a $16 billion infusion of cash can help gain a handle on the wait times and poor care issues for veterans that have plagued the department.

But it was unclear whether the money is sufficient and properly tailored to fix the problems, given the systematic data manipulation within the Veterans Affairs health care system that has made the department’s own numbers suspect.

Indeed, it was unclear how far the $16 billion would go in setting up a key program that would let veterans seek care from private doctors at taxpayers’ expense if they have been waiting more than 30 days for a VA appointment or live too far from a VA facility.

Still, all sides said the House bill marked at least a down payment on fixing the system.

“There’s no doubt that the Department of Veterans Affairs, as we know it today, is in crisis and our veterans are suffering,” said House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, Florida Republican and a co-author of the bill. “The conference committee report we’re considering today is the first step.”

The 420-5 vote in favor of the deal signaled that the eagerness to care for veterans outweighed the price, $10 billion of which would be tacked onto the deficit, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate.

Senators are slated to vote Thursday on the agreement and send it to President Obama, who is expected to sign it.

It is the culmination of months of negotiations that began after a whistleblower revealed that veterans were dying while waiting for care on secret lists at a Phoenix VA facility. Since then, investigations have found whistleblower retaliation, poor care and wait-time data manipulation across the system.

The bipartisan deal would let veterans who have been waiting more than 30 days for appointments or who live more than 40 miles away from VA facilities to be reimbursed for private-sector care outside the system.

That program would last until the $10 billion is expended. At that point, Congress would have to decide whether to continue paying for the program.

The legislation also would give VA Secretary Robert McDonald — who was officially sworn in Wednesday — more power to fire poor-performing senior executives and would let the VA enter into 27 leases for major medical facilities in 18 states and Puerto Rico, something the VA requested in its fiscal 2014 budget request.

However, the VA has admitted to Congress that its data have been manipulated to the point that they are unreliable, making it uncertain whether the department has an accurate picture of where facilities are needed or how much they will cost to build.

For lawmakers, the symbolism of the vote was more important, said Steve Billet, director of the legislative affairs program at George Washington University.

“I don’t think anyone knows as a practical matter, and frankly I don’t think anybody cares, if it’s 27 or 35 [leases] in 18 states or nine states,” he said. “I think what’s going on here, frankly, is Congress is doing something that’s political expedient and necessary.”

Mr. Miller said the compromise bill will require independent assessments to make sure VA’s spending plans, including the 27 leases, are needed. He also warned the department that permission can be revoked or changed based on those assessments.

“The validity of VA’s numbers was a concern from the start. That’s why the House initially wanted to craft a bill that focused solely on increasing accountability at the department and providing veterans with options to obtain non-VA medical care,” Mr. Miller said. “But in order to reach a deal with the Senate, we had to make some concessions.”

Emphasizing the bipartisan support of the bill, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, said “no veteran should be forced to wait for the health care or benefits they have earned.”

All five votes in opposition were from Republicans.

“I have and will continue to fight to ensure that our men and women in uniform receive the physical and mental care that they deserve,” said Rep. Walter B. Jones, North Carolina Republican. “Unfortunately, this bill does the opposite by allowing the current broken system to remain in place and increasing federal spending at a time that our national debt has already reached $17 trillion.”

Mr. Billet said it may be more fiscally responsible to wait for the results of a full audit, but it’s not the most politically beneficial for lawmakers who cringed at the thought of facing constituents during the upcoming August vacation without finishing a deal.

“Politics trumps policy in every instance in this town and this is a great example,” he said. “It also says Congress can overcome its gridlock and its polarization when it needs to or when it thinks it needs to for political reasons.”

The reports of veteran deaths galvanized veterans groups into action and forced personnel changes at the VA, where a handful of top officials, including Secretary Eric K. Shinseki, were forced from office.

The pressure also helped push negotiators from the Republican-led House and Democratic majority in the Senate to bridge deep policy and cost differences between their proposals.

1917,1917,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/30/house-votes-sue-president-obama-over-claims-presid/,Right,"House Republicans voted Wednesday evening to authorize an unprecedented lawsuit against President Obama, escalating a separation of powers battle between Congress and the White House that is heavily tinged with election-year politics.

Mr. Obama mocked Republicans, telling them to “stop just hatin’ all the time,” but GOP lawmakers said they felt boxed in, being unable to get their legislation through the Democrat-controlled Senate and having to watch as the president tweaks, waives or ignores laws Congress has written but which he dislikes.

“This isn’t about Republicans and Democrats; it’s about defending the Constitution that we swore an oath to uphold and acting decisively when it might be compromised,” said House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, as he pleaded for Democrats to look beyond their party allegiance and defend Congress against an ever more powerful chief executive. “Are you willing to let any president choose what laws to execute and what laws to change?”

The 225-201 vote, which broke down almost entirely along party lines, was a resounding rejection of Mr. Boehner’s call, as Democrats said Republicans were more interested in repealing Obamacare and stopping the president’s agenda.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, the chamber’s top Democrat, said she could see no reason for the Republican effort unless it’s a precursor for impeachment.

“Why would you sue somebody unless you want to prove something? And why would you go down that path unless you wanted to do something about it?” Mrs. Pelosi said. “Middle-class families don’t have time for the Republican partisan grudge match with the president.”

SEE ALSO: CURL: Come election time, Obama suddenly talks jobs — and God

Mr. Boehner a day earlier said there were no plans to pursue impeachment and that Democrats are the only ones talking about impeachment because it’s a successful fundraising tactic for them.

Mrs. Pelosi, though, said Mr. Boehner must officially rule impeachment “off the table” — a phrase she used when she squelched efforts by her fellow Democrats to impeach President George W. Bush.

The details of the lawsuit itself were almost an afterthought, but under the resolution passed Wednesday, House attorneys can be directed to file suit challenging Mr. Obama’s decision to issue waivers of his own health care law’s “employer mandate,” which was supposed to require large companies to provide insurance for their employees or else face fines.

Mr. Obama waived the fines for 2014, then expanded his waiver to include 2015 and 2016.

Mr. Boehner said House Republicans support waiving those fines, which is why it’s all the more strange that Mr. Obama acted alone, without coming to Congress to change the law. He said that situation is why Republicans chose to sue over Obamacare rather than a host of other perceived overreaches including those involving environmental and immigration policies.

The lawsuit’s chances for success are questionable.

PHOTOS: See Obama's biggest White House fails

Legal analysts said the biggest hurdle will be overcoming the federal courts’ rules requiring a plaintiff to show harm before the judges will hear the case. Institutional harm to Congress’ constitutional powers generally has been rejected as a sufficient reason.

But some analysts said it’s an open question for the Supreme Court — and they argue Mr. Obama’s overreach has been so dramatic that judges might be tempted to get involved in order to rebalance the two other branches of government.

Speaking in Kansas City, Missouri, hours before the vote, Mr. Obama taunted Republicans, asking them to forgo the lawsuit and instead back his agenda of raising the minimum wage, boosting spending on infrastructure and other steps he said would help the middle class.

“Come on and help out a little bit. Stop being mad all the time. Stop just hatin’ all the time,” the president told a raucous crowd. “Come on. Let’s get some work done together.”

Minutes after Wednesday’s vote, the White House sent out an email to supporters vowing to take more executive action — this time issuing a policy laying out stiffer worker safety rules for federal contractors.

White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer also said in the email that Mr. Obama will “deal with our broken immigration system in the months ahead.”

Mr. Obama, who had some legislative successes in his first two years in office, backed by huge majorities in both the House and Senate, has grown increasingly frustrated since 2011, when Republicans took control of the House and began trying to roll back his policies.

With Democrats still controlling the Senate, that’s often led to gridlock on Capitol Hill — and Mr. Obama has enthusiastically claimed the right to take action on his own when Congress won’t.

Judges have taken a dim view of some of those actions. Last month a unanimous Supreme Court ruled that he overstepped when he made recess appointments to four key positions at a time when the Senate was meeting every three days in pro forma sessions specifically to deny him his recess powers.

Mr. Obama had argued that the Senate wasn’t really in session, but all nine justices rejected that, saying it’s up to Congress to decide those matters.

All Democrats who voted Wednesday opposed the lawsuit, as did five Republicans: Reps. Paul C. Broun of Georgia, Scott Garrett of New Jersey, Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Steve Stockman of Texas.

“This lawsuit is merely an act of political theater that is highly unlikely to result in any real consequences for an executive branch that continues to display a blatant disregard for the rule of law,” Mr. Jones said in a statement.

He said rather than sue, the House should either impeach Mr. Obama or use its power of the purse to cancel Mr. Obama’s actions.

Both sides are expected to use Wednesday’s vote as they gin up their base ahead of November’s elections.

1923,1923,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/1/house-gop-resurrects-border-bill-predicts-successf/,Right,"House Republicans resurrected their border bill Friday morning and said they were on track to pass the rewritten measure later in the day — though with the Senate gone for the summer the vote will be more a political statement than a policy-making exercise.

GOP leaders weren’t making any predictions after suffering an embarrassing conservative rebellion on Thursday, which forced them back to the drawing board, but rank-and-file lawmakers said they believed they had finally corralled enough votes to pass it.

“We will finish the job. We will get it passed tonight,” said Rep. Matt Salmon, an Arizona Republican who said the changes made overnight were critical to earning enough votes.

The crux of the bill sends hundreds of millions of dollars to immigration agencies to house the illegal immigrant children and families surging across the border, and makes changes to a 2008 law that made it difficult to deport children from Central America.

In order to attract enough support, Republicans also added in another bill that would halt President Obama’s non-deportation policy for so-called Dreamers, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

Conservatives had supported both of those policies in general but balked at the way the bills were written, arguing they left too many loopholes that they believed Mr. Obama would use in refusing to enforce the laws.

PHOTOS: Separated at birth: Pols and their celebrity look-alikes

As of late Friday morning GOP lawmakers were rewriting their bills to try to accommodate those concerns.

The procedural hiccups signal just how touchy the immigration issue is. Many Republicans want to vote on the strongest possible statement opposing Mr. Obama’s policies, and they fear his claims of unilateral authority to pick and choose how he enforces immigration laws.

Democratic leaders, meanwhile, have called for the GOP to forgo changes to the law, and instead want to see a bill that only spends money to house and care for the tens of thousands of children and families from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that are crossing the Rio Grande in search of a foothold in the U.S.

But Senate Democrats failed to win enough votes for that plan on Thursday, with even some of their own party colleagues joining Republicans in saying it doesn’t do anything to stop the flow of children.

After their failure, Senate Democrats closed the chamber down and sent most lawmakers home for a five-week summer vacation, meaning that regardless of what the House does, nothing can be sent to Mr. Obama’s desk.

“They never should have left in the first place,” said Rep. Michele M. Bachmann, Minnesota Republican. “We were here actively engaged on the House side, getting the job done on immigration. They couldn’t get the job done in the Senate.”

1933,1933,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/6/cease-fire-gaza-holds-second-day/,Right,"GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — A cease-fire between Israel and Hamas that ended a month of war was holding for a second day Wednesday, ahead of negotiations in Cairo on a long-term truce and a broader deal for the war-ravaged Gaza Strip.

In the coming days, Egyptian mediators are to shuttle between delegations from both sides to try to work out a deal. The Palestinian delegation is composed of negotiators from all major factions, including Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza. Names of those in the Israeli team have not been disclosed.

Some details have emerged about the negotiating points of Hamas, including an internationally funded reconstruction of the coastal strip that would be overseen by a Palestinian unity government led by President Mahmoud Abbas.

Meanwhile, Norway is organizing a donor conference and the Western-backed Abbas is expected to take the lead in overseeing the rebuilding in the coastal territory, which his Fatah movement lost to Hamas in 2007. International Mideast envoy Tony Blair, who is also involved in arranging the conference, was in Cairo and was to meet with Egypt’s foreign minister and Arab League officials on Wednesday.

The cease-fire is the longest lull in a war that has killed nearly 1,900 Palestinians. Israel has lost 67 people, including three civilians.

The war broke out on July 8, when the Israeli military began bombarding targets in Gaza in an attempt to stop Hamas from launching rockets at Israel. On July 17, Israel sent ground troops into the densely-populated territory to destroy underground tunnels it said Hamas had constructed for attacks inside Israel.

But in the weeks leading up to the war, Israeli-Palestinian tensions were soaring in the wake of the June killings of three Israeli teenagers, whose bodies were discovered two weeks after they disappeared in the West Bank.

Israel accused Hamas of being behind the abductions, and subsequently carried out a massive ground operation in the West Bank, arresting hundreds of Hamas operatives as part of a manhunt. And in early July, an Arab teenager was abducted and burned alive by Israeli extremists in an apparent revenge attack. Six Jewish Israelis were arrested in that killing.

On Wednesday, Israel’s justice ministry confirmed that the suspected mastermind behind the killing of the three Israeli teens had been arrested in July. The suspect, Husam al-Qawasmi, allegedly led a three-man cell that Israeli prosecutors say kidnapped and murdered the teens. It wasn’t immediately clear if al-Qawasmi has been charged.

Israel says the cell’s members are all affiliated with Hamas, though the militant group has not claimed any connection to the teens’ abduction and killings.

In Gaza, people took advantage on Wednesday of the calm to return to their devastated homes and inspect the damage.

Cars and donkey carts loaded with household goods and mattresses filled the streets and queues formed at banks as people waited to withdraw cash from ATMs.

Crews from utility companies worked frantically to repair downed electricity and telephone lines, though with Gaza’s only electrical generating plant badly damaged by an Israeli attack, it may be a long while before anything resembling normal service is restored.

In the devastated Shijaiyah neighborhood east of Gaza city, carpenter Mahmoud Al Maghani, 44, surveyed the damage to his property.

“I think my workshop was here, but honestly I can’t make sure of that,” he said. “I came yesterday and all I found was rubble.”

The mood was upbeat in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun, with many people expressing hope that the intensity of the destruction in this round of fighting — the third since Hamas took control of Gaza seven years ago — would ratchet up enough pressure on the international community to find solutions to the territory’s problems.

Small groups of civilians trickled back to their homes Wednesday, making their way over buckled roads, through dangling power lines and overturned trees to inspect their neighborhoods. Along the way, rows of flattened buildings alternated with moderately damaged structures — and rare buildings with no damage at all.

Mohammed Musleh, 27, said he had spent the last two weeks with his bride of four months and the rest of his family in the relative safety of the Jabaliyah refugee camp, south of Beit Hanoun.

He surveyed his now uninhabitable third floor apartment in the family’s home damaged by tank shelling, and said he hoped that this time a real solution could be found to end the isolation Gazans have endured since Israel imposed a blockade in 2007, followed by one by Egypt late last summer.

“The war was necessary to force the blockade to be lifted,” he said. “I hope that this time there will be a really permanent solution for it.”

Mr. Netanyahu specifically said Israeli military wouldn’t stop its fight against Hamas, even after troops rooted out and destroyed all the tunnels the terror group had dug, Reuters reported.

Shortly after, Israeli rocket attacks killed at least 30 more in Gaza — and a delegation of Palestinians headed back to Cairo for more cease-fire talks, Reuters reported. So far, previous peace talks have proven futile. One sticking point: Hamas wants the total destruction of the Jewish nation.

Among the main points of “The Covenant of the Hamas,” issued in 1988, is an excerpt that states: “On the destruction of Israel: Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it,” the Federation of American Scientists reported.

1943,1943,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/8/f-18-jets-dropped-500-pund-laser-guided-bombs-isil/,Right,"U.S. fighter jets have begun pounding artillery held by the al Qaeda-inspired militants in northern Iraq with laser guided bombs, a senior Defense Department official said Friday.



“At approximately 6:45 a.m. EDT, the U.S. military conducted a targeted airstrike against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorists,” Rear Adm. John Kirby, a top Pentagon spokesman said in a statement.



“Two F/A-18 aircraft dropped 500-pound laser-guided bombs on a mobile artillery piece near Erbil,” Rear Adm. Kirby said. “ISIL was using this artillery to shell Kurdish forces defending Erbil where U.S. personnel are located.”



A small clutch of U.S. advisers have been based in the city during recent weeks, assessing the capability of Kurdish forces to defend the region. No other details were immediately provided.



Friday’s action came roughly 12 hours after President Obama announced that he had authorized airstrikes against Islamist terrorists in Iraq and approved a humanitarian mission to deliver food and other supplies to tens of thousands of Iraqis trapped on mountaintops — moves that represent the most significant re-engagement in Iraq since formal combat operations ended three years ago.



Speaking at the White House on Thursday night, the president said the U.S. cannot sit idly by as innocent Iraqis are slaughtered by the al Qaeda-inspired extremists.

“Earlier today, the secretary called President Obama to make sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him, his policies, or his leadership,” said Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, in a widely reported statement. “While they’ve had honest differences on some issues, including aspects of the wicked challenge Syria presents, she has explained those differences in her book and at many points since then.”

Mrs. Clinton caused quite a stir with her comments to The Atlantic about Mr. Obama’s behind-scenes mantra on foreign policy, summed by White House aides as “Don’t do stupid stuff.”

Of that, Mrs. Clinton said: “Great nations need organizing principles and ‘don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle.”

One of Mr. Obama’s key supporters, former adviser David Axelrod, then took to Twitter to denounce Mrs. Clinton’s characterization of White House policy, suggesting that the real “stupid stuff” was “occupying Iraq in the first place” – an obvious reference to then-Sen. Clinton’s vote for U.S. use of force.

Mrs. Clinton’s walk-back comes as she is due to meet Wednesday night at a Martha’s Vineyard event, where Mr. Obama is vacationing.

1958,1958,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/15/rick-perry-indicted-abuse-power-over-threat-veto-p/,Right,"AUSTIN, Texas — Texas Gov. Rick Perry has been indicted for abuse of power after carrying out a threat to veto funding for state public corruption prosecutors.

The Republican governor is accused of abusing his official powers by publicly promising to veto $7.5 million for the state public integrity unit at the Travis County District Attorney’s office. He was indicted by an Austin grand jury Friday.

Perry said he’d veto the funding if the district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, didn’t resign. Lehmberg had recently been convicted of drunken driving. The state’s Public Integrity Unit operates out of her office.

When Lehmberg refused, Perry carried out his veto, drawing an ethics complaint.

Perry is the first Texas governor indicted in nearly a century. He’s leaving office in January, but he’s a possible 2016 presidential run."
1966,1966,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/18/editorial-restoring-the-peace/,Right,"OPINION:

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, called out the National Guard on Monday to restore order to the streets of Ferguson. Heavily armed soldiers will take the place of even more heavily armed police officers who had been assigned to prevent looting as the mobs gathered to riot.

The investigation of the Aug. 9 police shooting of Michael Brown shows that maybe the police did not, after all, coldly shoot an innocent man in the back. The evidence shows the officer faced a man who had just committed a strong-arm robbery of a convenience store. It’s plausible that young Brown, a 6‘4”, 292-pound 18-year-old was not happy when the local constabulary told him to get out of the middle of the street.

Residents in the St. Louis suburbs didn’t believe the initial police account because many of them have had experiences with cops that were not happy ones. The area is riddled with speed-trap towns that collect half of their general revenue from traffic tickets. Instead of friendly lawmen, they see revenue agents with attitude and big guns. Police weaponry is increasingly powerful.

Ferguson’s finest paraded their Pentagon hardware with pride, like a kid with his first car, not understanding that such a display of force is wholly inappropriate on American streets. The generals would cashier a commander who allowed his troops in Iraq to point machine guns and sniper rifles at civilians like an occupying army.

The militarization of the police has so reached the point of absurdity that three years ago the Department of Education led an assault on a mobile home in Stockton, Calif., to arrest a nonviolent, white-collar man who used faked student-loan applications to pocket taxpayer cash. Kids aged 3, 7 and 11 were sound asleep at 6 a.m. when a SWAT team broke down the door. Agents threw the father to the floor in his underwear, and his terrified children were locked in the back seat of an unheated patrol car for more than two hours while the cops went through the mobile home, apparently to look for guilty ballpoint pens.

There was no need for riot gear to apprehend a student-loan cheat, and certainly no excuse for harassing small children. Had this particular suspect locked his kids in a car to drop into a supermarket for a bottle of milk, he would have been arrested and prosecuted for child abuse. Common sense goes over the hill when policemen play soldier.

We don’t know that what happened in St. Louis County was the result of arming a SWAT team with enough military hardware to subdue Lower Volta. This transfer of so much military hardware has transformed police thinking. Unidentifiable armed men in military uniforms carrying fully automatic weapons and riding in armed personnel carriers no longer see themselves as keepers of the peace. They’re eager to find some action resembling Omaha Beach.

Fully 80 percent of towns and cities with a population of 25,000 or more have their own SWAT teams, many with small likelihood of encountering SWAT-like “situations.” Many snapped up armored vehicles, machine guns and body armor left over from the Iraq war. When these police teams are deployed in full battle regalia, they make up a dangerous and truly scary force.

No one wants to put the men and women who serve in law enforcement at greater risk than necessary. Nearly all of them do their best to do a difficult and often dangerous job, but no community should feel comfortable with a police force that seems to be morphing from a public safety force to an occupying army before a citizen’s very eyes."
1984,1984,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/27/gov-bobby-jindal-sue-obama-administration-common-c/,Right,"Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said he was filing a lawsuit on Wednesday against the Obama administration over alleged manipulation of grant money to force states to accept Common Core as their school standards.

Mr. Jindal is also accusing the White House of manipulating the regulatory process to compel states to take the much-disputed educational program, The Associated Press reported.

The U.S. Department of Education used its $4.3 billion grant program and waiver policy to press states into accepting the same educational testing and standards program. Mr. Jindal said that action “effectively forces states down a path toward a national curriculum,” which violates the 10th Amendment of the Constitution — state sovereignty, AP said.

Mr. Jindal also alleged the action breaks federal laws that ban the federal government from taking control of school and educational content.

He was planning to file the complaint in federal court in Baton Rouge.

AP was provided a draft copy of the suit.

“The federal government has hijacked and destroyed the Common Core initiative,” Mr. Jindal said in a statement reported by AP. “Common Core is the latest effort by big government disciples to strip away state rights and put Washington, D.C., in control of everything.”

Common Core puts forth benchmarks to show what students should know in math and English after each grade. Some educators, parents and students have complained the teaching style is fuzzy and confusing, and often does more harm than good.

Mr. Obama raised eyebrows last week when he admitted that the U.S. does not have a strategy yet to defeat the movement.

But Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, noted that Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are equipped to bring allies together at this week’s NATO conference in Wales.

The stakes are high, she noted, as the Islamic State has shown its brutality by sweeping through Iraq and killing American journalist James Foley

“I believe it’s potentially very serious,” she told “Meet the Press.” “They have announced that they don’t intend to stop. They have announced that they will come after us if they can, that they will, quote, spill our blood. They have, indeed, done that by beheading Mr. Foley and who knows how many others that are unknown. This is a vicious, vicious movement, and it has to be confronted.”

1992,1992,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/29/gop-sen-mcconnells-campaign-manager-resigns/,Right,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s campaign manager resigned Friday amid fallout from a scandal in Iowa involving a presidential campaign he worked for in 2012. Jesse Benton said he didn’t want to become a distraction as McConnell tries to win a tough re-election campaign in Kentucky.

“This decision breaks my heart, but I know it is the right thing for Mitch, for Kentucky and for the country,” Benton said in a statement.

Benton’s resignation, effective Saturday, comes barely two months before Kentucky voters choose between McConnell, a five-term incumbent and the top-ranking Senate Republican, and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes.

In Iowa this week, former state Sen. Kent Sorenson pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming from his switch of support from one Republican presidential candidate to another before the 2012 Iowa caucuses. He received thousands of dollars in “under the table payments” before switching loyalties from candidate Michele Bachmann, whose Iowa campaign he headed, to candidate Ron Paul, then lied to federal investigators about the money, the Justice Department said.

Prosecutors refused to say which campaign paid Sorenson. A representative for Bachmann didn’t immediately return voice and email messages seeking comment Friday. A phone message for Paul also wasn’t immediately returned.

Benton, a tea party insider, worked as a top aide to Paul. On Friday he said that he has been the target of “inaccurate press accounts and unsubstantiated media rumors” about his role in past campaigns that are “politically motivated, unfair and, most importantly, untrue.”

PHOTOS: Eye-popping excuses in American political scandals

In a separate statement Friday, McConnell’s campaign said the senator “obviously has nothing to do with the Iowa presidential caucus or this investigation, so it would be inappropriate for his campaign to comment on this situation.”

Charly Norton, a spokeswoman for the Grimes campaign, said in a statement, “Sen. McConnell owes the people of Kentucky a full account of what he knew and when he knew it.”

Benton was mentioned in documents gathered during an Iowa state ethics probe of Sorenson, a complaint to the Federal Election Commission and e-mails purported to be from the Ron Paul campaign obtained by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, which monitors federal campaign finance issues, The Courier-Journal of Louisville reported.

Benton’s hiring to oversee McConnell’s campaign was seen as a way to appeal to more conservative elements of the Kentucky GOP. McConnell eventually faced a tea party-inspired opponent in the Republican primary, which he easily won.

Early in the campaign, Benton gained unwanted attention with the airing of a recording in which he was heard saying he was “holding my nose” to work for McConnell’s re-election campaign.

Benton managed Rand Paul’s successful U.S. Senate campaign in Kentucky in 2010. Rand Paul is Ron Paul’s son.

In his statement Friday, Benton said he was troubled that media reports risked “unfairly undermining and becoming a distraction to this re-election campaign.”

“I cannot, and will not, allow any possibility that my circumstances will affect the voters’ ability to hear his (McConnell’s) message and assess his record,” he said. “This election is far too important and the stakes are way too high.”

Benton said he was leaving the campaign with “a top-flight team of incredible people that are working tirelessly to ensure Mitch’s re-election. They are a finely oiled machine and will not skip a beat without me.”"
2012,2012,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/9/obama-reveal-islamic-state-strategy/,Right,"Nine months after belittling the Islamic State as a “JV” terrorist group, President Obama will devote an urgent prime-time address Wednesday to his plan for defeating the suddenly resurgent militants, a strategy that will rely heavily on U.S. partnership with an untested Iraqi government and unproven Syrian rebels.

In a speech from the White House at 9 p.m., Mr. Obama will tell Americans that the Islamic State is now a “high national security priority,” aides said. And the president will try to marshal public and international support for what would likely be a yearslong counterterrorism campaign, launched little more than a year after he declared that the large-scale fight against Islamist terrorism was all but over.

The president briefed House and Senate leaders of both parties at the White House on Tuesday, though it didn’t appear he laid out many specifics. An aide to GOP House Speaker John A. Boehner said the president went over some of the ideas he’s already floated, and a White House statement Tuesday that Mr. Obama believed he had the power to act without congressional approval angered many on Capitol Hill.

Mr. Obama’s address will have to reconcile his past statements with his present course of action, analysts said.

“It’s going to be a huge challenge for President Obama, version 2014, to disagree with President Obama, version 2013, who suggested that we had won the battle against terrorism,” said Danielle Pletka, a foreign policy and defense analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington.

“With sufficient humility and a genuine strategy, I believe he could persuade the American people of the importance of this mission,” she said. “The question is: Does he have the strategy? Does he have the humility? That’s not entirely clear.”

While White House officials underlined that Mr. Obama told the congressional leaders he already has the authority he needs to conduct the kind of operation he will lay out on Wednesday, they said he welcomed a gesture by Congress expressing support for his policy.

A senior White House official said Mr. Obama asked the congressional leaders to authorize training and equipment for the Syrian opposition before lawmakers depart Washington for midterm election campaigning later this month. In May, Mr. Obama proposed $500 million in assistance.

That claim of authority doesn’t sit well with some in Congress, including many Democrats, who say any expansion of attacks must be put up for a vote on Capitol Hill.

“If the president intends to prolong the military campaign in Iraq or extend it into Syria, he needs to make the case directly to the American people and secure authorization from Congress,” said California Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said he thought President Obama should seek congressional “buy-in” on any major new mission, but said he was skeptical of the president’s intentions.

“I don’t think he’s going to ask for that, and I’m dismayed by that,” Mr. Corker told CNN. “I think most people here want to deal with [the Islamic State] in a strong manner that exterminates them. But I think not seeking that approval on the front end is extremely lacking in judgment.”

Mr. Obama approved strikes last month against Islamic State militants, who have made startling gains across broad swaths of Iraq since the spring. The U.S. campaign began on Aug. 8 and totaled 153 strikes as of Tuesday afternoon, all of them in Iraq.

The administration’s plan for fighting the terrorists in Syria will lean on moderate Syrian rebels who are also engaged in a brutal civil war to topple the regime of President Bashar Assad. Mr. Obama hasn’t said whether he’ll expand airstrikes into Syria, and he has vowed not to send U.S. combat troops into the fight.

“Ramping up our assistance to … elements of the moderate Syrian opposition would have the effect both of taking the fight to [the Islamic State] but also taking the fight to the Assad regime,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest.

But vetting the various Syrian rebel groups to find reliable, moderate partners has been a slow and frustrating process for the administration. Adding to that uncertainty, the family of slain U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff said this week that the hostage was sold to the Islamic State by a supposedly moderate Syrian rebel group.

Middle East trip

Mr. Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco, returned from the Middle East Tuesday and told colleagues that she was encouraged by the response from governments in the region to join the fight against the Islamic State. Among the nations most threatened by the militants is Jordan, where The Associated Press reported that the CIA has approached a retired former agency official with close ties to King Abdullah II about setting up a special task force to deal with the threat.

The Arab League has called on members to support international efforts against the Islamic State militarily and politically. Arab governments such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar thus far have avoided a prominent role for fear of provoking retaliatory attacks from the Sunni militants who control major regions of both Syria and Iraq.

The crosscurrents of the conflict are daunting, with the regimes in Syria and Iran, which are hostile to Washington, also determined foes of the Islamic State movement, and reliable allies for the United States on the ground hard to find.

News reports Tuesday indicated that the leader of an ultraconservative Islamic rebel group in Syria was killed Tuesday in a suicide bombing along with others of its top officials, its allies said, thereby weakening the ranks of the country’s already shaky armed opposition.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack that killed Hassan Aboud and other leading members of Ahrar al-Sham, part of the strongest front to challenge the Islamic State. But given that forces loyal to President Bashar Assad’s government do not typically use suicide bombers, it appeared likely that forces in the murky mix of opposition fighters in Syria’s 3-year-old civil war were involved, according to The Associated Press.

Mr. Obama, facing crucial midterm elections in which he needs his antiwar base, will also emphasize in his address Wednesday that he doesn’t envision a campaign in which the U.S. shoulders all of the costs and personnel for the fight, as in the last Iraq war.

“The president, as much as anyone else, has certainly learned the lessons that are evident from previous military activities in Iraq,” Mr. Earnest said. “It does not serve our interest to put the United States in the position in which we are bearing the load of the responsibility for providing security in the nation of Iraq.”

Jens David Ohlin, a constitutional law specialist at Cornell University Law School, said Mr. Obama “has a huge decision to make.”

“Does he want to leave the White House as a peacetime president, declaring victory in the war against al Qaeda and returning the country to a sense of normalcy?” Mr. Ohlin asked. “Or does he want to leave the White House having recommitted the country to another costly military campaign? He cannot have it both ways — splitting the difference with a combination of airstrikes and promises to avoid mission creep.”

2026,2026,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/14/hillary-clinton-returns-to-iowa-teases-about-2016-/,Right,"Hillary Rodham Clinton parachuted into Iowa on Sunday, marking her first visit to the state that crippled her 2008 presidential campaign — sparking a feeding frenzy of speculation about what’s next for the former first lady.

Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, headlined retiring Sen. Tom Harkin’s 37th annual steak fry in a grassy field in Indianola, where they were tracked by a media mob and celebrated the Iowa lawmaker’s 40-year political career.

Along the way, Mrs. Clinton shook hands and posed for pictures with supporters, signed autographs and flipped steaks, all while ignoring questions about the 2016 campaign.

Instead, the 66-year-old former senator and secretary of state teased the crowd about her plans, telling them that her focus is on her future grandchild and “then, of course, there is that other thing.”

“Well, it is true. I am thinking about it, but for today that is not why I am here,” Mrs. Clinton said, sparking disappointed “aahs” from those in attendance. “I am here for the steak.”

Mrs. Clinton praised Mr. Harkin’s record of service and called on the 5,000 activists that turned out for the event — some sporting “Ready for Hillary” T-shirts and touting “Hillary for President” signs — to honor Mr. Harkin’s legacy by working as hard as they can for Democrats in the November election, including his protege, U.S. Rep. Bruce L. Braley, who is running for Mr. Harkin’s seat against state Sen. Joni Ernst, a Republican.

“In 50 days, every Iowa voter needs to know that from the president on down to local officials, we Democrats are for raising the minimum wage, for equal pay for equal work, for making college and technical training affordable, for growing the economy to benefit everyone — and our opponents are not,” she said.

The race in Iowa is among about a dozen across the nation that could decide whether Democrats continue to call the shots in the Senate during the final two years of the Obama administration. Republicans need to pick up a net of six seats to flip control of the upper chamber.

“Do everything you can now to make sure [that] when you wake up the morning after the election, you breathe a big sigh of relief, because you will have done everything you could to make sure that Tom Harkin’s legacy of service, of fighting, of standing up and making it clear whose side he is on will continue,” Mrs. Clinton said.

A CNN/ORC poll released Friday showed that Mr. Braley has a slight 49 percent to 48 percent lead over Mrs. Ernst among likely voters.

The survey also found that 53 percent of registered Democrats said that they would support Mrs. Clinton in the Iowa caucuses, which traditionally kick off the nomination race.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden, who is scheduled to travel to Iowa on Wednesday to headline a liberal Catholic event in Des Moines, received 15 percent, compared to 7 percent for Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and 5 percent for Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who also was in Iowa over the weekend and is openly considering a bid.

“Iowa and America do not want to anoint anybody,” Mr. Sanders said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “What the American people clearly want to see is a major debate about the important issues facing American families and the middle class of this country and not [saying], ‘Oh, here is your crown; take the nomination.’”

Earlier this month, Mrs. Clinton said she will decide “probably after the first of the year about whether I’m going to run again or not,”

Political observers, though, said Mrs. Clinton is likely running.

“If the fact that Hillary Clinton is at Tom Harkin’s Iowa steak fry doesn’t scream ‘2016’ in surround sound, I don’t know what does,” said Ford O’Connell, a GOP strategist. “Let’s face the facts: No one goes to Iowa in September of 2014 without a future presidential run in mind, including Hillary, and this is her coming-out party.”

“The GOP should be shaking in their boots — regardless of the gains the party makes in 2014,” Mr. O’Connell said. “Were it not for Hillary in 2016, the Democrats would be locked out of the White House for the next 8 years no matter who the eventual GOP presidential nominee is.”

Before the steak fry, the Clintons attended a private reception for Mr. Harkin’s To Organize a Majority PAC at Principal Park, the home of Des Moines’ minor league baseball team.

Asked on CNN’s “State of the Union” whether he would support Mrs. Clinton for president, Mr. Harkin was noncommittal, saying they are “very close friends” and that she has inspired women across the globe.

Mr. Harkin said that Mr. Biden, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia and Mr. Sanders could also run for the Democratic nomination.

“Let’s be honest about this,” Mr. Harkin said. “If Hillary decides to run, I think it is going to be very tough for anybody else.”

Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, who served as secretary of the Navy under President Reagan, also has signaled some interest in the job. Despite her strong poll showings and popularity among progressives suspicious of Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Warren has repeatedly said she will not run, even to the point of publicly disassociating herself from a PAC seeking to raise money for her campaign.

In 2008 Mrs. Clinton placed a disappointing third behind then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, the party’s 2004 vice presidential nominee.

In her memoir “Hard Choices,” Mrs. Clinton described the Iowa result as “excruciating.”

At the steak fry Sunday, Mr. Harkin suggested Mrs. Clinton could rebound from the experience, calling the Clintons the “comeback couple.”

2037,2037,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/22/lois-lerner-breaks-silence-im-not-sorry-anything-i/,Right,"Lois Lerner, the former IRS director accused of using her position to delay nonprofit applications to scores of conservative and tea party groups, has broken her wall of silence in a sit-down interview with Politico to say: “I didn’t do anything wrong.”

“I’m proud of my career and the job I did for this country,” she told Politico.

Many in the United States — as well as Capitol Hill — disagree. Ms. Lerner, who’s no longer with the IRS, is having difficulty finding another place of employment, Politico reported. Meanwhile, her legal bills have been piling up, as she’s spent thousands of dollars defending herself against charges of a coverup in the IRS scandal.

But she’s far from asking for forgiveness.

“Regardless of whatever else happens, I know I did the best I could under the circumstances and am not sorry for anything I did,” Ms. Lerner, 63, said in the Politico report.

In May 2013, Ms. Lerner invoked the Fifth Amendment to keep from answering questions from lawmakers about her alleged role in the IRS scandal and coverup — specifically whether IRS agents were giving extra scrutiny to nonprofit applications that contained words like “tea party” and “patriot,” Politico reported.

She subsequently refused to resign but was ordered by human resources to clean out her desk and leave her position, Politico reported.

“By taking the Fifth, Lois put a sign on her back: Kick me,” said Paul Streckfus, the editor of the EO Tax Journal, in Politico. “To the average person, that sounds like, ‘Oh my God, she must be hiding something.’ “

2047,2047,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/26/obama-extends-safe-haven-liberians-ebola-crisis/,Right,"President Obama deferred deportation Friday for thousands of Liberians living in the U.S., allowing them to remain in America for two more years rather than return to their Ebola-stricken homeland.

In a presidential order, Mr. Obama extended the grant of “deferred enforced departure” for Liberians who have enjoyed safe haven status in the U.S. as far back as 1991, when their country was in the midst of a civil war.

Mr. Obama said there are “compelling foreign policy reasons” for his action; Liberia is one of three West African nations where the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus is spiraling out of control.

“I have determined that it is in the foreign policy interest of the United States to defer for 24 months the removal of any Liberian national,” Mr. Obama said.

The civil war in Liberia ended in 2003 and the Liberians temporary protected status ended in 2007. President George W. Bush then deferred enforced departure of the Liberians, and Mr. Obama had extended that deferral through the end of this month.

With the president’s action Friday, eligible Liberians may remain in the U.S. and obtain work through Oct. 1, 2016.

2056,2056,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/22/us-military-starts-bombing-isis-targets-in-syria-w/,Right,"UPDATE: Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby said strikes from the U.S. and Arab partners were trying to hit training facilities and headquarter buildings of the Islamic State in Syria where officials believed the terrorist group was trying to command and control their forces.

“We’re still assessing the effectiveness of these strikes, but we believe we hit what we were aiming at,” he said on MSNBC.

—-

President Obama on Monday night authorized a major escalation of the war against the Islamic State, sending missiles and warplanes on bombing missions for the first time into Syria to strike the terrorist group’s strongholds in that country.

The Pentagon announced that both U.S. and allied pilots, along with missile-firing U.S. ships, launched their first airstrikes inside Syria after a sweeping diplomatic push by the Obama administration had secured dozens of verbal commitments from leaders around the world and in the Middle East to join the fight against the Islamic State.

The missiles and bombs began flying into Islamic State-held areas early Tuesday local time and was expected to last for the next few days, a senior Pentagon official told The Washington Times.

SEE ALSO: White House: Some Islamic State fighters have returned to U.S.

“We will continue to attack Islamic State targets whether they’re in Iraq or in Syria,” the official said.

The barrage also comes on the eve of President Obama’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly and two days of meetings with world leaders at the New York gathering.

Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby noted Monday night that the U.S. was not acting alone, and there were multiple reports of involvement by several Arab nations in about two dozen strikes, concentrated on the insecure Iraqi-Syrian border and on Raqqa, the Islamic State’s de facto capital.

Several news organizations specified involvement in airstrikes by Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, while CNN reported that some Jordanian special operations forces were involved in ground assaults in Syria.

All those nations are conservative Sunni monarchies that could see the Islamic State as undermining their legitimacy despite its being a Sunni group fighting one majority-Shiite regime (Iraq) and one Alawite-dominated government (Syria).

But Adm. Kirby himself said only that “I can confirm that U.S. military and partner nation forces are undertaking military action against [Islamic State] terrorists in Syria using a mix of fighter, bomber and Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles. Given that these operations are ongoing, we are not in a position to provide additional details at this time.”

SEE ALSO: Fears mount that the Islamic State is plotting terror strike in Jordan

Rep. Michael T. McCaul, Texas Republican and chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, praised the assault, saying “in times of war and of peace it is important that we come together as a nation.

“To defeat ISIS, we must cut off the head of the snake, which exists in Syria. I support the administration’s move to conduct airstrikes against ISIS wherever it exists,” he said.

Even before the Pentagon announcement Monday evening, though, senior administration officials were unclear on exactly what role each coalition partner will play.

Turkey’s role

Secretary of State John F. Kerry dodged that question Monday, and questions remain over whether Turkey — which has a more than 750-mile border with Syria and Iraq and has resisted joining the coalition — will join the U.S.-led effort or continue to stay on the sidelines.

Turkish diplomats have paid lip service to the American push for international action against the Islamic State, also known by the acronyms ISIS and ISIL. But with Ankara having secured the release of 49 hostages from the Islamic State under vague circumstances in recent days, analysts cite fears that the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan may have cut a secret deal with the extremists that involves staying out of the U.S.-led coalition.

“There’s a lot of suspicion in Turkish public opinion right now about how the hostage deal was reached,” said Cenk Sidar, the head of Washington-based Sidar Global Advisors, a private analysis firm. “People believe there is some sort of a deal between Erdogan and ISIL.

“It seems there may have been a deal to release the hostages, but we don’t know what assurances have been given to ISIL in return,” Mr. Sidar said in an interview Monday. “Did they agree to something involving the Turkish border? Did they agree not to join the coalition against [the Islamic State]?”

Meanwhile, tensions escalated to new heights Monday along Turkey’s border with Iraq and Syria, where the Islamic State now controls a wide swath of territory.

Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtlumus claimed that some 130,000 Syrian Kurdish refugees — mostly women, children and elderly — have crossed into Turkey in the past four days, fleeing an onslaught by Islamic State militants on their villages and towns.

The situation has heightened tensions between Turkish authorities and Syrian and Iraqi Kurds. The Obama administration has been leaning heavily on Iraqi Kurds to take a lead role in ground-level combat against the Islamic State.

The Erdogan government has cited the surge of refugees as a reason to clamp down on key border crossings with Iraq and Syria. The move prompted clashes Sunday and Monday between Turkish police and angry Kurds stuck along the border. More than 100,000 displaced people from years of war in Syria are already living in camps on the Turkish side of the border.

Oil smuggling

Mr. Kerry in recent days has publicly questioned whether rogue elements inside Turkey are secretly working with Islamic State militants to transport crude oil northward across the Turkish border from Syria and Iraq for sale on the global black market, helping to finance the Islamist movement’s operations.

“There are various channels,” Mr. Kerry said Monday during an interview with MSNBC, adding that a core part of the growing U.S.-led mission is to ensure that oil “can’t move through Turkey or through Syria or out through Lebanon.”

Top Obama administration officials have provided few details on intelligence relating to the suspected Islamic State oil smuggling operation, and intelligence community sources in Washington cautioned against reading too deeply into Mr. Kerry’s remarks.

One U.S. intelligence official told The Times that “the black market in Turkey is playing an important role in giving [the Islamic State] a profitable outlet for the oil it controls,” but challenged the notion that Turkish authorities might have a role in the smuggling operation.

Further, the official said, some Iraqi Kurds may be involved in the smuggling, even as Kurdish forces are involved in fighting Islamic State militants.

“The area in Iraq where ISIL is operating is associated with long-standing oil smuggling networks which have traditionally had a Kurdish component,” the intelligence official said. “So, nobody should be surprised if there were Kurds involved in bringing ISIL-controlled oil to market.”

The official added that there are “constraints on [the Islamic State’s] ability to capitalize on the energy infrastructure it controls as it can’t sell at market prices, lacks technical expertise, and cannot operate facilities — some of which are shut down entirely — at anywhere near full capacity.”

While Mr. Kerry has repeatedly referenced the smuggling problem, he also has stressed that Turkey — long regarded as a key NATO ally and a bridge to the Middle East and Central Asia for the alliance — remains a close diplomatic friend of Washington.

Mr. Kerry said Monday that he “had a long meeting with President Erdogan” last week. He also told a Capitol Hill hearing last week that the Erdogan government’s reluctance to supporting the fight against the Islamic State might be related to the dozens of Turkish citizens held hostage in northern Iraq.

But with the hostage release, Mr. Kerry implied Monday, the Obama administration intends to mount pressure on Turkey to take a more active stand. “The proof will be in the actions,” he told MSNBC. “We’re not going to take anything to the bank on the basis of a verbal interaction.”

Mr. Kerry has spent the past three days in New York City meeting face to face with dozens of diplomatic counterparts on the periphery of the annual United Nations General Assembly gathering. He said Friday that “more than 50 countries have come forward with critical commitments” to the growing coalition.

But there has been little evidence of tangible action. On Friday, Mr. Kerry said dozens of countries had committed “almost $1 billion” to a U.N.-led humanitarian response to the crisis, and specifically cited contributions from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.

He asserted Monday that he and others in the Obama administration are just now “beginning to put together the specific tasks that each nation” will undertake in the growing coalition.

Late last week, French warplanes began pounding Islamic State targets in northern Iraq. On Monday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said his nation will not launch any strikes inside Syria. When pressed for an explanation, he said only that Iraq’s government had requested the strikes.

Syria has not made such requests and warned weeks ago that it would not let foreign countries bomb Islamic State targets with impunity. Unlike even an uncooperative Iraq, Syria has a military capable of at least attempting resistance to outside strikes.

Mr. Kerry met one-on-one with Mr. Fabius on Sunday, but State Department officials declined to provide details about the meeting. One State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity with reporters, said only that “the bulk of the meeting was devoted to working together to build the coalition to counter” the Islamic State. Mr. Kerry met privately with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond on Monday.

Mrs. Pelosi, the highest-ranking woman in American politics, said problems go beyond Ms. Pierson, who was put in charge of the Secret Service after a scandal involving agents who hired prostitutes in Cartagena in 2012. But Mrs. Pelosi said she accepts the analysis of Rep Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, who said he was displeased with Ms. Pierson’s leadership.

“I agree with his analysis,” Mrs. Pelosi said. “I am subscribing to his superior judgment and knowledge on the subject. But I’m also saying that this is more than one person, because there were problems before she went there.”

The Secret Service is reeling from a new scandal after an intruder last month jumped the White House fence and made it into the executive mansion before he was apprehended.

Ms. Pierson told Congress on Tuesday that she takes full responsibility for the security failure, and said they are conducting an internal investigation to see what went wrong. Mrs. Pelosi, however, said the agency needs to face a compulsory external investigation that would be able to impose recommendations on the agency, as a way of cleaning up a troubled culture there.

2080,2080,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/30/after-first-ebola-case-fears-turn-us-pandemic-prep/,Right,"The confirmation Tuesday of the first Ebola case on U.S. soil emerges against a backdrop of increasing concern in America’s medical community that preparedness for a pandemic has stagnated or slipped in recent years because of tough economic times and increasing malaise since the 2001 anthrax threat.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, America’s premier disease fighter, offered an air of confidence Tuesday in declaring that the first Ebola patient in Dallas was carefully contained.

But earlier this year, it sounded less optimistic about the U.S. health care system’s ability to fight a pandemic should a major disease outbreak occur.

“CDC continues to work with reduced financial resources, which similarly affects state, local, and insular public health departments. … These losses make it difficult for state and local health departments to continue to expand their preparedness capabilities, instead forcing them to focus on maintaining their current capabilities,” the CDC warned in a report this year.

CDC flagged several key trend lines, including congressional funding for public health emergency preparedness had shrunk by $1 billion from its highs shortly after the 2001 terrorist and anthrax attacks.

It also noted that state and local public health departments on the front lines of any health emergency have shed 45,700 jobs since the 2008 financial crisis.

PHOTOS: Celebrity deaths in 2014

The concerns, however, extend far beyond financial resources. The Department of Homeland Security inspector general issued a scathing report in September warning the department was woefully prepared for a pandemic, with expired medicines and inadequate resources to effectively equip its top responders in the field.

“DHS may not be able to provide sufficient pandemic preparedness supplies to its employees to continue operations during a pandemic,” the agency’s watchdog declared in a report made public Sept. 1.

“Without sufficiently determining its needs, the department has no assurance it will have an adequate amount of antiviral [drugs] to maintain critical operations during a pandemic,” the report said, warning of the effects for offices such as the Secret Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration.

Despite having the task of protecting the U.S. from dangerous threats, the Homeland Security Department “did not keep accurate records of what it purchased and it received,” the department’s inspector general found.

Homeland Security officials disagreed with much of the report, saying it was a misrepresentation of the agency’s preparedness for an outbreak.

Other preparedness concerns flagged in recent months include the ability of overburdened Border Patrol agents to screen immigrants for disease and inadequate tools to detect or combat a bioterrorist attack.

PHOTOS: Child stars: Then and now

For instance, numerous government investigations have questioned the adequacy of the federal government’s premier biosurveillance system, code named BioWatch. The respected National Academies of Science questioned whether the current-generation system can detect hazards, and the next generation of the project is in danger of being canceled after the Government Accountability Office questioned its dealing with contractors.

“Over the past several years, our work has identified significant shortcomings in the department’s ability to manage an expanding portfolio of major acquisitions,” said the GAO report, dated June 10. “We recommended that before continuing the Gen-3 acquisition, DHS should carry out key acquisition steps, including reevaluating the mission need and systematically analyzing alternatives based on cost-benefit and risk information.”

The message from the panoply of reports is clear: Although the U.S. clearly made strides after 2001 on pandemic preparation, those gains have stagnated and in some cases begun to reverse even as the risks for an outbreak grow with global travel and determined terrorists.

People say that Ebola looks “so far away, it’s so remote,” said Dr. J. Scott Ries, vice president of Christian Medical & Dental Associations, who worked with Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly, who contracted the disease while treating Ebola patients in Liberia. “Well now, anyone who has thought that will change their opinion. It’s here, like we predicted, and it’s time to massively ramp up our efforts to address this.”

To be sure, the CDC says it will contain the incident in Texas, and the Ebola virus will not spread in the U.S. like it has in West African countries because of U.S. isolation methods, first-world medical care, and the fact that friends and relatives don’t intimately prepare bodies for burial as is customary in West Africa.

“There is no doubt in my mind, we will stop it here,” CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a press conference Tuesday. Although Ebola is a “scary disease,” he said, “we are stopping it in its tracks in this country.”

Worrisome, however, is that the infected patient in Texas waited four days after he began experiencing symptoms to seek admission to the Dallas hospital. During that time, he was symptomatic and contagious. Ebola doesn’t spread via airborne methods like the flu does, but only through contact with bodily fluids such as blood, feces, urine and vomit.

The CDC said it was monitoring the people with whom the infected patient came into contact. Ebola starts with a high fever and leads to internal bleeding. In Africa, it has a mortality rate as high as 90 percent.

The West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have experienced the worst outbreak of the disease in history, killing more than 3,000 people there and infecting others. A total of 6,574 cases have been reported, according to the World Health Organization. There is a separate outbreak in Congo.

Dr. Ries said news of a U.S. Ebola case is “no surprise,” but there is also “no need to panic.”

“We know how to deal with Ebola. While Ebola is highly infectious, it’s not highly contagious,” he said, adding that the Dallas patient has been isolated and is being treated aggressively.

“That’s the advantage we have here with our health system versus what they have in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea,” he said.

Nevertheless, U.S. policymakers renewed alarm that the African outbreak had reached American shores.

“Communicable diseases do not stop at borders,” said Rep. Edward R. Royce, California Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. “While the likelihood of a major outbreak in the United States is still very unlikely, with this case, it is more clear than ever that the rapid spread of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone presents a clear and present danger not only to West Africa, but the broader international community.”

Sen. Rob Portman, Ohio Republican, renewed his call for the CDC to direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to enact active screening of travelers demonstrating Ebola symptoms at U.S. ports of entry.

“While I hope that this is an isolated case, today’s announcement serves as a reminder of the need for increased U.S. prevention efforts,” Mr. Portman said in a statement. “According to reports, the patient had recently travelled to West Africa and would have been a clear candidate for active screening. With this announcement, I hope the CDC will consider enacting elevated screening levels.”

Three American medical missionaries other than Dr. Brantly became infected and fell ill in Africa while treating Ebola patients. All were flown back to the U.S. in isolation and have recovered.

“The lessons learned” from treating those workers at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and elsewhere showed that “this is a disease that we can manage with tech,” said Michael G. Schmidt, vice chairman of the microbiology and immunology department at the Medical University of South Carolina.

Credit also goes, he said, to “the convalescent serum and ZMAPP” administered to Ebola patients, and the “unsung heroes” within local health departments, public health agencies and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases “who have been planning for this event since” the Ebola outbreak flared up in March.

A White House statement said President Obama had spoken via phone Tuesday with Dr. Frieden and discussed Ebola isolation protocols and efforts to figure out where the patient may have contracted the virus.

The CDC said the Dallas patient was asymptomatic during his flight from Liberia to Dallas. Although he likely contracted the disease abroad, he was not contagious during air travel or noticeably sick on arrival.

CBP works in conjunction with the CDC to monitor travelers and attempt to contain any diseases that may be spread by travelers from abroad.

However, given CBP’s current resources and other strains at the border given the recent influx of unaccompanied minors, it may not be well-equipped to handle another crisis, the Congressional Research Service warned in a report.

“In the current context of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, CDC has emphasized exit-based airport screening from areas with Ebola, and not screening at [point of entry] in the United States,” wrote Ruth Ellen Wasem, an immigration specialist in a Congressional Research Service report dated Aug. 13.

Ms. Wasem warned that “from an immigration standpoint, an outbreak of an infectious disease places substantial procedural and resource pressures on CBP.”

2083,2083,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/7/lambro-fearing-the-obama-factor/,Right,"OPINION:

Legendary GOP campaign strategist Lee Atwater was guided by a political maxim he called the Napoleonic rule: Never interfere with the enemy when he is in the process of defeating himself.

Atwater, a master political infighter without peer, would be jumping up and down with glee if he had lived to see what is now happening to President Obama and his party leading up to the 2014 midterm elections.

To say the Democrats, led by Mr. Obama’s many blunders, are tearing themselves apart is putting it mildly. Some of his top advisers are blowing the whistle on him. Consider what has happened in just the past few weeks.

Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Obama’s former secretary of defense, has written a tell-all book about his disagreements with the president over disengaging from the war on terrorism. He doesn’t pull any punches.

In a brutally candid history of the internal battles over policy, Mr. Panetta says that Mr. Obama’s eagerness to pull out of Iraq as fast as possible has led to the blitzkrieg rise of the Islamic State’s armies that now threaten the entire region and, very possibly, our own homeland security.

The longtime Democratic Party leader said Mr. Obama “lost his way” by failing to arm the Syrian rebels and enforce his own “red line” threat to respond to Syrian President Bashar Assad’s use of chemical weapons against his own people.

All too often, Mr. Panetta writes, Mr. Obama “avoids the battle, complains, and misses opportunities,” painting a portrait of a president who has a hard time making up his mind.

If anyone still has confidence in Mr. Obama’s ability to deal with the Islamic State and defeat it, Mr. Panetta’s description of the president’s disengaged style puts that to rest. The president has a tendency to fall back “on the logic of a law professor rather than the passion of a leader,” he writes.

Heading into the homestretch of a critical congressional election in which polls show the Republicans are going to pick up a lot of Senate seats, is tough enough. Whoever thought Mr. Obama would help Republicans with a welcome line that plays right into the hands of the GOP’s strategy?

In a speech last week in which he tried to make a case for his anemic economic policies, Mr. Obama said this: “I am not on the ballot this fall . But make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.”

David Axelrod’s jaw must have dropped when he heard that one, but even the president’s ace campaign strategist couldn’t defend him. He made “a mistake,” he told NBC’s “Meet The Press.”

Within 24 hours of Mr. Obama’s blunder, the Republicans were on the air, trumpeting his own self-inflicted quote.

Americans are more than willing to vote on his policies, according to a Gallup poll, which found that one-third of all registered voters surveyed saw their vote as the only way to demonstrate their disapproval of Mr. Obama’s policies.

Only 38 percent of Democrats, however, said their vote would be a message of strong support for the way Mr. Obama has governed. That’s 7 percentage points below what it was when Republicans won control of the House in 2010.

Gallup called their polling results “the Obama factor,” and Democrats fear it more than anything else this year, which is why so many of them are running away from the president and his policies. It is also why Mr. Obama hasn’t been out on the campaign trail with his party’s candidates.

Last week’s jobs number, showing payroll employment had increased by 248,000 in September was ballyhooed by the West Wing, which hoped it would lift the Democrats’ prospects on Nov. 4.

CBS News anchor Scott Pelley dutifully reported the story that the jobless rate had dropped to 5.9 percent, ignoring the ugly details buried in the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) Friday report. For example: 4.5 million Americans were “job losers” or “persons who completed temporary jobs.” The “number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was essentially unchanged at 3.0 million.”

Or the “number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed at 7.1 million.”

These are people who wanted full-time work, or whose hours had been cut back (perhaps because employers sought to avoid higher Obamacare payroll costs), or were unable to find a full-time job.

Even the ultraliberal New York Times felt obligated to report the BLS’ bad news that the nightly network news programs either ignored or underplayed — and to note its political implications.

“For Democrats, there was also a dark underbelly in Friday’s bright news. The employment rate among the constituents they need most on Election Day — women, young people and black voters — did not improve in September,” the newspaper reported.

“The actual percentage of working-age people with jobs — 59 percent — has not changed for four months, a reflection of just how many people have stopped looking for work,” the newspaper added.

This was a pointed reference to one of Mr. Obama’s most painful economic-policy failures and a major reason why the jobless rate has declined: millions of workers who have stopped looking for work because they couldn’t find good, full-time employment and, thus, were no longer counted as unemployed.

The “labor participation rate under the Democrats is the lowest since 1978,” The New York Times said in a lengthy story that ran under the headline “‘Hidden’ Unemployment In Millions.”

“It is indisputable that our economy is stronger today than when I took office,” Mr. Obama insists. That’s not saying much. Twenty-five states have jobless rates in the 6 percent to 8 percent range, and voters, including Mr. Obama’s, are angrier than ever.

Let’s take the president at his word. In four weeks, his job-killing issues will be on the ballot, represented by people who voted for them and want to keep their jobs. That’s when the voters will get their revenge.

Mr. Paul said Senate races in Iowa, Alaska, Arkansas and Louisiana that seem to favor Republican candidates may be too close to call.

“This will be one of those elections were you have to count the votes and stay up late,” Mr. Paul said.

The libertarian-leaning Republican, who is considering a 2016 presidential bid, said President Obama’s decline in popularity would help Republicans at the polls and blasted Mr. Obama’s foreign policy leadership.

Nina Pham, 26, will be taken to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Ms. Pham, who is in good condition and reported she is “doing well,” tested positive last weekend for the deadly virus that has ravaged West Africa, killing more than 4,000.

She had been treating Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national who traveled to Dallas from Liberia and became sick with Ebola. He died last week.

A second nurse, 29-year-old Amber Vinson, tested positive this week. She traveled on a commercial airplane one day before she showed symptoms Tuesday, raising fears the virus could spread beyond the Dallas hospital.

Rep. Chris Van Hollen, Maryland Democrat, said NIH’s director assured him the Bethesda campus is equipped to care for Ms. Pham without risk to the community.

“I’m confident that all necessary steps and precautions will be taken to treat this patient and prevent the further spread of the disease,” he said.

Ron Klain, an attorney who worked for Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, is president of Case Holdings, which handles business interests for former AOL CEO Steve Case, and general counsel at Revolution LLC, a tech-focused venture capital firm in Washington, according to the White House.

He will be the point-person in charge of responding to the deadly virus in the U.S., and will report directly to Homeland Security Adviser Lisa Monaco and National Security Adviser Susan Rice.

Although Mr. Klain does not come from the public health sector, the White House said he possesses “strong management credentials, extensive federal government experience overseeing complex operations and good working relationships with leading members of Congress, as well as senior Obama administration officials, including the president.”

Mr. Obama had said late Thursday it “may make sense for us to have one person” coordinating the government’s response to the Ebola outbreak, after the Liberian national who brought the virus to America’s shores died and two nurses who treated him tested positive in the following days.

The president said administration officials such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Thomas Frieden, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell and Ms. Monaco have other responsibilities and may benefit from having one person in charge of the government’s entire response.

“It may make sense for us to have one person in part just so that after this initial surge of activity we can have a more regular process, just to make sure that we’re crossing all the t’s and dotting all the i’s going forward,” the president said.

The appointment won early praise from Democrats and expert observers.

“I’ve known Ron Klain for over twenty years. He is smart, aggressive, and levelheaded — exactly the qualities we need in a czar to steer our response to Ebola,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer, New York Democrat. “He is an excellent choice.”

Carl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond who tracks judicial appointments, said Mr. Klain’s experience in executive offices and on Capitol Hill should buoy him through this challenge.

“I think he really does know his way around Washington better than a whole lot of people,” he said.

When the president walked over to an electronic voting machine, he had to bend over somewhat to cast his ballot.

“I will say this is made for folks who are a little short,” Mr. Obama said.

“That’s me,” he said. The president also hugged a few other voters, who told them they love him.

The Secret Service K-9s, Hurricane and Jordan, were treated for minor bruises after successfully fending off Dominic Adesanya, who jumped the fence and rushed the building, authorities said.

Mr. Adesanya, 23, fought the dogs, kicking one and throwing and punching the other on the ground. But the Secret Service said both were cleared for duty by the veterinarian, the New York Times reported.

Mr. Adesanya is in the custody of the Marshals Service, facing two counts of assaulting the police dogs, the Times reported. He also reportedly faces four counts of resisting and unlawful entry and one count of making threats.

Law enforcement officials said he had outstanding warrants.

Hurricane and Jordan are part of the Secret Service’s attempt to bolster security at the White House amid recent intrusions onto the property.

2115,2115,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/24/house-lawmakers-grapple-with-ebola-both-home-and-a/,Right,"A House oversight hearing Friday laid bare the sheer complexity of dealing with the global Ebola epidemic, as lawmakers toggled between the desperate plight in West Africa and concern that flawed policies have put Americans’ at risk on their own shores.

Rep. Darrell Issa, California Republican and the chamber’s top investigator, repeatedly questioned the Obama administration’s ability to track the virus and guide local officials through the fight.

A Dallas hospital turned away the Liberian man who first brought Ebola to the U.S. when he presented symptoms, only to admit him days later. He died Oct. 8, and two nurses contracted the virus from him. The second nurse was allowed to fly on a commercial airline.

“We need to know why there have been breakdowns and if our system for responding to such serious crisis is working properly,” Mr. Issa said.

Even as Nina Pham, the first Dallas nurse to contract the virus, was set to be released from special care in Bethesda, Md., reports from New York City spurred new alarm about the ease with which Ebola could crop up in pockets of the country.

Late Thursday, New York City officials confirmed that a 33-year-old doctor, Craig Spencer, had tested positive for Ebola after treating patients in West Africa. Although he was not symptomatic and likely not contagious, the doctor had been out bowling and used public transportation before he was hospitalized.

Dr. Spencer left Guinea on Oct. 14 and traveled through Brussels, Belgium, before arriving at JFK Airport last Friday, New York City officials said.

The oversight committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, tried to shift the focus of Friday’s hearing to the plight abroad. At one point, he played a short video of a West African gravedigger who said he has no specialized skill, but he is a laborer who wants to do his part in the fight against Ebola

“We need to deal with the Ebola virus as its source, in West Africa,” said Rabih Torbay, asking for more health care personnel and financial resources. “This is a global issue, not just a West Africa issue.”

President Obama has dedicated upwards of 3,000 troops to the fight in West Africa.

On Friday, Michael D. Lumpkin, an assistant secretary at the Defense Department, highlighted the disarray in those countries for the committee.

“I traveled to the region thinking we faced a health care crisis with a logistics challenge,” Mr. Lumpkin testified. “In reality, what I found was that we face a logistics crisis focused on a health care challenge.”

Lawmakers worried about the challenge abroad, but repeatedly questioned whether the administration is implementing an on-the-fly approach to the disease at home.

The scramble to retrace Dr. Spencer’s steps in New York presented a moral dilemma for lawmakers scrutinizing U.S. efforts. The young doctor volunteered his time in West Africa, but members wondered whether he should have spent Ebola’s 21-day incubation period in his apartment upon his return.

“I give the doctor tremendous credit for going over there. But I think there should be more restrictions when they come back, because, as we saw in the first few weeks of the CDC, they were wrong in certain areas,” Rep. Peter King, New York Republican, told MSNBC early Friday. “I don’t think we know yet enough about Ebola and how it may be transmitted, for instance, in a region like Africa, as opposed to a confined urban center such as New York, with the subways, with the crowded population.”

The Department of Homeland Security is screening all passengers from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea at major international airports, yet some say the process is useless if travelers do not show symptoms until they are deeply within the U.S.

“I can tell you it’s not working,” Rep. John Mica, Florida Republican, said at the oversight hearing. “All you have to do is look at Craig Spencer.”

2124,2124,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/30/paul-lepage-talks-kaci-hickox-ebola-quarantine-off/,Right,"Maine Gov. Paul LePage said Thursday he is ready to flex his legal powers to rein in a 33-year-old nurse who worked with Ebola patients, after she practically dared the state to seek a court order to quarantine her by enjoying a morning bike ride and refusing a deal that would bar her from public spaces.

The standoff between the Republican governor and Kaci Hickox is shaping up as a test case in the national struggle to balance public health and fear of the deadly Ebola virus against the personal liberties of volunteers returning from the outbreak’s epicenter in West Africa.

Mr. LePage, who is up for re-election on Tuesday, said state attorneys tried to work with the nurse, but negotiations failed.

“As a result of the failed effort to reach an agreement, the governor will exercise the full extent of his authority allowable by law,” Mr. LePage’s office said in a midafternoon statement. “Maine statutes provide robust authority to the state to use legal measures to address threats to public health.”

The Republican governor remains “ready and willing” to “reasonably address the needs of health care workers meeting guidelines to assure the public health is protected,” officials added, but they did not specify what Mr. LePage plans to do.

Ms. Hickox insists she doesn’t pose a threat, as she has no symptoms of Ebola since returning from Sierra Leone and is not considered contagious. She refuses to be cooped up in her house, and has left her home twice in the past 24 hours while police could only watch.

The drama is playing out in a remote corner of the state near the Canadian border, roughly 600 miles from the buzz of New York City, where the positive Ebola test of Dr. Craig Spencer, also recently returned from West Africa, sparked a wave of public concern about the unchecked movement of Ebola workers.

Fears in the Big Apple set off a domino effect of state-mandated quarantine rules, starting with New York and New Jersey before extending to several other states. The virus has killed nearly 5,000 people in countries such as Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and governors said they would not take any chances with public health.

In West Africa, Liberia is making some progress in containing the Ebola outbreak while the crisis in Sierra Leone is going to get worse, the top anti-Ebola officials in the two countries said, according to The Associated Press.

U.S. U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power, just returned from a visit to the region, told reporters in Belgium that the efforts by the United States and other countries to combat the spread of the deadly virus have begun to bear fruit but that “we each have to dig deeper.”

Ms. Hickox fell under New Jersey’s new quarantine mandate when she returned to the U.S. through Newark Liberty International Airport and registered a fever.

She insisted the reading was faulty and that she should not have spent the weekend in a Newark hospital tent. From her confinement she traded public barbs with Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who let her return to Maine on Monday after she had been symptom-free for 24 hours.

Mr. LePage’s office said it outlined new terms in line with the “some risk” category outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this week.

The guidelines would let a returning health care worker leave home to ride a bike or go for a walk, “but would prevent such a person from going into public places or coming within three feet of other people in non-congregate gatherings,” according to the governor’s office.

“Unfortunately, an agreement was not reached,” Mr. LePage’s office said. “The governor remains willing to enter into such an agreement, on a case-by-case basis, with traveling health care workers who meet this definition.”

President Obama traveled to Maine Thursday to campaign for Democrats but had no plans to meet with Ms. Hickox or wade into the fight.

“Ultimately, it’s states and local officials who have the authority for implementing these policies,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.

Mr. Obama has indirectly rebuked state leaders for pushing quarantine rules that go beyond the science of Ebola contagion.

But governors are not backing down — particularly Mr. Christie, who said this week the nation does not need “seven-minute lectures” from the White House and that returning workers who were exposed to the virus must quarantine for 21 days.

“That’s what we’re doing and we’re not changing,” he told reporters. “I don’t care what happens.”

Regardless of the description they use, Republican candidates for governor in some of the Democratic Party’s most dependable strongholds are finding receptive audiences of voters fed up with too many taxes.

Incumbent Democratic governors in Connecticut and Illinois, which rank among the states with the heaviest tax burdens, find themselves trailing or tied in polls against Republican challengers a week before elections.

In Maryland, another deep-blue state with sky-high taxes, Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, a Democrat, had to vow “no new taxes” while struggling to convince voters he deserves a promotion to the governor’s mansion. His Republican opponent, businessman Larry Hogan, has made a top issue of the dizzying proliferation of taxes during Mr. Brown’s eight-year tenure with Gov. Martin O’Malley.

Republican victories in governors races in liberal-leaning Maryland, Connecticut and Illinois would signal a strong anti-tax tide building against Democrats ahead of the 2016 presidential elections.

In TV ads, debates and on the stump, Mr. Hogan has hammered home that the O’Malley-Brown administration has levied 40 consecutive tax increases that he says “crushed the middle class.”

The increases hit income tax, sales tax, gas tax, vehicle registration fees, birth and death certificate fees, alcohol tax and bridge and tunnel tolls — to name a few.

“They’ve never met a tax they didn’t like or at least one they didn’t hike,” Mr. Hogan says in one of his TV spots.

Mr. Brown led Mr. Hogan 49 percent to 42 percent in a Baltimore Sun poll this month. In a state with twice as many registered Democrats as Republicans, the 7-point spread was too close for comfort for Mr. Brown, who did get a bump in a CBS/New York Times poll that gave him a double-digit lead.

Polls show that voters in these solid Democratic states are on the verge of tax revolts at the ballot box.

Connecticut voters are reeling from at least $1.8 billion in tax increases — the largest in state history — under Gov. Dan Malloy, a Democrat. Residents are paying higher income taxes, sales taxes, cigarette and alcohol taxes and a yoga studios tax, while tax exemptions for clothes and footwear that cost less than $50 have been eliminated.

After all that, the state nevertheless faces a $1 billion budget shortfall in 2015.

SEE ALSO: Republican wave coming in 2014 elections: poll

Mr. Malloy trailed Republican Thomas C. Foley 50 percent to 43 percent in a Rasmussen Reports survey this month. It gave Mr. Foley a double-digit advantage over Mr. Malloy on handling taxes, 50 percent to 37 percent, and government spending, 47 percent to 38 percent.

Mr. Foley has called it “the big squeeze” that higher taxes and rising prices exert on residents suffering from stagnant or falling wages. His pledge to lower taxes and freeze state spending is the cornerstone of his campaign.

“They are rejecting the higher taxes,” said Mark McNulty, communications director for the Foley campaign. “Malloy has proven that his solution for everything is to raise taxes.”

A Quinnipiac University poll last week showed the race had tightened to a dead heat.

Mr. Malloy, who beat Mr. Foley by just half a percentage point in the 2010 governor’s race, has promised not to raise taxes again if elected to a second term.

He responded to attacks on his tax policy by slamming Mr. Foley for being a multimillionaire with a 116-foot yacht and his own fighter jets, who managed to owe no federal income taxes in 2011 and 2012.

Mr. Foley released tax return summaries that showed he wrote off business losses those years exceeding his tax debt.

Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat, has to fend off questions about whether he will try to raise taxes again in a lame-duck session if he loses his re-election bid to Republican Bruce Rauner.

Mr. Quinn has said he wants to make permanent a temporary increase in the state income tax to 5 percent. The rate is set to drop to 3.75 percent in January. He argues that it would be offset by a proposed $500-per-homeowner property tax rebate.

The temporary tax increases were passed in a lame-duck session just hours before the next General Assembly was sworn in.

Mr. Rauner, who has a slim lead in polls, has campaigned on a promise to get rid of the Mr. Quinn’s 67 percent income tax increase and 45 percent corporate income tax increase. He called the tax hikes irresponsible.

He also pledged to overhaul the tax code and prevent property tax increases that coincide with falling home values.

The tax increases under Mr. Quinn have topped $27 billion since 2011, according to an analysis by Forbes.

The increases included taxes on cigarettes and tobacco, Internet sales taxes and corporate taxes. One of the most painful was the 66 percent increase in personal income tax from a rate of 3 percent to 5 percent.

“We’ve become the worst state in America,” Mr. Rauner said in a recent debate.

Mr. Rauner led Mr. Quinn 48 percent to 47 percent last week in a Rasmussen Reports poll, well within the 3-point margin of error.

The survey showed Mr. Rauner had the advantage over Mr. Quinn when it came to voters’ trust on key issues of taxes (45 percent to 40 percent) and government spending (46 percent to 40 percent).

Mr. Quinn has shot back by attacking Mr. Rauner for being a billionaire and accusing him of planning to cut his own taxes while reducing spending on public schools.

The governor also has insisted that he doesn’t have “secret plans” to make the income tax increase permanent because his 2015 budget proposal included the higher 5 percent tax rate that he says is necessary to maintain the state’s “good schools.”

“I have the courage to tell people what they need to know,” Mr. Quinn said in a debate.

2134,2134,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/30/babbin-a-better-defense-than-obamas/,Right,"OPINION:

The leaders of our uniformed military — the Joint Chiefs of Staff — have committed an act of common sense that exposes President Obama’s Ebola policy for its comprehensive lack of that commodity. According to a recent report on Fox News, they have called for all troops returning from the Ebola “hot zone” to be quarantined for 21 days.

On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced that returning troops would be quarantined for the length of Ebola’s incubation period and asked the Joint Chiefs to propose a way to do it.

That not only conflicts with Mr. Obama’s refusal to impose any limitation on coming to this country for people who have possibly been exposed to Ebola, but it also conflicts directly with the pressure the president has put on the governors of New York and New Jersey for doing for Ebola-exposed health workers exactly what the Joint Chiefs proposed and Mr. Hagel has now ordered.

By sending troops to the Ebola zone in West Africa, Mr. Obama wrongly decided to put them in harm’s way against an enemy they can’t fight with bullets, rockets and bombs. Ebola is a disease that our best medical experts only begin to understand.

That many of the troops will be exposed to Ebola is certain, and some — despite the training they receive and the protective gear they may wear — are likely to be infected. On their return, the Pentagon faces a clear duty: to protect the rest of our forces from the disease, as well as the families and friends of the troops. The only way to do that is by quarantining those who are exposed and to provide the best treatment medical science can provide if any suffer the disease.

However, that contrasts in obvious and severe ways with the president’s actions. So far, Mr. Obama’s response to the Ebola crisis has been purely political, not substantive. He has refused to stop the flow of people coming in from the Ebola “hot zone” nations, saying that such a travel ban will somehow lessen the flow of aid to those countries. It would do no such thing, but it would be inconvenient for Mr. Obama, owing to his open-borders policy and plans to create some sort of immigration amnesty by executive fiat after the Nov. 4 election.

Events moved quickly, and served mainly to prove how wrong Mr. Obama’s political decisions have been. Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan traveled freely to the United States and apparently lied to the nurses at the Dallas hospital where he went for treatment, telling them he hadn’t been exposed to the disease. Then came the nurses’ infections. One was rushed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Maryland and successfully treated. Another who was suffering a fever called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for advice on whether she could travel and was told she could. She later came down with the disease as well, leaving the government to try to trace her steps to see who else was exposed. (A medical doctor source at NIH told me last week that the people answering those phone calls were not doctors or nurses, just lay people entirely unqualified to give such advice.)

When the CDC protocols for Ebola were first not followed and then shown to be inadequate, public confidence was lost in Dr. Thomas Frieden, the CDC chief. Mr. Obama then appointed Ron Klain as his “Ebola czar,” though Mr. Klain’s only qualification for the position is his longtime experience as a Democratic political operative.

The Joint Chiefs’ plan was only common sense. It forced Mr. Hagel into a corner. He could either go against the president’s political policy or follow the advice of the Joint Chiefs. He made the right decision but now, the Pentagon policy stands in stark opposition to that of the president, who is their boss. The contrast between the two policies forces Mr. Obama into a narrower corner. He can either ignore the Pentagon’s action or he can change his policy and impose limits on travel from the Ebola “hot zone” countries, which he cannot do without admitting his open-borders policy endangers the public.

Mr. Obama could have gone with the quasi-quarantine policies announced by Govs. Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie. Their plans didn’t go nearly far enough to be effective, but they were a start. Mr. Obama could have compromised and endorsed a version of those plans — and tried to explain away the contrast with his open-borders policy — but instead he chose to oppose them and pressure the governors to cancel their plans.

The Pentagon’s plan is another matter. The duty the Joint Chiefs and Mr. Hagel have to protect the troops, as well as their families and communities, is entirely clear. The Joint Chiefs, having won the defense secretary over to their side by standing fast, must surrender that duty without resigning from their posts. This president is too weak politically to withstand such a move, but he may try.

Mr. Obama’s duty to protect the American public from the dangers of Ebola is just as clear and compelling as the Joint Chiefs’ duty to protect the troops. His refusal to perform that duty is yet another major failure that should be in voters’ minds next Tuesday.

Biden Jr. said the White House is “ready to compromise” after the midterm elections but that a Republican victory on Tuesday wouldn’t force the administration to undergo a wholesale overhaul in how it does business.

He appeared to indicate that the onus would be on Republicans regardless of the outcome of the elections on Tuesday.

“I don’t think it would change anything, in terms of what we’re about,” he told CNN. “We know what we have to get done the last two years. Going into 2016, the Republicans have to make a decision whether they’re in control or not in control. Are they gonna begin to allow things to happen? Or are they gonna continue to be obstructionists? And I think they’re gonna choose to get things done.”

He also said he doesn’t see the White House drastically changing the way it does business after the midterms should Republicans take control of the U.S. Senate.

“I think we have to be more direct and clear about exactly what it is we’re looking to do, and look, we’re ready to compromise,” he said. “I think they’re gonna be inclined, because the message from the people — and I’m getting it all over the country — is they’re tired of Washington not being able to do anything.”

For his part, Mr. Biden did predict that Democrats will hold onto their tenuous majority in the Senate — where he could theoretically be called on to break ties if the balance ends up 50-50.

As for 2016, Mr. Biden said he would “absolutely” run for president even if former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton — who has a big advantage in most public polling among would-be Democratic candidates — enters the race, but said he hasn’t made up his mind yet about a possible run.

“There’s plenty of time to make that decision,” he said. “There really is. I mean, look, everybody talks about how, you know, everything is gonna be gone by the summer. And I don’t see that at all.”

WMUR reporter James Pindell asked Mr. Brown, a former Massachusetts senator, what he thinks is going “right” and “wrong” in Sullivan County, which lies on the western border of New Hampshire, Fox News reported Friday.

Mr. Brown responded with a number of economic challenges that faced areas of the state north of Concord.

“Geography plays a role along the southern border. We have more jobs, we have more opportunity, infrastructure, and other opportunities up north are difficult,” Mr. Brown said. “One of the biggest opportunities is tourism. One of the biggest opportunities are ski areas and trails for snowmobiles — I support those efforts.”

Mr. Pindell then interrupted Mr. Brown, reminding him that the question was about Sullivan county. “I think you were talking about the North Country,” he said.

But Mr. Brown responded “I’m talking about any place past Concord, actually, and the challenges of our state.”

Mr. Brown went on to list more economic challenges facing northern counties when Mr. Pindell interrupted him again.

“Sullivan County is west of Concord. It’s not north of Concord, Senator Brown. So what do you see as going well and what’s not going well there,” Mr. Pindell said.

Mr. Brown stuck with his answer, maintaining that “the challenges are the same in every county in our state.”

The state Democratic Party posted a video of the tiff, calling Mr. Brown “clueless” in the description online.

Later that night, Mr. Pindell admitted that Mr. Brown’s geography was indeed correct in a tweet, noting that Mr. Brown was referring to Mt. Sunapee, a ski resort in Sullivan County north of Concord.

Mr. Pindell also apologized on air after the debate.

“I said that Sullivan County was west of Concord, not north of Concord. The truth is, it’s both. So on this point, Scott Brown was right, I was wrong, and I apologize to Scott Brown and to both campaigns,” Mr. Pindell said.

Ted Cruz on Monday blasted net neutrality as “the biggest regulatory threat to the Internet” in reaction to President Obama’s request to the Federal Communications Commission to create new rules of the road.

“In short, net neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet,” the Texas Republican and possible 2016 presidential contender said in a statement distributed by his office. “It puts the government in charge of determining Internet pricing, terms of service, and what types of products and services can be delivered, leading to fewer choices, fewer opportunities and higher prices for consumers. The Internet should not operate at the speed of government.”

Mr. Obama on Monday called on the FCC to create rules governing access to the Internet “ensuring that neither the cable company nor the phone company will be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online.”

The rules include no blocking by a website or service, no intentional slowing down of service by providers, increased transparency, and no paid prioritization on service speed.

Net neutrality rules are intended to provide companies the same speed and access to lines as others and curb undue influence from cable corporations. Proponents say such oversight helps provide a more level playing field for Internet access but opponents see such rules as government overreach in an area, they argue, that has thrived without them.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, announced Thursday that he was expanding the leadership team with the appointments Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who will act as special liaisons to the party’s liberal base and to the Republicans, respectively.

He made the announcement after a four-hour caucus meeting in which he and the rest of the current leadership team were re-elected to the same posts in the new minority.

“We’re going to do things a little differently, just different approach,” said Mr. Reid, who suffered some criticism from members in light of Senate Democrats’ humiliating loses in the elections but nevertheless survived as their leader in the minority.

The rank within leadership and the parameters of the jobs for Mrs. Warren and Mrs. Klobuchar remained unclear.

“Somebody asked me on the way in here: ‘Liz Warren is going to be part of your leadership; what do you expect her to do?’ I expect her to be Elizabeth Warren,” Mr. Reid said.

2166,2166,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/11/us-china-unveil-ambitious-greenhouse-gas-reduction/,Right,"The United States and China unveiled ambitious targets Wednesday to reduce greenhouse gases in an effort by the world’s two biggest carbon dioxide polluters to foster a global agreement on climate change next year.

President Obama said the U.S. would cut its emissions much faster than previously planned, reducing greenhouse gases by anywhere from 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Those are deeper cuts than were planned through 2020, and most of the action would be required after Mr. Obama leaves office in 2017.

In return, Chinese President Xi Jinping didn’t commit to cut emissions by a specific amount. He said China, which is still building coal-burning plants, would set a target of capping its greenhouse gas emissions by around 2030.

Mr. Obama said the U.S. goals are “ambitious,” but said the accelerated pace of cuts will improve public health and boost jobs.

“This is a major milestone in the U.S.-China relationship,” Mr. Obama said. “We have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change.”

He praised China for agreeing to “slow, peak and then reverse” its carbon emissions eventually.

China also is pledging to get about 20 percent of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.

It was unclear how feasible it would be for either country to meet their goals, and Mr. Obama’s pledge was sure to confront tough opposition from ascendant Republicans in Congress.

The new, accelerated targets for the U.S. are sure to raise objections among congressional Republicans. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, has frequently denounced Mr. Obama’s “war on coal” and wants to cut funding to the Environmental Protection Agency.

In a statement after the deal was announced, Mr. McConnell said the new targets agreed to by Mr. Obama are “unrealistic.”

“Our economy can’t take the president’s ideological War on Coal that will increase the squeeze on middle-class families and struggling miners,” Mr. McConnell said. “This unrealistic plan, that the president would dump on his successor, would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs.”

He added, “The president said his policies were on the ballot, and the American people spoke up against them. It’s time for more listening, and less job-destroying red tape. Easing the burden already created by EPA regulations will continue to be a priority for me in the new Congress.”

Environmental groups praised the deal, saying it would create momentum for a global climate-change pact in Paris next year among nearly 200 nations.

“It’s a new day to have the leaders of the U.S. and China stand shoulder-to-shoulder and make significant commitments to curb their country’s emissions,” said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute. “They have both clearly acknowledged the mounting threat of climate change and the urgency of action. It’s heartening to see this level of cooperation.”

It was the first time that China has agreed, at least in principle, to cap its greenhouse gas emissions.

Mr. Obama said his visit to China produced a “remarkable scope” of agreements with Beijing, including a pact to extend visa limits for Chinese citizens, and an understanding to expand an information technology agreement on the export of electronic goods.

Boehner would not say Friday what action he and his colleagues will take to push back against President Obama’s executive immigration moves, but vowed something will happen.

“The House will, in fact, act,” the Ohio Republican said at a brief morning press conference to respond to what he called a break-down in democracy stemming from Mr. Obama’s claims of unilateral powers to halt deportations and grant work permits to as many as 5 million illegal immigrants with family ties or who meet other criteria the president said make them the wrong targets for deportation.

Mr. Boehner’s House colleagues have been struggling with what options they have. Some had hoped to use the annual spending process to defund the president’s action, but on Thursday the Appropriations Committee said that was a fruitless avenue.

Mr. Boehner said he believes Congress should still work on immigration, but said Mr. Obama’s moves signaled he “has chosen to deliberately sabotage any chance of enacting bipartisan reforms.”

The speaker also predicted another surge of illegal immigrants next year, similar to the one involving children and families from Central America this past summer, which took the Homeland Security Department by surprise and sent the administration scrambling to adjust.

Tens of thousands of children and families have been granted at least temporary admittance to the U.S. while they await the outcome of their cases, which could take years.

“Next summer it could be worse,” he said.

2192,2192,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/26/thomas-dibacco-pilgrims-puritans-shaped-420521605/,Right,"OPINION:

Nov. 21, 1620, was a bitterly cold day off Cape Cod — so cold that the sea spray froze on the coats of the ship’s passengers.

But this was minor in comparison with the other problems they had encountered since leaving Europe. For example, their ship, the Mayflower, was a wine carrier that had been poorly converted to passenger use. It was much too small for 102 people in addition to the crew and forced the mingling of individuals who had little in common with one another. Most passengers were hell-bent only on making money in the New World, while a minority, “the Saints,” as they would be derisively called, hoped to build an economically viable religious community unchallenged by English political authorities.

During the 66-day voyage, the Saints, subsequently dubbed Pilgrims, sang hymns, while the other passengers chimed in boos. To be sure, many had signed an agreement aboard the ship setting up a form of government in the new country, but there was squabbling over the details. The one redeeming aspect as the two groups moved ashore with the frozen sea spray on their coats was that the Saints gave thanks for finally reaching their destination dubbed Plymouth — a thanksgiving a year before its formal observance.

What followed in the weeks, months and years to come was an answer to their prayers, namely, that the initial adversity of living, first on ship and then in caves and shoddy wooden shacks, would develop into a religious community fortified by a strong private enterprise economy. The two leaders who accomplished these goals were governors, William Bradford of Plymouth and John Winthrop of the nearby Massachusetts Bay colony, founded in 1630, that eventually subsumed the smaller Plymouth settlement.

Bradford was 31 when he became governor of Plymouth for the first time. As a boy, he proved to be a maverick, deserting his family’s church for a separatist faith. As a man, he believed that idleness was religiously wrong and economically devastating. Because English officials began to persecute his sect, he and other church members fled to the more tolerant Holland, the center of Europe’s textile industry. Although Bradford received a family inheritance when he was 21, he was devoted to working for a living and became a master weaver. But Holland’s worldliness was too tempting for religious dissidents, especially children, and off they moved to America.

As governor, Bradford forged private enterprise principles into a colony bound by religious dogmas. Repudiating a backer’s loan requirement that the settlement own property only communally, he paid off the balance quickly with interest rates as high as 45 percent.

John Winthrop, like Bradford, came from a solid family that also provided him with an ample inheritance. He would study law, become a lawyer and justice of the peace and move to higher legal positions in London. He also became utterly bored. The one excitement in his life was his religious creed that, like Bradford’s separatism, had little in common with the prevailing Anglican mentality. Winthrop’s Puritanism stressed man’s quest for perfection, emphasizing to a lazy and indulgent world that good people could prevail by continual religious devotion and hard work, and build a model “city upon a hill.”

What sustained both Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay was that, thankfully, America could be carved into a better community for all, providing that elusive but mysterious challenge that was missing from the lives of so many in England. Not a single Pilgrim and only a few Puritans opted to return to the Old World. The Pilgrims, who lost half their population in the first year as a result of disease and starvation, said of themselves: “It is not as with other men, whom small things could discourage or small discontents cause to wish themselves home again.”

John Winthrop, like the Pilgrims on Nov. 21, 1620, celebrated his first Thanksgiving in one of his first letters to his wife: “I thank God. I like so well to be here, as I do not repent my coming: and if I were to come again, I would not have altered my course, though I had foreseen all these Afflictions: I have never fared better in my life, never slept better, never had more content of mind.”

2197,2197,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/18/keystone-xl-pipeline-senate-dems-filibuster/,Right,"Senate Democrats filibustered the Keystone XL pipeline on Tuesday, in a vote that reverberated from Louisiana, where a key senator’s career is now likely doomed, to the broader national Democratic Party, where environmentalists have emerged triumphant in a divisive internal battle with labor unions.

The Keystone vote took on symbolism far beyond the small impact on American crude supplies and the slight effect expected on gas prices. Environmentalists drew lines and dared moderate and conservative Democrats to cross it. In the end, most were unwilling to defy the ascendant movement, and it marked a key moment in the climate change debate.

“It’s time to make this turn. And there’s no better moment to make this turn than on this pipeline that would bring the filthiest fuel in the planet into circulation,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat.

The vote fell one shy of the 60 needed to overcome the filibuster, with 14 Democrats joining all 45 Republicans in backing the project.

In the near term, the vote means President Obama gets to avoid a difficult decision on whether to veto the bill. But Senate Republicans said he shouldn’t get too comfortable because they will pass a new version as soon as they take control of the chamber next year.

Based on Tuesday’s vote and Senate balance next year, Republicans should have enough support to overcome a Democratic filibuster but not enough to override a presidential veto.

PHOTOS: See Obama's biggest White House fails

Mr. Obama refused to say whether he would veto this year’s bill, though he sounded skeptical when he spoke to reporters over the weekend. He said Congress should give him leeway to make a decision on his own.

Traditional blue-collar labor unions, though, desperately sought the pipeline’s approval, saying it was a test of whether the Democratic Party could be trusted on jobs.

“The majority of Democrats in the Senate and the White House just don’t get it, even though the recent election results surely should have sunk in by now. They have lost their way, their purpose and their base,” said Laborers’ International Union of North America President Terry O’Sullivan.

State Department officials have been delaying a decision for years, trying to decide whether to approve the final permit that would allow the pipeline to cross the international boundary between Canada and the U.S., bringing crude from the oil deposits in the tar sands of Alberta to refineries in the U.S.

The pipeline is also awaiting action by courts and permitters in Nebraska, where some residents have challenged its proposed path. They say the pipeline would threaten critical natural habitat.

The Senate vote proved to be dramatic, chiefly because it wasn’t clear what the outcome would be.

PHOTOS: Best handguns ever made

Vote counters said over the weekend that Sen. Mary L. Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat who pushed for the vote, was just shy of the support she needed — though she was optimistic.

Her re-election bid is now likely doomed. Ms. Landrieu was already struggling to unify her party and eat into Republican support, and the pipeline, which she set up as a test of her leadership, backfired.

Indeed, the comparison with her Republican opponent, Rep. Bill Cassidy, is striking. Mr. Cassidy was the sponsor of the House version of the Keystone bill, which cleared the lower chamber last week in a bipartisan vote.

Her fellow Democrats did their best to defend Ms. Landrieu during the floor debate, praising her efforts even as they prepared to filibuster her bill and defeat her chief case for re-election.

“Without Mary Landrieu, we would not be having this debate,” said Sen. Barbara Boxer, chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, who led opposition to her fellow Democrat.

An emotional Ms. Landrieu stood in the well and watched as her colleagues voted and likely sealed her fate back home.

Afterward, she told reporters she resented both sides trying to play politics with the issue and said she believed she had forced the issue onto the agenda thanks to her seniority in the Senate.

“There’s no blame. There’s only joy in the fight,” Ms. Landrieu said.

Analysts said the vote was everything from a statement on U.S.-Canada relations to a proxy for where Congress stands on climate change and the future of fossil fuels in the economy. Some also said it hinted at a battle within Senate Democrats’ ranks over whom they wanted to be the next top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and, more broadly, over which wing will control the Democratic Party going forward.

“The totemic nature of it can’t be avoided,” said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist. “It’s essentially a choice between Mary Landrieu and Maria Cantwell, between [Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid and [West Virginia’s Sen.] Joe Manchin, if you want to think of it that way. Between a party that used to be a fairly reliable oil and gas party, the Democrats, and what they want to be in the future — a party in favor of exotic and expensive energy.”

Jane Kleeb, director of Bold Nebraska, one of the major groups opposing the pipeline, said the vote was a challenge to Democrats.

“The Democratic Party must lead on energy in order to not only win elections but to protect our land and water,” she said. “There is no place in the party to keep on the outdated mantra of drilling more. We’ve done that for 100 years, it’s time to diversify our energy base. Sen. Manchin can represent coal jobs and families. He just can’t do that at the expense of others. That type of horse trading has to be over.”

After the vote, a dozen environmental groups issued an ebullient statement saying they had won the fight and expressed optimism that Mr. Obama’s State Department would ultimately reject the pipeline.

“We’re more confident than ever that this pipeline will never be built,” said League of Conservation Voters Senior Vice President Tiernan Sittenfeld.

The bill would have removed Mr. Obama’s final say and officially approved the pipeline under terms submitted to the State Department.

Supporters and opponents could agree on little. Ms. Boxer warned of the danger of environmental catastrophe from spills and said the oil wouldn’t end up in the U.S. but instead would be shipped from refineries on the Gulf of Mexico to foreign ports.

“I call it the Keystone extra lethal pipeline,” she said in front of a poster of a child wearing an oxygen mask.

Keystone defenders predicted the oil would end up in the U.S. and be shipped to ports in states such as Florida. They also said the drills would go no matter what — the question is whether the oil is shipped to the U.S. or China, and if it comes to the U.S., whether it’s shipped by dangerous railway cars or by what they said was the most advanced pipeline ever built.

“The pipeline has taken a role in American politics that is way disproportional to what it is,” said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat whose state has undergone an economic renaissance based on drilling. “It is a pipeline. There are over 2 million miles of pipelines in America today. This is going to be just another one of those, and it’s going to be state of the art.”

Mr. Carter served under both Mr. Hagel and former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.

Other high-profile contenders such as Michele Flournoy and Sen. Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, withdrew from contention.

Mr. Hagel resigned under pressure last week.

David Sedney, who served under Mr. Obama from 2009-2013 as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia, said Mr. Hagel’s replacement “will be in a difficult position.”

“Chuck Hagel appears to be getting pushed out because of criticism the administration has faced over its national security policies and because of the overall weakness of those policies,” Mr. Sedney said.

“These issues that have bedeviled the administration are from decisions made inside the White House, not at the defense or state departments,” he said, adding that such problems will likely dominate defense secretary confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill and can be expected to continue going forward.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest would not confirm reports that the president has selected Mr. Carter, but said he served “very ably” as deputy Defense secretary in the administration and possesses a “detailed understanding” of the Pentagon.

“He is somebody who did serve the president and the American people well,” Mr. Earnest said. He added that the Senate confirmed him for the previous Pentagon post by unanimous consent, saying Mr. Carter “certainly deserves and has demonstrated strong bipartisan support.”

2214,2214,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/5/la-voters-head-polls-saturday-runoff-elections/,Right,"Louisiana voters will head to the polls Saturday to decide on the lone outstanding U.S. Senate contest of 2014 and two outstanding U.S. House races.

In the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy, Ms. Landrieu has been struggling to get help from national Democratic groups after the Nov. 4 “jungle primary” in which neither candidate managed to eclipse 50 percent of the vote.

That sent the race into a Dec. 6 runoff, where polling shows Mr. Cassidy up double digits in a race that will likely give Republicans a 54th seat to pad their majority in the U.S. Senate. The Republican National Committee circulated a collection of news clips Friday morning detailing how national Democratic groups like the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) have largely left Ms. Landrieu to fight on her own in the runoff.

And the Center for Public Integrity reported this week that groups backing Ms. Landrieu have aired less than 100 television ads since Nov. 5, while a handful of conservative groups have aired nearly 6,000, most of which are devoted to attacking Ms. Landrieu.

Ms. Landrieu has survived runoffs before, both in 1996 when she was first elected and in 2002 when she won a second term. But it appears as if the national political environment of 2014 could be too much to overcome.

Louisiana voters will also get to decide on the final two House races of the cycle, apart from a congressional race in Arizona between Democratic Rep. Ron Barber and Republican Martha McSally that’s headed to a recount with Ms. McSally clinging to a narrow lead.

Former Gov. Edwin Edwards, a Democrat who spent nearly a decade in prison on racketeering charges, is facing Republican Garrett Graves in the race to fill the vacancy being left by Mr. Cassidy in the state’s 6th congressional district.

And in the 5th congressional district, Republican Ralph Abraham and Democrat Jamie Mayo are running to replace GOP Rep. Vance McAllister, who failed to advance past the Nov. 4 contest into the runoff. Mr. McAllister had been under fire after being caught on camera last year kissing a staffer.

Fifty-two percent of adults view Mrs. Clinton favorably in a new Bloomberg Politics poll, compared to 42 percent who view her unfavorably.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a possible Democratic rival for Mrs. Clinton if she runs, is at a slightly positive 45 percent/43 percent favorable/unfavorable split.

Thirty-two percent have a favorable view of GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, compared to 29 percent who have an unfavorable view.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is at a slightly positive 36 percent/35 percent split, and former Massachusetts governor and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has a slightly negative 43 percent/44 percent split.

The other potential GOP candidates the poll asked about, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, are viewed slightly negatively. Mr. Bush has a 32 percent/37 percent favorable/unfavorable split, and Mr. Cruz has a 26 percent/29 percent favorable/unfavorable split.

Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Bush, Mr. Christie, and Mr. Romney by 6 points in head-to-head match-ups. She leads Mr. Bush 43 percent to 37 percent, Mr. Christie 42 percent to 36 percent, and Mr. Romney 45 percent to 39 percent.

She leads Mr. Paul by 8 points, 45 percent to 37 percent, and Mr. Cruz by 13 points, 46 percent to 33 percent.

On four candidate qualities people said matter to them in deciding how they vote for president — shares your values, has a vision for the future, is a strong leader and cares about people like you — Mrs. Clinton also outpaced all five Republicans by between 3 and 21 points.

Overall, Mr. Romney was closest to Mrs. Clinton compared to other Republicans on those qualities. Forty-seven percent think she’s better at sharing your values, compared to 44 percent for Mr. Romney. Forty-nine percent think she’s better at being a strong leader, compared to 42 percent for Mr. Romney.

Fifty-one percent think she is better at caring about people like you, compared to 40 percent for Mr. Romney; she also has an 11-point edge on that question over Mr. Bush, Mr. Christie, and Mr. Paul. And 49 percent think she is better at having a vision for the future, compared to 43 percent for Mr. Romney.

Nearly 80 percent of voters say her having lived in Washington and worked in the federal government is more to her advantage than to her disadvantage. More than three-quarters of voters see her having served as Secretary of State for four years as an advantage, and two-thirds see her being married to former President Bill Clinton as an advantage.

About 6 in 10 see her having a run for president before and having served in the Obama administration for four years as an advantage, while 52 percent say her having close ties to Wall Street is more to her advantage, compared to 41 percent who say her having close ties to Wall Street is more to her disadvantage.

The poll of 1,000 U.S. adults was taken between Dec. 3-5 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

House leaders hope those moves will keep Republicans in line behind the spending bill, which makes some dents in programs the GOP wanted to target, but does not cancel President Obama’s temporary deportation amnesty, instead pushing that fight into next year.

“Without a threat of a government shutdown, this sets up a direct challenge to the president’s unilateral actions on immigration when we have new majorities in both chambers of Congress,” House Speaker John A. Boehner told reporters after huddling with his fellow Republicans to try to sort out the strategy.

He is trying to thread a needle of winning enough Republicans and Democrats to get the bill passed over the objections of conservatives who wanted the immigration fight this year.

But House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said there are two provisions she cannot stomach, including one that would alter the rules for treatment of financial derivatives and another that would raise the cap on donations from individuals to political parties.

“These provisions are destructive to middle class families and to the practice of our democracy. We must get them out of the omnibus package,” she said.

And the White House signaled it wasn’t sure it was on board, either. Press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Obama hasn’t decided whether to sign it if it reaches him.

“We’re still reviewing the broader package,” he said.

Those comments are somewhat of a rebuke of Senate Democrats, who negotiated the package with House Republicans and who signed off on the two provisions Mrs. Pelosi objects to, as well as the other provisions reining in the EPA and cutting money from the IRS.

Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the Maryland Democrat who headed negotiations for her party, said the talk were tough, but Democrats managed to keep out of the bill a number of provisions the GOP had sought while keeping funding for many of their favored agencies.

“This bill invests in America’s future by creating jobs today and jobs tomorrow,” she said. “It strengthens our physical infrastructure, building roads and bridges and creating jobs in construction to keep the economy moving. It supports research and discoveries to save lives and spur the development of new products that lead to new jobs.”

Opposition to the final agreement came from both ends of the political spectrum, with conservative activist organizations Club for Growth and Heritage Action announcing they were encouraging members to vote against the bill and would score it as a “key vote” in their influential scorecards of lawmakers’ performance.

But House Republicans were confident they’ll win the Thursday vote.

“Pelosi’s just blowing smoke,” said a GOP aide. “She’ll vote for it. … She’s not about to vote against a bill her party negotiated.”

House Republicans leaders, meanwhile, looked for a strong showing from rank-and-file members in the final vote. They had expected as many as 40 defectors but now aimed to cut that number to about 30, saying they sense growing support for the leadership’s strategy to clear the decks this year and set up a major brawl over Mr. Obama’s immigration moves early next year.

2229,2229,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/14/cheney-cia-interrogation-id-do-it-again-minute/,Right,"Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Sunday that in spite of the backlash from a recent Senate report and innocent men supposedly being imprisoned, he would authorize CIA interrogation tactics again with no hesitation.

“It worked. It’s worked now for 13 years. We’ve avoided another mass-casualty event against the United States,” he said on “Meet the Press.” “I’d do it again in a minute.”

The Senate released a report last week that described interrogation tactics including waterboarding, sleep deprivation, rectal feedings and confinement in a coffin-sized box for more than a week. Many call the actions torture that violate international agreements and put U.S. troops in jeopardy of similar treatment if taken captive.

Mr. Cheney maintained that the administration consulted with lawyers at the time and made sure not to cross that line. He also contemptuously dismissed fears of retaliation, saying that an American captured by the Islamic State is “not likely to be waterboarded; he’s likely to have his head cut off. It’s not a close call.”

Democrats have condemned the actions in the report, but Jose Rodriguez, a former chief of the CIA National Clandestine Service, said some, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, knew about the interrogation techniques as far back as 2002.

“I briefed her on all of the techniques. These people were fully aware of all of the techniques approved by the Department of Justice and legal counsels,” he said on “Fox News Sunday. “She never objected to the techniques at all.”

He said many members of Congress told CIA officials that they were being too careful and needed to do more to protect the country.

The Senate report found that 26 of the 119 men detained by the CIA did not meet the criteria to be imprisoned or interrogated.

But just because someone didn’t meet the criteria to be detained doesn’t mean that person wasn’t a member of a terrorist organization or a threat to Americans, former CIA Director Michael V. Hayden said on ABC’s “This Week” program.

Asked specifically about an innocent man who froze to death in CIA custody, Mr. Cheney said he was more concerned with the men who were released and returned to the battlefield than the minority of innocent men who were harmed.

“I have no problem as long as we achieve our objective, which is to get the guys who caused 9/11 and to protect the United States,” he said.

Karl Rove, who served as a top aide to President George W. Bush, criticized Senate Democrats for not interviewing any top CIA officials to compile their report.

He also said the report contains factual errors, such as a statement that Mr. Bush didn’t know about the interrogation tactics until 2006. Mr. Rove said Mr. Bush approved the tactics long before that.

“They simply didn’t talk to the people. They talked to no one. They simply read documents. It’s like the Queen of Hearts: Judgment first, verdict second,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, Rhode Island Democrat, said committee members didn’t talk with former top officials or directors for the report because they thought those officials were misleading Congress. Instead, the report focuses on lower-level officials who were in the room where actions or conversations took place.

Mr. Cheney said the report is putting national security in jeopardy by making agents worry that “10 years from now, even though the president approved it and Department of Justice approved it, some lawmaker on Capitol Hill is going to come back and want a piece of your fanny.”

Mr. Rodriguez also said the report puts too much blame on CIA employees and that the country will “pay the price” in the future with hesitation to act because of concern about backlash.

“Leaders at the agency are going to wonder whether the authorities they receive from their president will last longer than one election phase. That’s a big concern,” he said. “We want the CIA to be confident their authorities will not be second-guessed when the administration changes.”

Marco Rubio on Wednesday slammed the administration’s agreement with Cuba to open normal diplomatic relations for the first time in more than 50 years,vowing that the incoming Republican majority in the Senate will try to undo the deal with whatever tools they have at their disposal.

Speaking just minutes after Mr. Obama hailed the deal — predicated on the release of political prisoners by both nations — Mr. Rubio, a Cuban-American, said the president has let the people of Cuba down by finalizing a “disgraceful” deal that is a major setback for human rights and freedom for the Cuban people.

Moving forward, the Florida Republican said congressional Republicans may block the nomination of a U.S. ambassador to Cuba and could stand in the way of funding for diplomatic facilities on the island.

“I’m committed to doing everything I can to unravel as many of these changes as I can,” he said. “I intend to use every tool at our disposal in the majority [in the Senate] to unravel as many of these changes as possible.”

On the action itself, Mr. Rubio said normalizing relations with Cuba will only allow Cuban President Raul Castro to shore up his power base and continue oppressing his own people, adding that the president’s belief that the move will help the Cuban people is naive.

“This entire policy shift announced today is based on an illusion, on a lie — the lie and illusion that more commerce, more access to money and goods will translate to political for the Cuban people,” Mr. Rubio, Florida Republican and a potential 2016 presidential candidate, told reporters. “All this is going to do is give the Castro regime, which controls every aspect of Cuban life, the opportunity to manipulate these changes to perpetuate itself in power.”

The deal announced Wednesday comes as the Cuban government released American aid worker Alan Gross, who had been held for five years. In a separate deal, the U.S. and Cuba released political prisoners, including a U.S. intelligence asset who had been held for two decades, officials said.

Mr. Rubio praised the release of Mr. Gross and said he is grateful to have him home.

But the broader agreement, the senator said, is a mistake of huge proportions.

“It is just another concession to a tyranny by the Obama administration rather than a defense of every universal and unalienable right that our country stands for … It will significantly set back the hopes of freedom and democracy for the Cuban people,” he said. “It is disgraceful for a president who claims to treasure human rights and human freedom. This president is the single worst negotiator we have had in the White House in my lifetime.”

2254,2254,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/24/police-officer-in-missouri-shot-killed-man-who-pul/,Right,"BERKELEY, Mo. (AP) — Violent protests broke out in suburban St. Louis after another black 18-year-old was fatally shot by a white police officer.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the officer was questioning the 18-year-old and another man about a theft late Tuesday at a convenience store in Berkeley when the young man pulled a 9mm handgun on him. The officer stumbled backward but fired three shots, one of which struck the victim, Belmar said.

Berkeley is just a few miles from Ferguson, Missouri, where a white police officer fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, on Aug. 9. Brown’s death sparked weeks of sometimes violent demonstrations and a grand jury’s decision to not charge Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting has spurred a nationwide movement to protest police brutality.

Belmar declined to name the 18-year-old killed in Berkeley, but a woman at the scene told reporters she was his mother and identified him as Antonio Martin. Belmar said he was 18 years old and black.

The 34-year-old white police officer, a six-year veteran of the Berkeley Police Department, is on administrative leave pending an investigation, Belmar said.

“He will carry the weight of this for the rest of his life, certainly for the rest of his career,” Belmar said. “So there are no winners here.”

Police released surveillance video from the parking lot outside the store. The nearly two-minute clip shows two young men leaving the store at about the time a police car rolls up. The officer gets out and speaks with them. About a minute-and-a-half later, the video appears to show one of the men raising his arm, though what he is holding is difficult to see because they were several feet from the camera. Belmar said it was a 9mm handgun.

The other man ran away, and police are searching for him.

It was the third fatal shooting of a black suspect by a white police officer in the St. Louis area since Brown was killed. Kajaime Powell, 25, was killed Aug. 9 after approaching St. Louis officers with a knife. Vonderrit Myers Jr., 18, was fatally shot Oct. 8 after allegedly shooting at a St. Louis officer.

Each shooting has been met by protests, and a crowd quickly gathered late Tuesday and early Wednesday in Berkeley. The demonstration involving up to 300 people turned violent.

More than 50 police officers, some in riot gear, responded. Video showed some wrestling with protesters. Belmar said officers used pepper spray but not tear gas. Four people were arrested on charges of assaulting officers.

Belmar said three explosive devices, possibly fireworks, were tossed near gas pumps. Some protesters threw rocks and bricks. One officer was hit by a brick and treated for facial cuts. Another was treated for a leg injury sustained as he tried to get away from one of the explosives.

The protest spilled to a neighboring convenience store where a man in a hoodie set a fire inside the store. The fire was quickly put out, but the glass door was shattered.

Orlando Brown, 36, of nearby St. Charles was among the protesters.

“I understand police officers have a job and have an obligation to go home to their families at the end of the night,” he said. “But do you have to treat every situation with lethal force? … It’s not a racial issue, or black or white. It’s wrong or right.”

Brown said he was pepper-sprayed during the protest and that his friend was arrested for failing to disperse.

Toni Martin, Antonio Martin’s mother, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that her son was with his girlfriend at the time of the shooting. The video did not appear to show a female with the two young men.

Belmar said the 18-year-old had a considerable criminal record in the less than two years since he turned 17, with three assault charges, armed robbery, armed criminal action and unlawful use of a weapon.

The chief said some protesters questioned why the officer couldn’t use pepper spray or a stun gun.

“Frankly, that’s unreasonable,” Belmar said. “When we had somebody pointing a gun at a police officer, there’s not a lot of time.”

Berkeley has body cameras and dashboard cameras. The officer wasn’t wearing his body camera, Belmar said. The dashboard camera activates when the red lights are on, and they were not on at the convenience store.

Belmar said the body of the young man remained on the scene for about two hours. After Brown died in August, the fact that his body remained on the street for more than four hours drew widespread criticism. Belmar said two hours is fairly typical as police gather evidence, and he said interference from protesters may have prolonged the situation in Berkeley."

2280,2280,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/6/john-boehner-re-elected-house-speaker/,Right,"Conservatives’ rebellion against Rep. John A. Boehner fell short Tuesday, as he earned enough votes to win a third term as speaker of the House — though the contentious afternoon vote underscored the continued strain within the GOP.

Mr. Boehner received 216 votes, topping Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who earned 164. But the key contest was within the GOP, where a group of conservatives displeased with Mr. Boehner’s leadership advanced a series of alternatives.

“This is the day the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad,” Mr. Boehner, Ohio Republican, said as he took the gavel from Mrs. Pelosi and vowed to put the economy as the top GOP priority. He said first up will be a bunch of bills that cleared the House in the previous Congress with bipartisan support, but which died for lack of action in the Democratic-held Senate.

Before handing the gavel over to Mr. Boehner, Mrs. Pelosi laid out Democrats’ agenda, saying they will immediately introduce legislation to raise taxes on the wealthy and businesses, as well as try to boost spending on infrastructure. She also said Democrats will focus on voting rights.

“We invite our Republican colleagues to join us,” she said, drawing scattered applause from her Democratic colleagues, who seemed to sense that their agenda has little chance of advancing in the GOP-led Congress.

Rep. Daniel Webster, a Florida Republican, earned 12 votes, which while well short of threatening Mr. Boehner was the largest single challenge to a speaker in years. Rep. Louie Gohmert, Texas Republican, earned three votes of support.

Across the Capitol, meanwhile, the Senate quickly finished swearing in the latest class of senators and proceeding with other ceremonial business, including affirming Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, Utah Republican, as the president pro tempore without any objections.

The House vote was more contentious — though the speakership was never in much doubt, despite conservative pressure groups’ efforts to rally opposition from outside the Capitol.

Mr. Boehner’s 216 votes was slightly less than the 220 he won in the last go-around in 2013, but because of absences, the number of members voting was less, too. So his percentage of support actually increased slightly.

He also won over lawmakers who had opposed him before, such as Rep. Steve Pearce of New Mexico, but lost support of others.

Rep. Jeff Duncan, South Carolina Republican, voted for fellow South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy.

“A fresh start often requires change, and I believe that change should start with the election of a new speaker,” Mr. Duncan said in a Facebook post defending his vote, saying he intended it to send a message of objection to President Obama, who he said has overstepped the limits of presidential power without facing any serious consequences from Congress.

But Rep. Lou Barletta, Pennsylvania Republican, said he would give Mr. Boehner a chance — now that he has a GOP-led Senate to work with — to see what progress he can make.

“I believe he deserves the chance to negotiate with a Senate which, for once, is not an automatic adversary,” Mr. Barletta said in a statement.

The speaker of the House does not have to be elected to Congress, which produced some curious picks on Tuesday.

One Republican voted for Sen. Jeff Sessions, Alabama Republican, while another voted for Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican.

One Democrat voted for former Secretary of State Colin Powell.

2281,2281,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/7/mitch-mcconnell-obama-new-congress/,Right,"Ending gridlock in Washington will require a change of heart by President Obama, the Senate’s new leader said Wednesday in laying out terms for getting things done on Capitol Hill this year, now that Republicans have majorities in both chambers.

Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who was recognized as majority leader Tuesday, said in a commentary piece for CNN that Congress will need to learn to function, which means senators will need to rebuild trust, cast votes and allow each other to offer tricky amendments.

But he laid most of the responsibility at the feet of Mr. Obama, saying it’s the president who will decide whether his troops in Congress cooperate with the GOP or throw up roadblocks.

“It won’t be easy for him. The president’s supporters are pressing for militancy, not compromise. But they need to understand that democracy isn’t about what you can get away with, it’s about what you can achieve together,” Mr. McConnell wrote.

Early signs aren’t encouraging.

The new Congress had barely convened when the White House issued veto promises on two bipartisan bills — one to build the Keystone XL pipeline, and another to change Obamacare’s definition of the work week back from 30 hours to the more traditional 40 hours.

That second veto threat is the more striking, because it signals that despite Mr. Obama’s earlier vow to work with Congress on tweaks to his health care law, the president does not see any changes that are necessary.

Mr. Obama has invited congressional leaders to meet next week.

2290,2290,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/14/house-votes-cancel-obama-amnesties/,Right,"Brushing aside Democrats’ warnings of permanent political doom, House Republicans voted Thursday to cancel President Obama’s deportation amnesties, casting it as an effort to undo a runaway White House untethered either to the Constitution or its own words and promises.

In a debate freighted with political, symbolic and constitutional significance, House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, read 22 quotes from Mr. Obama denying he had powers to act unilaterally to halt deportations. The president claimed the powers last year when he announced an amnesty for more than 4 million illegal immigrants, granting them tentative legal status and work permits to compete legally for jobs.

“We do not take this action lightly, but there is simply no alternative,” Mr. Boehner said from the well of the House. “This is not a dispute between parties, or even branches of government. The president’s overreach is an affront to the rule of law and the Constitution itself.”

Democrats, no less strenuous in their defense of Mr. Obama, accused Republicans of mean-spiritedness with a series of votes to roll back Mr. Obama’s November amnesty and a smaller 2012 amnesty for Dreamers, or young adults brought to the U.S. as children.

“As a country, we’re better than this. Shame on you,” said Rep. Linda T. Sanchez of California, chairwoman of the House Hispanic Caucus.

The vote to cancel the November amnesty was 237-190, with seven Republicans joining Democrats in opposition. The vote to cancel the amnesty for Dreamers was less popular, passing on a 218-209 vote with 26 Republicans joining all Democrats in opposition.

White House officials and immigrant rights advocates feared the votes could send illegal immigrants back into the shadows.

But Cecilia Munoz, Mr. Obama’s domestic policy director, said the White House will make it clear to illegal immigrants that the president won’t be daunted.

“At the end of the day, we are confident we are going to be implementing these executive actions,” she said.

The courts could have a final say, however. Several challenges have been filed, including one in Texas, where 25 states have sued, arguing that they will have to fund billions of dollars worth of services to illegal immigrants if the president’s plans are allowed to stand.

A judge will hold a hearing Thursday on the states’ request for an injunction.

Wednesday’s fight was part of the debate on a bill to fund the Homeland Security Department and its immigration enforcement mission through the end of the fiscal year. That bill cleared the House on a 236-191 vote.

Mr. Obama has vowed to veto the bill because it includes the provisions canceling his amnesties, and Senate Democratic leaders said they will lead a filibuster to prevent the bill from even reaching the president’s desk.

That would leave homeland security funding in limbo, with a Feb. 27 deadline looming, and rank-and-file House Republicans acknowledged Wednesday that they aren’t sure about the next step.

“I don’t know that there is a Plan B,” said Rep. Peter T. King, a New York Republican who voted for the amendment to cancel the November amnesty but against the plan to scrap the Dreamer amnesty. “It’s a work in progress.”

Mr. King said there are six weeks to go before the deadline, which gives all sides a chance to work out an agreement.

House and Senate Republicans will gather Thursday and Friday in Pennsylvania for a policy retreat, where immigration is bound to take up much of the discussion.

Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican who opposed both amnesty amendments, said the effort was a waste because Republicans don’t have the votes to override a presidential veto.

“I wish that wasn’t the case. I wish President Obama was not in the White House. But that’s the reality,” he said.

All sides said Wednesday’s votes were momentous political statements and served as a signal of how much the immigration debate has changed over the past year.

House Republicans entered their annual policy retreat last year with Mr. Boehner announcing principles for tackling immigration, including legalizing the Dreamers and figuring out a solution for the rest of the illegal immigrant population. This year, Mr. Boehner led the charge to cancel the amnesty for Dreamers and to step up enforcement of immigration laws.

Republicans said the moves should be seen as statements on the Constitution and separation of powers, not as attacks on immigrants.

Democrats, though, said Hispanic voters won’t see it that way.

Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who has been a staunch advocate for legalizing illegal immigrants, chided Republicans for backtracking on Mr. Boehner’s stance to legalize Dreamers.

“One year later, you want to take away from 600,000 Dreamers their right to live in this country. What happened? What happened?” Mr. Gutierrez said.

He vowed to make sure Hispanic voters punish Republicans for the votes: “The fruits of your action today will ultimately anger and outrage and [mobilize] the immigrant community throughout this nation.”

Democrats pointed to missives from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the AFL-CIO and Hispanic rights groups who all blasted the amendments. The bishops said deporting illegal immigrants would fracture families, and labor unions said the moves were “anti-immigrant.”

2309,2309,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/19/wesley-pruden-obamas-tax-riot-will-make-a-memorabl/,Right,"OPINION:

The annual State of the Union might not be an occasion for the president to preach to the choir, but it’s an opportunity for the choir to catch 40 winks. Neither the soprano nor tenor will miss anything.

President Obama doesn’t have a choice. The Constitution requires him to “give to Congress information about the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.” The Founders didn’t anticipate Barack Obama. If they had they would have commanded him to move tonight’s State of the Union to Halloween.

The president has been leaking dribs and drabs of this year’s “information” for days, and some of the dribs and drabs would be enough to frighten ghosts and scare goblins out of their sepulchers if anyone took any of it seriously, but no one does.

The tax riot is the president’s scheme to raise $320 billion in new taxes, raising the tax on capital gains, and eliminate tax breaks for children inheriting their parents’ savings. “Is this for real?” asked an incredulous Bob Schieffer of Dan Pfeiffer, a White House aide, on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” Mr. Pfeiffer returned a sheepish smile, as if to say he had not come to town on the turnip truck, but the president is indeed real, and so is his tax riot.

He won’t get his new taxes, but he’ll make his State of the Union speech memorable, no small accomplishment. The speeches are nearly always forgettable, unless there’s someone brave enough in the audience to tell the president “you lie!” as a South Carolina Republican congressman told Mr. Obama in 2009.

Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, after listening to President Obama insert a long diatribe against the court’s Citizens United decision, predicting it would inundate Kansas in a tidal wave and put Mars and Venus on a collision course, was caught on camera mouthing the words: “Not true.” George W. Bush identified Iran, Iraq and North Korea as “the axis of evil” in one of his eight State of the Union speeches. Bill Clinton promised in 2000 that “the era of big government is over,” and Richard Nixon pronounced the Watergate scandal over in 1973. “One year of Watergate is enough.” Enough for him, no doubt. Six months later he resigned to avoid impeachment.

But some presidents have delivered real goods in their State of the Union speeches. James Monroe set down the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, a warning to the European powers that the Western Hemisphere was for the Americas, so stay out. James K. Polk set off the great California Gold Rush in 1848 with the word that “an abundance of gold” had been discovered at Sutter’s Mill “that would scarcely command belief.” There went the neighborhood, and eventually San Francisco would be painted a deep shade of lavender.

The Founders didn’t say the State of the Union message required a speech, but George Washington delivered the first one to a joint session of Congress in 1790. A decade later Thomas Jefferson decided not to deliver the State of the Union in person because it sounded too “monarchical,” like the “Speech from the Throne” in Old Blighty. For a long time afterward presidents put it in the mail.

Woodrow Wilson, still at heart the college president (Princeton), revived the speech in 1913. Except for Jimmy Carter, who sent his written speech to Congress in 1981, presidents have thought that “speaking from the throne” sounded about right. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first president to call his remarks the State of the Union, Calvin Coolidge was the first to make a radio broadcast of it, Harry S. Truman was the first to make the speech on television, and Bubba was the first on the World Wide Web.

Distinctions all, but through the years the speeches have grown from dull to duller, leaving it to the likes of Joe Wilson and Samuel Alito to keep the audience awake. But not always. Abraham Lincoln, unsettled by the midterm congressional campaigns of 1862, used his State of the Union in 1863 to set down a “more moderate, gradual emancipation” than in the Emancipation Proclamation he made only 10 weeks earlier. He was trying to mollify if not satisfy angry Democrats. That woke up everybody.

Politicians of much smaller bore have adopted and adapted the custom, with States of the State, States of the City, and in the nation’s capital even the State of the District. Somewhere a ward boss, probably in Chicago, is preparing his State of the Precinct Address. But nobody does a tax riot like Barack Obama.

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

For all the talk of a deep Republican bench for 2016, a lot of the faces in the early game are the same.

Mitt Romney? Really? He ran and lost in 2012 — badly. Rick Santorum? Mike Huckabee? Rick Perry? They all ran and lost to the guy who won the nomination — and then lost — badly. Sarah Palin? She lost so badly in 2008 she didn’t even make an effort in 2012. The list of has-beens goes on and on.

But there are a few new faces — and thank God, because the 2016 nominee is going to have to be a whole new breed of Republican. After back-to-back shellackings — first against a nearly unknown first-term U.S. senator, then to a highly unpopular president — the party has no choice but to go in a new direction, and that path does not lead back into the wilderness.

The New Breed were on hand Saturday at the Iowa Freedom Summit, the first showcase for those who hope to move into the White House on Jan. 20, 2017. None was more highly anticipated than Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who with his tax-slashing, union-bashing swagger has quickly become the new darling of conservatives.

In a 20-minute, stage-pacing speech, Mr. Walker wowed the heartland crowd. In what was mostly an introduction to voters who’ve never heard of him, the governor opened with his travails during a statewide recall vote, when his family faced threats and one anonymous opponent vowed to “gut my wife like a deer.”

“Since I was elected governor, we’ve cut taxes in Wisconsin, we’ve reduced spending, we balanced the budget, we took the power away from the big-government special interests and we put it firmly in the hands of the hard-working taxpayers. That’s what we need more of in this great country. And you know what, the liberals don’t much like that,” he said to loud applause.

Mr. Walker, who looked less than polished, at one point talking over the applauding audience, told folksy stories about working at McDonald’s as a kid, shopping at Kohl’s. But his bootstrap message resonated with attendees, who heartily cheered when he said: “The measure of success in government is how many people are no longer dependent on the government.”

Another new face on big stage belonged to Ben Carson, who famously spanked President Obama over his health care overhaul during the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast. He, too, sought to introduce himself to voters, referring often to his hard-working mom who took no guff from her rambunctious boys.

The world-famous surgeon also talked God, a big topic in Iowa: “You don’t have to have a PhD to talk to Him, you just have to have faith.” He vowed that as president, he would have a secure southern border within one year, and pledged to reduce the size of government so “they don’t have time to stick their big noses in everybody’s business.” The crowd whooped at that line.

Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, also debuted, and delivered several spectacular lines, none better than this aimed at a certain Democratic former secretary of state: “Like Hillary Clinton, I too have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe. But unlike her, I’ve actually accomplished something.”

She said she felt “a deep disquiet” in the nation and blamed both parties for the growth of government. On that topic, she said: “Politics can no longer tinker on the edges. … The potential of America is being crushed by the weight of government.” And her appearance made for a stark contrast, as Mrs. Palin followed her on the stage, delivering a 35-minute rambling stream-of-consciousness mess of a speech.

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas sought to paint himself as an outsider (he said he’d spent all week in D.C., so “it’s good to be back in America again” … ba da bing). And he strived to win the Most Like Reagan award every one of these forums should feature (“We will together bring back that shining city on the hill that is the United States of America”).

“All candidates will say they’re the most conservative. ‘Gosh darn it, hoodiddly, I’m conservative.’ Well, you know what, talk is cheap,” he said before quoting the Bible. Mr. Cruz clearly knows what plays in Iowa.

And so does the other big star of the confab, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Heckled right out of the gate, Mr. Christie asked: “If I was too blunt, too direct, too loud and too New Jersey for Iowa, why do you people keep inviting me back?” Unlike the other stage pacers, Mr. Christie stood at the podium reading his speech from papers as he acknowledged that he faces an uphill road with conservatives.

But he warned: “If you want a candidate who agrees with you 100 percent of the time, I’ll give you one suggestion — go home and look in the mirror: You are the only person you agree with 100 percent of the time. … If that’s the standard we hold each other to as a party, we will never win another national election — ever,” he said.

And last but not least, another new face was Donald Trump, who really does appear as if he’s serious about running for president. He called Obamacare a “filthy” lie, vowed to fix Social Security and Medicare, but he won the biggest cheers when he talked about who voters shouldn’t pick in 2016.

“It can’t be Mitt because Mitt ran and failed,” The Donald said to loud applause. “And you can’t have Bush,” he said about a summit no-show, Jeb Bush. “The last thing we need is another Bush,” he said, drawing even louder cheers.

Say what you want about The Donald, but he’s a fresh voice in a party that sorely needs a change. No doubt the other newcomers to this presidential race took note of the supportive response he received."

Ms. Lynch will “lead the Justice Department to face these complex challenges,” Mr. Leahy said, and said the confirmation hearing should remain focused on her and not outside issues.

“Her credentials are beyond reproach,” Mr. Leahy said. “She’s fought tirelessly against violent crime and financial fraud…She’s prosecuted those who have committed crimes against police officers, as well as police officers who have committed crimes.”

Despite growing up in the Jim Crow south, “she never lost faith that the way to obtain justice is through our justice system,” Mr. Leahy said.

Chris Christie, on an overseas trip to the United Kingdom, said there needs to be a balance in considering parental concerns over vaccinations as the U.S. deals with a recent spread of measles.

Asked if he would urge Americans to vaccinate their children, Mr. Christie said that “we vaccinate ours, and so, you know that’s the best expression I can give you of my opinion.”

“You know it’s much more important what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official,” he said, according to NBC News. “And that’s what we do. But I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that’s the balance that the government has to decide.”

Asked if he thinks some vaccines are dangerous, Mr. Christie said he didn’t say that.

“I said different disease types can be more lethal so that the concern would be measuring whatever the perceived danger is by vaccine and we’ve had plenty of that over a period of time versus what the risk to public health is and you have to have that balance and that’s exactly what I mean by what I said,” he said.

His office later sent out a clarification on the remarks, saying that Mr. Christie believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is “no question” kids should be vaccinated. At the same time, his office said, different states have different requirements on vaccinations, which is why he called for a balance in which ones should be mandated by the government.

In an interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie, President Obama advised parents to get their kids vaccinated, saying that measles is “preventable” and that the science is “pretty indisputable.”

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

President Obama put on his preaching clothes yesterday and drove up Connecticut Avenue to the Washington Hilton to deliver a sermon to the choir. He took his text from the first chapter of the Book of Moral Equivalence and let the choir have both barrels.

He spoke from the pulpit of the National Prayer Breakfast, organized as an occasion of Christian congressmen six decades ago, and has evolved into an occasion for politicians to come together not so much to pray as to be seen praying. Such prayers are often lectures to heaven, attempts to straighten God out on what’s going on down here.

Mr. Obama has so far been unable to talk very much about Islamic terrorism, or even to say the words “Islamic” and “terrorism” in the same sentence. Perhaps the prayer breakfast was the time and place he had been waiting for, to say what everyone in the world knows is true, that Islam, distorted or not, has been giving the world a royal pain in that certain private place, and should straighten up and fly right into the 21st century.

Alas, no. If he wants an appropriate time and place, he’s still looking for it. His speechwriters gave him the usual things to say about religious freedom, the trite and true about how everybody should have the right to practice his faith however he chooses, to change his faith if he chooses, or to practice no faith at all if that’s what nourishes his soul, and no offense if he thinks he doesn’t have one. (The pronouns here are collective, including both male and female, but the president, who is politically correct to a considerable fault, avoids pronouns except the vertical one.)

He didn’t call out anyone by name, though the place in the world where someone risks keeping his head on his shoulders for changing his religious “faith” is neither Presbyterian nor Buddhist, Hindu nor Hottentot. So where are the places the fatwa is feared, where an imam can casually write a sentence of death for the faithful to carry out? He didn’t say. He probably figured everyone already knows the answer to that one.

How can people of faith, he asks, reconcile “the profound good, the strength, the tenacity, the compassion and love that can flow from all our faiths operate alongside those who seek to hijack religious [faith] for their own murderous ends?”

Humanity, he said, has been grappling with this puzzle throughout history, and just to make sure that everyone knows who he’s talking about, he called out offenders by name.

“Lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ. In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ.”

The president is correct, of course, that many bad things have been done by people who called themselves Christians. But they were not celebrated in the faith for the sin and the outrage, bur roundly rebuked: In the words of the ancient black spiritual, “everybody talkin’ ‘bout heaven ain’t goin’ there.” If Mr. Obama wants to think Jim Crow was a Baptist deacon, he’s entitled, and rebuking the hubris of Christians, to challenge them to dismount from the high horse, is a useful thing to do.

But given the widespread and well-founded suspicion that Mr. Obama is soft on those who, as he says, distort Islam to justify jihad, why did he choose a Christian prayer breakfast to equate the faith of most of his constituents to the barbarism of the cult whose proper name he cannot bring himself to say?

Intolerance is all about us, and confronting it is often difficult, and most Christians agree with the president that God compels the faithful to try. Mr. Obama’s prescription is a useful one, and maybe in a rare fit of introspection he was preaching not only to the choir but to himself.

“First,” he said, “we should start with some basic humility. I believe that the starting point of faith is some doubt — not being so full of yourself and so confident that you are right and that God speaks only to us, and doesn’t speak to others, that somehow we alone are in possession of the truth.”

Strong words, and welcome words. We all need to hear them. But the president’s invoking the Crusades — the last Crusader left Europe for Jerusalem 700 years ago — sounds like something remembered from a radical mosque. He’s preaching tolerance to the wrong congregation.

2340,2340,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/6/wh-cites-climate-change-national-security-plan/,Right,"President Obama’s new national-security strategy ranks combating climate change as a priority alongside more traditional threats such as terrorism, biological emergencies and nuclear weapons in the hands of rogue states.

The White House released an outline Friday of Mr. Obama’s updated national-security strategy, the administration’s first revision in five years. Along with confronting terrorist groups such as the Islamic State and working to reverse automatic budget cuts for national defense, the administration cited climate change as a top priority.

President Obama said the multiple national-security challenges around the globe will require “strategic patience.”

“As powerful as we are and will remain, our resources and influence are not infinite,” Mr. Obama said in a letter to Congress. “We must recognize that a smart national security strategy does not rely solely on military power. Indeed, in the long-term, our efforts to work with other countries to counter the ideology and root causes of violent extremism will be more important than our capacity to remove terrorists from the battlefield. The challenges we face require strategic patience and persistence.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, criticized that view.

“I doubt [the Islamic State], the Iranian mullahs, or [Russian President] Vladmir Putin will be intimidated by President Obama’s strategy of ‘strategic patience,’” Mr. Graham said. ” From their point of view, the more ‘patience’ President Obama practices, the stronger they become. The Obama Doctrine, or “strategic patience,” has led to a world in chaos.”

Mr. Graham added, “We now confront a growing threat from radical Islamists intent on striking the American homeland as well as wreaking havoc on the Middle East, Iranian mullahs intent on obtaining nuclear weapons capability, strengthened dictatorships in Russia and Cuba, and the poorest relationship with Israel in decades. The consequences of Obama’s ‘strategic patience’ are an America that is less secure and at greater risk.”

The president is committed to “confronting the urgent crisis of climate change, including through national emissions reductions, international diplomacy, and our commitment to the Green Climate Fund,” the White House said.

A clean-coal advocacy group immediately blasted the administration’s plan.

“The mere suggestion that climate change is akin to public health crises, dangerous radical groups and a host of other immediate — and legitimate — security threats is absurd,” said Laura Sheehan, an executive at the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. “President Obama’s climate change regulations are, in fact, the real threat to our national security, putting the lives of families at risk, hamstringing our economy and undermining domestic energy production.”

White House National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice said 2015 “is a whole new ballgame” for national security and that Mr. Obama intends to “stake out a much larger role for America in shaping the world.”

“President Obama has two years left in his term, and two years is plenty of time,” Ms. Rice said at the Brookings Institution. “President Obama is going to leave everything on the field. We are committed to seizing the future that lies beyond the crisis of the day.”

Five years ago, Mr. Obama’s strategy called for a cooperative “reset” in relations with Russia. Given the Russian-backed war in Ukraine, Ms. Rice acknowledged that the president now is taking a different approach to Moscow.

“Now we have to deal with the realities we face,” she said. “We will push back and impose costs for Russia’s aggression.”

Vice President Joseph R. Biden, meeting Friday with European Union leaders in Brussels, acknowledged that the U.S. and its allies haven’t stopped Russia’s proxy invasion in eastern Ukraine with the pressure of economic sanctions.

“Ukraine is fighting for their very survival right now,” Mr. Biden said. “This is a moment where the United States and Europe must stand together — stand firm. Russia cannot be allowed to redraw the map of Europe. Because that’s exactly what they are doing.”

Ms. Rice also addressed the U.S. coalition fighting the Islamic State, also known as ISIL and ISIS, saying patience is required.

“Fighting terrorism is a long-term struggle. There will be setbacks,” she said. “ISIL should know that their barbarism only fortifies the world’s collective resolve.”

She said the administration has released about half of the terrorism detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention center, and added, “We mean to keep going until we finish the job.”

The other priorities in the plan are:

• Maintaining a national defense that is “the best trained, equipped, and led force in the world.”

• Ending sequestration budget cuts.

• Reinforcing homeland security “to keep the American people safe from terrorist attacks and natural hazards while strengthening our national resilience.”

• Keeping the pressure on al Qaeda and other terrorist groups while “transitioning to a sustainable global security posture that combines our decisive capabilities with local partners.”

• Pursuing “a world without nuclear weapons and ensuring nuclear materials do not fall into the hands of irresponsible states and violent non-state actors.”

• Developing a global capacity “to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to biological threats” such as Ebola.

Departing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the strategy “makes clear [that] a strong military is the bedrock of our national security.”

“The Department of Defense stands ready to help execute the president’s strategy,” Mr. Hagel said.

Secretary of State John F. Kerry called the plan “a pragmatic, clear-eyed assessment of both the challenges we face and the full arsenal of our power to confront them through moral, diplomatic, economic, development, and military tools.”

“It’s a strategy to promote our values in a world where no ocean, no fence, and no firewall can shield us from the reality of threats across the globe,” Mr. Kerry said.

The City of Brotherly Love beat out Brooklyn, New York and Columbus, Ohio to host the event, to be held the week of July 25. The DNC signed the final contract with Philadelphia Thursday morning.

“There is clearly no better city to have this special event than Philadelphia. The role of Philadelphia in shaping our nation’s history is unmatched,” said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Florida Democrat and chairwoman of the DNC.

Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell said the convention is expected to cost $84 million, and expressed confidence they could raise the funds.

In choosing Philadelphia, Democrats bypassed holding their convention in the perennial swing state of Ohio, or New York, where former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumptive front-runner for the Democratic nomination, could house her campaign.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio had promoted Brooklyn as an ideal spot, but his recent high-profile clashes with the city’s police department could have served as a point of tension as Democrats try to unify and rally behind their candidate. Ms. Wasserman Schultz, though, said the decision was based solely on logistics, security, and resources.

Columbus Mayor Marcus B. Coleman said the city would try to land a political convention in 2020.

Democrats last month announced the timing of their convention, which will be held the week after Republicans hold their in Cleveland.

Republicans and Democrats held their conventions in back-to-back weeks in 2012, but the GOP held theirs in Tampa the last week of August and Democrats held theirs in Charlotte the first week of September. In 2008, Democrats held their convention the last week of August in Denver and Republicans held theirs the first week of September in Minneapolis.

The announcement has not yet been made public but sources with direct knowledge of the matter told local news station KOIN 6 that Mr. Kitzhaber met with administration officials Friday morning to make his plans known.

Reports surfaced earlier this week that Ms. Hayes had accepted nearly $200,000 in payments from green nonprofits to work on controversial low-carbon fuel standard policies at the same time that the administration was promoting new legislation on the issue.

Mr. Kitzhaber’s resignation will take effect 10 a.m. Wednesday. Oregon Secretary of State Kate Brown is expected to assume the office and become the nation’s first openly bisexual governor.

“What should be a day of celebration for is turning into a day of reflection and mourning,” Oregon Senate Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli said Friday morning while addressing a gathering of the Oregon Wheat Grower League outside the capitol, The Oregonian reported.

Mr. Ferrioli told the crowd this morning that he would not attend Ms. Brown’s swearing in but instead planned to return home “to grieve for the departure in disgrace of one governor and to hope for the healing that can only come if the next governor turns away from policies that put symbolic gestures ahead of the real needs of our citizens,” The Oregonian reported.

2371,2371,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/15/drone-on-faa-sets-rules-for-unmanned-aircraft/,Right,"The Obama administration on Sunday released a long-awaited set of guidelines to govern drones in American skies, setting the stage for widespread use of unmanned aircraft in a variety of industries.

The Federal Aviation Administration proposal, which is in draft form and will be open to public comment for the next 60 days, applies to drones weighing less than 55 pounds and being used for non-recreational purposes, such as commercial use by private companies.

Under the proposed rules, drone operators must be at least 17 years old, must pass an aeronautical knowledge test and get an operator certificate from the FAA.

Operators also will be required to maintain visual line of sight of their craft at all times. As is the case with recreational craft such as model airplanes, drones also must not fly over populated areas, cannot exceed an altitude of 500 feet or a speed of 100 mph, and must stay out of restricted airspace such as airports, the agency said.

“We have tried to be flexible in writing these rules,” FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a statement. “We want to maintain today’s outstanding level of aviation safety without placing an undue regulatory burden on an emerging industry.”

In 2012, Congress directed the FAA to integrate drones — also known as unmanned aerial systems (UAS) — into the national airspace by September. Even with Sunday’s proposal, the agency remains behind schedule.

Still, the proposed rules begin to offer a degree of clarity that had been missing.

Current law prohibits using drones for commercial purposes, limiting use of the unmanned craft to government operations and for research purposes. But the FAA also has begun to issue waivers for commercial drone use, allowing a select number of filmmakers, news organizations, oil-and-gas companies and others to use the craft.

The FAA’s method of picking and choosing who gets to use drones had come under fire from industry leaders who urged the agency to release broader rules as soon as possible.

Those industry leaders say Sunday’s move in a key step in the right direction.

““This proposed rule is a critical milestone in the UAS integration process, and one that is long overdue. UAS technology has largely remained grounded while many prospective users wait for the regulatory framework to catch up,” said Brian Wynne, president and CEO of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, the drone industry’s largest trade group.

“This is a good first step in an evolutionary process that brings us closer to realizing the many societal and economic benefits of UAS technology,” he added.

The full proposal is available here.

2375,2375,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/18/obama-picks-joe-clancy-secret-service-director/,Right,"President Obama on Wednesday tapped the acting director of the Secret Service, Joseph Clancy, to lead the embattled agency on a permanent basis, ignoring calls for an outsider to take over.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the president decided that Mr. Clancy “has demonstrated that he was willing to conduct a candid, clear-eyed assessment of the shortcoming of that agency and to look at needed reforms and implement them.”

“That precisely is why he has been promoted to this permanent role,” Mr. Earnest said.

Mr. Clancy was appointed on an interim basis last October after then-Director Julia Pierson was forced out of the agency due to embarrassing security breaches, including one in which a fence-jumper ran all the way into the White House through an unlocked front door. Those episodes came on the heels of an incident in 2012 in which agents performing advance work for the president’s trip to Colombia were caught with prostitutes in their hotel rooms.

While serving as interim director, Mr. Clancy had already embarked on a shake-up of the agency’s top officials, reassigning at least four others to posts elsewhere in government. He is a former agent-in-charge of the president’s personal protection detail as well.

An independent review panel concluded earlier this year that agency was too “insular” and “starving for leadership,” and recommended an outsider for the agency’s next director.

SEE ALSO: FLASHBACK: Secret Service needs outside leadership to drive culture change, review finds

“Only a director from outside the service, removed from organizational traditions and personal relationships, will be able to do the honest top-to-bottom reassessment this will require,” the panel’s report said.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said he and Mr. Obama considered several candidates, “including those who had never been with the Secret Service.”

“Ultimately, Joe Clancy struck the right balance of familiarity with the Secret Service and its missions, respect from within the workforce, and a demonstrated determination to make hard choices and foster needed change,” Mr. Johnson said. “I am confident Joe will continue this management approach.”

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman, called the choice of Mr. Clancy “disappointing.”

“The [review] panel made it crystal clear that only a director from outside the agency would meet the needs of the agency today — someone with a fresh perspective, free from allegiances and without ties to what has consistently been described as a ‘good old boys network,’” Mr. Chaffetz said. “The good men and women of the Secret Service are screaming for a fresh start. At this moment in time, the Secret Service would best be served by a transformative and dynamic leader from outside the agency.”

The panel’s ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, said Mr. Clancy has already demonstrated “decisive leadership.”

“I look forward to working with him closely over the next year to ensure that the Secret Service gets what it needs to fulfill its critical mission,” Mr. Cummings said.

Mr. Clancy, a 27-year veteran of the agency, also served in the protective detail for President Bill Clinton. He left the Secret Service in 2011 to become the head of corporate security at Comcast, then returned when Mr. Obama summoned him.

“It’s sad to see when somebody who’s attained a certain level of public stature — and even admiration — tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. “The truth is, I don’t take any joy or vindication or satisfaction from that. I feel sorry for Rudy Giuliani.”

Mr. Giuliani has defended his remarks after saying at a Republican fundraiser this week that he does “not believe that the president loves America.”

“[Obama] doesn’t love you. And he doesn’t love me,” Mr. Giuliani said. “He wasn’t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.”

Mr. Earnest said Mr. Obama’s love of the United States is well documented.

“Many of you have been in the room when the president’s delivered speeches when he’s talked about his love for this country, or how the United States is a force for good in the world, in fact it’s the greatest force for good that the world has ever seen,” he told reporters.

Mr. Earnest didn’t address the former mayor’s additional remark that his criticism of the president should not be considered racist because Mr. Obama was raised by “a white mother.”

“Some people thought it was racist — I thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother, a white grandfather, went to white schools, and most of this he learned from white people,” Mr. Giuliani told the New York Times. “This isn’t racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism.”

2402,2402,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/3/bill-schuette-a-prescription-for-health-care-after/,Right,"OPINION:

On Wednesday, the nine justices of the United States Supreme Court will consider the case of King v. Burwell, concerning the constitutionality of Obamacare, determining the limits of President Obama’s executive power and the ability of the president to rewrite laws on his own while ignoring the constitutional duties of the legislative branch of government.

The court’s ruling would also impact the health care subsidies some citizens receive in Michigan and in 37 other states.

Before the Supreme Court issues an opinion, responsible state and federal leaders should construct a new health care model. A fresh approach to overhaul and remedy inequalities in America’s health care system is overdue. The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, has been an empty suit and did not live up to the president’s promises. Many Americans could not keep their health care plan, paid huge increases to stay on a plan, or could not keep their doctor.

Here is a prescription for health care options after Burwell:

First Principles: Any overhaul of health care should be patient-focused, consumer-driven and should favor the free market over a single-payer system or government-run bureaucracy. To paraphrase a popular ad, when companies compete, the consumer wins.

Eighteen-month “safe harbor” hold-harmless period: The potential Supreme Court ruling, concerning bedrock provisions of the U.S. Constitution and excessive use of presidential power, could cause stress for many individuals and families who may not be able to purchase insurance without the subsidies. A “safe harbor” provision for a 12- to 18-month period to help people who might lose subsidies would provide sufficient time for the president and Congress, as well as state legislatures, to enact a much-improved health care system that provides insurance to many who are uninsured, deals with pre-existing conditions, expands coverage and also lowers costs.

“You choose” option — opt-in, opt-out: Give Americans choice, the opportunity to choose their preferred health care plan. If you prefer Obamacare, then opt-in and keep it. But also guarantee Americans the freedom to purchase other health care options, separate from Obamacare. Former Sen. Phil Gramm refers to this as the “freedom option” and he is right. Choice is as American as apple pie, and the federal government ought not to be dictating what health insurance plan Americans cannot buy.

End Obamacare mandates and regulations: One example should suffice: repeal the medical device tax. Importantly, this is not just a Republican proposal. It enjoys broad, bipartisan support, including support from Democratic Sens. Al Franken, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.

End tax inequality: It is time to end a health care tax inequality that favors employer-provided health insurance while taxing millions who desire to buy insurance on the individual market. Continue to protect the tax treatment of job providers that offer health plans to their workers, and then extend tax credits to those who buy insurance on their own. The credits should be annual, age-adjusted and class-blind, available for a variety of health coverage options to make it easier for the uninsured to afford coverage.

Encourage the use of Health Savings Accounts: By providing access to Health Savings Accounts, consumers would have greater incentives to control costs and would be able to shop for the best health insurance plan that meets their needs. This can be encouraged through the use of one-time tax credits to get consumers started.

Allow interstate health plan purchases: End “lockout” provisions, which prevent consumers from purchasing health care insurance no matter where they live. Americans should be free to purchase health insurance anywhere in the nation. Portability of health care will increase competition and lower costs.

States make better decisions: The individual states should have broad opportunity to offer a diversity of health care insurance options to their citizens, including free-market options of premium subsidies, Health Savings Accounts and direct primary care options, as well as high-deductible plans coupled with other options. Medicaid recipients should be allowed to participate in any private market health plan.

Establish high-risk pools: Federally subsidized, state-managed high-risk pools should be used to cover the costs for those with high-cost health care needs.

Require insurers to cover adult children. Maintain the reform enabling adult children to retain coverage under the health insurance plan of their parents up to age 27.

Insure pre-existing conditions: No individuals should have his insurance canceled because of a pre-existing condition. All consumers should be given a transition period in which to purchase coverage so that no one is excluded because of his health history.

Some Washington elites are predicting gloom and doom should a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court justices rule against the Obama administration in King v. Burwell. In fact, just the opposite is true. The court case provides policymakers with a moment in time to offer real reforms that expand choice and competition, put the patient first and greatly improve options for health care coverage.

The Affordable Care Act violated the very first principle of medicine: Do no harm. This prescription is better for our health care system, and most importantly, for consumers. As with any prescription, if not administered immediately, the ailment only gets worse.

2404,2404,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/3/doj-us-report-finds-racial-bias-ferguson-police/,Right,"The Justice Department will conclude that there is a “pattern of police bias and excessive force” at the Ferguson, Missouri, police department, but is unlikely to directly charge former Officer Darren Wilson in the death of teenager Michael Brown, reported news agencies who were briefed on the report Tuesday.

The full report is expected to be released this week, possibly as soon as Wednesday. The DOJ has been investigating Ferguson law enforcement agencies following the August death of Mr. Brown during an altercation with Officer Wilson. After a grand jury decided not to press charges against Mr. Wilson, many civil rights advocates had turned their hopes to the DOJ’s investigation instead.

The Justice Department appeared to brief reporters from the Washington Post, New York Times, Associated Press and CNN on Tuesday before the report is officially released.

According to a law enforcement official who spoke on a condition of anonymity, the DOJ’s report will say that Ferguson police have disproportionately used force against black citizens and violated their constitutional rights.

Those violations include making arrests without a probably cause; charging black citizens with petty crimes, usually in an attempt to generate revenue from fines; and pulling over black citizens for traffic stops without suspicion of wrongdoing.

DOJ investigators conducted hundreds of interviews and reviewed more than 35,000 pages of documents and Ferguson police department records.

The Washington Post reported that while blacks make up 67 percent of Ferguson’s population, they have been disproportionately targeted by the police, accounting for 93 percent of all arrests between 2012 and 2014, as well as 90 percent of all citations issued and 85 percent of all people stopped by police.

The review by federal officials also seems to have uncovered disparaging comments officers made about President Barack Obama. A November 2008 e-mail questioned whether Mr. Obama could be president because “what black man holds a steady job for four years.”

Attorney General Eric Holder had promised last week that the results of the DOJ’s investigation would be released before he stepped down.

2412,2412,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/7/obama-selmas-50th-anniversary-americas-racial-past/,Right,"Commemorating the 50th anniversary of the bloody civil-rights march in Selma, Alabama, President Obama said Saturday that America’s history of racial conflict “still casts its long shadow” and he called on Congress to strengthen voting-rights laws for minorities.

Speaking to a crowd of about 40,000 at the Edmund Pettus bridge where marchers were attacked by state troopers in 1965, Mr. Obama said it’s a “common mistake” for Americans to believe that “racism is banished.” He pointed to this week’s Justice Department report that found widespread patterns of racial bias in the Ferguson, Missouri, police department.

“We just need to open our eyes, and ears, and hearts, to know that this nation’s racial history still casts its long shadow upon us,” Mr. Obama said. “Citizens in Ferguson and New York and Cleveland just want the same thing young people here marched for 50 years ago — the protection of the law.”

About 10 minutes into Mr. Obama’s speech, a group of protestors carrying signs such as “stop the violence” began to bang a drum and chant “we want change,” drowning out his remarks for part of the crowd. The chanting drew angry reactions from some in the audience until police moved the protesters away.

Mr. Obama drew a connection between the events of 50 years ago and his current efforts to reform the criminal justice system.

“Together, we can address unfair sentencing, and overcrowded prisons, and the stunted circumstances that rob too many boys of the chance to become men, and rob the nation of too many men who could be good dads, and good workers, and good neighbors,” he said.

The president also praised the marchers of long ago, including Rep. John Lewis, Georgia Democrat, for serving as catalysts of change for the better.

“The change these men and women wrought is visible here today in the presence of African-Americans who run boardrooms, who sit on the bench, who serve in elected office from small towns to big cities; from the Congressional Black Caucus all the way to the Oval Office,” Mr. Obama said. “Because of what they did, the doors of opportunity swung open not just for black folks, but for every American. What they did here will reverberate through the ages.”

Thousands gathered in Selma to mark the anniversary of the march, a landmark event of the civil rights movement that led to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. First lady Michelle Obama, former President George W. Bush and about 100 members of Congress also attended the event.

Speaker John Boehner, Ohio Republican, didn’t attend but issued a statement on the anniversary.

“Today, 50 years after the Selma to Montgomery marches began, the House honors the brave foot soldiers who risked their lives to secure the blessings of liberty for all Americans,” Mr. Boehner said.

Mr. Obama said the clash on the bridge was “a contest to determine the true meaning of America.”

“In one afternoon fifty years ago, so much of our turbulent history – the stain of slavery and anguish of civil war; the yoke of segregation and tyranny of Jim Crow; the death of four little girls in Birmingham, and the dream of a Baptist preacher – all that history met on this bridge,” Mr. Obama said.

The president used the occasion to criticize voter ID laws in many Republican-controlled states, and the Supreme Court decision in 2013 to strike down a key section of the Voting Rights Act. The ruling allowed nine mostly southern states to change their election laws without advance federal approval.

“Fifty years after Selma, there are laws across this country designed to make it harder for people to vote,” Mr. Obama said. “As we speak, more of such laws are being proposed. Meanwhile, the Voting Rights Act, the culmination of so much blood and sweat and tears, the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence, stands weakened, its future subject to political rancor. How can that be?”

Noting that the Voting Rights Act has traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support, the president added, “One hundred members of Congress have come here today to honor people who were willing to die for the right to protect it. If we want to honor this day, let these hundred go back to Washington, and gather four hundred more, and together, pledge to make it their mission to restore the law this year.”

Mr. Obama also chastised voter apathy, saying too many citizens today are taking for granted the sacrifices of the civil-rights marchers of a half-century ago.

“What is our excuse today for not voting?” he asked. “How do we so casually discard the right for which so many fought?”

Although he was not a foot soldier in the civil-rights movement, the president said that he benefited from its achievements. And Mr. Obama inserted his own 2008 campaign slogan into the historical mix of popular phrases that have signified revolutionary changes.

“The single most powerful word in our democracy is the word ‘We,’” Mr. Obama said. “We The People. We Shall Overcome. Yes We Can. Fifty years from Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet finished. But we are getting closer.”

On the flight to Selma on Air Force One, Mr. Obama signed a law granting the congressional Gold Medal to the thousands of “foot soldiers” who participated in Bloody Sunday, Turnaround Tuesday, or the final Selma-to-Montgomery Voting Rights March during March 1965.

The flap comes just a week after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress at the invitation of House Republicans and warned against striking a deal with Iran. Mr. Obama refused a meeting with Mr. Netanyahu, and the White House condemned the speech, deepening already clear battle lines between the White House and congressional Republicans over foreign policy.

But that battle reached new heights Monday. Congressional Democrats said their GOP counterparts issued a “hard slap” to the face of the administration by communicating directly with Tehran, while Iranian leaders accused Republicans of standing in the way of peace.

Mr. Obama said the Republicans now effectively have aligned themselves with Iranian leaders in trying to pour cold water on a potentially fruitful diplomatic endeavor.

“I think it’s somewhat ironic to see some members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hard-liners in Iran. It’s an unusual coalition,” Mr. Obama said just before a closed-door meeting with European Council President Donald Tusk. “I think what we’re going to focus on right now is actually seeing whether we can get a deal or not. And once we do — if we do — then we’ll be able to make the case to the American people, and I’m confident we’ll be able to implement it.”

Negotiations between Iran and the so-called P5+1 — the U.S., Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain — are scheduled to resume next week in Switzerland, with just under four months until a June 30 deadline, although that deadline already had been pushed back multiple times.

The coalition hopes to halt Iran’s uranium-enrichment program for at least the next decade. In exchange, the U.S. and its partners gradually would begin to lighten economic sanctions against Tehran, though Congress would have to sign off on lifting many of the stiffest sanctions.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell emphasized that point Sunday on “Face the Nation” on CBS, saying that while it’s obvious “the president doesn’t want us involved in this … he’s going to need us if he’s going to lift any of the existing sanctions. … He cannot work around Congress forever.”

Nevertheless, the administration has repeatedly maintained it can strike a deal with Iran without congressional approval, and has given no indication it will seek a vote on Capitol Hill.

Amid the uncertainty and admissions by the administration that Iran can’t fully be trusted, Mr. Obama has maintained that the chances of an agreement are 50-50 at best. They now say those chances could be reduced as a result of Monday’s letter, which was a showing of near-unity among the Senate GOP in opposition to the president’s approach to Tehran.

“We will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei,” the senators wrote in the open letter. “The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time.”

Reaction to the letter, from the White House, Tehran and among Capitol Hill Democrats, was fierce.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Republicans are undermining the president’s efforts for a diplomatic agreement and, in essence, trying to set the stage for yet another war in the Middle East.

“The president is trying to explore this diplomatic option with Iran, alongside our international partners, because it is in the best interest of the United States,” he told reporters. “The rush to war — or, at least, the rush to the military option that many Republicans are advocating — is not at all in the best interest of the United States.”

Meanwhile, the Iranian regime lumped congressional Republicans in with Mr. Netanyahu, painting them all as war-hungry politicians set on derailing the “peace” process at any cost.

“In our view, this letter has no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy,” Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said in a report from Iran’s state news service. “It is very interesting that while negotiations are still in progress, and while no agreement has been reached, some political pressure groups are so afraid even of the prospect of an agreement that they resort to unconventional methods, unprecedented in diplomatic history. This indicates that, like Netanyahu, who considers peace as an existential threat, some are opposed to any agreement, regardless of its content.”

Mr. Zarif went on to say that Iran believes the next U.S. administration would be bound by any potential agreement, a misunderstanding that Mr. Cotton said the letter was in part intended to address.

“Many Iran experts say that Iran’s leaders don’t understand our Constitution, so they need to understand that under our Constitution, Congress plays a very important role of improving international agreements, and any deal that is not approved by the Congress won’t be accepted by the Congress — now or in the future,” Mr. Cotton said Monday on “Fox and Friends.”

White House officials argued Monday that major diplomatic agreements typically aren’t cast aside as soon as a new president comes to power, though they did not deny that the deal could be abandoned as soon as January 2017.

On Capitol Hill — where there’s been bipartisan support for slapping new economic sanctions on Iran even as nuclear negotiations continue — top Democrats condemned the letter.

“This letter is a hard slap not only in the face of the United States but in the face of our allies,” Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said on the Senate floor. “Let’s be very clear: Republicans are undermining our commander in chief while empowering the Ayatollahs.”

Mr. Reid also said that while he had disagreed with President George W. Bush on the Iraq War, he never stooped to writing a letter to undermine the commander in chief’s policy.

However, Mr. Reid was accused of potentially traitorous remarks and undermining troop morale when, in a 2007 speech, he declared “this war is lost.” The Bush White House called those comments “disturbing.”

Rand Paul of Kentucky, and likely 2016 presidential candidate, joined Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand to end the federal ban on medical marijuana, now legalized in 23 states.

The three senators issued a statement saying the bill would “allow patients, doctors and businesses in states that have already passed medical-marijuana laws to participate in those programs without fear of federal prosecution,” Time reported.

Mr. Paul has spoken out about marijuana users in the past saying they should not be placed in jail, Reuters said.

He also said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and a likely opponent for the 2016 Republican nomination, showed hypocrisy for his opposition to medical marijuana in Florida, yet admitted to using pot in college.

Mr. Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio, Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Ted Cruz, all mentioned as possible 2016 presidential hopefuls, have said they believe states have the right to make their own marijuana laws.

Roughly 46 percent of Americans support legalizing marijuana, although most Republicans oppose legalization, a Reuters/Ipsos poll said.

Chris Christie looks to find his footing in the 2016 GOP presidential field, his supporters have launched a super PAC that can raise unlimited amounts of money to boost a possible bid and Mr. Christie’s leadership PAC is bringing on three veterans of President George W. Bush’s re-election campaign.

The America Leads committee was registered on Feb. 23, according to a filing with the federal election commission.

“He’s provided effective, conservative leadership in a deep blue state, bringing people together to solve difficult problems and get results,” said the group’s executive director, Phil Cox, according to the AP. “That’s the kind of leadership we need in America today, and we hope he decides to run.”

Mr. Cox was executive director of the Republican Governors Association when Mr. Christie served as chairman.

Mr. Christie is currently sixth in Real Clear Politics’ latest average of public polling on the possible 2016 GOP field, and a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 57 percent of Republican voters said they would not consider voting for him for president.

At last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference, Mr. Christie dismissed his critics and said there’s a long way to go.

“Is the election next week?” he said. “If I decide to run for president, I’m not worried about what polls say 21 months before we’re going to elect the president of the United States.”

The Wall Street Journal also reported Thursday that Mr. Christie’s Leadership Matters for America committee, which has stricter fundraising limits, is bringing on a trio of advisers who have experience on President George W. Bush’s re-election campaign: Brian Jones, Cary Evans, and Kevin Shuvalov.

2429,2429,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/16/ted-cruz-in-2017-gop-president-will-sign-legislati/,Right,"As the administration touted new health insurance enrollment numbers on Monday, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas predicted a Republican president would undo the entirety of President Obama’s signature domestic achievement upon taking office in 2017.

“I believe in January of 2017 a new Republican is going to enter the White House and in 2017 is going to sign legislation repealing every word of Obamacare,” Mr. Cruz said, speaking at the “Politics and Eggs” event in Manchester, N.H.

Mr. Cruz, who is considering a presidential bid of his own, tweaked “graybeards” in Washington and people who predicted the fall 2013 battle over the law, spearheaded by Mr. Cruz and other conservatives in Congress, that led to a partial shutdown of the federal government would guarantee Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid would keep his job as majority leader in the U.S. Senate.

“If that had happened, there’d be a lot of voices on TV going, ‘I told you so. We told you so. That numbskull Cruz persisted in fighting against Obamacare and look what happened,’ ” he said. “Well, the old rule: What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”

He said in 2014, Republicans won an “epic, historic, tidal wave” election and said Obamacare was the No. 1 issue.

“And it’s interesting — it doesn’t seem to have occurred to anyone in Washington that energizing and mobilizing millions of people across this country, elevating debate about the disasters — all of the people who’ve lost their jobs, lost their health care, lost their [doctor] because of Obamacare may have played some part in an historic tidal wave that changes control in Washington based on the exact issue that energized and mobilized those millions of people,” he said.

The Obama administration, meanwhile, said Monday that a net 16.4 million people have gained coverage since the law’s major provisions took hold, driving the uninsured rate from 20.3 percent to 13.2 percent between October 2013 and March 4.

But Mr. Cruz said the law was “biggest job killer in the country” and that when you go to “the Upper East side of Manhattan,” Obamacare isn’t a big issue — but it is a big issue “with people who are struggling.”

Speaking in the early presidential state, Mr. Cruz also pitched a broader message of what he called “opportunity conservatism.”

“That means that I believe we should look at every single domestic policy with a laser focus on opportunity,” he said. “How does it help those at the bottom climb the economic ladder?”

He said he’s convinced that the “single biggest lie in all of politics” is that the GOP is the “party of the rich.”

“Here’s the truth of the matter: The rich do just fine with big government,” he said. “Big business does great with big government. Big business inevitably has armies of lobbyists and lawyers and accountants. Big business gets in bed with government.”

“The people who get hammered by big government are the little guys — it’s the small businesses, it’s the mom and pop,” he said. “The top 1 percent — the millionaires and billionaires that the president loves to demagogue — today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.”

He said those on the left, often with good and well-meaning instincts, look at someone on the economic ladder and want to “physically grab them” to move them up — but that doesn’t work, and policy should be focused on empowering people to take ownership of their own future.

He relayed stories from his own parents, such as his father, a Cuban immigrant, working his way from a dishwasher to a cook on up, and said that “every other step on the economic ladder depends on getting on that first rung” and then being able to pull yourself up.

To spur economic growth, Mr. Cruz also called for tax reform, the abolition of the IRS and a “simple flat tax,” praising the efforts on tax reform of former President Ronald Reagan and former Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill, who represented neighboring Massachusetts in the House.

He also called for regulatory reform, saying smaller community banks and institutions are getting hammered by federal regulations.

2430,2430,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/21/obama-congress-endangers-national-security-loretta/,Right,"President Obama is accusing Congress of playing politics with law enforcement and national security by holding hostage attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch in exchange for leverage on legislation.

Mr. Obama blasted Republicans for preventing the female federal prosecutor from New York from succeeding Attorney General Eric Holder during his weekly address to the country to Sunday.

But lawmakers have delayed the nomination of Ms. Lynch by more than 130 days over concerns surrounding Mr. Obama’s executive action on immigration, which would provide temporary legal status to millions of illegal immigrants and reprieve from deportation. Now Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, wants to waylay that nomination over a bill known as the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. The bill contains language that would prohibit the use of restitution funds for abortions.

Mr. Obama tapped Ms. Lynch to replace Mr. Holder in November and has this month become more vocal about the roadblocks that Republicans have set up for his nominee. Republicans have the majority in both the House and the Senate.

“No one can claim she’s unqualified,” he said during his weekly address. “No one’s saying she can’t do the job. Senators from both parties say they support her. This is purely about politics. First, Republicans held up her nomination because they were upset about the actions I took to make our broken immigration system smarter and fairer. Now they’re denying her a vote until they can figure out how to pass a bill on a completely unrelated issue.”

This is the third time in less than a week that the White House has lashed out Republicans for stalling a yes-or-no vote for Loretta Lynch.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest during a March 16 press briefing described the delay of Ms. Lynch’s yes-or-no vote on the Senate floor as “an unconscionable delay.”

“There is not a single legitimate question that has been raised about her aptitude for this job,” he said. “Instead, all we’ve seen is a bunch of political obstruction from Republicans that, again, does not speak well of Republicans’ efforts to run the Senate in an effective fashion and certainly not in a way that’s in the best interest of the country.”

Mr. Obama repeated that point during an interview with Huffington Post, saying that it was wrong for Congress to hold the attorney general nominee hostage “for other issues.”

“Republicans promised that Congress would function smoothly with them in charge,” Mr. Obama said during his weekend address. “Here’s a small chance for them to prove it.”

Opposition leader Isaac Herzog’s center-left coalition holds a small but clear lead as Israelis head to the polls Tuesday. If he wins and is able to form a government, Mr. Herzog is expected to present a very different face to the world than the far better known Benjamin Netanyahu has over the past six years.

Unlike Mr. Netanyahu, who made last-minute pre-election headlines Monday by declaring that he no longer supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Herzog has long supported the idea of Palestinian statehood and has pledged during his campaign to push anew for peace talks if he is elected.

He also has said he would freeze construction on most Israeli settlements in the West Bank and go into high gear to breathe new life into Israel’s relationship with the U.S. — not just with Republicans, but with the Obama administration as well.

Mr. Herzog, 54, is known as a shrewd lawyer and able domestic politician. He has served in Israel’s Knesset for the past decade. He also has strong political bloodlines as the son of Chaim Herzog, who served as Israel’s sixth president from 1983 until 1993.

Beyond such broad-stroke facts, the world had paid almost no attention to the Labor Party head prior to last week, when it suddenly became clear that he has a good chance of becoming Israel’s next prime minister.

SEE ALSO: Benjamin Netanyahu promises no Palestinian state if he is re-elected

By the time voting booths opened Tuesday, Mr. Herzog was picking up big-name endorsements — including from such key moderates as Mr. Netanyahu’s former Defense Minister Ehud Barak.

The Zionist Union coalition that Mr. Herzog’s left-leaning Labor Party formed with former Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni’s centrist HaTnuah party was carrying a four-seat lead in the polls over Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud Party.

No one disputes that the rules of Israel’s Knesset leave open the possibility of a last-minute Netanyahu turnaround. Likud could negate the pre-election polls, which predict Mr. Herzog’s party will win 26 seats to Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud Party’s 21 or 22. Mr. Netanyahu could use postelection maneuvering to fashion a majority coalition of right-wing parties. However it unfolds, the battle over who can cobble together a majority government — and ultimately become prime minister — is likely to come down to the wire.

As the prospect of a Herzog win loomed larger Monday, Ms. Livni suddenly announced that she was prepared to cede the premiership entirely to Mr. Herzog if it boosts his chance of forming a majority that can trump anything Mr. Netanyahu pulls together on the right.

Her announcement seemed to push Mr. Herzog further into the spotlight, raising the stakes for change in the Israeli government, especially on the issue of relations with the Palestinians.

Surprising choice

Mr. Herzog raised eyebrows in January when he announced that Amos Yadlin would be his first choice for defense minister.

The former Israeli military intelligence chief and 30-year Israeli air force veteran is no doubt qualified, but his approach to the Palestinian issue differs starkly from Mr. Netanyahu’s.

The Netanyahu government promoted a continual expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, but Mr. Yadlin said Israel should be taking proactive steps to withdraw from the West Bank regardless of the state of peace negotiations with the Palestinians.

That position has angered many on the Israeli right, and Mr. Netanyahu appeared eager to exploit that anger during last-ditch appeals for support from his base ahead of Tuesday’s vote.

Mr. Herzog, meanwhile, has consistently criticized Mr. Netanyahu for damaging Israel’s standing in the world by taking an abrasive posture toward the nation’s allies, specifically Washington.

He leveled a particularly bitter assault at Mr. Netanyahu during an interview with Israel’s Channel 2 News in June, asserting that the prime minister’s attitude toward Mr. Obama was hostile and damaging to Israel.

An account of the interview by The Times of Israel said Mr. Herzog slammed Mr. Netanyahu for failing to listen to the international community, failing to present peace proposals of his own for an accord with the Palestinians and failing to work properly with Mr. Obama.

Mr. Herzog, however, does not always disagree with Mr. Netanyahu and is not an all-out dove on national security matters.

At the height of weeks of battle last summer between Hamas and Israel, Mr. Herzog supported the Netanyahu government’s decision to conduct airstrikes and ground raids on Hamas targets in Gaza.

The campaign drew criticism from some on the Israeli left, but Mr. Herzog told the BBC at the time that “if you want to make peace, you have to be ready for war.”

He also appears to be in agreement with Mr. Netanyahu’s positions on Iran. There “is no daylight” between the two on the issue, Mr. Herzog wrote in a New York Times op-ed last month.

Where there is disagreement, he wrote, is in the way Mr. Netanyahu has conducted himself on the issue diplomatically. It was “a major mistake,” Mr. Herzog wrote, for the prime minister to have agreed to address Congress on Iran at the invitation of Republican leaders without consulting first with the Democratic U.S. president.

He suggested that it was dangerous for Israel to create “the false impression that our interests are allied with only one American party or interest group.”

“We should be reaching out to all Americans — Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, hawks and doves,” Mr. Herzog wrote.

2437,2437,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/19/wh-unmoved-netanyahus-comments-palestinian-state/,Right,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu backed away Thursday from his declaration that he wouldn’t support a Palestinian state, but furious Obama administration officials said they weren’t accepting his explanation.

Two days after winning reelection, Mr. Netanyahu hewed to long-standing U.S. policy toward a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during an interview on American television.

“I don’t want a one-state solution. I want a sustainable, peaceful two-state solution,” Mr. Netanyahu said on MSNBC. “I have not changed my policy.”

Amid the escalating tensions, President Obama spoke by telephone Thursday with Mr. Netanyahu to congratulate him on his reelection and reaffirm U.S. support for a two-state solution. The White House said the two leaders agreed to consult closely on “the difficult path forward to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”

“The president reaffirmed the United States’ long-standing commitment to a two-state solution that results in a secure Israel alongside a sovereign and viable Palestine,” the White House said.

Earlier Thursday, however, administration officials said they weren’t buying Mr. Netanyahu’s comments that he still supports a two-state solution. The White House focused on his statement before Election Day that creating a Palestinian state would be “giving attack grounds to … radical Islam against the State of Israel.” He said a Palestinian state would not be created as long as he was prime minister.

While many in Israel viewed Mr. Netanyahu’s comments before and after the election as standard political rhetoric, White House officials said his words would have serious consequences. For example, administration officials said they would now consider supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for the creation of a Palestinian state generally along the pre-1967 lines that divided Israel from the West Bank and Gaza.

“It means that our policy decisions need to be reconsidered. And that’s what we will do,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. “It has, in the mind of the president and other senior members of his team, created a need for the United States to reevaluate our approach.”

He mentioned the United Nations several times as a forum where the U.S. has consistently supported Israel.

“The United States has repeatedly intervened … at the U.N. and in other places by saying … the best way for us to solve this problem is to get the two parties to sit down at the negotiating table, resolve their differences so that this two-state solution can be realized,” Mr. Earnest said. “But now the prime minister of Israel says earlier this week, days before an election, that this is a principle that he no longer subscribes to and that his nation no longer subscribes to.”

During their phone call, Mr. Obama “emphasized the importance the United States places on our close military, intelligence and security cooperation with Israel, which reflects the deep and abiding partnership between both countries,” the White House said.

They also discussed Iran, with Mr. Obama reiterating that the U.S. is focused on reaching “a comprehensive deal with Iran that prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and verifiably assures the international community of the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program.” Two weeks ago, Mr. Netanyahu told Congress in a speech not to accept a nuclear deal with Iran that would allow Tehran to keep working to build a nuclear weapon.

Mr. Earnest said Mr. Netanyahu’s pre-campaign comments were “cynical, divisive, election-day tactics” to curry favor with hard-line voters in Israel.

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said Thursday that, in light of Mr. Netanyahu’s earlier comment opposing a Palestinian state, he would renew his push for full U.N. recognition.

“If these things are true, it means that the Israeli government has no serious intentions to reach a peace agreement that will create two states based on the 1967 borders,” Mr. Abbas said during a Palestine Liberation Organization meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah. “We therefore will not retreat from our position to apply international law, and so it is our right to go anywhere in the world to realize our rights according to international law.”

“It would be transformative if everybody voted,” Mr. Obama said during a town-hall event in Cleveland. “That would counteract [campaign] money more than anything. If everybody voted, then it would completely change the political map in this country.”

Mr. Obama raised the subject during a discussion of curbing the influence of campaign donations in U.S. elections. The president said he had never discussed the idea publicly before, but said Australia and some other countries have compulsory voting.

The president didn’t commit to pushing a mandatory voting initiative at the federal level but said, “that may end up being a better strategy in the short term” than finding a solution to curbing campaign donations.

Australia is one of 11 nations worldwide with mandatory voting. Australians who fail to vote can be fined, or even jailed for repeatedly not casting a ballot.

The president repeated his frequent complaint that Democrats tend to stay home in midterm elections. Last November, Republicans regained control of the Senate and added seats to their majority in the House despite Mr. Obama’s massive fundraising efforts for his party.

“The people who tend not to vote are young, they’re lower income, they’re skewed more heavily towards immigrant groups and minority groups,” Mr. Obama said. “And they’re the folks who are scratching and climbing to get into the middle class and they’re working hard. There’s a reason why some folks try to keep them away from the polls. We should want to get them into the polls.”

General election voter turnout for the 2014 midterms was 36.4 percent, the lowest in any election cycle since World War II, according to the United States Election Project.

In the presidential election year of 2012, about 58.2 percent of eligible voters went to the polls. Mr. Obama defeated Republican Mitt Romney, 51.1 percent to 47.2 percent — a margin of about 5 million votes.

But in House races nationwide last November, about 5 million more Republican voters cast ballots than Democratic voters.

The president, who raised $1.1 billion for his re-election, said the “blitzkrieg” of campaign spending is “bad for our democracy.”

“I speak as somebody who has raised a lot of money,” Mr. Obama said. “I’m very good at it. It just degrades our democracy generally.”

SEE ALSO: Obama hits GOP for ‘trickle-down’ budget plan

Referring to the Supreme Court’s “Citizens United” ruling that resulted in increased campaign spending by third-party advocacy groups, the president said it would be difficult to change the law with a Constitutional amendment.

“We have to think about what are other creative ways to reduce the influence of money,” he said. “There are other ways for us to think creatively, and we’ve got to have a better debate about how we make our democracy better and encourage more participation.”

Mr. Obama also said the process of gerrymandering is harmful to democracy.

“I don’t think the insiders should draw the lines and decide who their voters are,” he said. “Democrats and Republicans do this, and it’s great for incumbents. It pushes parties away from compromise.”

2449,2449,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/12/ryan-pick-gives-romney-camp-a-jolt-of-energy/,Right,"Newly minted vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan hit the stump this weekend with a level of energy that seemed to boost Mitt Romney’s entire campaign, giving the presumptive nominee a much-needed change in the narrative while adding another high-profile fundraiser and campaigner to deploy across the country.

It got off to an inauspicious start, though.

When Mr. Ryan was first introduced Saturday in Norfolk, Va., walking down the gangplank of the USS Wisconsin with the theme of the movie “Air Force One” playing in the background, Mr. Romney got a little ahead of himself, introducing Mr. Ryan as “the next president of the United States.”

Mr. Romney quickly corrected the slip-up, saying he had been known to make mistakes, “but I didn’t make one with this guy.”

Mr. Ryan showed a clear ability to connect with voters and infuse Mr. Romney’s campaign with, quite literally, a dash of youthful energy. At 42, Mr. Ryan is the same age as Mr. Romney’s eldest son, Tagg.

The two men campaigned together through Virginia, North Carolina and Wisconsin, with Mr. Ryan introducing himself to the nation, showing an easy comfort when greeting supporters and firing up crowds by attacking President Obama’s policies and talking up his man at the top of the GOP ticket.

He accused Mr. Obama’s campaign of going from a 2008 run based on “hope and change” to one of “attack and blame.”

“We’re not going to fall for it,” Mr. Ryan told a cheering crowd in High Point, N.C.

And while Mr. Romney was pilloried earlier in the campaign for casually mentioning that he had a few friends who were NASCAR team owners, Mr. Ryan appeared thrilled just to meet one of the NASCAR drivers on Sunday.

“This is awesome,” he told a crowd of 10,000-plus at the Absolute Style furniture company in High Point after exchanging high-fives with some people on the way to the event. “I just had a great experience, and that is — I got to meet Darrell Waltrip. That was pretty cool.”

The mood also got to Mr. Romney, whose public persona can come across as a bit staid or “square,” but who was clearly energized by his running mate and the responses from overflow crowds at the weekend rallies.

“I am so happy! I am so happy to have my teammate now,” he told cheering supporters in Mooresville, N.C., on Sunday.

When the crowd interrupted Mr. Romney’s prepared remarks with chants of “U-S-A, U-S-A,” the former Massachusetts governor went off his script to join in and pump his fist in the air as Mr. Ryan did the same.

With Mr. Ryan’s selection — which came earlier in the season than either of the selections in 2008 — the Republican ticket now has a second weapon to raise funds and to deploy as a major surrogate, the way the Obama campaign has used Vice President Joseph R. Biden.

“We’re going to split up, more often than not, and double our efforts,” Mr. Ryan said in a joint interview with Mr. Romney on Sunday’s “60 Minutes.” “It was one against two for a while — now it’s two against two. We’re going to redouble our efforts, and we’re going to bring a message to the country: ‘Here’s how you get the country back on track.’ ”

After the weekend with Mr. Romney, Mr. Ryan will campaign solo at the Iowa State Fair on Monday, getting a chance to test his Midwest appeal when he takes a turn at the fair’s soapbox, according to Iowa press reports.

Next weekend, Mr. Ryan will campaign in Florida, home to a large population of seniors — the kinds of voters Democrats say could be put off by the House Budget Committee chairman’s plans to alter Medicare. Mr. Romney, however, said any changes wouldn’t affect current seniors or those close to retiring.

“What Paul Ryan and I have talked about is saving Medicare, is providing people greater choice in Medicare, making sure it’s there for current seniors,” he said in the interview.

“No changes, by the way, for current seniors, or those nearing retirement. But looking for young people down the road and saying, ‘We’re going to give you a bigger choice.’ In America, the nature of this country has been giving people more freedom, more choices. That’s how we make Medicare work down the road,” he said.

The Romney campaign is already grappling with how to square Mr. Ryan’s extensive voting record and his budget plans with Mr. Romney’s own stances, with campaign aides stressing to reporters that Mr. Romney is the top of the ticket.

Mr. Ryan also marched in tune with Mr. Romney on the matter of tax returns, saying on “60 Minutes” that he had turned over “several” years of tax returns to the Romney campaign as part of the vetting process, but that he would publicly release two — the same number Mr. Romney has.

The former Massachusetts governor has received pressure to release more. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, has gone as far as accusing Mr. Romney, publicly and without proof, of going 10 years without paying any taxes.

“What I hear from people around this country — they’re not asking, ‘Where are the tax returns?’ ” Mr. Ryan said. “They’re asking where the jobs are; where’s the economic growth? Those are the issues that matter.”

Earlier in the weekend jaunt, Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan again appeared to feed off one another in a marginally successful effort to purchase pies at Homemades by Suzanne, a shop in Ashland, Va., which another vice-presidential candidate — Sarah Palin — also visited on the campaign trail in 2008.

Mr. Romney walked to the counter and asked what kind of pies they had. Blueberry? Rhubarb? No.

Mr. Romney glanced at the press corps as he was waiting for his apple, pecan and chocolate pies, urging a woman working behind the counter, “C’mon, push through there.”

Mr. Ryan instantly piled on — with an odd combination of nerdiness, politeness, and feigned outrage.

“Are they messing with their pie-making business here?” he said. “You guys are getting in the way of commerce.”

The two already have somewhat of a culinary history: They ate hamburgers together when they campaigned earlier this year. Mr. Ryan was also in on an April Fools’ Day joke when he introduced Mr. Romney (rather than vice versa) as “the next president of the United States” to a practically empty room.

On the other hand, Crenshaw Gymnasium at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland was so packed that the two actually hosted an impromptu rally afterward before an estimated 500 to 800 people who could not make it in but were still desperate to catch a glimpse of the 2012 GOP ticket.

Standing on two wooden crates, the two men were practically doppelgangers in matching outfits of white shirts, gray pants and no ties.

Mr. Romney had taken off the blue-and-white patterned tie he was wearing earlier at the bakery.

2454,2454,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/27/hillary-clinton-wiped-email-server-clean-refuses-t/,Right,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has refused to turn her email server over to an independent third party and claims she has wiped the server clean, dealing a setback to the special investigative committee looking into the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack, the probe said late Friday.

Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy said the whole House will have to decide what the next steps are in the push to pry information from Mrs. Clinton, but said she will likely have to appear and testify on her decision-making about her emails, setting up another dramatic showdown between the former first lady and her congressional critics.

“Not only was the secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record, she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest,” Mr. Gowdy said in a statement excoriating Mrs. Clinton’s actions.

Mr. Gowdy said Mrs. Clinton’s response to his subpoena was to re-transmit several hundred pages of emails that the State Department has already turned over.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, the top Democrat on the Benghazi probe, said that proves Mrs. Clinton has already produced all of her official records concerning the terrorist attack.

“It is time for the committee to stop this political charade and instead make these documents public and schedule Secretary Clinton’s public testimony now,” he said.

Mrs. Clinton said at a press conference earlier this month that she culled through more than 60,000 emails from her time as secretary and decided about 30,000 of them were public records that should have been maintained. She said the rest were private messages relating to her daughter’s wedding or her yoga class schedule, and she didn’t keep those.

But Mr. Gowdy said Mrs. Clinton’s lawyers informed him Friday that she “unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails” from it.

He said it wasn’t clear when Mrs. Clinton made the final decision, but he said it appeared to have happened after the State Department asked her to turn over her government business messages in late October.

Mrs. Clinton rejected use of a government-issued email account during her four years as secretary, first relying on an account she used while a senator and then later setting up an email server at her home in New York and using an account on that to conduct all of her business, both public and private.

She insists she followed the law, which at the time didn’t require officials to use government-issued accounts but did require them to turn over all official records to be stored. Mrs. Clinton didn’t turn over those records until last December, after the Benghazi probe noticed she had used a private email and requested those records from the State Department, which then asked Mrs. Clinton for them. The law doesn’t set a date for turning over records.

Open-records experts, however, question Mrs. Clinton’s designation of her server as private, saying it was set up in order to do government business, and so it and the emails on it arguably belong to the government.

Mrs. Clinton’s email practices have put the Obama administration in a difficult position. Obama lawyers have admitted in federal court that for years, they were not correctly performing open-records searches because they didn’t have her emails, but they say they are unilaterally going back and doing those searches now.

2465,2465,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/31/committee-demands-clinton-appear-explain-emails/,Right,"The Benghazi investigative committee on Tuesday formally requested that former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton give a transcribed interview detailing her decision-making in determining which emails she turned over to the government and why she wiped her email server clean.

Chairman Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican, made the request as the State Department began to divulge some of Mrs. Clinton’s emails that she hid for years. One of the early messages contradicts her claim that she wanted to use a single electronic device for email.

Mr. Gowdy said Mrs. Clinton’s “unique arrangement with herself” — in which she claimed complete control of government business email — needs to be explained, and nobody other than Mrs. Clinton can do that.

The interview would be behind closed doors but would be part of the committee investigation’s record. A public hearing would be held once the select investigative committee has gathered all of the documents it believes it needs, Mr. Gowdy said in a letter to Mrs. Clinton’s attorney.

“We continue to believe Secretary Clinton’s email arrangement with herself is highly unusual, if not unprecedented,” he said. “The decision to delete these records during the pendency of a congressional investigation only exacerbates our need to better understand what the secretary did, when she did it, and why she did it. While she has cited a variety of justifications for this arrangement, many questions and details about the arrangement remain unanswered.”

Mr. Gowdy said the questions include why Mrs. Clinton refused a government-issued account and set up her own account and server; why she kept the emails herself rather than turning them over to the State Department when she left office in early 2013; and how she decided which of the 62,000 emails from her time in office she would delete, and which she would turn over.

The chairman also pointedly made clear that since the emails are under committee investigation, any action to destroy them would be illegal. He said that is why Mrs. Clinton must turn over her server to a neutral third party — a request Mrs. Clinton’s team has rejected, saying she already has complied with the law.

Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said Mrs. Clinton looks forward to a public hearing, but he didn’t address Mr. Gowdy’s request for a transcribed interview.

“Secretary Clinton already told the committee months ago that she was ready to appear at a public hearing. It is by their choice that hasn’t happened,” Mr. Merrill said. “To be clear, she remains ready to appear at a hearing open to the American public.”

The White House, which has tried to keep the Clinton email situation at arm’s length, waved off questions about the Benghazi committee’s request, saying it is up to Mrs. Clinton, who spokesman Josh Earnest made clear is no longer part of the Obama administration.

“If the committee makes a request and Secretary Clinton, in her capacity as a private citizen, decides that she wants to — once again — go above and beyond in terms of trying to provide them information and access, then that will be a decision for her to make,” Mr. Earnest said.

Mrs. Clinton said she used an email server she set up at her home in New York, and issued herself her own email address, because she wanted to use a single device and account for both personal and private mail. She has said she determined that about 30,000 of her 62,000 emails from her time in office were government-related, and in December — nearly two years after she left office — she turned those over to the State Department amid prodding by the Benghazi committee.

PHOTOS: Eye-popping excuses in American political scandals

The emails she turned over amounted to 55,000 pages. The State Department said this week that it will take several months to process those emails because it needs to scan the pages to create digital files and then needs to run them by authorities to determine what can be released publicly.

In a court filing this week, the Obama administration said it wants to rush production of all of those emails online and rejected a request from a conservative legal group, Judicial Watch, for a quick turnaround on an open-records request.

The State Department didn’t apply that to all requests. The Associated Press reported Tuesday morning that the department had released four of Mrs. Clinton’s emails to the news organization — including one that showed Mrs. Clinton used an iPad in addition to her mobile phone for sending emails.

That contradicts one of Mrs. Clinton’s justifications for having a single account. The former first lady and potential Democratic presidential candidate told reporters in early March that she didn’t want to carry multiple devices.

Judicial Watch has multiple outstanding requests for Clinton emails. Its president, Tom Fitton, said the State Department has searched Mrs. Clinton’s emails in one of those requests and will divulge the results to the group Thursday.

“It is not a matter of playing favorites; it is a matter of further harming [through delay] our right to know under the Freedom of Information Act, which the agency has trashed,” Mr. Fitton said.

2468,2468,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/31/iran-talks-in-overtime-as-nuke-deal-proves-elusive/,Right,"Blowing through a self-imposed deadline, negotiators from Iran, the U.S. and five allied powers labored into the night trying to hammer out an outline toward a final deal to curb Iran’s nuclear programs, but Obama administration officials said talks will carry on into Wednesday in the hope that a stalemate can be broken on “several difficult issues.”

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters at the talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, that top diplomats from the U.S., Britain, France, China, Russia, Germany and Iran had “made enough progress” to “merit staying until Wednesday,” past the original midnight Tuesday deadline for a deal.

Late Tuesday, Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters in Switzerland that “for the majority of issues, solutions have been completely found” and that an agreement should be drafted starting Wednesday.

But White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the talks were aiming for an interim agreement with few specifics, accompanied by other papers detailing the issues still needing resolved. “If we are making progress toward the finish line, then we should keep going,” he said.

While resistance to a deal has been fierce from Republicans and some Democrats in Washington, the talks have reached a make-or-break point this week after nearly 12 years of stagnation and an exhaustive push by the White House for a breakthrough that could prevent a military confrontation with Iran over its disputed nuclear programs.

Tehran insists its nuclear operations peaceful, but Washington and its allies have for more than a decade accused Iran of running a clandestine program to develop a nuclear bomb. Iran is demanding an end to crippling international economic sanctions as its price for a deal.

Officials on the sidelines of this week’s talks have suggested that all sides are close to producing broadly-worded outline that could allow negotiations to continue toward a June 30 final deadline — but without many of the specifics that some had been hoping for.

With oil prices dropping toward $55 a barrel Tuesday, the global energy market seemed to be bracing to the announcement of a deal that could see a lifting of the U.S.-led embargo on Iranian crude. Such a development could push prices even lower as it would increase supply to the world market.

But tension was reportedly thick in the negotiations Tuesday as the talks ground past a previously agreed to March 31 pre-deadline deadline.

At midday, Iranian state media reported that the negotiations were carrying on, but slowly. And since they’re being held under a cloak of secrecy in Switzerland, details on the terms of a potential deal remained unconfirmed.

Claiming to have obtained a draft version of the deal two weeks ago, The Associated Press reported that Western powers were haggling over whether to allow Iran to retain some 6,000 centrifuges for uranium enrichment — a process that can lead to nuclear weapons-grade material — as part of a deal that would last 10 years.

Officials have reportedly leaked details of other last-minute sticking points in the talks, including the length the proposed deal and the timing of the end of sanctions. While Iran reportedly agrees with the 10-year time frame, France and other nations are said to want a deal lasting at least 15 years.

The question of sanctions relief continues to be debated. The Obama administration and its allies have reportedly pushed for a so-called “phased relief.” But Iranian negotiators are said to be holding out for a deal that would see broad-based relief from the start.

The U.S. and other Western powers in the talks are also said to favor a deal that could seen U.N. sanctions on Iran’s economy and military reimposed automatically if Tehran is blocks U.N. weapons inspectors from its nuclear sites — or violating any other terms of a potential deal.

But Iran’s state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported Tuesday that Russia and China are believed to disagree with those terms, instead favoring a scenario in which the U.N. Security Council would have to vote on appropriate future punishments if Iran violated the deal.

Still, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters on Monday that the prospects for breakthrough in the ongoing talks “were not bad.”

“I would even say good,” Mr. Lavrov said, according to The Associated Press.

The survey found that 49 percent of respondents view Mrs. Clinton in a positive light — down from 67 percent more than two years ago — and 46 percent view her unfavorably, as she lays the ground work for a presidential bid.

“Yet Clinton still is better off than six potential GOP candidates tested in this survey,” the survey analysis said.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s favorable-unfavorable rating sits at 33-53 percent, compared to 26-61 percent for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

“Compared with Clinton, more Americans have yet to form an opinion of Bush. Christie or, especially the others tested in this poll, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker,” the analysis said. “Still, Cruz’s favorability rating, like Bush’s, is underwater by 20 points, Rubio’s by 14, Paul’s by 13 and Walker’s — the least known — by 7.”

2471,2471,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/5/netanyahu-iran-nuclear-deal-lets-tehran-build-tero/,Right,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday blasted the preliminary nuclear deal struck between Iran, the U.S. and other countries last week, saying the agreement not only endangers Israel but also will enable Iran to build a “terror machine” capable of conquering the Middle East.

Appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” Mr. Netanyahu — who has been the chief critic of the agreement — said lifting economic sanctions on Iran will lead to disaster in the region.

“I think this is a bad deal. It leaves Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure. It lifts the sanctions on them fairly quickly and enables them to get billions of dollars into their coffers. They’re not going to use it for schools or hospitals or roads,” he said. “They’re going to use it to pump up their terror machine worldwide and their military machine that is busy conquering the Middle East now.”

In exchange for some sanctions relief, the agreement calls for Iran to limit its uranium enrichment, reduce the number of its operating centrifuges and take other steps designed to slow the pace at which Tehran could build a nuclear weapon.

Much like Mr. Netanyahu, some U.S. lawmakers fear that sanctions relief will immediately lead to economic prosperity in Iran.

“Their economy is going to flourish,” Sen. Bob Corker, Tennessee Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Mr. Netanyahu said the deal is lacking in that it does not require Iran to stop sponsoring terrorism in the region and does not call on Tehran to stop its frequent verbal threats against Israel.

The Times reports that the application, obtained from the Miami-Dade County Elections Department, shows that Mr. Bush marked himself “Hispanic” in the field labeled “race/ethnicity.”

Under Florida law, voter registration applications must be submitted in hard copy and require an original signature, because the voter is swearing or affirming an oath, The Times reported.

Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told USA Today that “it’s unclear where the paperwork error was made,” adding that the governor’s family “certainly got a good laugh out of it.”

Mr. Bush’s son, Jeb Bush Jr., apparently alerted his dad to The Times’ report Monday morning, writing on Twitter: “LOL — come on dad, think you checked the wrong box #HonoraryLatino.”

Within 20 minutes Mr. Bush responded: “My mistake! Don’t think I’ve fooled anyone!”

Mr. Bush, the brother and son of two former presidents, was born and raised in Texas. He taught English in Mexico where he met his wife, Columba Bush, and speaks fluent Spanish. For two years in his 20s, he lived in Venezuela.

“While Mr. Bush’s claiming to be Hispanic may have been a careless mistake, confusion over heritage is no laughing matter during a campaign season,” The Times reported, citing Elizabeth Warren’s Senate campaign in 2012, when she was accused of misrepresenting herself as Cherokee.

2477,2477,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/2/obama-allies-hail-iran-nuclear-deal-as-critics-sla/,Right,"President Obama and other world leaders on Thursday hailed what they said was a breakthrough accord setting the stage for a historic agreement that will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, even though Iran will be allowed to enrich uranium under the agreement and the schedule for easing international sanctions remains to be negotiated.

After 12 years of deadlock over Iran’s disputed nuclear activities — and a sleepless marathon of negotiations in Switzerland over the past week — Iranian and Western diplomats said the final terms of a 15-year phased deal will be hammered out and signed by all sides this summer.

An ebullient Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s top negotiator, hailed the agreement reached in Lausanne as a “win-win” for both sides.

In Washington, Mr. Obama said that “if this framework leads to a comprehensive deal, it will make our country, our allies and our world safer.”

Even as critics on Capitol Hill and Israel pointed out shortcomings and omissions in the deal, Mr. Obama told reporters in the White House Rose Garden that Iran agreed to dramatically limit the scope of its nuclear program and committed to “the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program in history.”

“It is a good deal, a deal that meets our core objectives,” the president said.

SEE ALSO: Benjamin Netanyahu’s spokesman rips Iran nuclear deal

If it leads to a final deal, he said, the framework negotiated by top diplomats from the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and Iran will “cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon.”

Skeptics were out in force by Thursday night, and a fact sheet that the State Department circulated to reporters showed a clear gap between the president’s rhetoric and the terms of the agreement by Washington and its allies.

In a concession indicating that Western negotiators believe the Islamic republic ultimately will build a nuclear bomb, the fact sheet suggested that the agreement’s bottom line is simply to slow the speed at which Iranian scientists can pursue such a goal if they violate terms of the agreement.

The amount of time it would take Iran to “break out” with enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon is “currently assessed to be 2 to 3 months,” the State Department document said. If the deal is finalized, “that timeline will be extended to at least one year, for the duration of at least ten years.”

All sides agree that the nuclear agreement will not resolve a host of bilateral problems that have poisoned U.S.-Iranian relations for decades, including Iran’s support for insurgent proxies in Iraq and throughout the Middle East, its suspected support of terrorist groups and even Tehran’s refusal to release three Americans — a Christian pastor, a journalist and a former U.S. Marine — who are being held in Iranian prisons.

Fate of sanctions unclear

On a separate front, uncertainty loomed over the process by which Iran will achieve its top objective in the talks: an end to crushing international economic sanctions, including the global embargo on Iranian crude oil, that the Obama administration helped organize in recent years to force Tehran to the bargaining table.

The State Department fact sheet said only that sanctions relief will occur if and when Iran “verifiably abides by its commitments” under a final deal. No specific timeline was identified, leaving open the possibility that sanctions could be lifted rapidly or could continue for years after a final deal is signed.

The sanctions issue is believed to have been bitterly divisive as the nuclear talks continued past the negotiators’ self-imposed March 31 deadline and one that may cause Mr. Obama significant problems with Congress.

Iran’s Mr. Zarif at first acknowledged to reporters that sanctions would be lifted only after inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency have verified Iranian compliance with the terms of a final deal.

But Thursday night, Mr. Zarif took to Twitter to assert: “There is no need to spin using ‘fact sheets’ so early on.” The main point, he said moments later, is that the sanctions will be lifted.

The White House said late Thursday that Mr. Obama personally briefed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top Saudi officials — who are deeply skeptical of any agreement with Tehran — on the details of the accord.

Mr. Netanyahu, who addressed a joint session of Congress last month lobbying against a deal with Iran, was not assuaged.

“A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu declared in a statement after the president’s call.

In an ironic twist, the lack of clarity on sanctions could help Mr. Obama sell the deal in Washington, where Republicans and some key Democrats in Congress have been threatening to do everything in their power to keep the sanctions in place.

The unexpected extent and specificity of the deal, after multiple reports that negotiators in Lausanne were at loggerheads, appeared to give some critics pause as they tried to digest the details.

“If a final agreement is reached, the American people, through their elected representatives, must have the opportunity to weigh in,” said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, Tennessee Republican, who is pushing a bill to require congressional review of any final deal before Mr. Obama can lift sanctions.

Other Republicans were offering negative reviews of the deal.

“Iranian leaders will now find a nuclear weapon dangerously within reach,” said Rep. Michael T. McCaul, Texas Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security. “If this deal moves forward, the consequences for the U.S. and our allies in the region will be dire.”

Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, was more generous. “While important details still need to be worked out,” he said, the framework accord shows “a negotiated resolution of Iran’s nuclear program may be possible.

“Congress must ensure that its actions do not preclude reaching an acceptable agreement or be seen as scuttling a peaceful path to ending Iran’s nuclear ambitions,” Mr. Schiff said.

‘Decisive step’

The agreement was first announced by European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and Mr. Zarif, who appeared together at the site of negotiations in Switzerland.

With diplomats from the so-called P5+1 group — the U.N. Security Council’s five permanent members, plus Germany — behind them, the two read out a joint statement hailing what they called a “decisive step” after more than a decade of negotiations.

Secretary of State John F. Kerry, the lead U.S. negotiator, acknowledged that the deal remains preliminary but stressed that “the parameters that we have agreed to will do exactly what we set out to do: make certain that all pathways to make enough fissile material for one nuclear weapon have been cut off.”

Explaining the deal, U.S. officials said Tehran has agreed to reduce the number of uranium enrichment centrifuges it operates by roughly two-thirds, from an estimated 19,000 to roughly 5,000. The remaining centrifuges will be allowed to continue with only low-level enrichment good for civilian nuclear power use over the coming 10 years.

U.S. officials also said Tehran agreed to trim its uranium enrichment to a level of 3.67 percent for at least 15 years and committed to reducing its stockpile of about 10,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to 300 kilograms for 15 years.

Iran also has agreed to halt all uranium enrichment at its heavily fortified underground Fordow nuclear facility, although the facility will be allowed to remain as a nuclear, physics and technology research center, the officials said. Critics noted that even Mr. Obama has questioned why Iran needed the secretive Fordow facility if it was not interested in obtaining a bomb.

According to the State Department fact sheet, Iran’s enrichment activities will be confined to the Natanz facility roughly 200 miles south of Tehran, where enrichment activities also will be curtailed.

The document said Iran has agreed to enrich uranium using only its first-generation IR-1 model centrifuges at Natanz for 10 years — removing roughly 1,000 advanced IR-2 model centrifuges from the facility and placing them in “IAEA monitored storage for ten years.”

At the same time, Tehran will allow IAEA inspectors “regular access to all of Iran’s nuclear facilities, including to Iran’s enrichment facility at Natanz and its former enrichment facility at Fordow,” the department said.

Iran appears not to have agreed to surprise inspections, a provision that many critics demanded.

A combative Mr. Obama strongly defended the accord and challenged his congressional critics to offer a better alternative if they were prepared to scuttle the deal on offer.

“If Congress kills this deal not based on expert analysis, and without offering any reasonable alternative, then it’s the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy,” Mr. Obama said. “International unity will collapse, and the path to conflict will widen.”

2478,2478,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/6/rand-paul-launches-2016-white-house-bid-plans-ambi/,Right,"Sen. Rand Paul, the eye doctor turned politician, officially kicked off his long-awaited campaign for the Republican presidential nomination Tuesday in his home state of Kentucky, intent on waging a 50-state campaign that marries the small-government libertarianism championed by his father and the millennial generation with the traditional forces of the Republican Party.

“I am running for president to return our country to the principles of liberty and limited government,” Sen. Paul said Tuesday in his official campaign kickoff.

The scope of the challenge and the ambition of the candidate displayed themselves in full Monday when the first-term Kentucky senator released his campaign slogan — “Defeat the Washington machine. Unleash the American dream” — designed to position him as an anti-Washington crusader able to attract new voters to the traditional Republican coalition.

Campaign advisers also told The Washington Times that Mr. Paul planned to compete in every primary election and caucus in all 50 states, all five territories and the District of Columbia, a feat that only two GOP candidates achieved in 2012.

“It’s time for a new way. A new set of ideas. A new leader, one you can trust. One who works for you and, above all, it’s time for a new president,” Mr. Paul said in a video released by his campaign as a prelude to Tuesday’s announcement.

The Kentucky senator’s “all-chips-in” message was enhanced by his winning preliminary commitment from his home state GOP to convert Kentucky’s planned presidential preference primary next May into a presidential caucus earlier in the calendar.

SEE ALSO: Kentucky GOP considering changing from primary to caucus to help Rand Paul in 2016

The move will allow Mr. Paul to circumvent Kentucky’s election law requirement that a candidate’s name may appear on the ballot for only one office. He plans to seek nomination for a second Senate term in case his presidential aspirations go south on him.

The state party, not the state government, runs the caucus.

And the challenge for a politician bred in the shadows of his famous father, former Texas congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul, also came into clearer focus. The elder Mr. Paul gained enormous popularity among millennials but struggled to gain mainstream support from traditional Republicans, who worried about some of his views on eliminating some government agencies and his reluctance to intervene militarily abroad.

Libertarians like the elder Mr. Paul have been distrusted on issues like gay marriage by social conservatives, who are key to the Iowa caucuses, as well as war hawks, who fear the anti-interventionist agenda — shared by populists like Pat Buchanan and many libertarians — would force the U.S. to shrink from its role as the world’s superpower.

The younger Mr. Paul has sought to blunt these expected attacks, openly discussing his Christian faith, traveling to Israel to show his support for an ally that both Christians and war hawks champion and penning an op-ed insisting he would not be an isolationist as president.

But like his father, the younger Paul clearly champions the smaller-government, anti-Washington sentiments that have made both Pauls popular among college students and young adults. Rand Paul won the last three straw polls at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where younger voters tend to dominate.

He’ll get to test the popularity of his message of reining in Washington and unleashing American ingenuity on wider audiences this week during his five-state tour, which will take him from his home state to the first four presidential nomination contest states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

Getting his name on the Republican presidential nomination ballot in all 50 U.S. states and territories would be no small feat. History suggests it’s likely to be most presidential nomination aspirants’ toughest row to hoe.

It takes hordes of volunteers, separate staffs and leaders for organizations in place on the ground in each of the states and territories, money to finance it all and the know-how to pull it off.

It also takes organization and a long head start to compete successfully in states that hold presidential preference caucuses instead of primary elections to award delegates to the Republican presidential nominating convention, to be held next summer in Cleveland.

Only two GOP presidential nomination candidates managed to have their names on the ballots (or to be fully prepared for the logistic challenge of caucuses) in every state and territory in 2012.

One was former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who had more money available than anyone else in the field and a full-blown national campaign organization. The only other 50-state-plus competitor was Ron Paul, the senator’s father. The libertarian conservative had the advantage of twin followings — tens of thousands of millennials belonging to the ubiquitous Young Americans for Liberty chapters on college campuses, and older voters whose highest political priority was to get the government off their backs and out of their bedrooms.

Getting on the ballot became a headline issue only occasionally in the last presidential cycle.

Mr. Paul and Mr. Romney were the only candidates that appeared on the ballot in Virginia’s March 6 primary — one of the Super Tuesday contests that year. Former Sen. Rick Santorum, Pennsylvania Republican and a favorite of many religious conservatives, never filed in the state.

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich did file, but his paperwork fell short of state requirements. Rick Perry, then the popular governor of Texas, lost a legal challenge, along with other GOP hopefuls, on Virginia’s requirements.

Being on all ballots and winning the most delegates isn’t automatic, as 2012 showed.

Mr. Romney wound up with 1,575 delegates, Mr. Santorum with 245, Mr. Paul with 177 and Mr. Gingrich with 138.

Mr. Paul’s campaign also hopes to expand his appeal as a Washington outsider willing to smash the conventions and practices of a hostage capital city to help reclaim control of government for everyday Americans and reduce the burden of excessive federal spending and debt.

But behind the scenes, his effort to qualify both for Senate re-election and the presidential nominating in Kentucky could pose challenges.

On the eve of his announcement, The Times confirmed Mr. Paul has won an important victory inside the Kentucky Republican Party that could allow him to run for both offices next year.

State GOP Chairman Steve Robertson has appointed a special committee to explore converting Kentucky’s presidential preference primary, scheduled for next May, to a caucus to be held earlier in the year.

The special committee “will bring back a workable plan to present to the full central state committee to determine the feasibility of going ahead with a caucus, which will mean a lot of work for everyone involved,” said Second District Chairman Scott Lasley, who is running the effort.

Mr. Paul and his chief strategist, Doug Stafford, persuaded the state GOP executive committee to act on the idea with what some Republicans call the “approval” and others call the “acquiescence” of Kentucky’s most powerful Republican, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

The state central committee of more than 300 members must vote to approve the plan.

Mr. Paul says he will help raise the money for the state GOP to shoulder the burden. The move would benefit Mr. Paul on numerous fronts. If Mr. Paul can get all of his home state’s 45 delegates to the Republican presidential nominating convention in Cleveland next summer in his column early in the nomination contest — say, the first few weeks in March — he will look all the better to potential donors and bandwagon voters in subsequent primaries.

It also would allow Mr. Paul to hedge his election bets, running both for president and re-election to the Senate, without having to go to court to challenge the current legal requirements.

Kentucky’s election rules call for a state government-financed presidential primary every four years. The regulations also stipulate that if you want to appear on the ballot for the U.S. Senate nomination — as Mr. Paul does so that he might have a second six-year Senate term — you can’t have your name on the ballot for a second office, such as for a presidential primary.

They’re first in the nation, and don’t you forget it. The New Hampshire Republican Party is ferocious about its traditional status as host of the nation’s first presidential primary, which can make and break candidates and create a media ruckus. So, naturally, there’s a First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit which began Friday — and the GOP giants can’t wait to get there. The sold-out event in Nashua is “an electrifying two-day conference,” say the organizers, who credentialed over 100 journalists to cover it.

Attending, in no particular order: Sens. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham; Govs. Scott Walker, Chris Christie, John Kasich and Bobby Jindal; Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, Donald Trump and John Bolton. Among media and polling folks: Fred Barnes, Joe Scarborough, Stephen Hayes and Frank Luntz; among assorted politicians: Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Rep. Peter T. King, George Pataki, Scott Brown, Bob Ehrlich, Betsy McCaughey, John Sununu and Jim Gilmore.

On the Republican Richter scale of fame, this big group is pretty electrifying. Yes, C-SPAN will be there live, beginning at high noon Friday and continuing through early Saturday night. Eager Democrats are lying in wait, however. Also journeying to Nashua for the big event: that would-be Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who staged her own press conference just down the street from the GOP’s snazzy hotel, her talking points at the ready.

“Republicans running, or considering a run, for the White House in 2016 have stumbled all over themselves to brandish their conservative credentials, and their out-of-touch policies leave everyday Americans behind,” says Mrs. Wasserman Schultz. “This group of Republicans is pushing policies that will benefit the wealthy at the expense of hardworking Granite State families and would turn back the clock on women’s health and LGBT equality. The Granite State and the country deserve better.”

Needless to say, Hillary Rodham Clinton arrives in the Granite State on Monday for a cozy two-day visit.

CONSERVATIVES ON ALERT

Not to be outdone and ready to rumble, 24 hours after the first-in-the nation GOPers vacate their event site, a feisty group of New Hampshire conservatives moves in. Literally. On Sunday, the 603 Alliance — activists loyal to founding principles and intent on discovering the genuine conservatives in the presidential bunch — will stage a daylong Grassroots Summit. In the very same Nashua hotel, of course. They have big plans.

“On April 19, in the city of Nashua, New Hampshire, the live-free-or-die state, there is going to be a loud bang very much like the shot heard around the world made on April 19, 1775 in Massachusetts,” the group sternly predicts in a statement.

Past elections, they say, have taught them that “splitting their votes among numerous conservative candidates enables the moderate establishment to cruise to victory, and that only a consolidating effort on their parts will result in a victory for a conservative candidate.” They have a plan, and will reveal it with fanfare. And some interesting speakers will be along, including Sharon Angle, who ran for the U.S. Senate seat in Nevada; author Trevor Loudon and Aaron Day, chairman of The Atlas Society.

“We welcome all — Republicans, undeclared voters, Libertarians, Constitutionalists, Free Staters, even Democrats if they support our organization’s principles,” the group notes.

RAND’S PRO-LIFE RATIONALE

“Now some have said to me, ‘Well, you’re big on all this liberty stuff, why do you want to restrict a woman’s right to choose?’ And I say, ‘Well, you know what, the government does have some role in our lives. One of the main roles the government has is to restrict you from harming another individual.’ Which gets us back to the original debate: When life begins, there is a role for state. So it’s not that I’m against people choosing things. I’m in fact one of the biggest believers in choice and liberty. But you can’t have liberty if you don’t protect where your liberty originates from — and that’s your right to life.”

— Sen. Rand Paul, to the Susan B. Anthony List Summit on Thursday.

MR. BOEHNER, REFEREE

“We’ve got a lot of good candidates out there, and they’ll sort — they’ll sort this out themselves. I’ve been a Jeb Bush supporter for a long time — a longtime friend of mine, colleague, and I think he’d do a great job. But we’ve got a lot of good candidates, and they’re going to have to go sort this out themselves.”

— House Speaker John A. Boehner, on the burgeoning field of presidential hopefuls, to Fox Business Network anchor Maria Bartiromo

ABOUT THAT GYRO GUY

“Despite the clear liberal agenda of postal worker Doug Hughes flying a gyrocopter into restricted Washington, D.C., airspace to protest for campaign finance reform, the broadcast networks avoided linking the dangerous stunt to left-wing politics or the Democratic Party,” says Kyle Drennan, an analyst for NewsBusters.com who has a long memory.

“Such avoidance stood in stark contrast to media eagerness to falsely blame conservatives and the Republican Party for deadly acts of violence in recent years, including a man flying a plane into an IRS building in 2010, the shooting of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011 and the Colorado movie theater shooting in 2012,” Mr. Drennan notes, adding, “while network coverage treated the stunt as a serious security breach in the nation’s capital, none of the reports attempted to connect the reckless action to heated Democratic rhetoric on the topic.”

2502,2502,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/20/malta-bury-24-victims-latest-shipwreck-tragedy/,Right,"MILAN (AP) — An Italian coast guard ship headed toward Sicily Monday with 27 survivors of what could be the Mediterranean’s deadliest migrant tragedy, as EU foreign ministers gathered for an emergency meeting on the growing crisis as migrants flee instability in Libya at unprecedented rates.

One survivor, identified as a 32-year-old Bangladeshi, has put the number of people on board the smugglers’ boat when it capsized near the Libyan coast at 950, and only a handful have been rescued. The survivor was flown Sunday by helicopter to Catania, in Sicily, where he was interviewed by prosecutors. He was being treated in a hospital.

“He is pretty well now and he is reporting that there were really many, many persons including children on the boat. So it’s confirming the terrible news,” said Carlotta Sami, a U.N. refugee agency spokeswoman.

International agencies stressed that the information provided to prosecutors still needs to be confirmed.

Earlier Friday, the Italian coast guard ship Gregoretti brought the bodies of 24 victims to Malta, where the dead will be buried.

All 24 were adult men, according to the Maltese Army.

Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said that survivors spoke of “haunting experiences.”

The Maltese Army said that items recovered from the site of the tragedy included a diary, which has been passed on to Italian authorities for investigation.

Italian Premier Matteo Renzi told private Italian radio RTL he will ask his EU counterparts on Monday to confront instability in Libya more decisively than in the past, but he ruled out ground troops.

“At this moment to intervene with international forces on the ground is a risk that is absolutely excessive,” Renzi said. “We cannot think about sending tens of thousands of men without a strategy, on a wave of emotion.”

Renzi said he would ask his European counterparts to participate in a joint operation targeting smugglers. He said that Italy has so far arrested nearly 1,000, but needs help.

Renzi met in Washington last week with President Barack Obama, who also pledged to help on Libya.

EU foreign ministers are meeting in Luxembourg Monday focusing on the migration crisis and the role of the conflict in Libya fueling the influx. The EU’s top migration official, Dimitris Avramopoulos, has canceled a trip to the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla to attend.

Fighting in Libya has escalated to its worst levels since the 2011 civil war that ended with the overthrow and killing of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

Rebel groups that fought against him kept their weapons and militias mushroomed in number. The country now has rival governments — the internationally recognized one in the eastern city of Tobruk, and an Islamist-backed one in the capital, Tripoli. The two sides have been negotiating in Morocco to end the fighting.

Malta and Italy are closest to the Libyan coast, and have received the brunt of a migrant tide that carried 219,000 people from Africa to Europe last year. Some 3,500 died or went missing along the way, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said in a statement Sunday.

2503,2503,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/21/senate-trafficking-deal-clears-vote-loretta-lynch/,Right,"Attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch could finally earn a confirmation vote in the Senate this week after Democrats and Republicans struck a deal Tuesday on an unrelated bill against human trafficking, clearing a legislative logjam after more than a month.

The confirmation of Ms. Lynch, whom President Obama picked to replace Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., has been pending since late last year, but Republicans insisted on finishing the human trafficking bill first — and the trafficking bill has been stuck in a fight over abortion funding.

On Tuesday, both sides agreed to shelve the thorny abortion issue by rearranging money for a victims’ fund so it comes from existing health care money.

Congress could take final action on the trafficking bill Wednesday, and then Republicans could move on to Ms. Lynch as promised.

“There are no more excuses. We should vote to confirm Loretta Lynch as quickly as possible,” said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, one of a number of Democrats who accused Republicans of slow-walking Ms. Lynch, who would be the first black woman to hold the nation’s top law enforcement post.

Ms. Lynch appears to have enough votes for confirmation — though just barely.

Many conservatives have said they will vote against her, citing her defense of the legality of Mr. Obama’s deportation amnesty as evidence that she will not be an independent constitutional referee holding the president in check.

The White House has berated Republican senators for insisting on completing the human trafficking bill first, saying Ms. Lynch has waited longer than any other attorney general nominee in decades.

Some Senate Democrats have hinted at racial motives behind the Republicans’ strategy. However, the inaction has kept in office Mr. Holder, who also is black and is disliked by Republicans.

Republicans said the bipartisan breakthrough on the trafficking bill validated their decision to insist that legislation be finished before Democrats get a vote on Ms. Lynch.

“I’m happy with it,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican.

The trafficking bill cleared committee on a unanimous vote and seemed destined for easy passage last month — until Democrats said they noticed a provision applying the so-called Hyde Amendment restrictions, which prohibit federal funds from going to pay for abortions, to fines the government would collect from convicted traffickers.

Some Democrats explained their about-face by saying they never read the bill. Some staffers reportedly acknowledged that they were aware of the Hyde language but didn’t object until pro-choice groups demanded a fight.

Those groups argued that applying to fines was an expansion of the Hyde restrictions, which they said previously applied only to money collected from taxpayers. Republicans countered that the Hyde restrictions applied to all federal funding.

Under terms of the agreement, money collected from traffickers will not go to health-related services but will be spent on services such as legal aid for victims. Health services for victims, meanwhile, would be paid for by existing community health center funds with abortion restrictions, circumventing the need for another abortion fight.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota Democrat, said the two-fund solution came to her while she was traveling through a cornfield during the Senate’s spring break this month. She said she met little resistance as she shopped the idea to colleagues in a series of personal phone calls.

“I just knew it had a chance, because no one ever said it was impossible to do,” Ms. Klobuchar said outside the Senate chamber.

Planned Parenthood Action Fund, a pro-choice group, applauded the breakthrough, saying key Democrats “held the line” against an expansion of Hyde restrictions, while other pro-choice groups bemoaned the fact that Hyde language remained in the bill.

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, boasted that he forced Republicans to back off their more expansive abortion restrictions, which he called a “pointless, contrived fight,” clearing the way for the deal.

The trafficking bill still must clear the full Senate, and Mr. McConnell has promised lawmakers a chance to offer amendments. Some Republicans are itching to use the bill as a vehicle for fights over such issues as birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants.

Mr. Reid, though, warned Republicans not to amend the bill, saying it would upset the compromise. “We’re not out of the woods yet, and that’s an understatement,” he said.

His opposition to amendments recalls his time as majority leader, when he regularly used his powers to shut out amendments altogether.

Republicans vowed to change that practice once they took control, and Mr. McConnell said he wanted a more open process in which members of both parties could feel they were getting a say.

So far, the approach is bearing fruit.

The Senate last week passed a bipartisan deal to overhaul Medicare’s formula for paying doctors, and lawmakers have reached other bipartisan agreements on Iran sanctions, an education overhaul and trade promotion.

2505,2505,http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2012/aug/1/poll-obama-leads-three-key-swing-states/,Right,"President Barack Obama leads Republican Mitt Romney by a significant margin in three key battleground states, according to a new Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS poll.

Including voters leaning toward a candidate, Mr. Obama holds a six-point lead in both Florida and Ohio and an 11-point lead in Pennsylvania.

SEE RELATED:

In Florida, 51 percent of likely voters favor Mr. Obama, compared to 45 percent who lean toward Mr. Romney. In Ohio, Mr. Obama holds a 50 percent to 44 percent advantage, and in Pennsylvania, he holds a 53 percent to 42 percent lead.

Mr. Obama is also viewed more positively by the voters in each state, with at least 50 percent holding a favorable opinion of him. Mr. Romney, meanwhile, was underwater on favorability in all three, performing the worst in Pennsylvania. Thirty-nine percent of voters in the Keystone state hold a favorable view of the former Massachusetts governor, compared to 47 percent with an unfavorable one.

Voters supporting Mr. Romney in all three states also appear to be more likely to back him because they dislike Mr. Obama, rather than vice versa.

Nearly two-thirds of Mr. Obama’s supporters in Florida say they strongly favor their candidate, compared to 14 percent who support him because they dislike Mr. Romney. Meanwhile, 49 percent of Mr. Romney’s backers strongly favor him, with 19 percent supporting him because they dislike Mr. Obama.

Six in 10 Obama voters in Ohio voters strongly support the president while 9 percent support him because of their dislike for Mr. Romney. Forty-two percent of Romney supporters strongly favor their candidate, and more the one-fifth support him because they do not like the president.

In Pennsylvania, 59 percent of Mr. Obama’s supporters back him strongly and 7 percent support him because of their distaste for Mr. Romney. Meanwhile, 41 percent of Romney backers favor him strongly, and 22 percent favor him because of their dislike of Mr. Obama.

While the numbers on their face appear favorable for Mr. Obama, there was also a greater sample size of Democrats in the poll. Thirty-six percent of Florida voters identified themselves generally as Democrats, compared to 27 percent Republicans and 32 percent independents. The split was nearly identical in Ohio, with 35 percent saying they were Democrats, 27 percent Republicans, and 32 percent independents. In Pennsylvania, 38 percent considered themselves Democrats, 32 percent Republicans, and 26 percent independents.

Voters were also rather evenly split on which candidate would do a better job on the economy — overwhelmingly the most important issue for voters in all three states. But they strongly support Mr. Obama’s plan to raise taxes on households making more than $250,000 in order to reduce the federal deficit. Sixty-two percent of Pennsylvania voters support the plan, compared to 60 percent in Ohio and 58 percent in Florida.

The polls were conducted by land line and cell phones from July 24 through July 30 among 1,193 likely voters in Ohio, 1,168 likely voters in Florida, and 1,168 likely voters in Pennsylvania."
2509,2509,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/24/elizabeth-warren-let-people-see-trade-deal-we-have/,Right,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is calling on President Obama to make a proposed trade deal with Pacific Rim nations public before Congress decides whether to press forward on it.

Ms. Warren said members of Congress can read the deal but “aren’t allowed to talk about it.”

“So now it’s the case that the president says that he wants the American people to judge this deal based on the facts, but to do that, he’s got to make the deal public,” Ms. Warren said this week on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show.” “Otherwise, the American people can’t judge it on the facts — [you] won’t put the facts out there.”

“If it’s a great deal for families, like the president says, or a great deal for workers, then put it out there and let ‘em see it before we have to grease the skids to get the deal done,” she said.

Ms. Maddow pointed out that administration has said there will be a public comment period on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and that the public will be able to see it online.

But Ms. Warren said they’re “asking us to vote now on greasing the skids so that we give up now any chance to be able to block it, any chance to be able to slow it down — give all that up, and then you’ll get to see the deal on the other side.”

“I just don’t think that’s reasonable,” she said.

This week, House and Senate committees signed off on bills that would give the president so-called “trade promotion authority” on the deal that would give Congress an up or down vote on it without an ability to amend it — an issue that has revealed sharp divides in the Democratic party.

Mr. Obama, speaking at an Organizing for Action summit Thursday, called the Trans-Pacific Partnership “the most progressive trade agreement in our history.”

“So when people say that this trade deal is bad for working families, they don’t know what they’re talking about,” he said.

But liberals like Ms. Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont Independent, have remained opposed.

Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who is considering a 2016 run for president on the Democratic side, has also come out against the deal, while Democratic frontrunner and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was noncommittal on the campaign trail in New Hampshire this week.

“Well, any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security,” Mrs. Clinton told reporters. “We have to do our part in making sure we have the capabilities and the skills to be competitive.”

2512,2512,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/23/hillary-clinton-under-fire-for-foreign-donations-l/,Right,"The White House struggled Thursday to fend off a barrage of questions about foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation during the tenure of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, including reports of donations linked to a deal that helped Russia nearly corner the world uranium market with State Department approval.

Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign has wrestled with the same questions, but neither the campaign nor the White House provided enough answers to quell the uproar.

Scrutiny of foreign money swirling around Mrs. Clinton, including skyrocketing speaking fees paid to her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and megadonations to their charitable foundation after she became America’s top diplomat, will only intensify and dog her on the campaign trail.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest insisted that President Obama is not troubled by reports that the Clinton Foundation accepted $2.35 million from a businessman involved in Russia’s uranium deals that required approval from the U.S. State Department as well as other countries.

“At this point, there has not been any evidence presented that would prompt the president or anybody at the White House to be unsettled by Secretary Clinton’s conduct as secretary of state,” said Mr. Earnest. “In fact, everyone here at the White House, including the president, continues to be very proud of her service to this country.”

The contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite a memorandum of understanding between Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration that required donations to the foundation to be disclosed to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, The New York Times reported.

SEE ALSO: Mitt Romney on Clinton Foundation uranium story: ‘It looks like bribery’

The deal gave Russia’s atomic energy agency, Rosatom, control of uranium mines stretching from Asia to the Western U.S., including half of America’s uranium supply.

Shortly after the Russians announced plans to buy mining giant Uranium One, a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin and the deal paid Mr. Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow, according to the newspaper.

That was about five times Mr. Clinton’s typical speaking fee.

Mr. Earnest said he wasn’t familiar with details of the Russian case.

Asked whether the administration is concerned that examples continue to emerge about questionable donations from foreign governments or foreign entities to the Clinton Foundation, he said no.

“The president and the administration continue to have a strong confidence in the decision-making of Secretary Clinton,” he said.

Still, Mr. Earnest declined to answer a reporter’s question on whether it is now “clear” that Mrs. Clinton didn’t abide by an agreement she signed with the administration before becoming secretary of state in 2009 to disclose donations to the foundation and the speaking fees paid to her husband.

“I’m not sure that that’s clear, but you should go ask Secretary Clinton’s team about that,” Mr. Earnest said.

The Clinton campaign did not respond to questions about violating the memorandum of understanding.

Mrs. Clinton, who is the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic presidential nomination, also came under fire form her potential Republican rivals.

“It’s the Clinton way: raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep. Now they’re scrambling to refile their taxes and account for her decisions as Secretary of State,” Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard who plans to announce her Republican presidential run May 4, wrote on her Facebook page.

She continued: “The American people will have a choice. Are we going to demand trust and transparency from our leaders? Have we had enough of a ruling political class that doles out favors to the wealthy and well connected few?”

The Clinton campaign has tried to tamp down the controversy since it emerged this week in previews of the book “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.”

The book, by conservative political adviser Peter Schweizer, argues that the Clintons got rich from speaking fees and donations in return for favors from Mrs. Clinton to various foreign interests while running the State Department.

Other dealings include a free trade agreement in Colombia that benefited a major foundation donor’s investments in the South American nation, development projects in Haiti after a devastating earthquake in 2010, and more than $1 million in payments to Mr. Clinton by a Canadian bank and major shareholder in the Keystone XL oil pipeline that occurred while the project was under State Department review, according to reports.

The Clinton campaign tried to dismiss the accusations as a right-wing “smear project,” but that becomes increasingly difficult as mainstream news outlets pick up the story.

Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon sent a memo Thursday to supporters and donors in an attempt to beat back the accusations.

“The bottom line remains that the book fails to produce a shred of evidence supporting the theory that Hillary Clinton ever took action as Secretary of State for the purposes of supporting the interests of donors to the Clinton foundation,” he wrote.

At a campaign stop in New Hampshire this week, Mrs. Clinton brushed aside reporters’ questions about connections between contributions from foreign entities and her actions as secretary of state, calling them merely “distractions and attacks.”

“I know that that comes, unfortunately, with the territory,” she told The Associated Press.

2515,2515,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/29/hillary-clinton-doubles-down-racial-justice-first-/,Right,"Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday demanded sweeping criminal justice reforms to end a “pattern” of black men being killed by police and black communities being subjugated by poverty, as the Baltimore riots pushed race relations to the forefront of her presidential campaign.

Mrs. Clinton called for an end to racial profiling, alternatives to incarceration for low-level offenses and body cameras on police officers nationwide to help fix a justice system that she said was tilted against black men.

The former first lady, senator and secretary of state said the the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man whose death in police custody set off riots in Baltimore this week, was only the latest example of a system that has grown “out of balance.”

“From Ferguson to Staten Island to Baltimore, the patterns have become unmistakable and undeniable,” said Mrs. Clinton in a speech at Columbia University in New York, the first major address of her campaign.

She listed the series of deaths of black men at the hands of police that have grabbed headlines in recent years.

“Walter Scott shot in the back in Charleston, South Carolina, unarmed, in debt, terrified of spending any more time in jail for child support payments he couldn’t afford. Tamir Rice shot in a park in Cleveland, Ohio, unarmed and just 12 year old. Eric Garner, choked to death after being stopped for selling cigarettes on the streets of our city. And now Freddie Gray, his spine nearly severed while in police custody,” she said.

“Not only as a mother and a grandmother, but as a citizen, a human being, my heart breaks for these young men and their families,” Mrs. Clinton said. “We have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in America.”

The remark drew some of the loudest applause in her keynote address at the university’s David N. Dinkins Leadership and Public Policy Forum.

“We have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance and these recent tragedies should galvanize us to come together as a nation to find our balance again,” she said.

Mrs. Clinton also called for calm in Baltimore.

“We should begin by heeding the pleas of Freddie Gray’s family for peace and unity, echoing the families of Michael Brown, Travon Martin and others in the past years,” she said. “Those who are instigating further violence in Baltimore are disrespecting the Gray family and the entire community. They are compounding the tragedy of Freddie Gray’s death and setting back the cause of justice.”

2520,2520,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/23/lynch-clears-filibuster-poised-become-1st-woman-ag/,Right,"Senators were on track to approve Loretta Lynch to be the new attorney general, defeating an early filibuster attempt Thursday morning, with a final vote scheduled later in the afternoon on what Democrats said was a major civil rights milestone.

Ms. Lynch, a federal prosecutor in New York, would replace Eric H. Holder Jr. and would be the country’s first black woman to reach the top law enforcement post.

She cleared the filibuster on a 66-34 vote, with Republican opposition directed not so much at Ms. Lynch herself but at President Obama, whose clashes with Congress over immigration, health care and environmental policy she will be tasked with defending.

“I hope she can recover from her testimony where she seemed to embrace the president’s illegal executive action [on immigration] without regard to the fact that it is a constitutional overreach,” said Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who voted against Ms. Lynch.

Mr. Obama had nominated Ms. Lynch in the wake of last year’s elections, hoping for quick action. But Democrats, who controlled the Senate during the lame-duck session of Congress, put off action on her, believing she would easily clear when the GOP took control in January.

Instead she’s languished as both sides clashed over abortion-funding provisions in a bill against human trafficking. An agreement this week finally cleared that snag, setting up the final Lynch vote.

Democrats have called the delays a black mark for Republicans, whom they accused of thwarting civil rights history.

“At long last this embarrassment for the Senate is over and this triumph for the American people will occur,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat.

Ms. Lynch grew up in a North Carolina still struggling with civil rights issues, including at her high school where she was the school’s valedictorian — but officials wary of having a lone black honoree decided she needed to share the top billing with two other students.

She graduated from Harvard College and got her law degree from Harvard Law School, and has twice served as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York — first under President Clinton and beginning again under Mr. Obama.

None of her opponents questioned her qualifications, and she has headed some of the Justice Department’s highest profile cases, including terrorism prosecutions and the case against former Rep. Michael Grimm, a New York Republican who resigned his seat and pleaded guilty.

The opposition to Ms. Lynch instead flowed almost entirely from her boss, Mr. Obama, and his efforts to test the limits of executive power, drawing fierce pushback from Republicans on Capitol Hill who accused him of ignoring the Constitution.

At her confirmation hearing Ms. Lynch defended the Justice Department’s legal reasoning underpinning Mr. Obama’s deportation amnesty programs, and refused to second-guess the president on a series of other actions.

Republicans also demanded to know how Ms. Lynch would be different from Mr. Holder, who has repeatedly clashed with the GOP, accused Mr. Obama’s opponents of being motivated by race, and withheld documents from Congress — resulting in him being the first attorney general in history to be held in contempt of Congress.

At her confirmation hearing and in written responses to followup questions Ms. Lynch insisted she would be different from Mr. Holder, though the only area she specifically identified where she might draw distinctions was on her willingness to be transparent.

Ms. Lynch also couldn’t think of any areas where she had made mistakes other than on cybersecurity, where she said she’s done a great job, but wished she’s gotten on top of the issue even earlier.

Democrats said opposing Ms. Lynch because she defended the president was a troubling precedent to set.

“This defies common sense,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill, Missouri Democrat. “You must vote against a nominee for the Cabinet of the duly elected president of the United States because she agrees with the duly elected president of the United States? Think of the consequences of that vote. Think what that means to the future of advise and consent in the Senate.”

But Republicans said her agreement with Mr. Obama went beyond normal bounds and suggested she would not be the independent officer they insisted the attorney general needs to be.

They contrasted her with Sally Quillian Yates, whom Mr. Obama nominated to be deputy attorney general and who cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee on an 18-2 vote Thursday morning, just minutes before the filibuster vote on Ms. Lynch.

Ms. Yates, who is white, is a prosecutor in Georgia, and had strong support of that state’s two Republican senators, which helped her nomination.

During her confirmation hearings she generally defended the president’s policies but did say she viewed the role of the Justice Department as being an independent constitutional authority whose clients are the American people, not the president or Congress.

“This may seem to some like a small point. But it’s important to me,” said Sen. Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican and chairman of the committee, who helped shepherd Ms. Yates’s nomination through the panel but said he was opposing Ms. Lynch.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont defended his record on Wednesday that includes opposing free trade agreements and taking on big banks, saying it will be up to voters to put his resume against that of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential nominating contest.

He said he likes and respects Mrs. Clinton, the party’s frontrunner for the presidential nomination, and that he’s running for working families and the middle class, “not against Hillary Clinton.”

“But I think people have got to look at the record — I have voted against every disastrous trade agreement coming down the pike and [am] helping to lead the effort against this Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will mean the outsourcing of all good-paying jobs to low-wage countries,” Mr. Sanders said on CNN’s “New Day.” “People have got to look at Secretary Clinton’s record.”

“Later today, I’m going to continue my effort to call for a breakup of the largest financial institutions on Wall Street who in my view, if they’re too big to fail, they’re too big to exist — they have simply too much power,” he continued.

Mr. Sanders also said he’s pushing for free college tuition at public colleges and universities and has been a leader on climate change, as well as a push for legislation that would have the wealthiest people and the largest corporations pay their “fair share” of taxes.

“Those are my views, and people are going to have to judge Secretary Clinton’s views,” he said.

“I think you have to look at my record,” he said. “There is in my lifetime, political life, no special interest that we have not taken on.”

“I think if you look, detail by detail, at my record, I think you find that there’s a very strong record [in] standing up for people who are kind of voiceless today, who have given up on the political process, who don’t have much power,” he said.

2545,2545,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/8/obama-free-community-college-everybodys-interest/,Right,"President Obama on Friday called on Congress to close tax loopholes for millionaires and billionaires and use the savings to offer all Americans a higher education, saying that two years of free community college is in “everybody’s interest.”

Speaking at Lake Area Technical Institute’s commencement ceremony in Watertown, South Dakota, the president said community colleges will play an increasingly vital role in the 21st-century economy. Mr. Obama has proposed two years of free community college for everyone, but his plan remains stalled on Capitol Hill.

“I didn’t come here to inspire you. I came here because you, the graduates, inspire me,” the president told the graduating class. “You’ve lived through some of the toughest economic times in your country’s history and you still chose to come here and invest in yourself because you still believe America is a place where you can make it if you try. … With a little hard work, something better is around the bend. And it is that promise that has always set this country apart.”

Mr. Obama has spoken at a number of graduation ceremonies during his time in office, including commencements at Notre Dame, Northwestern University, West Point, and others. He said he chose to visit the small South Dakota technical school this year to underscore his belief that every American deserves at least some higher education, whether it comes at a major university or a small community college.

“Our budgets should reflect that we care about you, and that means giving everybody in America the chance you’ve had here,” he said. “I want to lower the cost of community college to zero … We can’t afford to let striving Americans be priced out of the education they need to get ahead.”

Jeb Bush blasted the Obama administration on Saturday for limiting religious freedom. He added that “the Christian voice” isn’t heard enough in the world during his commencement speech at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.

The likely 2016 GOP candidate condemned President Obama during his commencement speech at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia for using “coercive federal power” to squash religious freedom and accused the administration of “demanding obedience in complete disregard of religious conscience,” The Associated Press reported.

“Somebody here is being small-minded and intolerant, and it sure isn’t the nuns, ministers, and laymen and women who ask only to live and practice their faith,” Mr. Bush said to an estimated 34,000 gathered for the graduation ceremony at the university’s football stadium.

“How strange, in our own time, to hear Christianity spoken as some sort of backward and oppressive force,” Mr. Bush said, AP reported. “Your generation is bringing the Christian voice to where it always is needed, and sometimes isn’t heard enough.”

Mr. Bush, a converted Catholic, will face tough competition in a crowd of GOP hopefuls that hold more sway with the Christian community.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz formally announced his candidacy at Liberty University last month and Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Baptist pastor, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry have all made their Christian faith a centerpiece of prospective campaigns.

2550,2550,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/13/house-democrats-mount-opposition-obama-trade-deal/,Right,"The White House tried to salvage President Obama’s free-trade deal on Capitol Hill Wednesday, even as House Democrats intensified their opposition to the measure and blamed Mr. Obama for mishandling the politics of his top second-term priority.

A day after Senate Democrats dealt an embarrassing setback to Mr. Obama on the trade legislation, key Democratic lawmakers vowed that the task ahead for the president will only become more difficult if the measure eventually reaches the House.

“If the administration thought it was tough going in the Senate, in the House it will be even harder,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, Connecticut Democrat and a leading opponent of giving the president special authority to negotiate the trade pact. “I believe they underestimated the depth of feeling.”

White House aides were in discussions with lawmakers to find “a path forward” to rescue the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sprawling agreement with 11 other Pacific-rim nations. The administration also was scrambling to reassure foreign governments from Japan to Canada that the failed test vote in the Senate Tuesday was not a fatal blow to the overall trade agreement.

But White House press secretary Josh Earnest acknowledged that the administration hasn’t yet found a solution to persuading U.S. lawmakers to grant trade-promotion authority to Mr. Obama.

“I don’t have one to announce now,” he said. “This is something that’s under a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill.”

Even as administration officials were trying to work through the policy differences with their own party, however, the White House also was grappling with renewed criticism about Mr. Obama bungling his personal outreach effort with an approach perceived by some as condescending and even sexist. Liberals from Sen. Sherrod Brown, Ohio Democrat, to NOW President Terry O’Neill said it was sexist for the president to refer to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat and a vocal opponent of the deal, as “Elizabeth.”

“I think it is sexist,” Ms. O’Neill told The Hill newspaper. “I think the president was trying to build up his own trustworthiness on this issue by convincing us that Senator Warren’s concerns are not to be taken seriously. But he did it in a sexist way.”

Mr. Brown later relented from his criticism, saying he would apologize to Mr. Obama.

Senate Democrats filibustered Tuesday to stop the first major free-trade deal vote in years, with the administration’s effort falling seven votes short of the 60 needed to proceed with debate. Only one Democrat, Sen. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, voted with the president on legislation to give Mr. Obama trade-promotion authority.

House Democrats said the White House miscalculated badly by rejecting lawmakers’ calls to include a provision in the TPP to address currency manipulation by other countries. Rep. David Scott, Georgia Democrat, called it “the Achilles heel” of the proposed agreement and said the administration’s refusal to address it was “asinine.”

Rep. Joe Courtney, Connecticut Democrat, said the administration has been downplaying lawmakers’ concerns for years about including an enforceable provision against currency manipulation in the TPP.

“A huge bipartisan collection of members have been sending up smoke signals for years, going back to 2013,” Mr. Courtney said. “To not have an agreement that has enforceable provisions on that issue, it’s almost political malpractice for members of Congress to just sort of look the other way. All of us would have preferred that the administration heeded the early input that all of us were giving on this issue and brought this to the table.”

The president has said that addressing currency manipulation could have an adverse impact on U.S. monetary policy, an argument that Mr. Courtney called “misleading rebuttal.”

Mrs. DeLauro said the administration has “rebuffed” lawmakers’ concerns about currency manipulation, food safety and enforceable labor standards for more than two years, and the problem is now coming back to haunt the president.

“The White House and the administration have only begun to engage in the last few months, really,” she told reporters. “We’ve been rebuffed. Now there is this frenetic sense of ‘let’s try to address those people who are still undecided.’”

Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican who supports the deal, has said the White House needs to provide about 50 votes from the 188 Democratic House lawmakers to help pass the measure. More than 150 House Democrats last year came out in opposition to the deal, and Mrs. DeLauro recited the names of a handful of other Democratic lawmakers who have recently announced their opposition, including Reps. Adam Schiff of California and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois.

The so-called “fast-track” authority allows a president to negotiate trade deals with other countries, then submit them for up-or-down votes in Congress without amendments. Analysts say that if Congress were allowed to amend deals, it would make it impossible to negotiate with foreign governments.

But the Senate test vote brought to light the breathtaking spectacle of Democratic lawmakers complaining that the president of their own party was trying to grab too much power.

“We have seen too much power ceded from Congress to the executive branch at the expense of the United States, particularly in foreign matters,” said Rep. David Scott, Georgia Democrat. “You can look at the Iran [nuclear] deal, look at a lot of things. Congress has to retain our place. This should be a shared trade deal, not just by the president himself.”

The simmering feud between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Warren, an icon of the progressive wing, showed no signs of abating. The White House also faced more second-guessing about Mr. Obama’s decision to promote the trade deal last week at the headquarters of Nike, a company that has used “sweatshop” labor overseas — a particular sore point with progressive groups.

Even as the White House was trying to patch up relations with Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Earnest tossed more criticism at Mrs. Warren by saying her claims that the pact is being negotiated in secret “are just not true.”

“If people do want to raise a substantive objection to pursuing this strategy, then they should stick to the facts,” Mr. Earnest said. We’re interested in a substantive debate. But we don’t have to say things that aren’t true in order to have this debate.”

Mr. Earnest defended the decision to visit Nike.

“This is the debate that we want to have, because this is the substance of the debate,” he said. “We are well aware that there are people in both parties that have raised concerns about Nike’s previous practices in terms of doing business overseas. The question right now is, ‘What are we going to do about it?’ And what we see from progressives is a lot of complaining about it.”

“As the president has made clear, these issues are not new,” White House aide Jerry Abramson said in an email to supporters. “What we are witnessing in cities across America is not only about policing. This is also about opportunity.”

Mr. Obama will take part in a discussion at Georgetown University, which is holding a three-day Catholic-Evangelical leadership summit on poverty after a call from Pope Francis to focus on the issue.

After rioting in Baltimore last month in reaction to the death of a black man who was fatally injured in police custody, Mr. Obama said tensions between minority communities and police departments have been simmering for decades in the U.S.

“This is a slow-rolling crisis,” Mr. Obama said at the time. “This has been going on for a long time. This is not new, and we shouldn’t pretend it’s new.”

Mr. Abramson, the White House director of intergovernmental affairs and former mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Mr. Obama will talk at the summit about the need to provide more opportunities for urban children.

“Unfortunately, in America, too many young people are limited by the ZIP code into which they are born,” Mr. Abramson said. “The president doesn’t treat this conversation as one to be had only every few months surrounding the latest tragedy captured on camera and replayed on the news.”

The White House said Mr. Obama has worked since his first day in office to address these issues by rebuilding the economy, protecting civil rights, expanding college access, providing tax credits to working families and targeting more money to high-poverty neighborhoods.

2598,2598,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/7/obama-merkel-agree-extend-punishment-putin/,Right,"President Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed Sunday to extend economic sanctions against Russia for its continued aggression in Ukraine, amid signs that the president was trying to repair relations with his German host.

The two leaders met in Bavaria before the annual summit of leaders from the Group of Seven industrialized nations. The White House said Mr. Obama and Mrs. Merkel agreed that sanctions “should be clearly linked to Russia’s full implementation” of a Ukrainian peace accord and Russian respect for its neighbor’s sovereignty.

European leaders will meet later this summer to decide whether to extend the penalties against Moscow and Russian-backed separatists, who have intensified fighting in the past week in eastern Ukraine. Mr. Obama said one of the priorities of the G-7 summit will be “standing up to Russian aggression in Ukraine.”

European Union President Donald Tusk said that because the Ukraine peace deal reached in February has not been fully implemented, the only question for the 28-nation EU is whether to make the sanctions against Russia even tougher.

“If anyone wants to start a debate about changing the sanctions regime, the discussion could only be about strengthening them,” said Mr. Tusk, a former Polish prime minister.

Before the president arrived for the summit, Speaker John A. Boehner called on Mr. Obama to increase the scale and power of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine. The House passed a bipartisan resolution in May in support of sending U.S. arms to the Ukrainian military.

“President Obama refuses to do the right thing,” Mr. Boehner said in a statement. “As a result, [Russian President] Vladimir Putin’s hostile acts have gone unchecked. Today, violence is increasing in eastern Ukraine and heavy weapons continue to move across the Russian border. … Words and photo ops will not beat back Russian aggression.”

But White House press secretary Josh Earnest said providing offensive arms “would only further escalate a situation that must be resolved diplomatically.”

“The president’s view has not changed about, at this point, not providing additional offensive military assistance to Ukraine,” Mr. Earnest said, who acknowledged that Moscow’s continued military provocations show that “Russia has essentially thumbed their nose” at the peace accord.

Mr. Earnest said the president and Mrs. Merkel agreed that it is important for the West “to show unity in confronting Russia over their destabilizing actions.”

Mr. Putin was kicked out of the group formerly known as the G-8 last year over his aggression in Ukraine. The U.S. and its European allies imposed several rounds of economic sanctions on Russia after it annexed the Crimean Peninsula.

As the summit opened, thousands of German police patrolled a security perimeter around an exclusive Bavarian hotel, and a few hundred protesters chanted anti-capitalist slogans.

Mr. Obama began his meetings with Mrs. Merkel Sunday with a public display of friendliness as he sought to smooth over lingering anger in Germany about revelations of extensive U.S. spying on its ally. The president praised the German chancellor as “my great friend and partner,” and extolled her leadership on various international issues.

Mrs. Merkel spoke of occasional “differences of opinion” between the two countries, but described the U.S. as an “essential partner.”

In the Bavarian town of Krun, Mr. Obama also hoisted a beer with his hosts and spoke admiringly of German culture.

“I have to admit I forgot to bring my lederhosen, I’ll have to see if I can buy some while I’m here,” he said.

One German newspaper said Mrs. Merkel’s photo-ops with Mr. Obama were a misleading “pretty picture” that didn’t dispel the public’s anti-U.S. feelings in the wake of revelations of National Security Agency surveillance of the German government. On Sunday, the first day for the two-day gathering, the leaders spent more than an hour discussing trade issues. The talks in the majestic Bavarian Alps coincided with the delicate debate in Washington over giving Obama the authority to move trade agreements through Congress more quickly, with big deal with Asia and the European Union now being negotiated.

Mr. Putin, in an interview with an Italian newspaper of the weekend, said he had not regrets about his Ukrainian policy, saying the crisis should be blamed on the actions of the government in Kiev and its backers in the West.

“The situation in Ukraine would have developed in an absolutely different way if the Americans and Europeans had stopped supporting those who resorted to unconstitutional actions,” he said. “So, I believe that this crisis was created deliberately and it is the result of our partner’s unprofessional actions.”

Republican Jeb Bush on Tuesday warned Vladimir Putin to back off in Ukraine and eastern Europe, vowing that if he is elected president, the United States will take a harder line on Russian aggression.

“Russia must respect the sovereignty of all of its neighbors. And who can doubt that Russia will do what it pleases if its aggression goes unanswered? Our alliance, our solidarity and our actions are essential if we want to preserve the fundamental principles of our international order… an order that free nations have sacrificed so much to build?” Bush said during a visit to Berlin.

The Russian president denies that he has sent troops into Ukraine in an attempt to stir discord, but satellite photos show otherwise. Bush said Putin, who is supporting separatists in their battle against pro-independence forces, must stop his effort to return Ukraine to the Russian fold.

“Who will say otherwise, as we watch the fate of Ukraine, slowly unfold in tragedy? Ukraine, a sovereign European nation, must be permitted to choose its own path,” Bush said.

Bush supports economic sanctions on Russia and has backed delivering at least some U.S. military equipment to Ukraine.

The speech follows the remarks by President Obama on Monday during his visit to the G-7 in Krun, Germany. Obama said he, too, supports continuing the sanctions on Russia and urged Putin to seek compromise.

Meanwhile, the Kremlin on Tuesday vowed to adhere to a Cold War-era nuclear treaty, and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia “has no intention to break the treaty.”

The U.S. has accused Russia of flight-testing a ground-launched cruise missile with a range prohibited by the treaty. Russia denied the claim and, in its turn, alleged that some elements of the U.S. missile defense shield violate the treaty, the AP reported.

Bush will meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday at the conference of the economic council of the Christian Democratic Union, the political party Merkel leads. Both are delivering speeches thee.

In other remarks, Bush said:

“In practice, so often human freedom comes down to economic freedom.”

“There will always be those who view opportunity as a privilege to be hoarded … who regard individual liberty as a threat to their own power.”

“In the democratic world, we understand that opportunity belongs to everyone. At a time when so many are still kept down – by poverty, tyranny, or both – we stand for the right to rise.”

“The EU and the United States have a common interest in the steady opening of markets across the world. What keeps that progress steady are standards and rules that are modern, transparent, and fair. And that doesn’t happen by itself.”

“That’s one reason why we need a serious plan to complete the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.”

“Seventy years after America and Western Europe began to build the post-war architecture of security, that alliance is as relevant as the day it was founded.”"
2604,2604,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/13/hillary-clinton-vows-shared-prosperity-campaign-ra/,Right,"Hillary Rodham Clinton rolled out a populist pitch and left-wing agenda Saturday, promising to restore a “shared prosperity” for all Americans in a speech at the first big rally of her Democratic run for president.

The former secretary of state stuck to themes of economic and political fairness, presenting herself as a champion of all Americans and decrying Republicans as beholden to the wealthy and corporations.

“Prosperity can’t be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers. Democracy can’t be just for billionaires and corporations,” Mrs. Clinton told a crowd of a couple thousands at a park on Roosevelt Island in New York City’s East River.

She said that working-class Americans had rebuilt the country’s economy after the Great Recession, working overtime and multiple jobs to pull themselves out of hard times — and now they deserved to share in the rewards of the economic rebound.

“Prosperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain, too. You brought our country back. Now it’s time, your time, to secure the gains and move ahead,” said Mrs. Clinton. “That is why I am running for president of the Untied States.”

“I’m running to make our economy work for you and every American,” she said.”For the successful and the struggling … for the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day, for the nurses who work the night shift, for the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us, for the veterans who served our country, for the small business owners who took a risk, for everyone who’s been knocked down but refused to be knocked out.”

The campaign billed the rally as a campaign kick off, though Mrs. Clinton announced her run two months ago. Since then she slowly unfurled her campaign with small events in early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.

All the while, she has carefully avoided taking position on most issues, safeguarding standing as her party’s all-but-inevitable presidential nominee who so far faces only token opposition from fellow Democrats.

The big rally in her adopted home state of New York, where she served as U.S. senator for eight years, was the first time she outlined an agenda, which attempted to satisfy the Democratic Party’s liberal base that remains skeptical because of her long record as a centrist.

She checked off many items wish list of the liberal activists, including a crack down on Wall Street and big corporations, fight climate change, provide universal pre-school and day care, mandate paid sick leave, equal pay for women and marriage rights for gay Americans.

Still, Mrs. Clinton has yet to offer detailed policy proposals. The campaign has promised to flesh out the agenda in coming days.

Mrs. Clinton use the venue, Franklin Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park, to underscore her commitment to the progressive movement and the vision of FDR, which she said had been carried forward by President Obama and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.

Mr. Clinton and the Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea Clinton, made their first appearance on the campaign trail at the rally.

“President Roosevelt called on all Americans to do his or her part, and every American answered,” said Mrs. Clinton. “He said there is no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous America: Equality of opportunity, jobs for those who can work, security for those who need it, the ending of special privilege for the few, the preservation of civil liberties for all, a wider and constantly rising standard of living.”

“That still sounds good to me,” she said.

Immediately after the rally, Mrs. Clinton embarked on a two-day swing across Iowa.

Mrs. Clinton took aim at her Republican rivals. She said they were offing the same “tickle-down” economic policies that she said caused the economic downturn and created massive income inequality.

“There may be some new voices in the Republican presidential choir but they are all singing the same old song, a song called ‘Yesterday,’” said said, paraphrasing a few lines from the song by the Beatles.

“You know the one: ‘All our troubles look as though they are here to stay and we need a place to hide away,’” she said. “They believe in yesterday. … These Republicans trip over themselves promised lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations, without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.”

She also blasted the GOP candidates for what she was their intention to deny climate change, cancel healthcare coverage for millions of Americans, revoke abortion rights, block gay marriages and deport “immigrants who work hard and pay taxes.”

Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore said it was Mrs. Clinton who was stuck in the past.

“Hillary Clinton’s announcement speech was chock full of hypocritical attacks, partisan rhetoric and ideas from the past that have led to a sluggish economy leaving too many Americans behind,” she said. “Next year, Americans will reject the failed policies of the past and elect a Republican president.”

The speech also drew fire form Mrs. Clinton’s Democratic rivals.

Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who is waging a long-shot challenge for the Democratic nomination, responded to Mrs. Clinton’s speech by saying America needs a new generation of leaders.

“Democrats, and in fact, our nation, will not make progress with status quo thinking. We need someone who can bring new leadership, strong progressive values, and a record of getting things done to the White House—and that person is Martin O’Malley,” said O’Malley campaign senior strategist Bill Hyers.

He noted that Mr. O’Malley has long fought to rein in reckless behavior on Wall Street, increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour, expand Social Security and give citizenship to illegal immigrants.

“In Maryland, Governor O’Malley enacted one of the most progressive agendas in the country, and that’s just what our country needs right now — someone who can get things done,” said Mr. Hyers.

2626,2626,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/19/medicare-now-focal-point-on-campaign-trail/,Right,"The Romney and Obama campaigns — both convinced that their man is more trustworthy with the future of Medicare — ramped up the debate this weekend, with operatives trading prickly barbs, the president dismissing Republican plans as “snake oil” and Paul Ryan bringing his 78-year-old mother into the fracas.

“This is the first election cycle I can remember for a long time that Democrats are on the defensive with Medicare,” Romney senior adviser Eric Fehrnstrom said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Hoping to turn what has long been a political strength for Democrats into a liability, presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans are trying to hammer home charges that Mr. Obama “raided” Medicare by $700 billion in order to pay for other parts of his health care overhaul.

Mr. Romney launched the strategy last week, and Mr. Ryan, joined by his mother, Betty Ryan Douglas, continued the line of attack at an appearance Saturday before a crowd of thousands of mostly senior citizens at the Villages, a sprawling retirement community near Orlando, Fla.

“When I think of Medicare, it’s not just a program, it’s not just a bunch of numbers, it’s what my mom relies on,” he said. “We want this debate. We need this debate, and we’re going to win this debate.”

The Obama campaign pushed back aggressively. During his swing through New Hampshire on Saturday, the president called the Romney-Ryan economic plan “trickle-down snake oil.”

“Congressman Ryan he put forward a plan that would allow Gov. Romney to pay less than 1 percent in taxes each year,” the president said. “Their ideas are pretty simple — they’re not hard to explain. They think if we do more tax cuts for the very wealthiest Americans, then somehow prosperity’s going to rain down on all of us.”

Team Obama also dispatched deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter to the Sunday talk-show circuit, where she defended the Medicare savings created by the Affordable Care Act by insisting that most of the cuts came from trimming wasteful overpayments to private insurers.

“It means they’re going to use taxpayer dollars to give overpayments to insurance companies,” Ms. Cutter said.

The Medicare program is always a sticky wicket for politicians, but it has become front and center in the presidential contest ever since Mr. Romney chose Mr. Ryan as his running mate.

“Medicare should not be used as a piggy bank for Obamacare,” Mr. Ryan said Saturday.

A congressman from Wisconsin, Mr. Ryan is known for putting together a budget that would cut Medicare and turn it into a premium support system that allows seniors to use vouchers to buy private insurance.

But now that he is paired up with Mr. Romney, the two are promising to return all of Mr. Obama’s Medicare cuts if elected. While light on the details, they say their plan would offer premium vouchers beginning in 2023 while preserving the option of traditional Medicare.

The Republicans emphasize that their plan wouldn’t go into effect until 2023 and would have no effect on benefits for Americans 55 and older.

“Our solution to preserve, protect and save Medicare does not affect your benefits,” Mr. Ryan said. “Let me repeat that. Our plan does not affect the benefits for people who are in or near retirement.”

The Obama campaign says the Affordable Care Act’s reductions to future Medicare spending are derived largely from cutting overpayments to private insurers who participate in the alternative Medicare Advantage program.

The Congressional Budget Office has said Mr. Obama’s cuts extend the life of the Medicare trust funds by eight years, giving the government until 2024 to figure out a long-term solution to the troubled program.

“Here is the bottom line: My plan saves money in Medicare by cracking down on fraud and waste and insurance company subsidies, and their plan makes seniors pay more so they can give another tax cut to millionaires and billionaires,” Mr. Obama told voters in New Hampshire.

“My plan has already extended the life of Medicare by nearly a decade. Their plan would put Medicare on track to be ended as we know it,” he said.

Mr. Obama was referring to Medicare vouchers, which Republicans have proposed as an alternative to traditional Medicare but which Democrats say could leave seniors paying larger portions of their health care costs.

The president said Republicans were trying to distract from their own plan by attacking his health care law.

“The truth is, I think they know it’s not a very popular idea. You can tell that because now they’re being dishonest about my plans, since they can’t sell their plans,” he said, prompting laughter from the audience. “I mean, they are trying to throw everything at the wall just to see what will stick.”

With Florida perhaps the most important swing state in the November election, both campaigns are working overtime to sell their respective visions for the program. Medicare presents an easy opportunity to prey on emotions, as the cost of health care remains a top concern among voters.

In a reversal of roles, Republicans are arguing against cutting federal spending after trying to block increased federal spending for the past few years.

“There are people out there right now, many of whom are probably watching this program, who are probably shopping for new private health care because their Medicare Advantage program is being cut by this president,” Mr. Fehrnstrom said.

Democrats also are taking the opposite tack, focusing on approaching Medicare insolvency — a tune often sung by Republicans.

“If they put that savings back into the system, it means Medicare will go bankrupt in just four years,” Ms. Cutter said.

2638,2638,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/26/terror-attack-french-gas-factory-leaves-1-decapita/,Right,"PARIS (AP) — France opened a terrorism investigation after an attack at a gas factory Friday left one person decapitated and multiple people wounded, officials said. One official said banners with Arabic writing were found near the body.

Two French officials said the attack began mid-morning when two men crashed a car into the entrance of a gas factory in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier in southeastern France, hitting gas canisters and touching off an explosion.

One of the attackers was arrested, they said. It was unclear what happened to the other attacker.

The decapitated body and banners with Arabic inscriptions were found near the factory entrance, one of the officials said.

Both officials spoke condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.

In a statement, France’s anti-terror prosecutor said an investigation was opened into the attack, which he said was carried out by “a terrorist group.”

France went on high alert after an attack in January that left 20 people dead in the Paris region, including the Islamic extremist attackers."
2657,2657,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/13/scott-walker-im-running-for-president/,Right,"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker announced Monday he is running for president in 2016, touting a combination of policy pursuits and electoral successes in his home state as a way to differentiate himself from a crowded Republican field.

“I’m running for president to fight and win for the American people,” he said in a video posted online Monday. “Without sacrificing our principles, we won three elections in four years in a blue state. We did it by leading. Now, we need to do the same thing for America.”

First elected in 2010, Mr. Walker, 47, survived a recall election in 2012 before winning again in 2014.

Mr. Walker, who has taken on public employee unions in Wisconsin, among other battles, also said that “we didn’t nibble around the edges,” but rather, “enacted big bold reforms” and “took power out of the hands of the big government special interests” and gave it to hardworking taxpayers.

In the Republican field, he said, “there are some who are good fighters. But they haven’t won those battles.”

“There are others who have won elections, but haven’t consistently taken on the big fights,” he said. “[We] showed you could do both.”

Mr. Walker is running at or near the top of early national public polling on the race for the 2016 GOP nomination, and has staked out early leads in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa.

“It’s not too late. We can make our country great again,” he said.

Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz responded to Mr. Walker’s announcement by saying he’s “already brought the worst of Washington to Wisconsin” and that he has “the wrong priorities for America.”

“To promote adherence to his rigid partisan views and to please the special interests that have backed his campaigns, Walker has pit the people of Wisconsin against each other in contentious ideological fights,” Ms. Wasserman Schultz said in a statement.

2663,2663,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/9/congress-pulls-bill-amid-confederate-flag-fight/,Right,"South Carolina will pull the Confederate battle flag down from a Statehouse memorial Friday, but the national debate over the flag showed no sign of waning as Democrats in Washington, sensing momentum, moved to furl state flags at the Capitol that still include Confederate symbols.

Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, signed a bill Thursday to remove the flag from the South Carolina Capitol grounds, saying it was a fitting tribute to the nine parishioners who were killed last month in a racially motivated shooting at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.

In Washington, Republicans were left in disarray after their congressional leaders had to scratch a planned vote in defense of flying the Confederate battle flag or selling flag-inspired memorabilia at National Park Service sites. They were concerned that voting to defend the flag at the same time South Carolina was overturning decades of tradition to pull it down would be an embarrassment.

“I do not want this to become some political football. It should not,” said House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican. “I want members on both sides of the aisle to sit down — let’s have a conversation to address what, frankly, has become a very thorny issue.”

Democrats brushed aside Mr. Boehner’s calls for a time-out and said the issue has been settled. They pointed to South Carolina, the first state to secede from the union ahead of the Civil War, as proof that times have changed.

“It’s long past the time to put away the Confederate battle flag,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat.

Seeking to continue the debate, she led a charge to take down state flags with Confederate emblems from the halls of the House, saying Congress should not lend its imprimatur to a “symbol of hatred, oppression and insurrection.”

She and fellow Democrats proposed a resolution that would remove all such flags except those flown in the offices of representatives from those states.

House Republicans turned back the effort in a near party-line vote and sent the proposal to a committee for further study.

Democrats, sensing a political opening, have begun petition drives and fundraising efforts for their campaign to remove the flag. They vowed not to be deterred by the parliamentary maneuvers.

Mr. Boehner is likely to be pressured to make good on his vow to sponsor a conversation on the role of the flag in the public space.

In South Carolina, where the debate has raged for decades, the Legislature gave bipartisan final approval early Thursday to a bill to remove the flag. Ms. Haley’s signature was the exclamation point that ended an extraordinary few weeks of debate since the shooting.

“Nine amazing people that forever changed South Carolina history,” Ms. Haley called the victims — parishioners who prayed for an hour with the accused gunman before they were killed.

In the days after the shooting, Dylann Roof was tied to racist statements, and pictures surfaced of him waving a Confederate battle flag, reigniting the debate over the emblem’s role in racial divisions in the 21st century.

Reversing their stand

A number of prominent South Carolina Republican lawmakers reversed their stance and distanced themselves from the flag, which flew atop the Statehouse before it was brought down and placed at the memorial on the Capitol grounds as part of a 2000 compromise.

The flag will be removed from that memorial at 10 a.m. Friday and put into a museum.

After Ms. Haley signed the bill, the NAACP canceled its 15-year boycott of South Carolina.

“Today is an extraordinary moment in the life of the nation,” NAACP President Cornell William Brooks said, though he added that the flag was a symbol of racism and bigotry that still exist and must be confronted in other ways.

It appeared Tuesday that Congress was moving to follow the lead of South Carolina. House lawmakers agreed to amendments to the Interior Department spending bill, which funds the National Park Service, that would have stopped the sale of merchandise with the Confederate flag “as a stand-alone feature” at concessions within the park system.

The House also approved amendments prohibiting the Park Service from displaying the flag except in specific circumstances for historical context. The Obama administration issued a similar policy late last month.

But Wednesday night, Rep. Ken Calvert, California Republican, moved to restore the previous Park Service policy. A vote was slated for Thursday afternoon.

With the prospect of that vote within minutes of Ms. Haley’s signature on a bill to remove the flag, Republican leaders backed off and Mr. Boehner called for a cooling-off period. He pulled the Interior Department spending bill from the schedule and said it would hold until lawmakers could have an “adult” conversation about how to address the flag controversy.

Confederate flags fly at a couple of national parks, and some graves in federal cemeteries are decorated with flags on Confederate Memorial Day. Concessionaires at some parks also sell memorabilia featuring flags.

In the wake of the Charleston shooting, Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis ordered gift shops and bookstores to stop selling three types of Confederate flags — the battle flag, the Stainless Banner and the Third National Confederate Flag — and asked concessionaires to voluntarily withdraw merchandise based solely on a Confederate flag.

Books, videos and other materials that show the flag in historical context may continue to be sold, Mr. Jarvis said. He said it’s up to each park superintendent to figure out which merchandise falls into which category.

2665,2665,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/14/iran-reaches-landmark-nuclear-deal-after-compromis/,Right,"The U.S. and other world powers struck a historic deal with Iran on Tuesday to curb Iranian nuclear programs in exchange for relief from crushing international sanctions, an agreement that sparked dancing in the streets of Tehran, alarm in Israel and vows of a showdown in Congress with President Obama.

After 18 days of intense and often fractious talks, negotiators in Vienna announced that they had reached an agreement designed to avert the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran and another U.S. military intervention in the Muslim world. The pact included late concessions by the Obama administration granting Tehran the right to object to international inspections of Iranian military sites and left unanswered questions about Iran’s past nuclear weapons activities.

Mr. Obama hailed the deal as a step toward a “more hopeful world,” and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said it marked “a new chapter” in his nation’s relations with the world. British Prime Minister David Cameron said it “will help to make our world a safer place.”

Israel said it would try to stop what it called a “historic surrender.”

In Congress, the announcement touched off objections from Republican lawmakers and some Democrats who said the deal doesn’t call for the dismantling of Iran’s nuclear facilities and doesn’t meet Mr. Obama’s stated goal of forcing Iran to submit to inspections “anytime, anywhere.”

Congress now has 60 days to review the agreement, and the president has said he would veto any effort to unravel the deal. Even some opponents of the agreement conceded that Republicans would be unlikely to muster enough votes to override a veto and stop the accord.

The agreement quickly became a test in the presidential race, with Republican candidates lining up against it and some, such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, calling on Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton to repudiate the deal. Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state under Mr. Obama, said as president she would be “absolutely devoted to assuring the agreement is followed.”

Critics pointed out that the negotiations failed to resolve the issue of three Americans who have become Iranian prisoners: Christian missionary Saeed Abedini, journalist Jason Rezaian of The Washington Post and former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said the U.S. “will continue to work for their safe and their swift return.”

In Tehran, young Iranians danced in streets and motorists honked their horns upon hearing news of the accord. Some people blew South African-style vuvuzela horns like those heard at the World Cup.

The accord marked a dramatic break from decades of animosity between the United States and Iran, countries that have called each other the “leading state sponsor of terrorism” and “the Great Satan.” Mr. Obama has been pushing for the agreement for years as the capstone of his diplomatic legacy, after he rallied international partners to keep economic sanctions in place to force Iran back to the negotiating table.

“This deal offers an opportunity to move in a new direction,” Mr. Obama said in an early-morning address at the White House that was carried live on Iranian state television. “We should seize it.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the agreement a “bad mistake of historic proportion” that will give Iran a “sure path to nuclear weapons.” He said pointedly that Israel isn’t bound by the deal.

“Wide-ranging concessions were made in all of the areas which should have prevented Iran from getting the ability to arm itself with a nuclear weapon,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “The desire to sign an agreement was stronger than everything else.”

Mr. Kerry, who led the U.S. negotiating team, called Mr. Netanyahu’s criticisms “way over the top.”

“Israel is safer” as a result of the accord, Mr. Kerry said on MSNBC. “This is under attack by people who really don’t know the terms of the agreement.”

Mr. Obama tried to assure Mr. Netanyahu in a phone call that the agreement is verifiable and “will remove the specter of a nuclear-armed Iran,” the White House said.

The negotiating has been a major source of tension between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu for years, building up to the Israeli’s address to Congress in March that wasn’t sanctioned by the White House.

Several Jewish-American groups came out Tuesday in opposition to the deal. The Simon Wiesenthal Center likened it to the Munich agreement in 1938 that made concessions to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.

Syrian President Bashar Assad, who has depended on Iran’s support while waging a brutal civil war, praised the agreement and suggested that the lifting of sanctions against Tehran would result in more aid for his regime.

“We are confident that the Islamic Republic of Iran will support, with greater drive, just causes of nations and work for peace and stability in the region and the world,” Mr. Assad said in a congratulatory message to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, published by state news agency SANA.

Saudi Arabia’s state news agency said the kingdom warned Iran not to use money resulting from the lifting of sanctions to incite turmoil in the region. The Saudi Press Agency said Tehran must use the funds in the service of the Iranian people.

Mr. Obama dismissed skeptics who argued that Iran will cheat. He said the deal all but eliminates the possibility that Tehran could rebuild a covert nuclear weapons program.

“Every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off,” Mr. Obama said. “This deal is not built on trust. It is built on verification.”

Ensuring Iran’s compliance will be a far-reaching job. The agreement calls for Tehran to reduce its number of uranium-enriching centrifuges from about 19,000 to 6,000, cut its stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent and convert its heavy-water plutonium reactor at Arak to use for research instead of bomb-making.

Iran currently has enough nuclear material to build at least 10 bombs, if it is enriched further to weapons grade.

The limits on centrifuges will be in place for 10 years, then gradually relaxed over the next three. Iran also commits to using only its current models, rather than more advanced centrifuges it hoped to install.

Iran committed to convert its Fordo enrichment site — dug deep into a mountainside and thought impervious to air attack — into a research center. The site will still house centrifuges, but they will make medical isotopes instead of enriched uranium. There will be less than one-tenth as many of these centrifuges as there originally were.

The agreement also calls for Tehran to give more access to its nuclear program to the U.N. nuclear agency. If that agency identifies a suspicious site, an arbitration panel with a Western majority will decide whether Iran must give inspectors access within 24 days. All sites, including military ones, may be inspected if the agency has solid evidence of undeclared nuclear activity.

Mr. Kerry said the deal “will bring insight and accountability into Iran’s nuclear program.”

“This is the good deal that we have sought,” Mr. Kerry said, adding that the agreement “also gives us the greatest assurance that we have had that Iran will not pursue a weapon covertly.”

Under the deal, all U.S. and European Union nuclear-related sanctions will be suspended — likely beginning in a few months — after inspectors have verified that Iran is adhering to its commitments. If Iran fails to fulfill its obligations, those sanctions could “snap back” into place, although critics say such an effort to rebuild international consensus to reimpose economic penalties is unlikely.

An arms embargo against Iran will stand for five years, and restrictions on Iran’s ballistic missile programs for eight years.

Mr. Obama said the failure to reach an agreement would lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. He asked Congress to “consider what happens in a world without the deal.”

“We give nothing up by testing whether or not this problem can be solved peacefully,” Mr. Obama said. “No deal means a greater chance of more war in the Middle East. No deal means no lasting constraints on Iran’s nuclear program. The world would not support an effort to permanently sanction Iran into submission.”

House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, was among the lawmakers speaking out against the agreement, calling it “unacceptable.”

“If, in fact, it’s as bad a deal as I think it is at this moment, we’ll do everything we can to stop it,” Mr. Boehner said.

Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who led 47 Republican senators in writing to Iran’s leaders to warn against a deal, called the agreement “a terrible, dangerous mistake.”

Supporters of the pact included Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, who said it “offers a verifiable, diplomatic resolution to one of our most pressing national security challenges.”

Mr. Obama said he welcomed “robust debate” by lawmakers over the deal, but he vowed to veto any effort to kill it.

“I will remind Congress that you don’t make deals like this with your friends,” Mr. Obama said. “I am confident that this deal will meet the national security interests of the United States and our allies. So I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal.”

The president cautioned lawmakers not to engage in a reckless escalation of rhetoric against Iran.

“We do not have to accept an inevitable spiral into conflict, and we certainly shouldn’t seek it,” Mr. Obama said. “Precisely because the stakes are so high, this is not the time for politics or posturing. Tough talk from Washington does not solve problems. Hard-nosed diplomacy, leadership that has united the world’s major powers, offers a more effective way to verify that Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon.”

2674,2674,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/19/donald-trump-says-he-doesnt-owe-an-apology-to-sen-/,Right,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Sunday he doesn’t owe Sen. John McCain an apology for saying over the weekend that the senator, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for six years, isn’t a true war hero.

In a phone interview on ABC’s “This Week,” Mr. Trump — who sits atop the Republican field in some polls — said his fellow candidates are blowing his comments out of proportion because they’re jealous or scared of his political power. He also strongly denied that he owes Mr. McCain an apology after making the comments at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa.

“No, not at all,” Mr. Trump said. “I got a standing ovation, the biggest ovation they had all weekend, by far. When I left the room, it was a total standing ovation. It was wonderful to see. Nobody was insulted. What happened is, later on the Republican candidates, some of whom are registering 1 percent and zero [in the polls], and they’re very upset I’m leading the polls by actually a nice margin, they’re very upset.”

Some of Mr. Trump’s fellow candidates have called for him to withdraw immediately from the race after his comments about Mr. McCain, a decorated Vietnam War veteran and the party’s 2008 presidential nominee.

At the summit, Mr. Trump downplayed Mr. McCain’s status as a war hero.

“He’s not a war hero. He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured. He’s a war hero because he was captured,” the real estate mogul said.

Mr. Trump later clarified that he does, in fact, consider Mr. McCain a war hero.

But the attempted backtracking wasn’t enough for other top Republican contenders. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Mr. Trump is “unfit” and should leave the race.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, on Mr. Trump’s heels in most polls, said “enough with the slanderous attacks” following the comments about Mr. McCain.

Other conservative leaders say Mr. Trump doesn’t belong in the race.

“Donald Trump is a clown … He needs to be out of the race,” Michael Needham, CEO of the group Heritage Action for America, said on “Fox News Sunday.”

In the face of such criticism, Mr. Trump has refused to back down. He said Mr. McCain failed the Republican Party by losing to President Obama in the 2008 election.

“I’m very disappointed. I understand John McCain. I’ve backed John McCain — raised, I think, $1 million for John McCain when he let us down. He ran for president and lost to Obama, let us down. I wasn’t thrilled with that,” Mr. Trump said. “But I will say what I want to say, and maybe that’s why I’m leading in the polls because people are tired of hearing politicians and pollsters telling the politicians exactly what to say.”

2676,2676,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/10/obama-skirts-supreme-court-birth-control-ruling/,Right,"The Obama administration on Friday tried to extinguish lingering concerns about Obamacare’s birth-control mandate, issuing final rules on how closely held corporations and religious nonprofits can opt out.

Health and Human Services Department officials said it rewrote its rules after the Hobby Lobby crafts chain and other devout business owners successfully challenged the mandate before the Supreme Court last year.

They also tried to mollify religious nonprofits who say their plans are used an conduits for sinful activity.

“Women across the country should have access to preventive services, including contraception,”HHS secretary Sylvia M. Burwell said. “At the same time, we recognize the deeply held views on these issues, and we are committed to securing women’s access to important preventive services at no additional cost under the Affordable Care Act, while respecting religious beliefs.”

The contraception mandate requires employers to cover 20 types of FDA-approved drugs and services as part of their health plans, including morning-after pills that Catholic groups and others equate with abortion.

In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court held that closely held corporations do not have to insure forms of birth control they object to on moral grounds.

They pointed to a 1993 religious-freedom law that says the government must find the least restrictive means possible to achieve its aims — in this case, providing cost-free birth control through employer-sponsored health plans.

HHS said Friday it relied on federal tax law to define a closely held corporation has one that is not publicly traded. It also said more than half of the company’s ownership should rest with five or fewer people, with all members of a single family being treated as an individual.

A company that meets this definition can opt out by adopting a resolution and then notifying either HHS or their insurer or third-party administrator of their formal objections. The third-party entity would make sure that female employees get their contraceptives, at no cost to the employer or employee.

The American Civil Liberties Union praised the effect of HHS’s announcement, while maintaining it shouldn’t have been necessary.

“Today’s guidance is a positive development for women denied access to important healthcare in the troubling aftermath of the Hobby Lobby ruling,” said Brigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney for the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project. “Invocations of religion shouldn’t be used as a smokescreen to allow employers to treat their female employees like second-class citizens. That’s why an accommodation was never necessary in the first place.”

The administration said it’s definition should cover all of the companies that challenged the mandate, but it faces longer odds among faith-based charities, hospitals and universities who want the type of blanket exemption that houses of worship enjoy.

HHS said Friday that religious nonprofits can opt out of the mandate by notifying HHS of their objections. Already, a nonprofit could have notified an insurer or third-party administrator that it doesn’t want any part in the coverage.

But nonprofits who’ve sued the administration have already rejected both options, and their backers showed no signs of backing off Friday.

“The government keeps digging the hole deeper,” said Adèle Auxier Keim, legal counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which pointed to several Supreme Court injunctions ordering lower courts to examine the nonprofits’ cases in line with the Hobby Lobby case.

Religious nonprofits say they are still complicit in providing drugs or services they object to, while the administration argues the nonprofits are like conscientious objectors at wartime who try to block the government from drafting someone else.

Nonprofits are now 0-5 in the federal circuit courts, depriving them of a coveted win that could force a showdown before the same Supreme Court that sided with family-owned corporations in “Hobby Lobby.”

Appellate judges have said that ruling is of little help to the nonprofits. At the time, the corporate objectors didn’t have the type of opt-out route that administration officials had extended to religious nonprofits.

2688,2688,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jun/20/white-house-defends-privilege-claim/,Right,"President Obama could be on shaky legal ground with his assertion of executive privilege in a congressional investigation that has been going on for a year, according to scholars who study the limits of presidential power.

Louis Fisher, a former specialist on the separation of powers at the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, said he found the administration’s arguments “extremely unpersuasive.”

Mr. Fisher noted that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., in a letter to the president, cited the need to protect the Justice Department’s “deliberative process” in responding to the congressional inquiry into a botched gun-running operation.

“Yet he admits throughout his letter to Obama that the department has regularly provided the House committee with documents” involved in drafting a particular letter to the committee on Feb. 4, 2011, Mr. Fisher said.

“He states that the department ‘has already shared with the Committee over 1,300 pages of documents concerning the drafting of the Feb. 4 letter,’ ” Mr. Fisher said. “In short, Holder was willing to release documents about that deliberative process.”

Mr. Fisher, who has testified before Congress and written a book about executive privilege, also said Mr. Holder repeatedly cites “the fundamentally false notion that when Congress wants information from the executive branch, it must be in furtherance of a ‘legitimate legislative responsibility.’ “

“The constitutional right of Congress to pursue oversight — is as legitimate as its legislative function,” Mr. Fisher said. “Oversight is also essential in investigating corruption and illegal activity in the executive branch.”

‘Not to be lightly invoked

Documents requested by House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell E. Issa, California Republican, in the “Fast and Furious” gun-running operation “should not qualify for executive privilege,” said Maureen Martin, senior fellow for legal affairs at the Heartland Institute, a conservative think-tank based in Chicago.

“The Supreme Court has held that executive privilege is ‘an extraordinary assertion of power not to be lightly invoked,’” she said in a statement. “It is intended to safeguard deliberations in the executive branch over what course of action to take. That was decided long ago as far as Fast and Furious is concerned.”

But Steven D. Schwinn, an associate professor of law at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago, said he believes Mr. Obama’s claim of privilege is valid.

“The committee appears to seek material relating to purely internal executive deliberations about how to respond to committee and press inquiries, and not to the substance of the program and other matters,” Mr. Schwinn said. “Largely for the reasons that the attorney general gives in his letter to the president, I think he’s right that this material is covered by executive privilege as against the committee’s request for it.”

The White House defended its assertion of executive privilege Wednesday, saying Mr. Obama has used the tactic only once, far less than his predecessors.

But scholars say what matters in court is the legal validity of presidential claims of privilege, not their frequency. The move also was awkward for a president who claims to be running for re-election as having the most transparent administration in history, and it opened up a new front in Mr. Obama’s ongoing feud with congressional Republicans.

Previous examples

A court decision from the administration of former President Bill Clinton is considered one of the most definitive on the subject of presidential privilege. The case involved then-Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who came under investigation by an independent counsel in 1994 over accusations of improper gifts. (He resigned and was indicted, but was acquitted.)

A grand jury subpoenaed a report that the White House counsel’s office had prepared for Mr. Clinton on the Espy case, and Mr. Clinton cited executive privilege in refusing to turn over some of the documents. A federal appeals court decision in 1997 made clear that such claims are limited to White House officials, according to the CRS.

“The court’s opinion carefully distinguishes between the ‘presidential communications privilege’ and the ‘deliberative process privilege,’” the CRS report stated. “Both, the court observed, are executive privileges designed to protect the confidentiality of executive branch decisionmaking. But the deliberative process privilege, that applies to executive branch officials generally, is a common law privilege which requires a lower threshold of need to be overcome, and ‘disappears altogether when there is any reason to believe government misconduct has occurred.’”

Mr. Holder and a top deputy defended the claim by saying the documents are not relevant to the original Fast and Furious operation, and that turning over such documents would have a chilling effect on the ability of a president’s top aides to give him advice confidentially.

A White House spokesman said Mr. Obama “has gone longer without asserting the privilege in a congressional dispute” than any other president in the past three decades. The White House said President George W. Bush asserted executive privilege six times, while President Bill Clinton did so 14 times.

Mr. Bush asserted executive privilege to block release of documents and testimony under oath by top White House aides, including White House counsel Harriet Miers, concerning the administration’s firing of nine federal prosecutors in 2006. Those aides later gave testimony in private, under a deal arranged by the Obama administration.

Obama’s past words

But the use of that privilege is one that Mr. Obama tried to exploit as a candidate for president. In 2007, then-Sen. Obama criticized Mr. Bush for trying to “hide” behind executive privilege in the case of the fired U.S. attorneys.

“There’s been a tendency, on the part of this administration, to try to hide behind executive privilege every time there’s something a little shaky that’s taking place,” Mr. Obama told CNN’s Larry King. “I think the administration would be best served by coming clean on this. There doesn’t seem to be any national security issues involved.”

He added, “There doesn’t seem to be any justification for not offfering up some clear plausible rationale for why these U.S. attorneys were targeted when by all assessments they were doing an outstanding job. I think the American people deserve to know what was going on there.”

A White House aide said the executive privilege claim was in response to a congressional investigation that is “all politics.”

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the committee’s ranking Democrat said claims of privilege should be used sparingly. But he said in this case, the administration was “forced into this position by the committee’s unreasonable insistence on pressing forward with contempt despite the attorney general’s good faith offer.”

Presidents typically cite executive privilege to protect aides within the White House under the reasoning that a president’s closest advisers should be able to give their advice freely in private.

White House involved?

But Mr. Obama’s assertion of executive privilege in the Justice Department’s “Fast and Furious” operation has critics questioning whether the president himself became involved in the internal discussions about the administration’s response to the probe.

“Until now, everyone believed that the decisions regarding ‘Fast and Furious’ were confined to the Department of Justice,” said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican.

“The White House decision to invoke executive privilege implies that White House officials were either involved in the ‘Fast and Furious’ operation or the cover-up that followed. The Administration has always insisted that wasn’t the case. Were they lying, or are they now bending the law to hide the truth?” Mr. Buck said.

It’s also an uncomfortable position for a president who hails his administration’s transparency, for example, in matters such as releasing White House visitor logs. As a candidate, Mr. Obama pledged to enforce “a new standard of openness.”

“We’re constantly trying to open up the process,” Mr. Obama said in January 2010.

When he was campaigning for the presidency in 2007, Mr. Obama promised to reserve the use of executive privilege for cases of national security or “traditionally sensitive matters.”

In 2004, Mr. Fisher noted, the George W. Bush administration initially refused to allow National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice to testify in public before the 9/11 Commission. White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales argued that the separation of powers were at stake, but he reversed himself and allowed Miss Rice to testify.

During Mr. Bush’s presidency, the Republican tried to greatly expand presidential powers, both to prevent disclosure of internal White House communications and to disregard portions of laws with which he didn’t agree.

Mr. Clinton claimed executive privilege to try to shield his wife, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, from questions about the Whitewater real estate scandal and the Monica Lewinsky affair. Courts rejected his claims in both cases.

A report in 2008 by CRS said the administrations of Presidents George H.W. Bush and Mr. Clinton took the position that executive privilege extended to recommendations made to senior officials and communications of senior policymakers throughout the executive branch, including within the White House or between the White House and any federal department or agency.

Speaking on “The Palin Update” show on Mama Grizzly Radio this week, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Palin is a “great person.”

Asked if he could see picking up the phone and “picking her brain” on some things or perhaps “having her along in some official capacity” if elected, Mr. Trump said, “I’d love that.”

“She really is somebody that knows what’s happening, and she’s a special person. She really is a special person,” he said. “And I think people know that, and she’s got a following that’s unbelievable. I still have people saying, ‘Oh, get Sarah’s support, get Sarah’s support’ no matter where I go. Everybody loves her.”

He said they also both have people who aren’t exactly fans of them.

“She’s an amazing woman … and she’s given great credit, but she should be given even more credit, because she is somebody that people respect and admire, and she speaks [for] so many people,” he said. “I don’t even think she knows how important she is, OK?

2724,2724,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/14/jeb-bush-im-reform-minded-governor-separate-washin/,Right,"Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush on Friday pitched himself as the most conservative governor in the history of Florida, saying his record of success is something people yearn for in a Washington, D.C., culture that has not yet “contaminated” him.

“I was the most conservative governor in the state’s history, but I had a reformer’s heart,” Mr. Bush said, speaking at the Des Moines Register political soapbox at the Iowa State Fair. “We cut taxes every year totaling $19 billion. We reduced the state government workforce by 13,000. In fact, you can fire someone for incompetence in state government in Florida — I’m sorry, that’s a really radical idea. And you can reward public [servants] that do a better job.”

Mr. Bush, the son and brother of two former U.S. presidents, has defended the foreign policy legacy of his brother, former President George W. Bush, in recent days. But he also been working to portray himself as someone whose political record was forged outside the divisive arena of the nation’s capital.

“Yeah, I haven’t been in Washington, D.C.,” Mr. Bush told reporters before his soapbox speech when asked if he is a “plausible outsider.” “I wouldn’t know how to drive — I could barely get from Dulles to Senator [Charles] Grassley’s office — I think I could probably get there with GPS.”

“I mean, I never lived there. … I’ve been a reform-minded governor. I’ll tell that story,” he said. “I’m blessed with a great family, but my record of success is something people yearn for in Washington, D.C.”

He took a shot at how President Obama has been selling the nuclear deal with Iran.

“This idea that a president tears down his opponents, demonizes ‘em, says that if you’re against the Iran deal, you’re part of the ‘death to America’ [or] you’re in cahoots with the ‘death to America’ crowd?” he said. “Give me a break. I mean, this is not how we’re going to solve our problems.”

“I haven’t been contaminated by that culture that always tries to demonize and divide. I’m from Florida. We solve problems there,” he said.

Mr. Bush was in a tie for seventh at 5 percent in a CNN/ORC survey on the Republican field in Iowa released earlier in the week. But the former governor, who has described himself as a “joyful tortoise,” said there’s a long way to go.

“Look, polls are irrelevant,” he told reporters. “During the … 10 days of the state fair, there will be people moving up and moving down — it’s always been that way. I’ll remind you that my dad in 1980 was probably [an asterisk] at this point, and last time around there were candidates that were winning at this point that never even made it to the starting line.”

“This is an all-in state — you got to organize, you got to get people to commit to attending the caucuses, recruiting others to go to the caucuses. … You gotta go campaign,” he said.

Asked whether he was “all in here,” Mr. Bush said, “Oh, yeah — I’m competitive. You gotta show respect for Iowans. They’re discerning voters, they want to hear what’s on your mind, and I do think leadership matters a lot. You see what’s going on in the world today. We need to re-engage and be the leader in the world [to] create a safer world for ourselves and for the rest of the world.”

2730,2730,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/2/joe-biden-2016-bid-becomes-viable-as-hillary-clint/,Right,"Stealing the thunder from the Republican Party’s first presidential debate this week is a flurry of speculation about a Democrat: Vice President Joseph R. Biden.

Chatter over whether Mr. Biden will challenge former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination has exploded as her stock continues to drop and Sen. Bernard Sanders’ insurgent campaign gains steam.

“It’s going to start sinking into Democrats that despite good speeches and despite lots of bravado, Hillary Clinton is a disaster,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “She’s a disaster because of corruption. She’s a disaster because of arrogance.”

While Mr. Biden has said nothing to indicate he’s running, behind the scenes the Biden camp has reportedly reached out to Democratic donors and sent out feelers in the media, prompting a renewed interest in the possibility of a bid.

Feeding the speculation was a Saturday op-ed by New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd saying that Mr. Biden’s son Beau, who died May 30 at age 46 from brain cancer, wanted his father to run so that the White House “would not revert to the Clintons.”

No less a political figure than Republican front-runner Donald Trump said Sunday that Mr. Biden’s odds of wresting the Democratic presidential nomination from Mrs. Clinton are on the upswing.

SEE ALSO: Donald Trump: Joe Biden would ‘do very well’ in presidential race against Hillary Clinton

“I think that Biden would have a good chance of beating her now,” the billionaire businessman said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “I don’t think he could have beaten her six months ago or even three months ago.”

Analysts have pointed to her dipping poll numbers as the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server during her State Department tenure grows. Meanwhile, Mr. Sanders continues to draw huge crowds, including more than 100,000 at last week’s nationwide simulcast “house party.”

“I think the email scandal is going to be a devastating blow for Hillary, if you have an honorable prosecutor,” Mr. Trump said.

Biden officials told The Associated Press that the vice president is expected to make a decision on whether to run as soon as early September. So far the Clinton campaign is taking the possibility of a Biden campaign in stride — at least publicly.

“We’ll let him make his decision,” Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said Sunday on CNN’s “Reliable Sources.”

“However hard it is to secure the Democratic nomination is however hard it is,” Ms. Palmieri said. “We have no illusions — we never thought that this was going to be easy. There’s a lot of views in the Democratic Party, and we’ll be prepared to handle whatever comes our way.”

Despite the criticism over her tenure at the State Department, which includes the terrorist attack in Benghazi that left four Americans dead, Mrs. Clinton remains a formidable foe, thanks to her prodigious fundraising and the vaunted Clinton political machine.

“In the coverage, it gets lost: She has the most money, and she’s beating every Republican in most of the polls. So you can’t really ask for much more than that,” Ms. Palmieri said.

Mr. Biden also has his weaknesses, starting with the Obama administration’s tepid approval ratings. He spent 36 years as the U.S. senator from Delaware, but his last six years as vice president have bound him inextricably to President Obama and his record in office, for better or worse.

In the event of a Clinton implosion, however, Mr. Biden is seen as more electable than any of the other Democratic contenders, including Mr. Sanders, a self-described socialist whose base lies with the party’s progressive wing and whose appeal to moderate voters may be limited.

Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour compared the primary fight in 2016 to that of 1968, when left-wing Sen. Eugene McCarthy did enough damage to incumbent President Lyndon Johnson to push him out of the race.

“I think if Hillary Clinton doesn’t win the nomination, she’s going to lose it to somebody like Joe Biden or John Kerry, as opposed to losing to Bernie Sanders,” said Mr. Barbour, the former Republican National Committee chairman, on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“It reminds me of 1968, when you had Senator McCarthy kick Johnson out. But it was [then-Vice President] Hubert Humphrey who got the nomination; and it would have been Robert Kennedy” barring his assassination, Mr. Barbour said.

On the other hand, Mr. Sanders argued Sunday that he is better positioned to win the Democratic nomination than either Mr. Biden or Mrs. Clinton, who are both viewed as members of the party establishment.

“I’ve known Joe Biden for many years, and I’m very fond of Joe,” Mr. Sanders said on ABC’s “This Week.”

“But I think the American people — who are seeing the middle class of this country disappearing, massive levels of income and wealth inequality, a campaign finance system which is literally corrupt now, owned by billionaires as a result of this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision — want to go beyond conventional establishment politics.”

“I think that’s what’s going on in this country, and I’m not sure that conventional politics will do it anymore,” Mr. Sanders said.

Both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns would have a huge jump on Mr. Biden in terms of infrastructure — they both have 11 campaign offices in Iowa already — but analysts Sunday said they believe he still has time.

“I don’t think it’s too late for him or Kerry or Elizabeth Warren, for that matter,” said Mr. Barbour.

Former Obama White House special adviser Van Jones added on CNN, “Listen, he’s a sitting vice president. He can wait until December if people want to. I think people have heard of him in Iowa. So I think he can wait if he wants to.”

A “Draft Biden” petition has collected more than 190,000 signatures, but Mr. Jones said that the push for a Biden candidacy probably has more to do with Mrs. Clinton’s vulnerabilities than the strengths of Mr. Biden, who already has run two unsuccessful campaigns for the Democratic presidential nod — in 1988 and 2008.

“I think this is more about the troubling signs from Hillary Clinton, possibly in October, imploding in front of a committee in Congress much more than it is a passion for Biden,” Mr. Jones said.

2734,2734,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/2/barbara-mikulski-back-obama-nuclear-deal-iran/,Right,"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats have rallied the 34 votes they need to keep the Iran nuclear deal alive in Congress, handing President Barack Obama a major foreign policy victory.

Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland became the crucial 34th vote Wednesday morning, declaring the agreement is the best way to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions.

Congress is to vote later this month on a resolution disapproving the deal, which is unanimously opposed by Republicans, who call it a dangerous giveaway to Iran.

Obama has vowed to veto the resolution if it passes. It would take 34 votes to uphold his veto, and Democrats now have those in hand.

The agreement — signed by Iran, the U.S. and five other world powers — seeks to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in relief from sanctions.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP’s earlier story is below.

President Barack Obama is just one Senate vote shy of being able to declare success on the Iran nuclear deal and cement a foreign policy legacy.

Senate support for the deal now stands at 33 votes, thanks to announcements Tuesday from Democrats Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Chris Coons of Delaware.

Once supporters reach 34 votes, they would be able to uphold Obama’s expected veto of GOP legislation aimed at blocking the Iran deal. That disapproval resolution is set for a vote later this month.

Secretary of State John Kerry is sending a letter to all members of Congress outlining U.S. security commitments to Israel and the Gulf Arab states in light of the nuclear deal. The letter comes as Kerry prepares to deliver a major policy speech Wednesday in Philadelphia that focuses on how the international agreement makes the U.S. and its allies safer and how the deal is being mischaracterized by some opponents.

“I really believe the fastest way to a genuine arms race in the Middle East is to not have this agreement,” Kerry said in a nationally broadcast interview Wednesday. “Because if you don’t have this agreement, Iran has already made clear what its direction is.”

With opposition to the agreement failing to get traction on the Democratic side, supporters may even be able to muster the 41 votes needed to block the resolution from passing in the first place, sparing Obama from having to use his veto pen. That would require eight of the 11 remaining undeclared senators to decide in favor of the deal.

“This agreement will substantially constrain the Iranian nuclear program for its duration, and compared with all realistic alternatives, it is the best option available to us at this time,” Casey said in a statement. In remarks at the University of Delaware, Coons said: “I will support this agreement despite its flaws because it is the better strategy for the United States to lead a coalesced global community in containing the spread of nuclear weapons.”

Republicans in Congress and running for president unanimously oppose the deal, which aims to curb Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. The Israeli government is vehemently against it, contending that concessions made to Iran could empower that country, which has sworn to destroy Israel. But critics have failed to use Congress’ summer recess to turn the tide against the agreement, despite a multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign funded by the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC.

Only two Democratic senators have come out against the deal — Chuck Schumer of New York and Robert Menendez of New Jersey — while in recent weeks undeclared Democratic senators, even from red states, have broken in favor one after another.

Even if Congress were able to pass the disapproval resolution, it can’t stop the deal, which was agreed to among Iran, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. In July, the U.N. Security Council unanimously endorsed the nuclear deal, approving a resolution that would lift the international sanctions on Iran in 90 days.

Interviewed on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program Wednesday, Kerry said that the absence of an agreement is what could lead to a nuclear arms race in the region. Putting the deal in place, he said, will keep other nations “from chasing a weapon on their own.”

Kerry also said that if the U.S. rejects the deal, it would confirm the fears of Iran’s leaders “that you can’t deal with the West, that you can’t trust the West.”"
2747,2747,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/11/rick-perry-drop-out-2016-gop-presidential-race/,Right,"Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is suspending his campaign to win the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, announcing the decision in a speech to the Eagle Forum in St. Louis on Friday afternoon.

Mr. Perry, who served 14 years as governor of Texas, had struggled to raise money and gain traction in a crowded and heavily experienced field.

He said God works in mysterious ways, but his political future had become clear to him.

“That is why today I am suspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States,” he said. “We have a tremendous field of candidates — probably the greatest group of men and women. I step aside knowing our party is in good hands, as long as we listen to the grassroots, listen to that cause of conservatism. If we do that, then our party will be in good hands.”

Suspending a campaign is, for all purposes, dropping out of the race. Candidates generally say they are suspending because of technical fundraising issues.

His decision comes less than a week before he was to join the rest of the field for the second debate of the primary season.

It’s also the second presidential campaign Mr. Perry has flamed out of, after his 2012 go-around was labeled one of the biggest campaign failures in modern political history.

This time around Mr. Perry had vowed to be more prepared, and to learn from his mistakes the last time, when he succeeded in fundraising, but failed to translate that into votes. He pulled out just ahead of the South Carolina primary in 2012, and a fellow governor, Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, eventually won the nomination.

Mr. Perry this time faced a crowded field full of current and former governors with extensive experience and fundraising abilities, and he never found a niche. Last week, reports began to surface that he had stopped paying staffers, and some of his team had fled to other political campaigns.

Michael Dennehy, a Perry supporter and strategist in New Hampshire, said it was “a shame” that he couldn’t keep going.

“I fully support his decision,” Mr. Dennehy said. “Campaigns are unpredictable but it is a shame that a man with the most successful executive experience and the one who can best relate to middle class America will not be on the ballot as we choose the Republican nominee. Fortunately we have a tremendous field of candidates and we will have a good nominee next year.”

Mr. Perry was relegated to the second tier in last month’s first presidential debate in Ohio, and was going to be in the second tier in next week’s debate at the Reagan Presidential Library.

Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, said that Mr. Perry struggled to rebound after being left out of the opening prime time debate.

“I knew that his demotion in Cleveland was punishing for him,” Mr. Schlapp said. “It was really a body blow. He put a good face on it because he has class, but that was brutal for him.”

Mr. Schlapp said the decision showed political maturity.

“I think he probably looked at the prospects of sitting at the ‘kids’ table’ again in California and probably thought, ‘This is not going where I thought [the campaign] was going to go,’” he said.

Mr. Perry remains under indictment in Texas on corruption charges after prosecutors said he tried to use the state budget to force a local prosecutor out of office.

His departure leaves just four candidates in that second-tier affair: Former Sen. Rick Santorum, former New York Gov. George Pataki, Sen. Lindsey Graham and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.

On the main stage are 11 candidates: Businessman Donald Trump, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, John Kasich of Ohio and Scott Walker of Wisconsin, former Govs. Jeb Bush of Florida and Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, and Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.

Mr. Perry said in his prepared remarks that he leaves the race “a blessed man.”

“As I approach the next chapter in life, I do so with the love of my life by my side, Anita Perry. We have our house in the country, we have two beautiful children and two adorable grandchildren, four dogs, and the best sunset from our front porch that you could ever imagine,” he said.

2749,2749,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/15/hungary-deploy-army-stop-migrants-border/,Right,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in two of its southeastern counties in response to the migration crisis, a move that paves the way to deploy the army to the border with Serbia to stop the flow of migrants that has been entering the country.

The state of emergency gives authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and limit the working of public institutions. It also speeds up court processes for asylum-seekers.

Technically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the military. However, Associated Press reporters at the border have already spotted heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs at the border in recent days.

The announcement on the state of emergency comes as tougher laws also came into effect on Tuesday aimed at preventing asylum-seekers from entering the country. The legislation makes it a crime to try to breach a razor-wire fence along the border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers.

Hungarian officials closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia Tuesday morning. The night before, officials deployed a boxcar covered with razor wire to close a key border crossing along a railroad track that had been the main entry point for migrants.

There were chaotic scenes at the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungarians opened a small temporary office to process people on the edge of no man’s land and crowds tried to squeeze inside. A first group of about 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.

A group of migrants also blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, saying they will refuse food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary. The sit-in protest is happening on the no man’s land between Roszke and Horgos, Serbia, which is the main border crossing between the two countries.

Those who were lucky enough to make it into Hungary the day before were boarding buses. One Hungarian police officer said they were being sent directly to Austria.

People had dashed to make it into the country in recent days, hoping to reach Western Europe before it was too late. A record 9,380 migrants entered Hungary on Monday, beating the previous record of 5,809 set just a day earlier.

Some 200,000 migrants have entered Hungary so far in 2015, nearly all by walking across the southern border with Serbia. Almost all, however, simply transit Hungary on their way to Germany or other Western European nations.

Under the new laws, most migrants entering the country from Serbia can be turned away because that country is considered safe and could theoretically provide them asylum.

The new law also makes it a crime to damage the 4-meter (13-foot) razor-wire fence that Hungary has built on the 110-mile (175-kilometer) border with Serbia, giving police the power to detain anyone trying to breach it.

The state of emergency allows the government to mobilize the army — pending parliamentary approval next week — to help police with border control, and forces courts to prioritize cases involving migrants caught entering Hungary illegally. Police can enter and search homes where migrants who entered Hungary illegally are believed to be hiding.

Germany’s interior minister, Thomas de Maiziere, on Tuesday said he supports the idea of cutting European Union funding to countries that refuse to share the burden of hosting refugees.

Several EU countries, particularly in the former Eastern bloc, have rejected calls from Germany and the EU’s executive Commission for mandatory quotas to spread refugees out among the 28-nation bloc.

De Maiziere told ZDF television that there needs to be discussion of how to exert pressure and that the countries rejecting quotas often receive significant amounts of EU funding.

He said that Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested — “and I find that right” — that “we should talk about (them) getting less money from the structural funds.”

(AP) — A gay couple emerged from a Kentucky county clerk’s office with a marriage license in hand Friday morning, embracing and crying as the defiant clerk who runs the office remained jailed for her refusal to issue the licenses because she opposed same-sex marriage.

William Smith Jr. and James Yates, a couple for nearly a decade, were the first to receive a marriage license Friday morning in Rowan County.

Deputy clerk Brian Mason issued the license, congratulating the couple and shaking their hands as he smiled. After they paid the license fee of $35.50, James Yates rushed across the steps of the courthouse to hug his mom as both cried.

“This means at least for this area that civil rights are civil rights and they are not subject to belief,” said Mr. Yates, who had been denied a license five times previously. He said he and Mr. Smith were optimistic they would get a license when they arrived, in part because the deputy clerk, Mr. Mason, had always been respectful when they came previously.

A crowd of supporters cheered outside as the couple left, while a street preacher rained down words of condemnation. Mr. Yates and Mr. Smith said they are trying to choose between two wedding dates and plan a small ceremony at the home of Yates’ parents.

Mat Staver and other attorneys with Liberty Counsel met with Ms. Davis Friday at the jail house in Grayson, KY.

“Five people on the Supreme Court imposed their will on 320 million Americans and unleashed a torrent of assaults against people of faith. Kim Davis is the first victim of this tragedy ,” Mr. Staver said, likening Ms. Davis to other historical figures who refused to violate their consciences and faith in the face of certain government-enforced laws.

He said Ms. Davis “is in good spirits … Her opening and closing comment was, All is well.’”

A rally called “I’m with Kim” is planned for Tuesday at the Carter County Detention Center. It is being organized by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a presidential candidate, said Liberty Counsel, which added that pastors have already been notifying organizers that they are sending buses of supporters to the rally .

In Rowan County Friday, marriage licenses were issued after all but one deputy clerks agreed to issue the licenses; the lone holdout was Ms. Davis’ son, Nathan Davis.

Her office was dark Friday morning as the license was issued to Mr. Yates and Mr. Smith, with a sheriff’s deputy standing guard in front of it.

“I just want the licenses given out. I don’t want her in jail. No one wanted her in jail,” Mr. Yates said.

During a hearing Thursday, U.S. District Judge David Bunning had offered to release Ms. Davis if she promised not to interfere with her employees issuing licenses, but she refused, citing her Christian beliefs.

Speaking to reporters Friday morning, Ms. Davis’ husband, Joe Davis, held a sign saying “Welcome to Sodom and Gomorrah” and said his wife was in good spirits after her first night in jail.

When asked if she would resign, he said, “Oh, God no. She’s not going to resign at all. It’s a matter of telling Bunning he ain’t the boss.”

Mr. Davis said he and his wife support her employees, whom he called “good people” and “good workers.” He said he ate with the other deputy clerks on Thursday at an Applebee’s restaurant and told them “I loved them and I was proud of them.”

Ms. Davis’ son supported his mother and was warned by the judge Thursday not to interfere with his fellow employees. The judge said he did not want “any shenanigans,” like the staff closing the office for computer upgrades as they did briefly last week.

“That would show a level of disrespect for the court’s order,” Judge Bunning said. He added: “I’m hoping that cooler heads will prevail.”

Ms. Davis’ son sat stoically as the judge questioned the clerks Thursday, some of whom were reluctant.

“I don’t really want to, but I will comply with the law,” deputy clerk Melissa Thompson said, weeping while she stood before the packed courtroom. “I’m a preacher’s daughter and this is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do in my life.”

“I don’t hate anybody,” she added. “None of us do.”

Judge Bunning indicated Ms. Davis would remain in jail at least a week, saying he would revisit his decision after the deputy clerks have had time to comply with his order.

Ms. Davis said she hopes the Legislature will change Kentucky laws to find some way for her to keep her job while following her conscience. But Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear again refused to call a special session of the legislature on Thursday. State lawmakers will not meet until January.

Ms. Davis, an Apostolic Christian, wept during her testimony in federal court Thursday, telling the judge she was “always a good person” but that she gave her heart to the Lord in 2011 and “promised to love Him with all my heart, mind and soul because I wanted to make heaven my home.”

“God’s moral law conflicts with my job duties,” Ms. Davis told the judge before she was taken away by a U.S. marshal. “You can’t be separated from something that’s in your heart and in your soul.”

2753,2753,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/11/donald-trump-ben-carson-set-pace-2016-gop-field-io/,Right,"Real estate mogul Donald Trump is leading the 2016 GOP field in the early state of Iowa, with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson 6 points behind and the rest of the field well back, according to a poll released Friday.

Mr. Trump was at 27 percent support, followed by Mr. Carson at 21 percent and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas at 9 percent, a Quinnipiac poll said.

“With five months until the balloting, anything can happen. But the field has become a two-tiered contest — Donald Trump and Ben Carson ahead, and everyone else far behind,” said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was at 6 percent, followed by former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida at 5 percent apiece.

A Quinnipiac survey taken in late June had Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in the lead at 18 percent, followed by Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson at 10 percent each. Mr. Walker was at 3 percent in the new poll, behind Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 4 percent apiece.

In line with some of the numbers from other polls, likely Republican caucus-goers said by a 79 percent to 15 percent margin that experience outside of Washington, D.C., is better for a president than Washington experience.

“The Iowa Republican Caucus looks like a two-man race in which the Washington experience that has traditionally been a major measuring stick that voters have used to choose candidates is now a big negative,” Mr. Brown said.

“Perhaps even more surprising, given the 17-member field of candidates vying for the Republican presidential nomination, is that more than half the votes in the Quinnipiac University poll of likely-GOP caucus-goers are going to three candidates who have never held political office — Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina,” Mr. Brown said.

Mr. Carson was the best-liked of the candidates with a 79 percent/6 percent favorable/unfavorable split. Ms. Fiorina had a 62 percent/8 percent split and Mr. Trump had a 60 percent/35 percent split.

Mr. Trump also topped the “no way” list at 25 percent, followed by Mr. Bush at 23 percent and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 14 percent.

Fifty-six percent said Mr. Trump is honest and trustworthy and 61 percent said he cares about their needs and problems. Eighty-three percent said he has strong leadership qualities, and 52 percent said he has the right temperament and personality to handle an international crisis.

Meanwhile, 88 percent said Mr. Carson is honest and trustworthy and 85 percent said he cares about their needs and problems. Seventy-six percent said he has strong leadership qualities and 72 percent said he has the right personality and temperament to handle an international crisis.

“Trump’s 27-21 percent lead over Carson obscures what appears to be the former surgeon’s stronger growth potential in recruiting new supporters when other candidates leave the race. Carson has a higher favorability rating than Trump and a higher score for honesty and empathy,” Mr. Brown said. “Trump has an edge on leadership, but Carson has a 20-point margin when it comes to having the right temperament and personality to handle an international crisis.”

The survey of 1,038 likely Iowa GOP Caucus participants was taken from from Aug. 27 to Sept. 8 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

2777,2777,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/1/oregon-shooting-obama-demands-action-guns-blames-w/,Right,"A visibly shaken and angry President Obama on Thursday attacked the American gun lobby, scolded the media and demanded that Congress take concrete action to stop the rash of recent mass shootings, which he said have “become routine” and are the pure result of inaction by lawmakers in Washington.

Speaking in the briefing room at the White House, the president — who offered his 15th statement in the wake of a mass shooting — said the federal government must explain to grieving families why it has virtually nothing to stop tragedies like the one seen on the campus of Oregon’s Umpqua Community College Thursday.

“This is a political choice we make — to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction,” Mr. Obama said.

A 20-year-old gunman killed at least 10 students and wounded 20 others on the Umpqua campus Thursday. His identity and motive have not been revealed.

In addition to blasting Congress, the president directed his anger at the gun lobby and the news media. He said he expects Second Amendment activists to again argue we need fewer gun laws, not more.

“We need more guns, they’ll argue, fewer gun safety laws. Does anybody really believe that?” he said. “There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country. They know that’s not true.”

On media coverage of mass shootings, Mr. Obama said news outlets should highlight that fewer Americans are killed by radical terrorists than by deranged gunmen in America.

“I would ask news organizations … tally up the number of Americans who have been killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade and the number of Americans who have been killed by gun violence and post those side by side,” he said.

2781,2781,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/7/fighting-erupts-central-syria-amid-russian-airstri/,Right,"BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian troops backed by Russian airstrikes battled insurgents in central Syria on Wednesday in the first major ground fighting since Moscow began launching air raids on militants last week, activists said.

The fighting comes as the Russian airstrikes appear to have emboldened Syrian troops to launch a ground offensive after suffering a string of setbacks in northwestern Syria over the past few months.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a government offensive began on four fronts early Wednesday in the northwestern provinces of Idlib and neighboring Hama. Observatory director Rami Abdurrahman said it is “the most intense fighting in months.”

Activist Ahmad al-Ahmad, who is currently in Idlib, said government troops are “heavily” shelling central areas after rebels attacked an army post and destroyed a tank.

The Observatory and al-Ahmad said the main launching point for government forces is the town of Morek on the highway that links the capital Damascus with the northern city of Aleppo, Syria’s largest city and former commercial center. Rebels have controlled areas on the highway since 2012.

The Local Coordination Committees, another activist group, said rebels were able to destroy two tanks and an armored personnel carrier in northern parts of Hama province near Idlib.

The Observatory said two helicopters believed to be Russian were seen flying at low altitude in Morek. It added that militants opened fire at the helicopters without striking them. It was not immediately clear if the pilots were Russian or Syrian.

The Islamic State group has no presence in the area that was attacked on Wednesday but al Qaida’s affiliate in Syria, the Nusra Front, is active in central and northern Syria, as are Western-backed rebels.

The latest developments come exactly a week after Russia began launching airstrikes in Syria.

Moscow has mainly targeted central and northwestern Syria, strategic regions that are the gateway to President Bashar Assad’s strongholds in Damascus, and along the Mediterranean coast.

Meanwhile, Syrian state TV quoted an unnamed Syrian military official as saying that Russian warplanes attacked Islamic State positions in the town of Al-Bab and the nearby town of Deir Hafer in the northern province of Aleppo."
2788,2788,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/4/asia-trade-deal-sought-by-president-obama-on-the-v/,Right,"A dozen Pacific-rim nations including the U.S. and Japan agreed early Monday to a massive free-trade pact that would cut trade barriers and set new labor and environmental standards, setting up a potentially contentious ratification vote before a skeptical Congress.

After a week of final talks in Atlanta, negotiators said they had reached an agreement on completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of President Obama’s main goals for his second term. The pact will cover commerce in nations representing 40 per cent of global economic output.

The agreement faces renewed scrutiny in Congress, as negotiators compromised on contentious provisions including tobacco companies and patents on U.S. pharmaceuticals.

Mr. Obama said lawmakers and the public will have months to “read every word” of the agreement before he signs it.

“If we can get this agreement to my desk, then we can help our businesses sell more Made in America goods and services around the world, and we can help more American workers compete and win,” the president said.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican who helped the White House secure passage of trade-promotion authority earlier this year, voiced new reservations about the deal after negotiators made it harder for tobacco companies to challenge anti-tobacco regulations in various nations.

“Serious concerns have been raised on a number of key issues,” Mr. McConnell said. “This deal demands intense scrutiny by Congress, and the legislation we passed earlier this year provides us the opportunity to give this agreement that scrutiny.”

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, reacted cautiously to news of the deal, saying that only “a good agreement” will be able to pass the House.

“I am reserving judgment until I am able to review the final text and consult with my colleagues and my constituents,” Mr. Ryan said in a statement. “In particular, I want to explore concerns surrounding the most recent aspects of the agreement. The administration must clearly explain the benefits of this agreement and what it will mean for American families.”

Rep. Louise Slaughter, New York Democrat and one of the most vocal opponents of the deal, said negotiators “will no longer be able to keep the TPP hidden from public view.”

“As Americans learn more in the coming weeks and months about how the agreement will impact their day-to-day lives — with things like unsafe food imports and restricted access to affordable medicines — I am confident that we will be able to build opposition to defeat this bad trade deal,” she said, adding that she’s been working with members of the Australian and Canadian parliaments who are concerned about provisions in the deal to allow companies to challenge domestic laws before “a panel of three unaccountable lawyers.”

The TPP also has become an issue in the 2016 presidential race, with Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton taking heat for trying to distance herself from a deal that she advocated as secretary of state. Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont independent who is challenging Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic nomination, said Monday the deal “will hurt consumers and cost American jobs.”

“Wall Street and other big corporations have won again,” Mr. Sanders said. “It is time for the rest of us to stop letting multinational corporations rig the system to pad their profits at our expense. In the Senate, I will do all that I can to defeat this agreement.”

Republican front-runner Donald Trump has called TPP “a disaster,” and many other GOP candidates have expressed opposition in varying degrees.

Mr. Obama has fought for the pact over the objection of Democrats and their labor allies, who say the deal will lead to the loss of more union jobs in the U.S. The president views the TPP as the centerpiece of his foreign-policy “pivot” to Asia and as a counterweight to China, which was not included in the agreement.

If implemented, it would be the largest trade deal the U.S. has negotiated since the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s.

Progressive groups signaled that they will push Congress to reject the agreement. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said the agreement “threatens our families, our communities and our environment.”

“The Trans-Pacific Partnership would empower big polluters to challenge climate and environmental safeguards in private trade courts and would expand trade in dangerous fossil fuels that would increase fracking and imperil our climate,” he said. “Congress must stand up for American jobs, clean air and water, and a healthy climate and environment by rejecting the Trans-Pacific Partnership.”

Business groups hailed the announcement of a final deal. The National Retail Federation said TPP will benefit merchants and consumers.

“International trade supports millions of jobs in the retail industry, and that number will only grow with passage of TPP,” said NRF Senior Vice President for Government Relations David French.

2791,2791,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/15/ben-carson-tops-republican-field-in-fundraising-do/,Right,"Ben Carson topped the rest of the Republican presidential field in fundraising for the third quarter, with Jeb Bush placing second — a critical showing for the former Florida governor whose White House bid has faltered in recent weeks.

Although billionaire front-runner Donald Trump is self-financing his campaign and does not actively seek donations, the real estate tycoon took in more cash unsolicited than did some of his rivals who need donations to keep their campaigns running.

(Corrected paragraph:) Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, meanwhile, reported the most cash on hand.

Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, said he raised $20.7 million from July 1 through Sept. 30, followed by Mr. Bush’s $13.4 million and Sen. Mr. Cruz’s $12.2 million haul, according to records filed Thursday with the Federal Election Commission.

Businesswoman Carly Fiorina raised about $7 million, Mr. Rubio raised $6 million, Ohio Gov. John Kasich collected $4.4 million and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie brought in $4.2 million. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky reported a $2.5 million haul as he fights to be included on the next debate’s main stage amid declining poll numbers.

“We’re in it for the long haul,” Mr. Paul insisted in an interview on CNN. “We have planned and we have organized in all 50 states. I wouldn’t waste two years of my life trying to put this message out if I did not plan on being there when they voted, so we plan on being there when they vote.”

His $2.5 million was a major drop from the $7 million he raised in the second quarter, which ran from April 1 to June 30, but Mr. Paul said he has seen a surge in October and is comfortable with the $2 million in cash he had on hand.

But that $2.5 million take is less than what Mr. Trump raised with neither effort nor need.

The Trump campaign raised $3.9 million in the third quarter, not only more than Mr. Paul but also almost as much as Mr. Christie and Mr. Kasich. Mr. Trump received 73,942 unsolicited donations with an average contribution of $50.46.

But the Trump campaign also spent $4 million from July 1 through Sept. 30, a higher figure than some of his peers, albeit much less than Mr. Carson. For example, Mr. Kasich spent $1.7 million in the quarter, Mrs. Fiorina spent $2.2 million and Mr. Christie said he spent $2.8 million — all less than Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump made a contribution of $100,779 to his campaign during the quarter, raising the amount he has personally spent since launching his campaign to $1,909,576.

But for the others, the third-quarter report is a key midpoint test as donors and activists try to gauge who has the funding to stick it out.

“We knew from the start this was going to be a hard fought and close race, but few could have anticipated just how volatile this field would be,” Mr. Bush’s campaign manager, Danny Diaz, wrote in a letter to donors.

“I — for one — would be less than forthcoming if I said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-style single-payer health care and partial-birth abortion would be leading the Republican Primary,” he wrote.

Mr. Diaz assured donors that Mr. Bush would be “better funded than any other in the entire field” and that their campaign has a “formidable grassroots organization in the early states.”

Although his fundraising intake was respectable, Mr. Bush ended with $10.3 million in cash on hand, which lagged several of his competitors: Sen. Ted Cruz, with $13.5 million; Mr. Carson, with $11.3 million; and Mr. Rubio, with $11 million.

Mr. Rubio, who draws from the same Florida base of donors as Mr. Bush, was quick to highlight the difference.

“Thanks to smart budgeting and fiscal discipline, Marco Rubio for president started October with more money in the bank than Jeb Bush for president and most other campaigns,” according to a statement by Mr. Rubio’s campaign — put out six minutes after Mr. Bush’s announcement. “Rubio’s FEC report details the lengths his campaign went to save money.”

It goes on to list buying office furniture from Craigslist, taking cheap Uber rides and flying discount airliners such as Sprint and Frontier.

Mr. Bush has been criticized for running a costly campaign, complete with chartered flights and expensive hotels.

Surprisingly, one of the most frugal campaigns is associated with a name synonymous with opulence and high-class trimmings: Donald Trump.

According to the FEC filing, the Trump campaign showed frugality in his expenses, with roughly $320 spent for McDonald’s from Iowa to New Hampshire to Virginia. Staffers also frequented Wendy’s and Dairy Queen.

Their overnight stays were at the Comfort Inn and Courtyard by Marriott.

By contrast, while Mr. Carson raised the largest amount, his campaign also burned through $14 million in the third quarter, spending money on lavish dinners at Johnny’s Half Shell, an upscale Washington seafood restaurant, and stays at the swanky Waldorf Hotel in New York.

“It is my great honor to be participating in this Presidential race, which has the possibility of having a truly great and positive impact on America,” Mr. Trump said in a statement releasing his numbers. “While our original budget was substantially higher than the amount spent, good business practices and even better ideas and policy have made it unnecessary to have spent a larger sum.

“To be number one in every poll, both state and national, and to have spent the least amount of dollars of any serious candidate is a testament to what I can do for America. This is what our country’s leaders should do for the United States — spend money wisely and win!” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Trump also financed all of his own events — large rallies that cost him thousands of dollars in setup and security, his filing shows.

He also recorded a $723,426 cost for Tag Air, a private jet and charter. Ironically, a man known to dominate the media paid $30,000 to Drake Ventures for communications consulting and shelled out $243 to Constant Contact for email marketing.

At the lower end, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has been fighting to be heard this election cycle, being put at the so-called “kiddie table” in the past two debates. He is betting that the $260,000 he has left in his coffers will take him to the finish line.

Mr. Jindal raised $579,000 in the third quarter but spent $832,000, according to the latest FEC records. It was the smallest haul of all of the candidates, but his lean campaign had to spend the largest amount on payroll, at about $300,000.

While Mr. Jindal has been polling at or about 1 percent nationally, his numbers have picked up in Iowa, which holds the first nominating contest. Mr. Jindal has vowed to stay in the race and is betting on winning Iowa in order to do so.

“This is an election not an auction. We are running a lean mean campaign,” Shannon Dirmann, a spokeswoman for the campaign, said in an email. “We are tied for 5th right now in Iowa and plan to win it on February 1st.”

Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor who bowed out of the Republican presidential contest last month, ended the quarter with almost four times as much money as Mr. Jindal, having $985,213.43 cash on hand, according to his FEC release. Mr. Walker concluded the quarter with $161,133.45 in debt but indicated that it would be paid and donations returned.

The biggest driver of Mr. Walker’s campaign debt was staff salaries, which came in at about $2 million. Communications director Kirsten Kukowski, campaign manager Rick Wiley and director of operations Matt Hall each made an annual salary of more than $200,000. Mr. Hall’s company, Harbinger LLC, also was paid $143,425 in August and September.

Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who dropped out of the race in early September, had $44,553.59 cash on hand at the end of the third quarter and had begun paying back his donors. Mr. Perry has no outstanding debts to pay.

2794,2794,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/18/hillary-clinton-blasts-benghazi-panel-as-partisan-/,Right,"Hillary Rodham Clinton expects to encounter a partisan witch hunt this week when she testifies before a House panel investigating the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks, but the committee’s leader is downplaying Mrs. Clinton’s upcoming appearance and casting her as just another witness.

Ahead of Thursday’s highly anticipated session, Mrs. Clinton and Republican leaders on the House Select Committee on Benghazi painted very different pictures Sunday of the panel’s intentions and motives.

Committee chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican, said he simply wants to find the truth behind the 2012 terrorist attacks on a U.S. diplomatic compound and CIA annex in Libya that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

But Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic Party’s presidential front-runner, said Mr. Gowdy’s panel simply wants to destroy her political career. The panel last week spent five hours behind closed doors questioning Mrs. Clinton’s top aide, Huma Abedin, a prequel to this week’s appearance by the former secretary of state.

“I really don’t know what to expect,” Mrs. Clinton said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “I think it is pretty clear [that] whatever they might have thought they were doing, they ended up becoming a partisan arm of the Republican National Committee with an overwhelming focus on, as they admitted, [to] drive down my poll numbers. I’ve already testified about Benghazi … I don’t know that I have very much to add.”

Mrs. Clinton was referencing comments by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other Republicans, who have suggested the Benghazi committee is designed to drive down her poll numbers and raise more questions about her use of a private email account while secretary of state.

Mr. Gowdy has vehemently denied that characterization and insisted Sunday that Mrs. Clinton will be treated fairly.

“She’s a witness. She was the secretary of state, you have to talk to her. But we’ve already talked to 50 people not named Clinton. We’re going to talk to another couple of dozen not named Clinton,” he said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “So I understand there’s more attention associated with her. But, from my perspective, I’m much more interested in Chris Stevens’ emails than her emails, which we just received.”

Mr. Gowdy said the panel now is examining Stevens’ emails to and those from other State Department officials, in which he made clear the U.S. compound in Libya needed additional security.

As for Mr. McCarthy’s comments and the words of other Republicans hinting the committee wants to sabotage the Clinton presidential campaign, Mr. Gowdy fired back, saying they “don’t have any idea what they’re talking about.”

Meanwhile, Ms. Abedin’s testimony focused entirely on Benghazi, lawmakers said after the meeting.

Her close working and personal relationship with Mrs. Clinton has made her a key figure in the ongoing email scandal, including recent revelations that she apparently had access to her boss’ account at the State Department. Mrs. Clinton exclusively used a private email server to conduct State Department business during her tenure as secretary.

Ms. Abedin also has come under scrutiny for pocketing a $33,000 payout from the State Department for unused leave and using her simultaneous employment inside and outside of government to cater to the Clintons’ friends and associates.

Mrs. Abedin remained tight-lipped, brushing past reporters during occasional breaks from the interview last week.

Top House Democrats say the focus on Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Abedin and others in the Clinton circle has been a mistake, and they believe Thursday’s testimony will be another unfortunate episode in Republicans’ flawed investigation.

“I think it’s a sad day for all of us,” Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Benghazi committee, told CBS News on Sunday. “We made a commitment to the families [of the Benghazi victims]. The families came in with tears in their eyes, literally, and said, ‘Please do not make this a political football.’ That’s exactly what’s happened.”

2802,2802,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/22/clinton-benghazi-hearing-gowdy-dead-deserve-truth/,Right,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton brushed aside emails Thursday that showed she privately told family and world leaders that the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi was a terrorist assault, and said Ambassador Christopher Stevens was responsible for his own decisions regarding skimpy security ahead of his death.

Testifying to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, a composed and controlled Mrs. Clinton said she was involved in the big decisions of deploying Stevens to Libya and pressing President Obama to lead the war effort that ousted Moammar Gadhafi. But she deflected responsibility for much of what went wrong, saying the ambassador’s requests for more protection, which were denied, were handled at levels beneath her.

Mrs. Clinton also revealed that she gave orders for her lawyer and aides to go through her emails, but she did not “look over their shoulder” and didn’t know exactly how they decided which emails were work-related business. And she declined to agree to release any emails recovered from her server.

In a hearing that lasted more than eight hours, Mrs. Clinton escaped without the kind of major gaffe that plagued her 2013 appearance before the Senate.

But she seemed unsure of whether she spoke with Stevens in the months between swearing him in as ambassador and the attack, in which he died of smoke inhalation.

And she stumbled over her relationship with family confidant Sidney Blumenthal, who repeatedly sent her messages about Benghazi at her special email account, and she struggled to explain her department’s public stance blaming the anti-Islam video with what her own staffers — and she herself — were saying in the immediate aftermath of the attack, which left Stevens and three other Americans dead.

Mrs. Clinton said her statement, issued the night of Sept. 11, that appeared to attribute the violence to “inflammatory material posted on the Internet,” was actually meant to be a warning to others not to blame the video — something that came to pass anyway.

Republicans were incredulous at that explanation, saying her official statement was belied by an email she sent to her daughter and a phone call she made to the Egyptian prime minister, where she said the attack was perpetrated by al Qaeda.

“State Department experts knew the truth. You knew the truth. But that’s not what the American people got. And again, the American people want to know why,” Rep. Jim Jordan told Mrs. Clinton in a heated exchange.

Mrs. Clinton rejected the line of questioning, saying the intelligence community itself was conflicted.

“I believe to this day the video played a role,” the former secretary said.

A short distance away from Mrs. Clinton’s marathon appearance, FBI Director James B. Comey fielded a question from the House Judiciary Committee about his agency’s criminal investigation into her use of a server she kept at her home in New York, including classified government business. He made clear the case is a top priority.

“As you also know about the FBI, we don’t talk about our investigations while we do them. This is one I’m following very closely and get briefed on regularly,” he said.

Mrs. Clinton defended her handling of the emails, repeating again that none of the emails was marked classified at the time she sent or received them. And she defended the way she decided which emails to return to the government, saying she tasked her lawyers and aides, rather than doing it herself.

“I thought that was the appropriate way to proceed,” she said.

Mrs. Clinton, the front-runner for Democrats’ presidential nomination, kicked off her testimony with remarks that tended toward campaign policy speech, saying she led a State Department committed to a forward-leaning posture.

“Retreat from the world is not an option,” she said.

As she gave her testimony, Mrs. Clinton was surrounded by some of her closest longtime aides who served under her at the State Department and now hold key posts in the Clinton campaign.

Reserved seats in the row immediately behind the witness desk were filled by Huma Abedin, who was Mrs. Clinton’s personal assistant at the department and now serves as national vice chair of the campaign; Jake Sullivan, who went from being a director of policy planning at the State Department to being the campaign’s top foreign policy advisor; and Nick Merrill, who went from a communications official at the State Department to a campaign spokesman.

Democrats on the Benghazi committee repeatedly sprang to Mrs. Clinton’s defense, questioning the very existence of the probe — an inquiry they have threatened to quit.

“We have learned nothing substantively new about what happened in Benghazi,” said Rep. Adam Smith, Washington Democrat. “This committee in all that time and effort has unearthed nothing. Instead, they want to prosecute you and rip apart your every word, your every e-mail.”

Later in the hearing he said the GOP was asking “vicious” questions in an attempt to wear Mrs. Clinton down — drawing a chuckle from the former secretary.

Republicans said Democrats never intended to pursue the inquiry, and have tried to thwart the investigation at every turn. The GOP lawmakers said previous investigations by the State Department and other congressional committees didn’t go far enough, for example failing to discover Mrs. Clinton’s tens of thousands of emails, which she shielded from public disclosure by taking them with her when she left office.

Under questioning by Rep. Susan Brooks, Indiana Republican, Mrs. Clinton said believed she spoke with Stevens at some point after she swore him in as ambassador, though she couldn’t remember when or what they talked about. Republicans said there was no record of any communication.

But Mrs. Clinton said the lack of better security in Benghazi at the time of the attack was the responsibility of Stevens himself and the security professionals she trusted to advise her, and who rejected some of the ambassador’s requests.

“Chris Stevens had an opportunity to reach me directly any time he thought there was something of importance,” the former secretary said.

Republicans said it appeared Mrs. Clinton lost interest in Libya after the 2011 U.S.-led effort to oust Benghazi. Rep. Susan Brooks, Indiana Republican, laid a massive stack of Libya-related emails on the dais that she said were from 2011, then placed beside them a skimpy stack from 2012, saying the lack of attention showed.

Mrs. Clinton countered that she didn’t do much of her business by email.

As the hearing extended beyond eight hours, Mrs. Clinton stood her ground and kept her cool against increasingly aggressive questioning.

Rep. Peter Roskam, Illinois Republican, said she was shifting blame for what happened, and asked her if she was responsible for the deaths of Stevens and the other Americans.

“Of course I would not say that,” Mrs. Clinton said firmly, “and I think it is a disservice for you to make that comment. … It is a disservice to people who are charged with making difficult security decisions.”

Facing questions about her own actions the night of the attack, Mrs. Clinton said she did not call Defense Secretary Leon Panetta or Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey, saying there was no reason because they were already doing what they needed to do to try to support the Americans on the ground.

Mrs. Clinton’s relationship with Sidney Blumenthal, a controversial figure she characterized as an old friend, also took center stage. She revised her earlier statement that she never solicited information from him, correcting herself to say that she didn’t initiate the first inquiries but listening as investigation Chairman Trey Gowdy read emails she wrote asking for Mr. Blumenthal’s advice and opinions.

Mrs. Clinton said she didn’t vet Mr. Blumenthal’s sources, but struggled to explain why she then deleted him as the origin of emails she forwarded on to others.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the probe, said that line of questioning was a disservice to the families of the Americans who died.

“I mean, if you’re a family member, and you’re sitting out there waiting for answers to your questions, you’re going to have to wonder why it is that the first questions that come forth are about somebody who knows nothing about Benghazi, has never been to Libya,” Mr. Cummings said.

2814,2814,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/1/john-barrasso-beginning-of-the-end-of-obamacare/,Right,"OPINION:

Obamacare’s third year of open enrollment began on Sunday. People hoping to sign up saw a website with fresh photos and high-tech features. They found the actual insurance of the president’s signature law has gotten even worse.

Unless something dramatic happens, this may be the year of the health care law’s collapse. Prices keep rising and service keeps fading. It should not surprise the administration that people are not signing up.

Despite all the Obama administration has done to completely upend health care in this country, there are still more than 30 million uninsured people in America today. The reason they’re not buying Obamacare isn’t because they haven’t heard enough about it. They’re not buying because it’s a bad deal for them.

As people log on to the government exchanges this year, they will see the telltale signs of Obamacare’s impending failure. These include: costs soaring, cancellations mounting, and choices disappearing.

The first thing most people will notice is the higher price tag. Premiums are jumping by double digits in many states. In Alaska, premiums will be nearly 40 percent higher next year. People buying insurance on the Minnesota exchange will pay anywhere from 14 to 49 percent more.

Premiums are just one part of the high-cost story. Many plans are raising deductibles, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket costs.

Remember when President Obama’s mantra was “If you like your health care plan, you can keep it?” Now the administration is singing a different tune: “If you have an Obamacare plan, you better shop around.”

That’s about the only advice Washington has for people who want to avoid brutal rate increases. If you’re willing to switch insurance plans each year, your rates may go up by slightly less.

For some people, their old plan won’t be available at any price. This includes more than a half-million people insured by one of the health co-ops that have shut down in 11 states over the past few months.

It also includes people whose insurer decided it simply couldn’t afford to sell Obamacare coverage anymore. That’s what happened in my home state, Wyoming, where the company WINHealth is dropping out of the exchange entirely.

In some states, plans are changing dramatically even if the company remains. A patient may find that her longtime doctor will no longer be a part of her plan’s network. Maybe the hospital nearest to her home is no longer included by her insurance. These kinds of changes can leave people with very different coverage than they had before.

As people work their way around the website, they may notice that the remaining options are slimmer than ever. Analysts at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation say that more of the choices will be HMOs this time around. That can mean narrower networks and no out-of-network coverage.

In some states, the number of options is practically non-existent. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, people living in 14 of Nevada’s 16 counties will have only one or two companies to pick from. In Wyoming, with the failure of WINHealth, residents will have only one option.

Insurance through Obamacare is largely coming down to a simple choice of take it or leave it. More and more Americans are leaving it.

The only people who are consistently signing up are the ones who get subsidies from Washington. For them, the website should come with a warning label reading: “Buyer beware.” According to the IRS, 90 percent of people who received government insurance subsidies last year got the wrong amount.

To avoid an all-out panic over low enrollment, the administration is trying to lower expectations. It’s lowered the bar for success to around 10 million people enrolled for 2016. That’s half of the 21 million people the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says should be covered next year. It’s also essentially flat compared to the 9.9 million who were enrolled in June.

The administration is playing the lowered expectations game because they know how hard it is to convince more Americans to buy government-mandated insurance that costs so much. For so many people, Obamacare doesn’t have much to offer.

Even the $695 tax penalty isn’t enough incentive to coerce people to buy. People facing premium increases along with a $5,000 deductible see little reason to pay for insurance they may not want, need, or be able to afford.

Obamacare is failing because too many people want nothing to do with it. As the costs continue to rise, more people get cancellation notices, and the exchanges offer fewer choices, the collapse will only continue. We may look back at this past Sunday as the beginning of the end.

2829,2829,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/19/abdelhamid-abaaoud-mastermind-paris-attacks-confir/,Right,"PARIS (AP) — The Belgian extremist suspected of masterminding the deadly attacks in Paris died a day ago along with his female cousin in a police raid on a suburban apartment building, French officials said Thursday, adding it was still not clear exactly how he died.

The body of Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 27, was found in the building targeted Wednesday in the chaotic, bloody raid in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis and was identified based on skin samples, the Paris prosecutor’s office said Thursday.

Abaaoud ended up near Paris after reportedly being in Syria but officials have not said how he managed to travel across so many borders en route to the French capital. In addition, authorities have not detailed his exact whereabouts or actions during the deadly rampage that killed 129 people last week in Paris.

Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said France did not know before last week’s deadly attacks that Abaaoud was in Europe, but said he was believed to be behind four of six attacks thwarted since spring by French authorities.

Three police officials have told The Associated Press that a woman who died in the police raid was Abaaoud’s cousin. One said the woman, Hasna Aitboulahcen, is believed to have detonated a suicide vest Wednesday in the building after a brief conversation with police officers.

The official confirmed an audio recording, punctuated by gunshots, in which an officer asks: “Where is your boyfriend?” and she responds angrily: “He’s not my boyfriend!” Then loud bangs are heard.

The bodies recovered in the raid were badly mangled, with part of Aitboulahcen’s spine landing on a police car, slowing down the identification process, according to one of the officials.

The three all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to divulge details of the investigation.

French police launched the operation after receiving information from tapped phone calls, surveillance and tipoffs suggesting that Abaaoud was holed up in the apartment. Eight people were arrested in the raid.

In Belgium, authorities launched six raids in the Brussels region Thursday linked to Bilal Hadfi, one of the three suicide bombers who blew themselves up outside the Stade de France.

An official in the Belgian federal prosecutor’s office told The Associated Press the raids were taking place in the suburb of Molenbeek and other areas of Brussels. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing, said the actions were focusing on Hadfi’s “entourage.”

With France still reeling from the Nov. 13 attacks that killed 129 and wounded hundreds, France’s lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, voted Thursday to extend a state of emergency for three months. The measure now goes to the Senate, where it likely will be approved.

The state of emergency expands police powers to carry out arrests and searches, and allows authorities to forbid the movement of people and vehicles at specific times and places.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls had pressed for the state of emergency extension, warning that Islamic extremists might at use chemical or biological weapons.

“Terrorism hit France not because of what it is doing in Iraq and Syria … but for what it is,” Valls told lawmakers. “We know that there could also be a risk of chemical or biological weapons.”

Valls did not say there was a specific threat against France involving such weapons, however.

Elsewhere in Europe, jittery leaders and law enforcement moved to protect their citizens as Rob Wainwright, director of the European Union’s police coordination agency Europol, warned of “a very serious escalation” of the terror threat in Europe.

—In Italy, Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said law enforcement was searching for five people flagged by the FBI in response to a U.S. warning about potential targets following the Paris attacks. The State Department issued a warning Wednesday that St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, Milan’s cathedral and La Scala opera house, as well as churches, synagogues, restaurants, theaters and hotels had been identified as “potential targets.”

— Danish and Norwegian police were asked to be on the lookout for a man who Swedish authorities said is wanted in connection with an investigation into “preparing for a terrorist offense.” Sweden’s Security Service, known as SAPO, said the request was not linked to the Paris attacks.

— In Belgium, where many of the Paris attackers lived, Prime Minister Charles Michel announced a package of additional anti-terror measures, and said 400 million euros ($427 million) would be earmarked to expand the fight.

Michel told lawmakers that security personnel will be increased and special attention will be paid to eradicating messages of hate. He also called for more international cooperation, and said he wants to amend the Belgian constitution to extend the length of time terror suspects can be held by police without charge.

“All democratic forces have to work together to strengthen our security,” Michel said.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius urged the international community to do more to eradicate the Islamic State group, which has claimed responsibility for the Nov. 13 attacks on a rock concert, Parisian cafes and the national stadium.

Fabius, speaking on France-Inter radio, said the group “is a monster. But if all the countries in the world aren’t capable of fighting against 30,000 people (IS members), it’s incomprehensible.”

France has stepped up its airstrikes against extremists in Syria, and French military spokesman Col. Gilles Jaron said Thursday that French forces have destroyed 35 Islamic State targets in Syria since the attacks on Paris.

French President Francois Hollande is going to Washington and Moscow next week to push for a stronger international coalition against IS. Speaking after the seven-hour siege in Saint-Denis, Hollande said that France was “at war” with the Islamic State group.

In its English-language magazine, Islamic State said it will continue its violence and “retaliate with fire and bloodshed” for insults against the Prophet Muhammad and “the multitudes killed and injured in crusader airstrikes.”

Francois Molins, the Paris prosecutor, said Wednesday that investigators found a cellphone in a garbage can outside the Bataclan concert hall in eastern Paris where 89 attack victims died. It contained a text message sent about 20 minutes after the massacre began. “We’re off, it’s started,” it read.

Molins said investigators were still trying to identify the recipient of the message.

Seven of the Paris attackers died on the same night as the attacks. French authorities have said most of the attackers — five have been identified so far — were unknown to them. But two U.S. officials said that many, though not all, of those identified were on the U.S. no-fly list. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

A Spanish security official said French authorities had sent a bulletin to police across Europe asking them to watch out for a Citroen Xsara car that could be carrying Salah Abdeslam, whose brother, Brahim, was among the attackers who blew themselves up.

French authorities declared a state of emergency after the attacks, and security forces have conducted 414 raids, making 60 arrests and seizing 75 weapons, including 11 military-style firearms.

2838,2838,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/23/belgium-police-arrest-16-paris-fugitive-still-larg/,Right,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Belgian police launched more raids in Brussels and beyond early Monday, detaining five more people as they continued their hunt for a fugitive suspect in the Paris attacks.

In Paris, British Prime Minister David Cameron said he will ask for parliamentary approval for the U.K. to join airstrikes against Islamic State extremists in Syria.

The raids began late Sunday, capping a tense weekend that saw hundreds of troops patrolling and authorities hunting for one or more suspected extremists including Salah Abdeslam, a fugitive since being named a suspect in the Nov. 13 Paris attacks. Between Sunday night and midday Monday, 21 people were detained

The Belgian government kept the capital on the highest state of alert in the face of what it described as a “serious and imminent” threat, preventing a return to normal in the city that is also host to the European Union’s main institutions.

Federal prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said 19 raids were carried out Sunday in Molenbeek, home to many of the Paris attackers, and other boroughs of Brussels, and three raids were carried out in Charleroi. Abdeslam was not among those arrested. Van Der Sypt said no firearms or explosives were found.

Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon told the RTL network that Abdeslam “must have a lot of support on our territory. That’s why all these searches being conducted at the moment are important.”

Police fired two shots at a car that approached them as they searched a snack bar in Molenbeek, Van Der Sypt said. The vehicle escaped but was stopped later in Brussels, and a wounded person inside was arrested. It was not immediately known if the person was linked to the investigation into the Paris attacks.

Cameron and French President Francois Hollande, meeting in Paris, paid a quiet visit to the Bataclan concert venue, which saw the worst of the carnage in Paris. Hollande plans to meet later this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkeld and then U.S. President Barack Obama in pursuit of a unified strategy in Syria.

Britain has been carrying out airstrikes in Iraq, but Cameron has long wished for an expanded mandate to include targets in Syria. But having lost a vote once two years ago, his government had been reluctant to even suggest a vote until it could be certain it would win.

Belgian authorities said more raids Monday in Brussels and eastern Liege yielded five more detentions.

The federal prosecutor said in a statement that a BMW sighting near Liege that had been rumored to contain Abdeslam had no links with the ongoing investigation.

Several of the Paris attackers had lived in Brussels, including Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the plot’s orchestrator who was killed Wednesday in a standoff with French police. Police issued a new public appeal for help in identifying the third attacker who was killed in the assault at the national stadium. They posted a photo of the man on Twitter, asking the public for information.

France has intensified its aerial bombing in Syria and Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, which has been sent to the Mediterranean, will be “operational” from Monday and “ready to act.”

France has extended a state of emergency which allows police raids, searches and house arrest without permission from a judge, for three months. On Saturday, it also extended a ban on demonstrations and other gatherings through Nov. 30, when a U.N. climate conference with more than 100 heads of state is scheduled to start.

The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attacks in Paris that killed 130 people and wounded hundreds more; the suicide bombings in Beirut that killed 43 people and injured more than 200; and the downing of the Russian jetliner carrying 224 people in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula. All happened within the past month.

ANALYSIS/OPINION

Turkey has shot down a Russian fighter jet, saying the SU-24 was warned repeatedly while flying in Turkish airspace. It seems both pilots have been killed, although there are some preliminary reports that one of the pilots was captured by Syrian rebels.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the incident was a “stab in the back,” according the Russian state news agency, TASS. Turkey and NATO have warned the Russian military frequently that this scenario could happen if Russia did not stop flying into Turkish territory.

The real question is—how will Putin respond? The Russian president has been two steps ahead of the West in Syria and in the geopolitical arena in general.

Putin may see this as an opportunity, not wanting to let a good crisis go to waste.

The weakness of President Obama in confronting threats against the United States is well documented, as ISIS rolls across the Middle East and threatens the world. Putin is well aware of this fact. Putin may see this as an opportunity to drive a stake through the heart of NATO. France most likely did not call for NATO Article 5 support in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks as it may have been afraid that the United States would not support this action.

2851,2851,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/29/cop-21-climate-deal-hinges-on-cash-payouts-to-deve/,Right,"Ugandan Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa was explicit earlier this year when asked what it would take for developing countries to sign up for the emerging U.S.-led climate deal: “Money.”

His candor was recounted in an April email between two of the Obama administration’s top global warming officials, who called the succinct wisdom from Mr. Kutesa — at the time the president of the U.N. General Assembly — the “best answer of [the] night.”

Indeed, as Todd Stern, the State Department’s top climate official, and Brian Deese, President Obama’s top climate adviser, are trying to rally a deal ahead of a major meeting in Paris that kicks off Monday, it’s becoming clear that any diplomatic breakthrough will be far less about converting hearts and minds than it will be about finding enough money to seal the agreement.

That payoff will come in the form of the Green Climate Fund, the U.N.’s green bank, to which the world’s rich countries are supposed to donate $100 billion a year beginning in 2020, with the money going to the developing world, where it is supposed to be split between converting economies to green energy and helping mitigate the worst effects of changing temperatures.

“It’s not about climate. It never was,” said Christopher Horner, a researcher who obtained the Obama administration email detailing Mr. Kutesa’s stance. “All they want is wealth transfers, for the poor in rich countries to pay the rich in poor countries.”

Neither the Ugandan foreign ministry nor Mr. Stern returned emails seeking comment on the exchange, but the sentiment is echoed by all sides ahead of COP 21, the two-week meeting to hammer out a new global climate deal, which begins Monday in Paris.

“Everyone knows that money will need to be on the table to seal the deal, but climate finance has been the biggest unknown in the lead-up to Paris,” Oxfam, a British-based nonprofit, said in a new report ahead of the meetings. “Negotiations on climate finance have been at a glacial pace, and only really began in earnest at the final negotiating session in October.”

Oxfam said the $100 billion target for annual aid must be a floor, not a ceiling, and warned that the number could need to rise much higher if governments can’t agree to stricter emissions targets.

It’s all a matter of math, the nonprofit said. The target was to reduce emissions enough so that the earth’s temperature would rise no more than 2 degrees Celsius — leading to costs of about $1.6 trillion a year in both economic losses and adaptation costs.

But current pledges would produce a rise of 3 degrees in world temperatures, which would add nearly $1 trillion to those annual costs, Oxfam calculates. That should put pressure on developed countries to pony up more, the nonprofit said, calling “climate finance” one of the major moving parts of the negotiations.

“The Paris COP won’t save the world. But it must serve as a springboard for increasing climate ambition in the years ahead. The Paris outcome will be a legal agreement, lasting for the next 15 years at the very least. As a consequence, we cannot afford to lock in low ambition, and we cannot settle for a deal at any price,” Oxfam said.

Nearly 150 heads of state will attend the Paris meeting, dubbed COP 21 because it is the 21st session of the Conference of Parties. Monday’s opening ceremonies will be followed by two weeks of negotiations lasting six hours a day, broken into morning and afternoon sessions.

The meeting comes as the World Meteorological Organization reported last week that the average global surface temperature in 2015 is likely to be the warmest recorded by humans, and will be 1 degree Celsius above the benchmark temperature before the industrial era.

A weather pattern known as El Nino is responsible for some of the warmth recorded this year, but the WMO scientists said 2011 to 2015 is the hottest five-year period on record, suggesting something more than weather is at work.

The Paris gathering is seen as a chance for the world community to erase the failure of Copenhagen in 2009 — COP 15 — which broke up in chaos, with major developing nations such as China and India refusing to agree to binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions.

The climate fund is one way to try to get developing nations on board, but perhaps anticipating difficulties, Mr. Obama and other world leaders plan to announce a clean energy initiative, dubbed Mission Innovation, designed to double research and development on green energy projects.

Mr. Obama himself will be in Paris only for several days, holding one-on-one meetings with key leaders such as Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But his personal involvement is likely to be derailed by the need to confront the resurgent Islamic State, which struck in horrific fashion in Paris just a few weeks ago.

Instead, it’s his Cabinet officials who will do most of the heavy lifting: Secretary of State John F. Kerry, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy.

“We have come so far, but we know we can’t go the distance alone,” Ms. McCarthy said in a video released ahead of her trip. “Nations around the world must come together in Paris and commit to leaving our kids a healthy, safe planet that is full of promise.”

But the president’s hands are somewhat tied by a GOP-led Congress back home, which has warned Mr. Obama he cannot sign any binding deals, and his own plans to impose cuts to U.S. emissions are facing tough challenges in the courts.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in an op-ed in The Washington Post on Sunday, said whatever the president agrees to could be undone by his successor in 2017.

“Few expect this anti-middle class power plan to last much beyond the months remaining in Obama’s term though. The courts appear likely to strike it down, the next president could tear it up, more than half of the 50 states have filed suit against it, and — critically — a bipartisan majority in both chambers of Congress just approved legislation to expressly reject it,” Mr. McConnell said.

One test for the U.S. will be to see if Mr. Obama offers to up the U.S. pledge to the climate fund.

The current pledge is for $3 billion — the biggest share of the $10.2 billion in total world pledges, from 38 countries. But the U.S. hasn’t signed over any of its money yet, with Congress reluctant to carve that much money out of already-stretched discretionary budgets.

Japan is the second-largest contributor, having pledged $1.5 billion. The United Kingdom is next at $1.2 billion, followed by Germany at $1 billion.

2855,2855,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/3/syed-farook-tashfeen-malik-erased-digital-footprin/,Right,"The Muslim husband and wife behind the mass shooting in San Bernardino began erasing their digital footprint a day in advance of the deadly attack, deleting email accounts, disposing of hard drives and smashing their cellphones, according to law enforcement investigators who are treating the probe as a counterterrorism case.

Investigators edged closer Thursday to the conclusion that Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, were radicalized by Islamist extremists either in the U.S. or during trips to the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia.

Working to determine whether terrorism was the motive in the attack at a government-organized holiday party, officials scrambled to re-create the travels, contacts and lifestyle of Farook, a 28-year-old U.S. citizen of Pakistani descent, and his 27-year-old Pakistani wife.

Intelligence sources said there is still no explicit evidence linking the two to known terrorists on U.S. or foreign watch lists and that the couple was not on the FBI’s radar before Wednesday’s deadly shooting rampage. But their cache of thousands of rounds of ammunition and explosives found in a home that the couple rented raises major concerns about a wider plot, or a plan to act on their own to hit other targets.

Authorities have tracked down at least four people from the Los Angeles area who were previously under investigation by U.S. counterterrorism officials and were found to have had communication with Farook in the past, said a law enforcement source involved in the investigation.

But details about the individuals were murky. The law enforcement source said the last contact any of the four had with Farook was in June, and asserted that nothing fruitful came from the interviews about Wednesday’s attack.

SEE ALSO: Authorities move toward terrorism as motive in San Bernardino rampage

With that as a backdrop, officials were working Thursday night to determine what motivated Farook and Malik to storm a conference room inside the Inland Regional Center during a holiday party and spray the room with bullets. Fourteen people were killed and another 21 were injured in either the shooting or a police pursuit and gunbattle that occurred hours later.

The San Bernardino County sheriff-coroner’s office continued to work at the scene of the massacre documenting evidence and removing several of the bodies that remained. It was not until Thursday afternoon that officials had contacted the next of kin for all 14 of the victims and that their names were publicly released.

Candlelight vigils were held in their honor Thursday night.

Farook and Malik died in the firefight as they tried to evade police in a rented SUV, firing 76 rounds at officers who unleashed 380 rounds of their own and riddled the vehicle with bullet holes. More than 1,500 rounds of unspent ammunition were found in the vehicle, according to police.

One official, who spoke anonymously with The Washington Times, cautioned against jumping to conclusions. The official said the investigation is still young and asserted that “radicalization can happen in a number of different inflection points and in a number of different ways. It’s not a one-size-fits-all sort of thing.”

But fresh details continued to emerge about the background of the two — supporting the notion that the attack was planned and not a spur-of-the-moment response to a party snub or quarrel.

SEE ALSO: W. SCOTT LAMB: Rand Paul responds to prayer shamers

The couple had a 6-month-old daughter, who was left in a relative’s care before they stormed the Inland Regional Center bedecked in tactical-style clothes and spraying 75 rounds into the conference room.

Three pipe bombs configured as one large explosive device were recovered from the center. Police also found bomb-making materials, 12 pipe bombs and more than 4,500 rounds of ammunition inside the couple’s home.

“This is not your average investigation,” said David Bowdich, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, mentioning the multiple crime scenes, victims and recovered evidence. “It will take time.”

Officials involved in the investigation said the couple appeared to have gone to great lengths to conceal themselves and make difficult investigation of their plans — further suggesting premeditation.

A cellphone recovered from Malik’s body was newly purchased and had been used only recently. Two other cellphones that were recovered had been smashed with a hammer and were expected to be sent to the FBI’s forensic lab in Washington for examination.

Authorities also noted that a hard drive and motherboard were missing from a computer found at the Redlands, California, home that the couple rented.

Farook worked as a health inspector for the San Bernardino County Health Department, the agency holding the holiday party. He had been in attendance at the event but was reported to have left and returned about 30 minutes later with his wife.

Accounts have emerged that Farook was engaged in a dispute with someone at the party before he left, but police at a Thursday press conference said they were still investigating the information and had varying stories from witnesses.

“There appears to be a degree of planning that went into this,” said San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan. “Nobody just gets upset at a party and goes home and plans an attack like that.”

The State Department confirmed Thursday that Malik held a Pakistani passport and was in the U.S. on a K-1 visa reserved for fiancees of U.S. citizens. Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters that Malik was granted the visa in Islamabad and would have had to undergo “counterterrorism screening” to receive the document from U.S. authorities.

While other officials said the visa was issued in 2014, details about international travel by Farook’s and Malik’s travels were not fully clear.

Investigators said Farook traveled at one point to Pakistan before returning to the U.S. in July 2014 with his bride-to-be. Sources also confirmed that Farook went to Saudi Arabia for nine days in summer 2014. It was unclear whether the couple traveled to other countries together.

Mr. Toner told reporters that the State Department does not track the movements of U.S. citizens overseas.

The official who spoke anonymously with The Times said it was entirely possible that the couple had contact with extremists during their foreign travels or while in the U.S., but that the extent of those contacts was unclear.

“If you’re in a minority in whatever country you’re in, a lot of the relationships may be tight-knit, so the chance that you’re going to have contacts with people that may be of interest to authorities, that’s plausible,” the official said. “But the chance that there’s a close relationship there is unknown and won’t be known until further investigation.”

Farook’s brother-in-law, Farhan Khan, said Wednesday that he was shocked by Farook’s actions.

“I have no idea, no idea, why he would do that. Why he would do something like this,” Mr. Khan said.

Two weeks ago, Farook and one of the co-workers he killed, 52-year-old Nicholas Thalasinos, had a heated conversation about Islam, according to Kuuleme Stephens, a friend of the victim’s.

Ms. Stephens said she happened to call Mr. Thalasinos while he was at work and having a discussion with Farook. She said Mr. Thalasinos told her that Farook “doesn’t agree that Islam is not a peaceful religion.”

Other co-workers recalled bits and pieces about the man, whom many viewed as mild-mannered and happy.

Co-worker Patrick Baccari said he was sitting at the same table as Farook during the holiday party when he suddenly disappeared. Mr. Baccari said that when the shooting started, he took refuge in a bathroom and suffered minor wounds from shrapnel slicing through the wall.

The shooting lasted about five minutes, he said, and when he looked in the mirror he realized he was bleeding.

“If I hadn’t been in the bathroom, I’d probably be laying dead on the floor,” he said.

Mr. Baccari described Farook as reserved and said he showed no signs of unusual behavior. Earlier this year, he traveled to Saudi Arabia, was gone for about a month and returned with a wife, and later grew a beard, Mr. Baccari said.

2876,2876,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/18/bernie-sanders-sues-democratic-party-for-data-acce/,Right,"Presidential candidate Bernard Sanders sued the Democratic National Committee Friday afternoon to demand access to the party’s voter files after the DNC suspended him for illicitly accessing the campaign files of his competitor, Hillary Clinton.

It’s the latest move in what’s become an embarrassing black eye for both Mr. Sanders and the DNC, with the party accusing Mr. Sanders of playing dirty, and the candidate saying the DNC is trying to undermine his campaign in order to help Mrs. Clinton.

For her part, Mrs. Clinton chirped from the outside, with campaign manager Robby Mook saying flatly that Mr. Sanders’ staff “stole data from our campaign” and insisting on an outside monitor to ensure all of the data has been expunged.

“This information is really key to our campaign and to our strategy, and for that reason this breach is totally unacceptable, and may have been a violation of the law,” Mr. Mook told reporters Friday evening.

The DNC on Thursday suspended Mr. Sanders’ access to its voter data file, which contains extensive details of the demographics, voting history and other personal information of tens of millions of Americans. Campaigns pay the DNC for access to those files, and use them to model their own strategies for turning out voters in caucuses and primaries.

The DNC said the contractor that runs the data file detected two dozen breaches where Sanders employees accessed Clinton data, and even tried to download it.

Mr. Sanders’ campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, says one staffer has been fired and others are being questioned for acting “irresponsibly.” But the campaign also says the DNC had no legal right to suspend its access, and said it appears Democratic Party leaders are trying to aid Mrs. Clinton’s campaign.

“By their action, the leadership of the Democratic National Committee is now actively attempting to undermine our campaign,” Mr. Weaver said. “This is unacceptable. Individual leaders of the DNC can support Hillary Clinton in any way they want, but they are not going to sabotage our campaign — one of the strongest grassroots campaigns in modern history.”

DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, speaking on CNN, said suspending Mr. Sanders’ access was the only fair move because he broke the terms of the access agreement.

The fight comes a day before Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley are scheduled to face off in the third Democratic presidential debate.

Mrs. Clinton maintains a wide lead in national polls and is ahead in Iowa, but Mr. Sanders tops her in polling in New Hampshire.

Mr. Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, said he was shocked to learn Mr. Sanders was trying to fundraise off of the incident, saying it didn’t appear the Sanders campaign was taking the breach very seriously.

“Their staff stole data from our campaign and they are now fundraising off of it. I’ll leave it to voters what that says or doesn’t say,” he said.

He said as long as the Sanders campaign has the information, they have a roadmap to Mrs. Clinton’s strategy in certain states. He called for an independent monitor to make sure the data has all been expunged by the Sanders campaign.

Computer-related problems have plagued Democrats all year. Mrs. Clinton had her push for the White House dented after it was revealed she rejected use of an official email account during her four years at the State Department, instead using an account on a server she kept at her home in New York. The arrangement went against department policy, and the emails are now being released on a rolling monthly basis in accordance with a federal court order.

In that situation, it was Republicans demanding Mrs. Clinton submit her server to an independent monitor — a demand she rejected. Mrs. Clinton eventually had to turn the server over to the FBI, which is investigating the arrangement.

Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said Friday the Sanders breach of voter files was not an accident, and Sanders staffers not only looked at the data but at one point tried — apparently unsuccessfully — to download data into a spreadsheet for storage and use later.

Mr. Sanders is paying $10,000 a month for access to the files, but in his court documents he said losing access to the files and his campaign’s work on them is costing his operation more than $600,000 a day in value because he cannot access mailing lists he’s used to raise money.

2883,2883,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/31/romney-touts-poland-economic-success-story/,Right,"Under mounting pressure to be more open on foreign policy issues, Mitt Romney tried to do just that during his six-day trip to visit three American allies — but repeatedly found himself having to backtrack on the things he said.

The Romney campaign shrugged off those hiccups, saying the trip to Britain, Israel and Poland was a success and gave the presumptive Republican presidential nominee a chance to appear on the world stage with foreign leaders and highlight key differences with President Obama over American policy toward Israel.

Mr. Romney showcased his friendship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had frosty relations with Mr. Obama, and accepted the endorsement of former Polish President Lech Walesa, the anti-communist hero and Nobel Peace Prize winner.

“It’s been a trip to three places far apart on the map. But for an American, you can’t get much closer to the ideals and convictions of my own country,” Mr. Romney said Tuesday in a speech at the University of Warsaw. “Our nations belong to the great fellowship of democracies. We speak the same language of freedom and justice. We uphold the right of every person to live in peace.”

The 15-minute address capped a trip aimed at bolstering Mr. Romney’s foreign-policy resume, showing he can operate on the global stage, and it was designed to highlight his vow to deepen ties with American allies while taking a stronger stance against potential adversaries. But at times, he ended up irking friends — and insulting enemies.

The trip got off to a shaky start when he seemed to insult Britain, which prides itself on maintaining a special relationship with the U.S.

Mr. Romney, who rescued the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, timed his trip to coincide with the opening of the Summer Olympics in London, and he delivered a frank assessment of Britain’s preparedness, saying some of the security issues were “disconcerting.” He dialed back that criticism later by saying the city was “ready.”

From Britain, he traveled to Israel, where he distanced himself from the Obama administration by saying Jerusalem should be the rightful capital and suggesting that he would follow through on a U.S. law that calls for the U.S. Embassy to be moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.

But after an aide asserted Mr. Romney would “respect” an Israeli decision to launch a unilateral strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, the candidate backtracked and refused to say whether that was true. In doing so, he passed on a chance to distance himself from the Obama administration, which has warned against a unilateral Israeli strike.

He also had to do damage control, denying that he was insulting Palestinians when he told a group of Jewish donors at a fundraiser Monday that the Israeli culture has allowed them to be more economically successful than their Palestinian neighbors. “That’s an interesting topic that deserves scholarly analysis, but I actually didn’t address that,” Mr. Romney said Tuesday in a Fox News interview.

The Obama campaign pounced on the stumbles. Senior campaign adviser Robert Gibbs, in a conference call with reporters, called Mr. Romney’s world tour an “embarrassing disaster.”

“He both offended our closest ally and triggered a troubling reaction in the most sensitive region of the world,” Mr. Gibbs said. “He certainly didn’t prove to anyone that he passed the commander-in-chief test.”

Romney spokesman Ryan Williams fired back that Mr. Obama has “weakened America’s position in the world and frayed relationships with our closest allies.”

“Gov. Romney has laid out a foreign policy that will strengthen our interests, ensure our security, and let our friends know they have a partner in the White House,” Mr. Williams said.

In his speech Tuesday, Mr. Romney embraced Poland, saying the Eastern European nation has no greater ally than the United States and that its economic transformation from communism to the free market provides the world — and by implication the Obama White House — with “a shining example of the prosperity that economic opportunity can bring.”

“Your success today is a reminder that the principles of free enterprise can propel an economy and transform a society,” Mr. Romney said, touting the same limited-government message that he has used to draw contrast with Mr. Obama on U.S. soil.

Mr. Romney, though, did not shed light on how his foreign policy approach toward Poland would differ from that of Mr. Obama, who angered some Poles when he started pursuing a “reset” in relations with neighbor and historic rival Russia early in his term. Some also took umbrage with the Democrat’s decision in 2009 to shelve an agreement the Bush administration had inked to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic.

The Republican did not mention the George W. Bush-era missile-defense program or weigh in publicly on Mr. Obama’s proposed replacement system. He brought up Russia, a country that he previously labeled the nation’s No. 1 “geopolitical foe,” just once by saying its “once-promising advances toward a free and open society have faltered.”

James M. Lindsay, vice president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said that the foreign-policy positions staked on the campaign trail are not always an accurate barometer for what someone will do after they are elected because “campaigning is about promising — governing is about choosing.”

Mr. Obama and two predecessors, Bill Clinton and Mr. Bush, on the campaign trail have backed the notion of Jerusalem being the Israeli capital and the U.S. Embassy site, then, once in office, postponed plans to move the embassy for fear of undermining Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

“If past is prologue, should Gov. Romney become President Romney, he is likely to follow suit?” Mr. Lindsay said, adding that Mr. Romney is not the first presidential candidate “who didn’t spell everything out in great detail and he won’t be the last.”

2886,2886,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/24/wesley-pruden-amazing-grace-christmas-morn/,Right,"OPINION:

REPRINTED FROM AN EARLIER CHRISTMAS

The malls and the Main Streets fall silent. The ringing cash registers and the happy cries of children become but ghostly echoes across the silent cities. But the Christ child born in a manger 2,000 years ago lives, liberating the hearts of sinners and transforming the lives of the wicked.

The story of the redeeming power of the Christmas message is nowhere more vividly illustrated than in the incredible life of an English slaver named John Newton.

He was born 300 years ago into a seafaring family in Liverpool. His mother was a godly woman whose faith gave her life meaning. She died when John was 7, and as an old man he recalled as the sweetest remembrance of childhood the soft and tender voice of his mother at prayer.

His father married again, and John left school at 11 to go to sea with him. He quickly adopted the vulgar life of seafaring men, though the memory of his mother’s faith remained. He reckoned that religious faith was important, he recalled many years later, “but I loved sin.” Once on shore leave, he was seized by a press gang to work on another ship, HMS Harwich, and life grew coarser. He ran away, was captured, put in chains, stripped before the mast and flogged without mercy. “The Lord had by all appearances given me up to judicial hardness. I was capable of anything. I had not the least fear of God, nor the least sensibility of conscience. I was firmly persuaded that after death I should merely cease to be.”

The Harwich traded him to a slaving ship, bound for West Africa to take aboard human cargo. “At this period of my life,” John reflected, “I was big with mischief and, like one afflicted with a pestilence, was capable of spreading a taint wherever I went.”

John’s new captain liked him, and took him to his home on an island off the African coast, where he had married a beautiful and cruel African princess. She grew jealous of her husband’s friendship with John, who fell ill, and was left in her care. HMS Harwich was barely over the horizon when she threw John into a pig sty, blinded him, and left him in delirium to die. He did not die, but was kept in chains in a cage and fed swill from her table. Word spread through the district that a black woman was keeping a white slave, and many came to taunt him. They threw limes and stones at him, mocking his misery. He would have starved if slaves waiting to embark on the Middle Passage to the Americas had not shared their meager scraps of food.

Five years passed, and the captain returned. John told how he had been treated and he was mocked as a liar. When he was finally taken aboard HMS Harwich again, he was treated ever harshly, allowed to eat only the entrails of animals butchered for the crew’s mess. “The voyage quite broke my constitution,” he would recall, “and the effects would always remain with me as a needful memento of the wages of sin.”

Like Job, he became a magnet for adversity. His ship crashed against the rocks, and he despaired that God’s mercy remained after his life of hostile indifference to the Gospel. “During the time I was engaged in the slave trade,” he said, “I never had the least scruple to its lawfulness.”

The wanton sinner, the arrogant blasphemer, the mocker of the faith of others was at last driven to his knees: “My prayer was like the cry of ravens, which yet the Lord does not disdain to hear.” Miraculously, he was rescued, and arrived back in London to reflect on the mercies God had shown him despite his awful life. He fell under the preaching of George Whitefield and the influence of John Wesley, and was born again into the new life in Christ.

Shortly before Christmas Day of 1807, he died at the age of 82, leaving a dazzling testimony to the miracle born on the first Christmas. “I commit my soul to my gracious God and Savior, who mercifully spared and preserved me, when I was an apostate, a blasphemer and an infidel, and delivered me from that state on the coast of Africa into which my obstinate wickedness had plunged me.”

His testimony, set to music, would become the most beloved hymn of Christendom:

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound



That saved a wretch like me.



I once was lost, but now am found,



Was blind, but now I see.



‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear

And grace my fears relieved



How precious did that grace appear



The hour I first believed.



Through many dangers, toils and snares,



I have already come;



‘Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,



And grace will lead me home.

2888,2888,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/26/obama-feels-small-compared-with-members-of-us-mari/,Right,"KANEOHE BAY, Hawaii (AP) — President Barack Obama is one of the most powerful men in the world. He’s commander in chief of one of its mightiest militaries, too.

Yet in spite of all that, Obama feels inadequate from time to time. Especially when he’s vacationing in Hawaii and working out alongside strapping Marines at their gym.

“The only problem I’ve got when I’m here is having to work out with Marines in the gym,” Obama said during his annual Christmas Day visit with U.S. troops at Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe Bay. “Because I generally feel like your commander in chief is in pretty good shape, and then I get next to some guy, you know, curling 100 pounds and it makes me feel small.”

Obama works out at the base gym just about every day when he vacations here. With New Year’s Day approaching, though, he told the troops he’s inspired “to work harder so I can keep up with you next year.”

Perhaps using the “workout stuff” his wife, Michelle, had said she was getting him for Christmas.

The 6-foot-1 Obama is known to enjoy a daily workout whether he’s at home in the White House, traveling or on vacation. He also plays golf practically every weekend in Washington when the weather cooperates, and he swings his clubs just about daily during extended vacations on Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, or here in his native Hawaii.

The Christmas visit with the troops has become a yearly tradition for the Obamas during their annual vacation on Oahu.

Obama said it’s one of their favorite things to do because they get a chance to “say thank you on behalf of the American people.”

This year’s visit came four days after six U.S. service members were killed in a suicide attack in Afghanistan. In his first public comments on the attack, Obama praised the six individuals as “outstanding, brave men and women.”

“As we know, when you’re deployed overseas, it’s tough,” Obama said Friday. He said that although his administration has brought home troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, “there are still folks over there every single day and it’s still dangerous, as we saw this past week, where we had some outstanding, brave men and women who were killed.”

“So we never take for granted what all of you do for the American people,” Obama said. “You help keep us free. You help keep us strong. Whatever service you’re in, whatever branch, we are extraordinarily grateful for everything that you do every single day.”

The six service members, including a New York City police detective who served in the U.S. National Guard, were killed Monday at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, the largest U.S. facility in the country, when a suicide attacker rammed an explosives-laden motorcycle into a joint NATO-Afghan patrol. The Taliban claimed responsibility.

Before the afternoon visit, Obama opened Christmas gifts and sang carols with his family at their vacation rental in nearby Kailua, about a half hour from downtown Honolulu.

Obama also spent part of Christmas Eve telephoning U.S. service members stationed around the world to thank them and their families for their service, the White House said.

Obama is on a 16-day vacation from Washington. He is scheduled to return to the White House just after the start of the new year."
2890,2890,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/17/enrique-marquez-ex-neighbor-friend-of-san-bernardi/,Right,"The friend and former neighbor of the San Bernardino shooters who purchased two guns terrorists used in the Dec. 2 massacre, was arrested Thursday and will face federal criminal charges, authorities said.

The charges brought against Enrique Marquez, are the first criminal charges filed in the widening investigation into the third terror attack in the U.S. this year, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The 24-year-old Riverside resident once lived next door to Syed Farook and purchased two semiautomatic rifles he and his wife Tashfeen Malik used in the attack that killed 14 people.

Mr. Marquez told officials that he bought the guns three years ago as a favor to Farook so that he would not have to go through a background check or be on record as the buyer, NBC reported.

He and Farook had discussed conducting some kind of attack in 2010 but called off their plans after they were spooked by several unrelated terrorism arrests in southern California, officials said.

FBI Director James Comey on Wednesday said investigators have found no connection between Farook and the people arrested in 2010.

He also said that investigators have found not social media posting connecting Farook’s wife and fellow gunman, Tashfeen Malik, to terror groups before she came to the U.S. on a fiancee visa.

Several media reports suggested that Malik had publicly posted about her support for Islamic terror groups and that the State Department and Homeland Security officials had overlooked her postings while conducting her background check before allowing her into the country.

Mr. Comey said all of Malik’s statements in support of jihad were made in private messages or emails.

2903,2903,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/21/obama-hillary-clinton-may-be-setting-up-donald-tru/,Right,"President Obama and Hillary Clinton have intensified attacks on Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, accusing him of manipulating voters’ “fear and ignorance” and using anti-Muslim rhetoric that helps recruit Islamic State terrorists — jabs that appear to be energizing his supporters and strengthening his campaign.

But campaign strategists say the attacks are not aimed at knocking down Mr. Trump. Instead, the smears are part of a calculated ploy by Democrats who want to help him win because they are convinced the billionaire businessman will lose in the general election.

“It definitely makes my allegiance to Donald Trump much greater,” Jeff Moorman, a Trump campaign supporter in Iowa, said after hearing the insults hurled at his candidate.

That is exactly the reaction Democrats want, said Republican campaign consultant Ryan Williams.

“It is a calculated effort on the Democrats’ part to elevate Trump. They clearly want Trump to be the nominee because they think they can beat him easily,” said Mr. Williams, who worked for the campaign of 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

“Attacks from Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama do nothing but energize Donald Trump’s supporters, and I suspect both Clinton and Obama are smart enough to realize that,” he said.

In a head-to-head matchup, the RealClearPolitics average of national polls show Mrs. Clinton beating Mr. Trump by an average of 6 percentage points, significantly higher than other Republicans such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who trail Mrs. Clinton by 1.5 percentage points and 2.5 percentage points, respectively. All the other Republican contenders fare better in matchups with Mrs. Clinton than Mr. Trump in the average of national polls.

Mr. Trump has been a target for Democrats’ attacks throughout the campaign. But the attacks have grown sharper as he defied predictions that his unconventional campaign would flare out and remained atop most polls.

Taylor Budowich, a national spokesman for the Tea Party Express, suspects Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton were trying to stir up conservative voters. But he said the scheme likely would backfire, pushing a wave of Republican voters to the polls.

“Sometimes a lot of these political consultants and political strategists get too smart for their own good,” he said. “In trying to control the outcome of an election, they end up getting the exact opposite outcome than what they wanted.”

Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic front-runner and the odds-on favorite to win the nomination, repeatedly hammered Mr. Trump during a Democratic candidates debate Saturday, saying his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. “fans the flames of radicalization.”

“He is becoming ISIS’ best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists,” Mrs. Clinton said at the debate in New Hampshire.

Mr. Trump demanded an apology Monday during an interview on NBC’s “Today” show.

“I will demand an apology from Hillary. She should apologize,” he said. “She lies about emails, she lies about Whitewater, she lies about everything. She will be a disaster as president of the United States.”

Mr. Trump said that saying he is being used in videos produced by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, was another lie from the former secretary of state.

“You’re talking about people dying. You’re talking about making up tapes and videos which don’t exist,” he said.

An exhaustive search for Islamic State videos and online postings did not produce evidence that Mr. Trump was being used as a recruitment tool, so the fact-checking organization Politifact rated Mrs. Clinton’s statement “false.”

Still, Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said an apology was not in order.

“Hillary Clinton will not be apologizing to Donald Trump for correctly pointing out how his hateful rhetoric only helps ISIS recruit more terrorists,” he said.

Meanwhile, Mr. Obama took a swipe at Mr. Trump and the candidate’s supporters.

He said Mr. Trump was exploiting the “anger, frustration, fear” of blue-collar men who are threatened by the rise of multiculturalism and a technology-based economy.

“I think somebody like Mr. Trump is taking advantage of that. That’s what he’s exploiting during the course of his campaign,” the president said in an interview with NPR.

Mr. Obama took a similar swipe at Mr. Trump and his supporters in a fundraising email for the Democratic National Committee.

In the email, the president said that because of his race and his unusual name, he had grown accustomed to being questioned about his religion, place of birth and “even whether I love this country.”

“I always dismissed that kind of talk, but I’ve also learned to listen closely when a conversation starts to lean on fear and ignorance,” he wrote. “So I pay attention when I hear the Republican frontrunner for president call for a ban on Muslims entering this country. And when their other candidates say we should only admit Christian refugees, not Muslims, or that there should be a religious test to determine which people fleeing a war-torn country can enter ours.”

Mr. Williams said the attacks that fire up Mr. Trump’s conservative supporters also motivate liberals to open their wallets.

“Trump, for better or worse, is the kind of candidate who elicits reactions on both sides,” he said. “People can use a lightning rod like Trump in politics to their advantage to accomplish what they are looking for.”

2911,2911,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/2/peaceful-protest-in-oregon-ranching-case-on-saturd/,Right,"BURNS, Ore. (AP) — A peaceful protest Saturday in support of an eastern Oregon ranching family facing jail time for arson was followed shortly afterward by an occupation of a building at a national wildlife refuge.

Ammon Bundy, the son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, who was involved in a standoff with the government over grazing rights, told The Oregonian that he and two of his brothers were among a group of dozens of people occupying the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.

Ammon Bundy said the group planned to stay at the refuge indefinitely.

“We’re planning on staying here for years, absolutely,” Ammon Bundy said. “This is not a decision we’ve made at the last minute.”

An Idaho militia leader who helped organize the earlier march said he knew nothing about activities after a parade of militia members and local residents in Burns walked past the sheriff’s office and the home of Dwight Hammond Jr. and his son Steven.

Beth Anne Steele, an FBI spokeswoman in Portland, told The Associated Press the agency was aware of the situation at the national wildlife refuge. She made no further comment.

Some local residents feared the Saturday rally would involve more than speeches, flags and marching. But the only real additions to that list seemed to be songs, flowers and pennies.

As marchers reached the courthouse, they tossed hundreds of pennies at the locked door. Their message: civilians were buying back their government. After the march passed, two girls swooped in to scavenge the pennies.

A few blocks away, Hammond and his wife Susan greeted marchers, who planted flower bouquets in the snow. They sang some songs, Hammond said a few words, and the protesters marched back to their cars.

Dwight Hammond has said he and his son plan to peacefully report to prison Jan. 4 as ordered by the judge.

Dwight Hammond, 73, and Steven Hammond, 46, said they lit the fires in 2001 and 2006 to reduce the growth of invasive plants and protect their property from wildfires.

The two were convicted of the arsons three years ago and served time - the father three months, the son one year. But a judge ruled their terms were too short under federal law and ordered them back to prison for about four years each.

The decision has generated controversy in a remote part of the state.

In particular, the Hammonds’ new sentences touched a nerve with far right groups who repudiate federal authority.

Ammon Bundy and a handful of militiamen from other states arrived last month in Burns, some 60 miles from the Hammond ranch.

In an email to supporters, Ammon Bundy criticized the U.S. government for a failed legal process.

The video was distributed on Twitter on Friday by Islamist militant organization al-Kataib, SITE reported.

Mr. Trump’s call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S. has prompted harsh criticism worldwide.

At a campaign rally in Sioux Center, Iowa, Mr. Trump said, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters.”

“It’s incredibly insensitive,” Mr. de Blasio said on ABC’s “This Week.” “We had a moment in our nation’s history we’re talking about how to deal with the scourge of gun violence. And for someone who says he wants to be president to say that, it shows he’s just not presidential.”

“And it’s incredibly arrogant, too, of him to suggest that his voters will be with him no matter what he does,” said Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat. “You know, this is another indicator that Donald Trump is not ready for prime time.”

Mr. Trump often has pointed to his loyal supporters as a point of pride for his campaign, and many of his supporters have been vocal to the press about their devotion to the flamboyant billionaire real estate developer.

Mr. de Blasio also said that too much power is in the hands of billionaires in the country, a reaction to the possibility of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg getting into the presidential race as an independent candidate.

“I respect my predecessor for sure,” he said. “but two things, I’d say. One, my candidate is Hillary Clinton, and I really believe she will be the next president of the United States.”

“And the second thing is, I don’t think the people of this country want to give more power to billionaires at this point. I think that’s what this election increasingly is about, how do we address income inequality,” Mr. de Blasio said. “How do we restore the middle class? I don’t think most Americans think that billionaires are the ones who are going to help give us a more fair economy.”

2954,2954,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/17/hillary-clinton-casts-herself-as-obamas-heir-berni/,Right,"Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton on Sunday cast herself as President Obama’s natural heir on guns, health care and the economy in the final debate before Iowa’s caucuses, but Sen. Bernard Sanders said it’s time for Democrats to push further, saying the country needs a “political revolution” to break the power of big corporations.

Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Sanders of betraying Mr. Obama by seeking a primary opponent for him in 2012, and calling the president weak on tackling Wall Street. And she said Mr. Sanders’ new plan for government-sponsored universal health care would undo the advances of Obamacare, which she said she would defend and expand.

Mr. Sanders denied that he’s an enemy of Mr. Obama, but embraced the charge that he wants to move beyond the president’s agenda, saying more must be done to break the power big banks and the wealthiest have over Washington.

“Can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals?” he said, pointing to $200,000 he said Mrs. Clinton collected in 2013 to deliver a speech at investment giant Goldman Sachs.

“It’s easy to say I’m going to do this and do that, but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street,” he said.

Facing off in Charleston, South Carolina, in a prime-time debate aired on NBC, the candidates — with former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley rounding out the field — drew some of their sharpest distinctions year, with the surging Mr. Sanders facing increasing scrutiny over his past stances and future plans.

Mrs. Clinton came out swinging at the top of the debate, saying Mr. Sanders has benefited from help from the National Rifle Association, and that makes it impossible for him to pass gun control.

“He has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby, numerous times,” she said. “He voted for immunity for gunmakers and sellers. There is no industry in America that was given the total pass the gunmakers and gun dealers were, and that needs to be reversed.”

Mr. Sanders, however, said he has a D-minus rating from the NRA, and said he can be the bridge-builder the country needs on the issue.

He’s taken heat for his 2005 vote to grant gun manufacturers immunity from liability lawsuits. Over the weekend he said he would now support legislation to eliminate that liability, and at the debate Sunday he said he “will support stronger provisions.” He also said Mrs. Clinton is politicizing the issue.

“This should not be a political issue,” he said. “What we should be doing is working together, and, by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe I am in an excellent position to bring people together.”

For his part, Mr. O’Malley said neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Sanders has led on gun control.

“They’ve both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue,” he said, arguing he’s got a track record of winning strict gun control legislation from the legislature during his eight years as governor.

While Mr. Sanders was the focus of the debate, Mr. Obama’s shadow loomed large — particularly after his Tuesday State of the Union address, where he looked beyond this year’s policy fights and tried to lay out the philosophical decisions that face voters in November.

Mrs. Clinton sought to cloak herself in his calls to surmount political divisions, saying she will be the unifying president the country needs.

“I would be working in every way that I knew to bring our country together. We do have too much division, too much mean-spiritedness,” she said. “We need to do it together.”

Mr. Sanders, though, said he’s hoping to lead a “political revolution” in the U.S. that would challenge the power he said the wealthy and big corporations have over politics.

“This campaign is about a political revolution, not only to elect a president but to transform this country,” said Mr. Sanders, a self-described socialist who caucuses with the Democrats in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. O’Malley almost didn’t make the stage for the debate, with his polling in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and nationally falling below the 5 percent threshold of support NBC had set for participants. But the network relented and allowed him in nonetheless.

The former governor’s chief argument has been that his experience as a chief executive trumps that of the other two, who amassed most of their own records as legislators.

But Mr. O’Malley has stalled, proving unable to win over any of the support defecting from Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Instead, those voters are turning to Sen. Bernard Sanders, who has won them over with questions about Mrs. Clinton’s commitment to reining in what many Democrats see as the unchecked power of big banks.

Mrs. Clinton continues to hold a significant lead nationally, though she’s lost her advantage in both Iowa and New Hampshire. The latest RealClearPolitics.com average of polls gives her a 4 percentage point lead in Iowa, and gives Mr. Sanders a 6-point lead in New Hampshire.

Some analysts say Mr. Sanders’ surge in the polls can be attributed to the fact that he’s widely seen as more passionate than Mrs. Clinton.

“He has a certain genuineness and appeal that she doesn’t,” said Dave Woodard, a political science professor at Clemson University.

The poll numbers have spurred Mrs. Clinton and her allies, and left them looking for ways to dent the rise of the Vermont senator.

One major area of dispute is over health care. Mr. Sanders strongly supports a Medicare-for-all health care system, and on Sunday night released the long-awaited details of his socialized medicine plan. The proposal relies on massive tax increases on the rich to pay for the $1.38 trillion-per-year system.

Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, says she supports the concept of universal health care but believes Democrats’ No. 1 priority must be protecting the Affordable Care Act at all costs.

“To start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back,” she said in the debate.

Mr. Sanders argues Obamacare was just a first step, but said it left tens of millions of Americans still without coverage — and leaves too much power in the hands of health and drug companies.

“We are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country,” he said.

Mrs. Clinton has charged that Mr. Sanders’ plan necessarily would raise taxes on middle-class families — a claim confirmed by Mr. Sanders plan itself, which would impose a 2.2 percent income-based tax on families making more than $28,800, in addition to other tax increases on individuals and businesses.

Sunday night’s debate, organized by the Democratic National Committee, comes as Mr. Sanders has kept alive a lawsuit against the party organization.

Mr. Sanders on Friday said he does not intend to pursue a lawsuit against the DNC over his campaign’s access to voter data files, but he kept the case open anyway in an attempt to hold the DNC’s feet to the fire.

In December DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz barred the Sanders campaign from accessing Democratic Party voter files after Sanders staffers were caught snooping through Mrs. Clinton’s files on the DNC’s system.

Mr. Sanders has apologized for the incident, and his campaign’s access was restored quickly after he filed the lawsuit.

2970,2970,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/1/hillary-clinton-claims-victory-bernie-sanders-laud/,Right,"COUNCIL BLUFFS, IOWA — Hillary Clinton was officially declared the winner in the Iowa caucuses Tuesday afternoon, but not before Sen. Bernard Sanders outperformed expectations and reset the Democratic presidential primary, putting a serious dent in Mrs. Clinton’s aura of inevitability.

Mrs. Clinton held a slim lead of 49.8 percent of delegates awarded to Mr. Sanders’ 49.6 percent, with 100 percent of Iowa precincts reporting.

“The results tonight are the closest in Iowa Democratic caucus history. Hillary Clinton has been awarded 699.57 state delegate equivalents, Bernie Sanders has been awarded 695.49 state delegate equivalents, [Former Maryland Gov.] Martin O’Malley has been awarded 7.68 state delegate equivalents and uncommitted has been awarded .46 state delegate equivalents,” Andy McGuire, Iowa Democratic Party chairman, said in a statement Tuesday.

O’Malley came in a distant third with less than 1 percent of delegates, and announced he was suspending his campaign on the heels of a dismal showing.

For Mrs. Clinton, the close result renewed some of the sting of 2008, when she lost the state to then-Sen. Barack Obama, and went on to lose the nomination to him in a race that lasted through June.

She followed her 2008 loss here with a come-from-behind victory in New Hampshire, but that will be tougher to duplicate this year, with Mr. Sanders, who has represented neighboring Vermont in Washington for decades, holding a commanding lead in polling there.

SEE ALSO: Hillary Clinton picks up handful of delegates in Iowa via coin toss

Iowa awards its delegates proportionally at the precinct level, and the state party does not actually report vote totals for each candidate.

Speaking at her campaign headquarters in Des Moines, Mrs. Clinton said she was “breathing a big sigh of relief,” a hint at the crushing defeat she suffered here eight years ago. She also said she’s now looking forward to a one-on-one debate with Mr. Sanders.

“It is rare that we have the opportunity that we do now to have a real contest of ideas, to really think hard about what the Democratic party stands for and what we want the future of our country to look like if we do our part to build it,” she said. “I am honored to stand in the long line of American reformers who make up our minds that the status quo is not good enough, that standing still is not an option, and that brings people together to find ways that will improve the lives of Americans.”

Hillary for America’s Iowa State Director Matt Paul said in a Tuesday morning statement: “Hillary Clinton has won the Iowa Caucus. After thorough reporting — and analysis — of results, there is no uncertainty and Secretary Clinton has clearly won the most national and state delegates. Statistically, there is no outstanding information that could change the results and no way that Senator Sanders can overcome Secretary Clinton’s advantage.”

Calling the race a “virtual tie,” Mr. Sanders said he succeeded by battling the juggernaut Clinton campaign to a razor-thin finish in Iowa and hit the anti-establishment notes that have made him the darling of liberals.

“Nine months ago, we came to this beautiful state. We had no political organization, we had no money, we had no name recognition, and we were taking on the most powerful organization in the United States of America,” he said in a speech at his campaign headquarters, delivered just after Mrs. Clinton left the stage.

“I think the people have sent a very profound message to the political establishment, and to the economic establishment, and by the way, to the media establishment,” he continued. “That is, given the enormous crises facing our country, it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.”

Mrs. Clinton has clung to President Obama during this campaign on a host of issues from foreign policy to health care to gun control. Many Iowa Democrats approved of that strategy and said they weren’t ready for the lurch even further to the left that Mr. Sanders would represent.

Some seemed to buy into Mrs. Clinton’s claim that Mr. Sanders’ policy proposals — especially his $1.38 trillion-per-year universal health care plan — would result in tax increases on the middle class.

“I just like her, and I don’t like Bernie Sanders. He’s going to raise taxes — he’s said so, ‘I’m going to raise taxes’ — and who’s going to pay for it? We are,” said Mike Regan, caucusing in Council Bluffs, on the western side of the state. “Unless he can get Trump to pay for it.”

Entrance polls found Mrs. Clinton with a slight lead over Mr. Sanders among female voters, 53 percent to 43 percent, with Mr. Sanders winning among male voters by the exact same margin, according to entrance polls from The Wall Street Journal.

Polling also gave Mrs. Clinton the edge among older voters. She won 68 percent of voters over 65, compared to 26 percent for Mr. Sanders. By contrast, Mr. Sanders dominated among younger voters, capturing 84 percent of voters ages 17 to 29, compared to just 13 percent for the former secretary of state.

Nearly three in five Democrats said they wanted to continue Mr. Obama’s policies, and Mrs. Clinton overwhelmingly won those voters. Those who wanted a more liberal direction, meanwhile, went to Mr. Sanders.

Fred Turnbaugh, wearing a Navy ball cap and a “Give ‘em Hell, Bernie” lapel pin on his jeans jacket while caucusing at Franklin Elementary School in Council Bluffs, said he appreciated the Vermont senator’s allegiance to blue-collar workers.

“I’ve always liked the way he’s pro-worker and takes care of the middle class,” Mr. Turnbaugh said.

His wife Diana Turnbaugh also swung for Mr. Sanders, but said she would also support Mrs. Clinton if she wins the nomination.

“If it’s a big landslide, I don’t have a problem with her either,” Ms. Turnbaugh said.

She said she’s looking for Mr. Sanders to improve Medicare. “I’m on Medicare, and the Obamacare insurance just ruined me.”

Other caucusgoers said they appreciated Mrs. Clinton’s position on social issues such as same-sex marriage.

Alisha Delsignore called the former secretary of state “very solid.”

“I have gay parents, so I like her position on those issues,” said Ms. Delsignore. “Plus she’s a woman.”

Her husband Nick Delsignore also backed Mrs. Clinton, in part because he worried about what he described as Mr. Sanders’ lack of experience.

“Some of his positions just aren’t as laid out,” said Mr. Delsignore, who wore a Sanders T-shirt.

While some voters have misgivings about Mr. Sanders, his performance thus far has been impressive, and he’s survived while other Democratic candidates have fallen by the wayside.

The Democratic field started with five candidates, but former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee dropped out soon after the first debate, in which they both turned in lackluster performances.

Despite low poll numbers throughout the race, Mr. O’Malley persevered through the Iowa caucuses. The former Maryland governor had tried to position himself as the progressive alternative to Mrs. Clinton, but liberal voters clearly favored Mr. Sanders.

Though he never gained traction, Mr. O’Malley said his performance in the primary process was beneficial both for himself and for the Democratic party.

“Together we all stood up for working people, for new Americans, for the future of the earth and the safety of our children. We put these issues at the front of our party’s agenda — these are the issues that serve the best interests of our nation,” he said in a statement. “The road has been long, but our course has been true. A great many people have put their time and talents into my campaign and I thank each of you from the bottom of my heart. Whoever our nominee is, we must all hold strong, together.”

Moving forward, Mr. Sanders appears poised for a major win next week in New Hampshire.

Mr. Sanders is crushing Mrs. Clinton in the polls in New Hampshire, with a University of Massachusetts Lowell/7 News poll released Monday giving him the support of 61 percent of Democratic voters, while Mrs. Clinton pulled in just 30 percent.

Like Mr. Obama in 2008, Mr. Sanders has energized young Democrats, especially those who identify as progressives. Polls show young voters overwhelmingly back the Vermont senator, while Mrs. Clinton holds a commanding lead among older voters.

But there also are deeper problems for Mrs. Clinton and her quest for the Democratic nomination. Surveys consistently have shown that Democrats consider Mr. Sanders much more honest and trustworthy than Mrs. Clinton.

The perception of dishonesty — which the Clinton campaign has been unable to shake — has grown amid revelations classified information passed through the private email account Mrs. Clinton used while secretary of state.

Mrs. Clinton has tried to curry favor among Democrats by positioning herself as the heir apparent to Mr. Obama. She’s praised the president’s actions on financial regulation, foreign policy and health care, all while trying to position Mr. Sanders as a candidate willing to tear apart pieces of Mr. Obama’s legacy.

Mrs. Clinton has said such an approach is a mistake and would undo all the progress made in the years since the Affordable Care Act — Mr. Obama’s signature domestic achievement — became law.

Mr. Sanders has shot back against those attacks and argues his plan would build on Obamacare, not destroy it.

2983,2983,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/7/marco-rubio-defends-his-performance-final-debate-n/,Right,"Florida Sen. Marco Rubio defended his performance in Saturday night’s Republican presidential debate, saying he has raised a lot of money from it and would use the same tactics again.

“Look, we raised more money last night in the first hour of that debate than any other debate,” Mr. Rubio said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”

Mr. Rubio was on the hot seat to prove that despite his short political career and lack of major accomplishments in the Senate, he has what it takes to be president. He said multiple times that President Obama had the same amount of experience when he took office and has proven to be effective in pushing a liberal agenda. He reasoned that it is ideology, not experience, that makes an effective commander in chief.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called out Mr. Rubio many times, asking the audience to watch for a “memorized 25-second speech.” Mr. Rubio delivered, repeating the same speech about Mr. Obama almost word for word — a chance Mr. Christie jumped at to point out to the audience: “There it is. There is is, everybody.”

But Mr. Rubio stood by his performance on Sunday.

“It’s what I believe,” he said, despite Mr. Christie’s criticism that he repeats his canned speeches again and again.

“It’s what I’m going to continue to say because it happens to be one of the main reasons why I am running,” the freshman senator said. “This is the greatest country in the history of mankind because of a certain set of principles. Barack Obama wants us to abandon those principles that he has spend seven years putting in place policies that rip them from us: undermining the Constitution, undermining free enterprise, undermining our standing in the world, weakening America, apologizing for us on the global stage.”

“The reason why I’m running is if we elect someone like that for the next four years, I think it may be too late for America to turn around.”

3007,3007,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/14/antonin-scalias-death-ignites-election-year-fight-/,Right,"Congressional bigwigs and the presidential field brushed aside their condolences Sunday and girded for an election-year fight over how and when to replace Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the colorful conservative justice who died over the weekend.

The fast-moving dispute pitted Democrats, who said the Constitution compels President Obama to act, against Republicans, who said the founding document will become irrelevant if the court tilts to the left.

Senate Democrats said Sunday that they can’t find the constitutional clause that says Mr. Obama has to sit back and let his successor fill the vacancy, while Republicans said the high court can function with eight members for now, giving voters the chance to shape its future.

News of Justice Scalia’s death in Texas, apparently of natural causes, was only a few hours old Saturday before Senate Democrats urged Mr. Obama to send them a nominee and the Republican majority vowed to ignore it.

“The Senate’s duty is to advise and consent,” said Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican and presidential candidate. “You know what? The Senate is advising right now. We’re advising that a lame-duck president in an election year is not going to be able to tip the balance of the Supreme Court — that we’re going to have an election.”

Justice Scalia, who was 79, was found dead in his room at a West Texas resort early Saturday after he didn’t come out for breakfast.

SEE ALSO: Antonin Scalia, conservative Supreme Court justice, remembered for caustic words, wit

Outspoken and often humorous, he endeared himself to conservatives during his three decades on the bench while vexing liberals who frequently disagreed with him yet admired his candor.

Mr. Obama said he will nominate a replacement in “due time,” but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, swiftly ruled out a vote this year.

“The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,” Mr. McConnell said. “Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.”

Other Republicans said it has been a “standard practice” for 80 years not to nominate and confirm Supreme Court justices in a presidential election year.

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was confirmed to his seat in 1988 — the final year of Ronald Reagan’s presidency — though Republicans contended that Senate Democrats stretched out that fight by vehemently opposing and rejecting a prior pick, Robert Bork.

Democrats rejected the Republicans’ posture Sunday, saying they have an obligation to follow the Founding Fathers’ constitutional design and fill the court, which is poised to rule this term on Mr. Obama’s amnesty program for certain illegal immigrants, how Obamacare’s birth control rules should apply to religious nonprofits and whether public-sector unions can collect fees from workers who do not join.

“I can’t find a clause that says ‘except when there’s a year left in the term of a Democratic president,’” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat.

Sen. Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent who is challenging former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, echoed Ms. Warren, saying the Constitution is “pretty clear” about what should happen when there is a vacancy.

“Let’s get on with that business,” Mr. Sanders told “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace.

The standoff adds a remarkable wrinkle to an already challenging year on Capitol Hill. Republicans in charge of both chambers say there are few opportunities for bipartisan agreement, though mental health care reform could be one.

Instead, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, wants to put forth an agenda of “ideas,” offering voters a clear contrast to Mr. Obama’s agenda. Mr. McConnell wants to get back to basics by passing a budget and all dozen appropriation bills in a legislative year shortened by this summer’s nominating conventions and November’s general elections.

The debate already is spilling onto the campaign trail in South Carolina, where Mr. Cruz said his chief rival, businessman Donald Trump, could not be trusted to nominate a worthy replacement.

“It is abundantly clear that Donald Trump is not a conservative, he will not invest the capital to confirm a conservative,” Mr. Cruz told ABC’s “This Week.”

Mr. Cruz said Americans’ right to bear arms and other “basic liberties” would be at risk if Mr. Obama is able to tilt the court toward a liberal majority.

“We’re one justice away from the Second Amendment begin written out,” he said.

The other sitting senator in the race, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, said Mr. Obama is free to make a nomination but Republicans will push aside confirmation.

“There comes a point in the last year of the president, especially in their second term, where you stop nominating or you stop the advise-and-consent process,” Mr. Rubio told “Fox News Sunday.”

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is hoping to give his Republican presidential bid a boost in South Carolina, said he thinks Mr. Obama will pick someone who is “out of the mainstream,” though it is up to Mr. McConnell to decide whether to hold a vote on a nominee.

“That’s really not important to me,” Mr. Bush said.

3013,3013,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/26/marco-rubio-donald-trump-con-artist-who-sticks-it-/,Right,"Sen. Marco Rubio on Friday attacked GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump as a “con artist” who has spent much of his life sticking it to the “little guy” and that the United States is on the brink of turning over the nuclear codes to an “erratic individual.”

“I can just tell you that a con artist is about to take over the Republican party and the conservative movement, and we have to put a stop to it,” Mr. Rubio, Florida Republican, said on “CBS This Morning.”

“Donald Trump last night had no answers on the issue of health care,” he said. “The media’s pumping him up as some sort of unstoppable force. Donald Trump has portrayed himself now consistently as fighting for the working people, and he has a record of sticking it to working people for 35 years.”

“We’re going to put a stop to it now,” Mr. Rubio said. “There is no way we are going to allow a con artist to take over the conservative movement, and Donald Trump is a con artist.”

Mr. Rubio had spent much of Thursday night’s GOP debate attacking Mr. Trump, notably on his business record, and said without a sizable inheritance, the billionaire businessman would be selling watches in Manhattan.

“This is the most important government job on the planet, and we’re about to turn over the conservative movement to a person that has no ideas of any substance on the important issues, the nuclear codes of the United States to an erratic individual, and the conservative movement to someone who has spent a career sticking it to working people,” Mr. Rubio said on CBS.

“I will acknowledge that there are some people watching this broadcast that are intrigued by him, that they think he’s a straight talker and he fights for the little guy, but Donald Trump has spent 40 years sticking it to the little guy, or longer, and every time one of those businesses of his failed, you know who didn’t get paid? The little guy that was working for him,” he said.

Speaking on CNN after the debate on Thursday, Mr. Trump dismissed Mr. Rubio as a “meltdown guy” who sweats too much.

“He’s a meltdown guy,” Mr. Trump said. “I mean, I’m looking at him, he’s pouring sweat. I’ve never seen anything like it; I don’t know what the problem is. He’s just pouring down sweat. We have to have somebody that doesn’t sweat. … We need somebody that doesn’t have whatever that is that he’s got.”

3023,3023,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/26/bernie-sanders-makes-final-plea-for-political-revo/,Right,"ORANGEBURG, South Carolina — Democratic presidential contender Sen. Bernard Sanders made a final plea Friday for young black voters to join his “political revolution” in hopes of an upset victory in the first-in-the-South primary.

“We need a political revolution. Are you guys ready to join in that revolution,” he said to cheers of affirmation from the crowd at Claflin University, a historic black university.

The roughly 300 people at the rally were enthusiastic about Mr. Sanders, but the reality of his long-shot campaign in the South Carolina primary Saturday hung over the event.

Mr. Sanders trails Hillary Clinton by more than 20 points in most polls, due to the former secretary of state’s overwhelming support with black voters, who make up about 55 percent of the Democratic electorate.

That’s why Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist from Vermont, spent most of the week campaigning outside South Carolina. He focused on multi-state contests that begin with Super Tuesday next week, when scores of delegates will be up for grabs and he will need a strong showing to remain competitive.

At the university, Mr. Sanders highlighted items from his far-left agenda that resonate with students and young voters, including free tuition at public colleges and universities, raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour and criminal justice reforms to keep drug offenders out of jail and stop police brutality in black communities.

He urged the students to stay involved in politics and work to change the country, despite friends who he said might ridicule them for getting involved.

He said the millionaires and billionaires wouldn’t lose any sleep worrying about whether the people at the rally suffered from crushing student debt or had to work for low wages.

“The only people who are going to make the change — the history of America, whether it is the workers rights movement, the civil rights movement, the women’s rights movement, the gay rights movement — it is always from the bottom up not the top down,” he said. “Welcome to the political revolution.”

3024,3024,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/17/wisconsin-center-republican-wave/,Right,"MADISON, Wis. — Wisconsin Republicans seem to have it all.

Native son Paul Ryan is Mitt Romney’s running mate. Gov. Scott Walker is a national conservative hero after surviving a recall vote. Former Gov. Tommy Thompson is vying to capture an open Senate seat held for more than 50 years by Democrats. And Wisconsin’s own Reince Priebus heads the Republican National Committee.

Now they’re focusing on the crown jewel: delivering Wisconsin’s 10 electoral votes for Romney. It won’t be easy. Barack Obama cruised to victory by 14 points four years ago, and maintains a slight lead over Romney in polls. And Wisconsin hasn’t gone for a Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1984.

Still, the fact that the goal is even plausible shows how much Wisconsin’s politics have changed in the few years since GOP nominee John McCain was blown out here in 2008 and Democrats held control of the statehouse. Wisconsin has a long tradition of political moderation, but voters have become more conservative since the recession slammed the economy and government deficits rose. A group of rising GOP leaders has taken advantage with a message that relentlessly emphasized jobs and making government less costly.

It’s an approach that will work here for the long haul, they insist, and can serve as a model for Republicans competing in other states with economic challenges.

“This is exactly what we’ve wanted to see, be the center of attention and have people stop and listen and say, ‘What’s Wisconsin doing?’,” said Milwaukee-area tea party organizer Tim Dake. “We’re flexing political muscle but we spent a long time building it up.”

Walker’s victory in the 2010 governor’s race came as the biggest step up for the Wisconsin party. Immediately upon succeeding Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, Walker moved to strip most public employees of their collective bargaining rights on the grounds that the state could no longer afford rich union contracts. His subsequent battle with organized labor, and resounding victory in a recall election, raised Walker’s conservative profile and bolstered his claim that Republicans are in tune with the concerns of average taxpayers.

Walker and Ryan will have prominent speaking roles at the national party convention, which is being organized by Priebus.

Walker, Ryan and Priebus represent a shift to the right from the more moderate Republicans — other than communist-hunter Sen. Joe McCarthy in the 1950s — who tended to represent Wisconsin since the party was founded at a little schoolhouse in Ripon in 1854. Robert La Follette Sr., who was the Progressive Party presidential candidate in 1924, was a social reformer. Former Republican Govs. Lee Dreyfus signed the nation’s first statewide gay rights bill in 1982 and Thompson reformed welfare in the 1990s.

That approach changed in 2010, when advocates of small government took over the party. Besides Walker’s victory, tea party candidate Ron Johnson beat liberal Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold, and control of both houses of the Legislature flipped from the Democrats to Republicans. Walker won by 7 points in his recall victory two months ago.

“A number of us have been talking about these big, bold ideas for years,” Walker said in an interview. “In 2010, it kind of all came together.”

Walker said that as they rose in the party, he, Ryan and Priebus, who are all in their 40s, talked about the need for Republican candidates to focus almost exclusively on plans for fixing the state and nation’s economic and fiscal woes. While Walker drew up his controversial budget cut proposal for the state, Ryan advanced a congressional plan for overhauling federal entitlement programs, including converting Medicare to a voucher system. Ryan’s selection for the GOP ticket has made his plan a centerpiece of the presidential campaign.

“We’re all going to talk about essentially the same thing, we’re going to repeat it over and over again, and more importantly than that, we acted on it,” Walker said. “This has become the testing ground for bold reform ideas.”

Democrats insist the GOP swing will prove short-lived after voters see that the conservative policies don’t produce prosperity or address average people’s needs. The Wisconsin economy, still dependent on manufacturing, has continued to struggle, with unemployment at 7.3 in July. Walker is also falling far short of his stated goal of creating 250,000 jobs over four years.

“2010 was a fluke,” said Matt Canter, a Wisconsin native and spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “The recall was an isolated incident. … In a presidential year Wisconsin voters will favor the same values and priorities that they have for many decades.”

Wisconsin is among a group of Midwest states pivotal to the presidential race. Both campaigns are showering money and attention on the region, especially Ohio, Iowa and Michigan, where Republicans also made gains in 2010. Recent polls that showed Obama with a small lead over Romney in Wisconsin were conducted before Ryan’s selection as Romney’s running mate.

Obama’s campaign has had a head start in the state. It has opened more than 40 offices and briefly aired television ads here; Romney’s campaign has 25 offices and is tapping into the network Republicans used to help Walker beat back the recall attempt.

Democrat Tom Barrett, the Milwaukee mayor who lost to Walker in both 2010 and in the recall, said Ryan’s selection could make the state more closely contested.

“Up to this point, it has certainly not been a battleground state in terms of resources,” Barrett said. “Both sides will ratchet it up in Wisconsin.”

Wisconsin residents have grown used to, and a little fatigued, by the attention.

“We’re kind of like the political weather vane,” said high school English teacher Dream Gunther, 38, of Milwaukee, an Obama supporter. “We’re at the forefront of change.”"
3025,3025,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/23/donald-trump-wins-nevada-caucuses/,Right,"Businessman Donald Trump easily won the Nevada GOP caucuses Tuesday, rolling to his third straight victory in the 2016 nomination race and giving him extra momentum heading into the delegate-rich Super Tuesday contests next week.

CNN called the race for Mr. Trump minutes after the first results became available though the battle for second between Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas went on into the morning.

Still, Mr. Trump was outpolling his two nearest rivals combined in early returns, raising doubts about the effectiveness of any “Stop Trump” movement.

With 100 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Trump had 45.9 percent of the vote, with Mr. Rubio at 23.8 percent and Mr. Cruz at 21.3 percent. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson was at 4.8 percent and Ohio Gov. John Kasich trailing at 3.6 percent.

“We love Nevada,” Mr. Trump said as he came out for his victory speech.

“We will be celebrating for a long time tonight — have a good time,” Mr. Trump said, whipping his supporters into a fervor.

QUIZ: Yes, Trump Said It.

“A couple of months ago, we weren’t expected to win this one, you know that right? We weren’t,” he said. “Of course, if you listen to the pundits, we weren’t expected to win too much, and now we are winning, winning winning … and soon the country is going to start winning, winning, winning.”

Mr. Trump appeared to capitalize on voter frustration with Washington, with entrance polls showing that about six in 10 caucus voters wanted a candidate from outside the political establishment and were “angry” with the federal government.

Mr. Trump won 70 percent of those who wanted an outsider and 49 percent who said they were angry. He even won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in Tuesday’s contest.

Thirty delegates to the Republican National Convention were at stake.

The victory followed wins in New Hampshire and South Carolina, which together helped erased a lot of the doubts about Mr. Trump’s candidacy that arose from his distant second place showing to Mr. Cruz in the Iowa caucuses.

Turnout was at a record pace, which overwhelmed some caucus sites and creating some disputes early in the evening. CNN said the number of early registrants alone exceeded the entire turnout for the 2012 caucuses, indicating Mr. Trump drove first-time voters to the caucuses.

The results could intensify the battle between Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz, each of whom could benefit from pushing the other one out of the race.

Mr. Rubio had already moved on to Minnesota, where he has landed endorsements from the state’s former Gov. Tim Pawlenty and former Sen. Norm Coleman, as well as Rep. Jeff Kline.

Speaking in Minneapolis, Mr. Rubio once again touted his ability to unify the party.

“This cannot be an election about nominating someone just to making a point,” he said. “This cannot be an election about nominating someone because they seem angrier than everybody else. We are all angry. We are frustrated, but you have to solve a problem.”

But the sniping among the non-Trump candidates showed no sign of abating early Wednesday morning. Even before the final tally was known, the Cruz and Kasich campaigns were taking aim at Mr. Rubio.

“Marco Rubio started working early and put a significant amount of resources into making Nevada the one early state he could win, the Cruz camp said in a statement. “But despite the hype, Rubio still failed to beat Donald Trump.”

Kasich spokesman Jon Weaver said, “Republicans are now left to wonder whether investing in Marco Rubio is throwing good money after bad,” explaining that his boss is a better long-term investment.

“We continue to increase our financial and political support as more and more Republican leaders recognize the wisdom of our strategy and believe that Governor Kasich has the right combination of experience, authenticity and general election appeal to become President,” he said.

For his part, Mr. Cruz has endured his roughest stretch in the race, following a disappointing third-place showing in South Carolina and his decision to ask for the resignation of campaign spokesman for circulating an inaccurate video that appeared to show Mr. Rubio dismissing the Bible.

The episode has provided more ammunition for Mr. Cruz’s rivals who have had a field day accusing him of relying on “dirty tricks” — an attack that started to resonate in the wake of the Iowa caucuses, where members of his team told voters that Mr. Carson was ending his bid before the Iowa caucuses, citing his scheduled return to his home in Florida.

On Tuesday night, Mr. Cruz told supporters that the first four nominating contests have shown the “undeniable reality” that the “only campaign that has beaten Donald Trump and the only campaign that can beat Donald Trump is this campaign.”

“If you are one of the 65 percent of Republicans across the country who doesn’t think Donald is the best candidate to go head-to-head with Hillary [Clinton], who believes we do better in elections when we actually nominate a conservative — then the first four states have performed a vital function of narrowing this race and presenting a clear choice,” Mr. Cruz said.

“You can chose between two Washington deal-makers or one proven consistent conservative,” he said, distinguishing himself from Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio.

Looking forward, Mr. Cruz said the Super Tuesday contests will be the “most important night of the campaign.”

It underscored how much he has riding on the March 1 contests, which include his home state of Texas and a slew of other Southern state — including Alabama, Georgia, Oklahoma and Tennessee — that have large evangelical populations that Mr. Cruz has targeted.

Polls, though, show Mr. Trump also is running strong in several of those contests, as well as in Alaska, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Vermont and Virginia, which also host March 1 contests.

Before that, the candidates are scheduled to meet Thursday for a debate at the University of Houston hosted by CNN and Telemundo.

3028,3028,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/28/trump-goes-on-defense-over-mussolini-quote-david-d/,Right,"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump was grilled Sunday on his opinion of Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini and white nationalist David Duke, after both popped up in references to his campaign.

Mr. Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard and former member of the Louisiana State Legislature, has endorsed the billionaire businessman, but Mr. Trump pleaded ignorance when asked about the endorsement.

“Just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK?” Mr. Trump said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists.”

Asked if he would condemn the endorsement, Mr. Trump said, “I’d have to look at the group. I don’t know what group you’re talking about. You wouldn’t want me to condemn the group that I know nothing about.”

Later Sunday, Mr. Trump, who leads the Republican presidential field entering the Super Tuesday primary, defended a Mussolini quote posted Sunday on his Twitter account: “It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.”

“It’s OK to know it’s Mussolini. Look, Mussolini was Mussolini,” Mr. Trump said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “It’s a very good quote, it’s a very interesting quote. I saw it, I don’t know who said it, but what difference does it make whether it’s Mussolini or somebody else? It’s certainly a very interesting quote.”

Asked if he wants to be “associated with a fascist,” Mr. Trump said, “No, I want to be associated with interesting quotes. I have almost 14 million people between Instagram and Facebook and Twitter and all of that, and we do interesting things.”

“Hey, it got your attention, didn’t it?” he added.

3030,3030,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/27/hillary-clinton-camp-upbeat-despite-low-voter-turn/,Right,"COLUMBIA, South Carolina — The mood was excited and merry at the Hillary Clinton’s campaign headquarters at midday, with state official reporting light turnout in Saturday’s Democratic presidential primary that likely helps her score another win.

Mrs. Clinton led rival Sen. Bernard Sanders by more than 20 percent in most polls heading into the first-in-the-South primary election, and Mr. Sanders had all but given up on the state and shifted focus to crucial multi-state contests that begin with Super Tuesday next week.

“I’m feeling very good. I’ve never felt so relaxed before a primary before,” said Lana Moresky, a volunteer who traveled from Columbus, Ohio, to work for the Clinton campaign in South Carolina.

“I just want it to be 20 percent,” added Eve Stacey, a volunteer from the Columbia area, referring to the margin of victory

Mrs. Clinton’s advantage in South Carolina comes from her expected overwhelming support from black voters, who make up about 55 percent of the state’s Democratic primary electorate.

Mr. Sander hopes to close the gap with Mrs. Clinton in the Palmetto State to blunt her momentum and demonstrate his viability heading into the March contests, when more than enough delegates to clinch the nomination will be at stake.

State election officials said turnout appeared generally low throughout the state, although there likely would be pockets of high turnout in places such as Charleston, S.C.

3034,3034,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/28/donald-trumps-dominance-leaves-republican-establis/,Right,"NEWS ANALYSIS:

With a few big-name GOP regulars, from moderate New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to conservative stalwart Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, now endorsing the agile Donald Trump, the billionaire businessman continues to flummox his party’s lumbering establishment.

The party’s powerful few — and for its own reasons much of the press — have argued for grabbing hold of one or another proposed plan to stop Mr. Trump. Some in the establishment find math getting in the way and already are planning for a brokered convention.

“Many Republican political elites out to stop Trump want all but one of his rivals to bail now,” said Dan Schneider, executive director of the American Conservative Union.

The one-on-one longing has a last-gasp air about it, said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a former candidate who upon his exit backed Jeb Bush’s campaign. “There’s this desire, verging on panic, to consolidate the field,” he said recently.

But Republicans not possessed of that desire see the writing on the tower and like it. “Trump is the next president of the United States,” said A.J. Spiker, a former Iowa Republican Party Chairman and an adviser to Sen. Rand Paul’s nomination bid.

The party regulars see the same writing on the tower. They hiss and plan last stands and counteroffensives.

“The key for Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, and to a lesser extent Gov. John Kasich, is to at least cut into Trump’s margins on Super Tuesday,” said delegate-allocation expert Jim Ellis, who was a political adviser to then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay.

“The important point to remember is that the eventual nominee must secure a majority of delegates, not just top the field in the primaries and caucuses,” he said.

“With three viable candidates remaining in the race, and a fourth who could score some delegates in northern states on Super Tuesday March 1 and [on] March 8, when Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii vote, it is still quite possible that Trump will finish first when the primaries conclude, but still be short of the necessary number of committed delegates.”

“Therefore, denying Trump a majority and forcing a brokered convention could soon become a conscious strategy for the Rubio and Cruz campaigns to implement,” Mr. Ellis said.

The theory behind One-on-One Strategy, Mr. Schneider said, is that it will allow Mr. Rubio — or a John Kasich, as the party establishment’s second choice — to run solo, without other rivals diluting his support, and helping Mr. Rubio get a delegate majority before the July nominating convention in Cleveland.

The problem with that idea is that Mr. Trump looks likely to finish far ahead of any of the remaining candidates in all the coming contests. The exception is Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas who is expected to win his home-state primary and a hefty share of its delegates Tuesday, giving him some bounce and incentive beyond mere ego to stay the course. However, Mr. Cruz is second only to Mr. Trump on the party leadership’s hit list.

Some strategists figure a better bet is for all Trump rivals to stay in the contest to accumulate their share of delegates, deny Mr. Trump a delegate majority and force a contested or “brokered” convention.

The theory that anti-Trump establishment has a built-in edge in a brokered convention also has its risks.

“Many political elites are playing Russian roulette with this election,” said Mr. Schneider of the ACU. “Some are trying to figure out how to deny Donald Trump the nomination, either by reducing the field to create a one-on-one primary, or by keeping the field large to siphon off as many votes from him as possible.”

This approach is designed to produce a contested convention, but a convention where nobody meets the delegate threshold would likely stress the Republican’s already strained electoral coalition even more, Mr. Schneider said.

“A year ago the elites thought they could shorten the election to select a particular nominee quickly,” Mr. Schneider said. “Now they’re considering protracting the election to select a particular nominee slowly.”

Mr. Spiker thinks that if the party establishment takes the nomination away from Mr. Trump at a brokered convention, it would risk destroying the party in order to save it — from Mr. Trump.

Mr. Schneider warned that the “elites need to learn that citizens don’t like being manipulated and they will not be ignored. They will stay home on Election Day.”

The problem is that although Mr. Rubio is the most popular second choice in most polls, he hasn’t won any of the four contests so far and may not win any of the 12 primaries and caucuses scheduled for Tuesday. The same is true of Mr. Kasich.

Mr. Rubio and Mr. Kasich also are both long shots in the 11 additional contests after Super Tuesday and before March 15 — the date on which state parties can grant all their delegates to the candidate who gets the most votes.

That means by the time Mr. Rubio and Mr. Kasich reach March 15, when eight states and two territories vote, they may have lost 27 consecutive caucuses and primaries. Mr. Cruz has Iowa under his belt and may have Texas and one more by then.

To stake the stop-Trump strategy on either Mr. Rubio or Mr. Kasich defeating him in two-man race seems a less-than-sound bet.

Which turns analysts back to that second stop-Trump plan, which rests on the opposite premise — keeping all five remaining candidates in the contest all the way to the last four primaries on June 7. That means Mr. Trump, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Kasich and Mr. Cruz (and perhaps last-placing Ben Carson) will divide up the 2,472 delegates to the July 18-21 Republican National Convention in Cleveland. And no one will have the 1,237-delegate majority needed for nomination on the first ballot.

From the second ballot on, delegates previously committed to a particular candidate are free to vote for anyone they choose. As are the 437 unpledged delegates who are party “regulars,” comprised of the 168 members of the Republican National Committee plus 269 current and former office-holders.

Sounds like a plan, but for the reasons Mr. Schneider and others suggest, not exactly a foolproof one.

3035,3035,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/29/donald-trump-eyes-super-tuesday-landslide-as-repub/,Right,"ATLANTA — The GOP presidential field mounted a last-ditch effort to derail Donald Trump ahead of Super Tuesday’s slate of primaries, with Sen. Marco Rubio demanding the billionaire businessman begin making his signature clothing lines in the U.S., while Sen. Ted Cruz accused him of plotting to go back on his vow to deport illegal immigrants.

Stunned by polls showing Mr. Trump easily leading in most of the dozen states that vote Tuesday — and a new poll showing him approaching majority support among Republicans nationwide — Republican leaders, strategists and candidates pleaded with voters to back away from Mr. Trump.

But Mr. Trump is also starting to build momentum among some of those leaders, having earned the support in the last week of six governors or members of Congress, as well as other lower-ticket state officials who say his stance on immigration makes him the only viable candidate for the GOP.

“Now, more than ever, America needs Mr. Trump’s aggressive approach to the problem of illegal immigration,” Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the architect of many of the state-level immigration crackdown proposals in recent years, said in a statement adding himself to Mr. Trump’s list of supporters.

Voters also continue to build support behind Mr. Trump, with a CNN/ORC survey of registered Republicans and GOP-leaners showing him with 49 percent of the vote nationally. That suggests that Mr. Trump was right in saying that he would pick up supporters when other candidates withdrew from the race, such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

Mr. Trump began celebrating early at a rally in Valdosta, Georgia.

“Tomorrow is a big day and I want you to lead the pack,” he told the crowd at Valdosta State University. “We are going to have a lot of success.”

Hitting on familiar campaign themes, the real estate mogul and reality TV star lamented that the U.S. does not win in trade, at the border, in education or in fighting ISIS. And he vowed as president to reverse that losing streak.

“You are going to look back and you’re going to say that was an evening when we really became great again,” said Mr. Trump, his voice rising. “We are going to win at every single level. We are going to win at the borders. We are going to win with our military. We are going to win, win, win. We are going to make America great again — greater than ever before.”

Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz were desperate to find a hole in Mr. Trump’s armor, and took aim at his populist positions on immigration and trade, telling voters the businessman is trying to defraud voters.

Mr. Cruz, joined later in the day by Mr. Rubio, demanded Mr. Trump call The New York Times editorial board and get it to release the tape or transcript of an off-the-record session they held in January. According to a report on BuzzFeed.com, Mr. Trump may have told the paper he’s willing to be more flexible on his strict immigration stance.

“I call on Donald: Ask The New York Times to release the tape,” Mr. Cruz told reporters. “And do so today, before the Super Tuesday primary.”

The paper told BuzzFeed it would decide what to do if Mr. Trump did call for its release.

Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz are battling to be the candidate the anti-Trump forces rally behind. But neither has shown any inclination to withdraw and create the one-on-one matchup that could derail Mr. Trump.

“There is only one campaign that has beaten, and that can beat, Donald Trump,” Mr. Cruz said again ahead of a Texas rally on Tuesday.

He said he’s leading Mr. Trump in polling in Texas and running “neck-and-neck” with him in the other Super Tuesday states. But polling suggests a more complicated picture, with some surveys showing Mr. Trump running almost even with Mr. Cruz in Texas. And Mr. Rubio tops Mr. Cruz in the latest polling in most of the other Super Tuesday states.

Still, Mr. Rubio trails Mr. Trump in his own home state of Florida, which votes March 15.

Mr. Rubio made a last-ditch appeal at a rally in Atlanta, warning that Mr. Trump was conning Republican voters and that he could not win the White House in a general election.

“A vote for Donald Trump tomorrow is a vote for Hillary Clinton in November,” said Mr. Rubio, his voice hoarse from nonstop campaigning.

“I will go to all 50 states and every territory. I will continue to speak out until I literally have no voice left,” he said. “I will go anywhere and speak to anyone before I will let a con artist get ahold of the Republican nomination.”

The crowd responded enthusiastically. And yet, their fervor was dampened by the daunting task confronting their candidate, who trails in Georgia and every other Super Tuesday state.

The Rubio campaign is hoping he can place second in most of the contests, giving him a reason to fight on to Florida.

“I just keep hoping,” said Rubio supporter Jenna Tagliaferri, 49. “I hope he doesn’t give up and Cruz will drop out first.”

Mr. Trump, meanwhile, continues to fan the flames of the civil war within the GOP.

Evangelical leaders begged their flock not to back him, with the Christian Post penning an editorial calling the businessman “misogynist and a philanderer.” But Mr. Trump continues to do very well among evangelical voters.

At the same time, Mr. Trump is holding his own among moderate GOP voters, and has been helped by defending the non-abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood, according to Democracy Corps, a Democratic firm.

“When Trump is talking Planned Parenthood, he knows something,” said Stan Greenberg, the Democracy Corps pollster.

Mr. Greenberg said the divisions within the GOP are deep, and could explode in a disastrous way for Republicans come November.

Sen. Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican, underscored the potential split when he announced he would not be able to support Mr. Trump as the GOP’s nominee. In a battle between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton, Mr. Sasse said he’d find a third candidate.

At the same time, Mr. Trump has begun to win the backing of other Republicans. After entering last week without a single governor or member of Congress supporting him, he now has three House members, Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Paul LePage of Maine, and Sen. Jeff Sessions backing his campaign.

The endorsements of Mr. Sessions and Mr. Kobach could be particularly important, joining that of Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Together the three represent the chief faces of the push to crack down illegal immigration at the federal state and local levels.

Mr. Kobach said Mr. Trump “stands head and shoulders above the other candidates” when it comes to toughness on illegal immigration.

He even said he had thoughts for ways Mr. Trump could live up to his pledge to make Mexico pay for the border wall, including using a section of the USA Patriot Act to dock some of the billions of dollars in remittances Mexicans working in the U.S. send back home to Mexico every year.

3042,3042,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/1/donald-trump-drives-republican-turnout-to-record-d/,Right,"Republicans continued to shatter turnout records in their presidential primaries and caucuses Tuesday, while Democrats lagged behind in what analysts said was a clear indication of an enthusiasm gap heading into the general election.

Virginia’s GOP primary tallied more than 1 million votes, shattering the record set in 2000 by more than 50 percent. Democrats, meanwhile, were 200,000 votes shy of their own record, set in the contested 2008 primary.

In Tennessee, GOP turnout crossed the 800,000-vote mark, leapfrogging the previous record by nearly 50 percent.

Records were also likely to be set in Georgia, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Massachusetts.

Democrats, though, were struggling, seeing turnout drop by massive levels in all of their races Tuesday night. That included Vermont and Arkansas, where their two candidates had home-state advantages of sorts, yet still couldn’t match the enthusiasm of the 2008 contest.

GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump said he’s the chief reason for the shifts in both parties, saying he’s drawn Democrats and independents into the Republican process this year, boosting his party at the expense of Democrats.

“The Republicans have tremendous energy. The Democrats don’t,” he said at his victory party.

All told, about a dozen states held caucuses or primaries on Tuesday.

The strong GOP showings Tuesday follow record turnout in the first four contests: Republican turnout in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada was up 27 percent compared to 2012.

By contrast Democrats’ turnout is down 25 percent compared to their record-setting 2008 campaign, when then-candidate Barack Obama faced off against Hillary Clinton, who is trying again this year.

That 2008 campaign saw contests on both sides of the aisle, and vote-counters said the deep interest in Democrats’ race that year drew voters away from the GOP and into the Democratic primary.

Mr. Obama won the nomination and went on to an easy victory in November, drawing minorities and young voters into the process.

Analysts said the enthusiasm this year is on the Republican side, and said Mr. Trump is driving much of it. They also said they expect that enthusiasm to carry over as the race continues.

“I think it’s a harbinger of things to come,” said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University. “All those people who line up for Donald Trump rallies and also lining up at the ballot box and the caucus site. Trump’s winning and nothing succeeds like success.”

Turnout has been strong for Republicans across the board. Iowa, which kicked off the campaign season, saw a 50 percent increase for Republicans over their previous record. Indeed, turnout was so high that Mr. Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio, the second- and third-place finishers, got enough votes that they would have won in any previous year.

Democrats, though, said they’re still happy with their turnout.

Luis Miranda, the Democratic National Committee’s communications director, who has been tracking turnout, says it’s unfair to compare the GOP’s turnout, spread among a big field of candidates, to Democrats’ turnout, with just two candidates still in the race.

“While turnout for Republicans in these early contests has increased over their previous baseline, it has NOT matched the level of spending or the size of their field,” he wrote in a memo last week.

“The 80,000 Democrats turned out to caucus across Nevada by just TWO Democrats was more than the 75,000 Republicans who were turned out by SIX Republicans. In New Hampshire TWO Democrats turned out 247,000 voters, while EIGHT Republicans turned out just 279,000. And in Iowa TWO Democrats turned out nearly as many caucus-goers as ELEVEN Republicans,” Mr. Miranda wrote.

3051,3051,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/8/bernie-sanders-wins-michigan-primary-major-upset/,Right,"Sen. Bernard Sanders scored a major upset victory in Michigan on Tuesday night, defeating presidential primary rival Hillary Clinton and notching a symbolic win that may breathe new life into his underdog campaign.

Despite weeks of polling that showed Mr. Sanders down by double digits, networks called the race for the Vermont senator late Tuesday night.

With 94 of precincts reporting, Mr. Sanders had 50 of the vote compared to 48 for Mrs. Clinton.

The win clearly surprised the Sanders campaign. The senator himself wasn’t even in the state and instead had addressed supporters in Florida earlier in the evening.

When it became clear he was likely to win in Michigan, Mr. Sanders made a brief impromptu speech in Miami.

“What tonight means is the Bernie Sanders campaign, the people’s revolution we are talking about, the political revolution we are talking about, is strong in every part of the country and frankly we believe our strongest areas are yet to come,” he said. “We are going to very well on the West Coast and other parts of the country. What the American people are saying is they are tired of a corrupt campaign finance system and Super PACs funded by Wall Street and the billionaire class.”

VOTE NOW: Should Marco Rubio drop out of GOP race

In an email blast Tuesday night, Progressive Democrats of America, which had been boosting a Sanders challenge since 2013, exulted with extra capital letters that “Our Bernie Sanders Movement Erased a YUGE 20 Point Lead to Win in Michigan! NINE States for Bernie…and Counting!”

Besides soliciting support in the form of cash and volunteers, the group warned that “with Donald Trump’s hateful campaign approaching victory in the Republican primaries, we need Bernie as our champion. National polls show Bernie can beat Trump easily.”

For Mrs. Clinton — who still will win more delegates Tuesday than will Mr. Sanders, thanks to her landslide win in Mississippi — the result in Michigan raises new questions about the strength of her campaign heading into next week’s slate of contests.

The key Midwestern states of Ohio and Illinois go to the polls March 15, and the Clinton campaign is counting on wins in those states and others to continue putting distance between the former secretary of state and Mr. Sanders in the all-important delegate count.

3060,3060,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/13/trump-defends-boisterous-rallies-says-theres-been-/,Right,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump defended his campaign rallies Sunday, arguing that there have been “zero” injuries and that he in no way incites his supporters to violence.

“I think in many cases I do lower the temperature,” Mr. Trump said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

He said that he does not spur his supporters to violence against protesters, arguing that despite “rallies of 25,000, 30,000 people, we haven’t even said anything about danger in our rallies.”

“Other than for the other day with Chicago and the one man who rushed the stage, with thousands of people … in Alabama, how many people have been injured at my rallies?” Mr. Trump said. “Zero. Zero.”

Mr. Trump bashed CNN host Jake Tapper and fellow anchor John King for “unfair” media coverage of his rallies.

The flamboyant businessman’s rallies have of late been scrutinized for incidents of violence, including two in the last week. On Tuesday, campaign spokesman Corey Lewandowski allegedly assaulted Breitbart news reporter Michelle Fields. On Friday, Mr. Trump cancelled a rally in Chicago when supporters and demonstrators got into fights and protests in the streets.

In early February, Mr. Trump told an audience that there were protesters with tomatoes in the audience and encouraged them to “knock the hell” out of them.

“So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of ‘em, would you?” He said. “Seriously, OK? Just knock the hell — I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise. I promise.”

Later that month, he said of a protester being escorted out of a rally, “I’d like to punch him in the face, I tell ya.”

But Mr. Trump on Sunday said that violence has been blown out of proportion, a lot of it at the hands of his nominee rivals who are trying to halt his meteoric rise.

“They are losing big league,” he said. “If Florida, we have a man, Marco Rubio, who doesn’t even show up to vote in the U.S. Senate. I don’t think he could be elected dog catcher in Florida.”

He also pointed to Vermont Sen. Bernard Sanders’ supporters in the Democratic nomination contest as a cause of the violence and threatened to return the favor, tweeting Sunday morning: “Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren’t told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!”

Mr. Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland, the 63-year-old chief judge of U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to fill the vacancy created by last month’s death of Scalia, a staunch conservative.

But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said voters in November’s elections should have a voice in who fills the seat. He said there will be no meetings, no hearings and no votes on Judge Garland.

Mr. Reid said Senate Republicans facing re-election already are cracking under pressure and want to meet with Judge Garland, instead of rolling the dice on a pick by Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton or flamboyant businessman Donald Trump, who leads the GOP nominating race.

“I don’t know why McConnell has done this to his senators,” Mr. Reid told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “He’s marching these men, women over a cliff, and I don’t think they’re gonna go.”

Democratic operatives have pointed to a series of polls that suggest the American people want the Senate to act on the nominee instead of waiting until next year.

Mr. Reid also downplayed statements he made a decade ago, in which he said the Senate isn’t bound to hold votes on judicial nominees.

Supreme Court picks such as Robert Bork and sitting Justice Clarence Thomas at least made it to the floor, he argued Sunday, and said the GOP shouldn’t get a pass for making a political calculation his own party might have made, if the tables were turned.

“Of course I blame them, of course I do … Their excuses are lame,” Mr. Reid said.

3075,3075,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/15/bernie-sanders-vows-to-persevere-despite-hillary-c/,Right,"Hillary Clinton took a giant step toward clinching her party’s presidential nomination Tuesday night, completely dominating the South with big wins in the Florida and North Carolina primaries and proving she can win in the Midwestern heartland with victories in Ohio and Illinois over Democratic rival Sen. Bernard Sanders.

With her win in Ohio and Illinois and a strong showing in Missouri, Mrs. Clinton abruptly halted all the momentum Mr. Sanders had built up with his surprise win in Michigan last week, and she is quickly closing off all of the Vermont senator’s potential pathways to the Democratic nomination.

The former secretary of state’s already massive lead in the all-important delegate race will grow after her string of wins, and she told her supporters Tuesday night that the nomination is within sight as she increasingly turns her focus toward November’s general election. She made the case again Tuesday night that she has the right experience to be president and can actually deliver for the American people once in the Oval Office, and she took veiled shots at Mr. Sanders’ ambitious, expensive proposals.

“We are moving closer to securing the Democratic Party nomination and winning this election in November,” she told supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida. “Every candidate makes promises but every candidate owes it to you to be clear and direct about what our plans will cost and how we’re going to make them work. That’s the difference between running for president and being president.”

Speaking to his supporters Tuesday night in Arizona, Mr. Sanders hinted that he’s content with losing the race to Mrs. Clinton as long as his campaign’s relentless focus on Wall Street reform and income inequality have an impact on the party’s larger agenda.

“If you want to vote for me, great. If you don’t, that’s OK,” he said. “But what I do not want to see is billionaires spending unlimited sums of money buying elections and undermining the democracy which has made our country so great.”

In North Carolina, with about 92 percent of the vote in, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Sanders 54.6 percent to 40.7 percent. In Florida, with more than 98 percent of precincts in, Mrs. Clinton had 64.5 percent to 33.3 percent for Mr. Sanders.

In Ohio, Mrs. Clinton pulled out a decisive win. With 91 percent of the vote in, Mrs. Clinton had 56.5 percent to 42.7 percent for Mr. Sanders.

With 94 percent of the precincts reporting in Illinois, Mrs. Clinton was beating rival Mr. Sanders 50.6 percent to 48.6 percent and was projected as the winner by CNN.

The primary in Missouri was still too close to call as of 12:30 a.m.

In her victory speech, Mrs. Clinton said the next president must not “embarrass” this country, a clear shot at GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump, possibly previewing the November matchup.

“We should be breaking down barriers, not building walls,” she said, taking aim at Mr. Trump’s plan to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall. “Our next commander in chief has to be able to defend our country, not embarrass it; engage our allies, not alienate them.”

For Mr. Sanders, Tuesday’s defeats leave him with little in the way of a realistic path to the nomination. The senator has promised to stay in the race all the way until the Democratic Party convention in July, but the delegate math is not on his side and the momentum is now firmly with the Clinton campaign again.

Mr. Sanders has struggled to compete with Mrs. Clinton among minority voters and has been riding strong support among working-class white Democrats to victories in states such as New Hampshire, Kansas, Minnesota and Kansas.

Even with his already slim chances greatly diminished after Tuesday’s results, Mr. Sanders has given little indication he’ll give up the fight, and is given a good chance of scoring some victories in the next round of primaries through the end of the month.

But Mrs. Clinton will emerge from Tuesday’s contests having added to her substantial lead in the delegate count.

Heading into Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Sanders among pledged delegates — those awarded as a result of actual voting — by 214. Including superdelegates, the party officials who are free to support whomever they choose, Mrs. Clinton’s lead is much greater, 1,235 to 580.

About 691 delegates were at stake in Tuesday’s contests, though Democratic Party rules award delegates proportionally.

Because of her convincing wins in Florida, North Carolina and Ohio and her narrow victory in Illinois, Mrs. Clinton will increase her lead over Mr. Sanders significantly.

Mr. Sanders’ supporters, however, believe the senator will stick to his pledge to fight on all the way to the convention.

“Don’t count us out. We’re a long way from naming our nominee,” said Eva Brandt, who voted for Mr. Sanders Tuesday in Palm Beach, Florida.

Electability concerns

While Mrs. Clinton again trailed badly among young voters, she seems to be picking up at least some voters who identify with Mr. Sanders ideologically but doubt the senator’s ability to actually win a general election in November.

“I love Bernie and he’s been raising a lot of important issues, but he’s just not electable,” said Len Barrack, a Jupiter, Florida, resident who cast his ballot for Mrs. Clinton. “In primaries, both parties get pulled further to the left and further to the right. Once we get into the general, we’ll see both sides move more toward the center.”

Some voters even go so far as to say they believe Mr. Sanders has a better platform and is a more authentic candidate, but they still voted for Mrs. Clinton.

“I’m more liberal, so I love what Bernie stands for and is about — he’s more authentic,” said Deborah Owen, 64, of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. “But I want someone who is going to win and continue [President] Obama’s issues, and that’s Hillary.”

But Tuesday’s results also highlight a number of ongoing challenges for Mrs. Clinton, not the least of which is her inability to inspire voters in the way Mr. Sanders has. Not only is she faring poorly among young voters, she also continues to do poorly among voters who say they’re looking for a new direction or more liberal policies.

Mrs. Clinton consistently does well among those who want the next president to continue President Obama’s policies, exit polls show, but Mr. Sanders leads among those who want the next Democratic president to go even further.

Joe Chuk, 62, a retired steel mill worker in Struthers, said the way in which Mr. Sanders has inspired young Democrats with his progressive message is striking.

“Let these young people have who they want,” he said. “Right now I’m voting for Bernie Sanders, and not that I wouldn’t vote for Hillary in the end, but I guess I’d just say I’m looking for different blood.”

The battle in the Midwest between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton had turned nasty over the past several weeks as the former first lady sought to recover from her shock defeat last week in Michigan.

Leading up to Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders had battled over manufacturing, trade and the federal government’s bailout of the auto industry. The Sanders campaign had launched a prolonged assault highlighting Mrs. Clinton’s support of trade deals such as NAFTA, which Mr. Sanders argues did irreparable harm to states such as Ohio and Illinois. Mr. Sanders even dubbed Mrs. Clinton the “outsourcer in chief.”

Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, rolled out her own Midwestern strategy: paint Mr. Sanders as an opponent of the bailout package that saved the U.S. auto industry.

Ahead of the Midwest voting, Mrs. Clinton also had to walk back her promise to “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,” which threatened to turn off voters in coal-dependent Missouri, Ohio and Illinois.

Mrs. Clinton made the comment Sunday on CNN as she touted her climate change and clean-energy agenda.

“I’m the only candidate [who] has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity, using clean renewable energy as the key, into coal country. Because we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,” she said. “We’re going to make it clear that we don’t want to forget those people.”

She came under fire from the coal industry, which noted that coal keeps the lights on in Missouri, Ohio and Illinois, where Mrs. Clinton was locked in tight races with Mr. Sanders.

By Monday night Mrs. Clinton released a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to coal miners as she works to transform America into a “clean energy superpower.”

“I firmly believe that if you spent your life keeping the lights on for our country, we can’t leave you in the dark,” she said. “We need to use every tool we have to build a 21st century energy future that doesn’t leave anyone out or behind.”

3097,3097,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/1/us-gains-215000-jobs-march-unemployment-rises-5-pe/,Right,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers notched another solid month of hiring in March, adding 215,000 jobs. The improvement was driven by large gains in the construction, retail and health care industries.

Despite the jump, the Labor Department says the unemployment rate ticked up to 5 percent from 4.9 percent. But that increase includes some good news: more Americans came off the sidelines to look for work, though not all found jobs.

The figures suggest that employers remain confident enough in their business prospects to add staff, even as overall growth has slowed since last winter. Many analysts estimate that the economy grew at a 1 percent annual rate or below in the first quarter.

The steady hiring lifted average hourly pay, which rose a modest 2.3 percent from a year earlier to $25.43."
3100,3100,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/scott-walker-endorses-ted-cruz-president/,Right,"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz for president Tuesday, giving Mr. Cruz a major boost ahead of the April 5 GOP primary in the Badger State.

“I am proud to endorse Ted Cruz,” Mr. Walker said on WTMJ radio. “After a lot of time looking at speeches, looking at the records, looking at what the candidates not only say but what they have done in the past, it was an easy call for me to support Ted Cruz.”

Many Republicans in recent weeks who have endorsed or supported Mr. Cruz have cited stopping GOP front-runner Donald Trump as part of their calculus. But Mr. Walker said he wanted to make sure he was supporting someone and that he wasn’t against something or someone.

Mr. Walker, who called Mr. Cruz a “constitutional conservative” capable of taking on special interests, said the Texas senator is best positioned both to win the GOP nomination and defeat Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in the fall.

Mr. Walker said he got to know Mr. Cruz a bit better during the campaign.

“He is a decent man, he loves his family, he loves his wife — he adores his children,” Mr. Walker said. “He loves his country. He and I are both preacher’s kids, so I certainly can appreciate and feel strongly about the impact that his father had on him as a minister.”

Mr. Walker also pointed out that he and Mr. Cruz, 45, are both in their 40s, as is House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, 46, who is also from Wisconsin.

“We actually literally came of age under President Ronald Reagan, and I just see someone who’s willing to uphold those same principles, and that’s why I’m proud to endorse,” said Mr. Walker, 48.

In a statement, Mr. Cruz said Mr. Walker has been “an outstanding leader in the conservative movement.”

“Gov. Walker courageously stood up to special interests and won in a bitter fight in Wisconsin,” Mr. Cruz said. “His leadership has made a profound impact on the people of Wisconsin and I welcome his advice on how we can unite the Republican party and defeat Hillary Clinton in November.”

Mr. Cruz, along with Mr. Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, are in Wisconsin this week trying to build support ahead of the state’s primary next Tuesday.

Mr. Walker said he does anticipate campaigning with Mr. Cruz ahead of the primary next week.

“To me, I’m all in,” Mr. Walker said. “This is not a default.”

Mr. Walker had strongly hinted he was thinking about endorsing Mr. Cruz in an interview last week with WTMJ, saying his views would probably be more aligned with those of Mr. Cruz or Mr. Kasich as opposed to Mr. Trump, but that Mr. Cruz was better positioned than Mr. Kasich in terms of the delegate math.

When he suspended his own presidential campaign in September, Mr. Walker had also encouraged other candidates to think about dropping out so voters could focus on a smaller number of candidates “who can offer a positive conservative alternative to the current front-runner.”

In a high school gym in Windham, N.H., Mr. Obama, tie loosened and sleeves rolled up, continued his campaign’s focus on Mr. Romney’s tax bills, and criticized Rep. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman tagged one week ago as Mr. Romney’s running mate.

“Congressman Ryan … he put forward a plan that would allow Governor Romney to pay less than 1 percent in taxes each year,” the president said, drawing boos from the crowd of supporters.

“Their ideas are pretty simple – they’re not hard to explain,” he said at the outdoor rally. “They think … if we do more tax cuts for the very wealthiest Americans, then somehow prosperity’s gonna rain down on all of us.”

A few hours later, in Rochester, N.H., Mr. Obama drew cheers with an energetic defense of the Affordable Care Act, his signature legislative achievement that critics have derisively called “Obamacare.”

The president said he was proud to hear the health care reforms called “Obamacare.”

“Well, I’m not crazy about people disrupting meetings, but the fact of the matter is Secretary Clinton has taken significant sums of money from the fossil fuel industry,” Mr. Sanders of Vermont said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

In a clip posted Thursday by Greenpeace, an activist asks Mrs. Clinton if she would reject fossil fuel money in the future.

“I have money from people who work for fossil fuel companies,” she responded.

“I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me. I’m sick of it,” she said, pointing her finger at the questioner.

“She raises her money with her super PAC, she gets a lot of money from Wall Street, from the drug companies, from the fossil fuel industry,” Mr. Sanders said. “On the other hand, we have received over 6 million individual campaign contributions averaging $27 apiece.

3127,3127,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/17/obama-amnesty-supreme-court-case-to-test-limits-of/,Right,"The Constitution was ratified more than two centuries ago, and in all that time no president had ever tested the limits of executive power enough to force the Supreme Court to rule whether he has lived up to the founders’ command that the laws be “faithfully executed.”

Until now.

When the justices convene Monday morning, they will hear what is shaping up to be the biggest case of the term, and perhaps one of the most consequential in a generation, as they consider whether President Obama has overstepped his constitutional powers by trying to grant a tentative deportation amnesty to up to 5 million illegal immigrants.

“In 225 years, the Supreme Court has never had occasion to ask the president whether he has reneged on his oath to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. However, with pens and phones replacing checks and balances, the Supreme Court is now poised to break new constitutional ground in order to preserve our embattled separation of powers,” said Josh Blackman, associate professor at the South Texas College of Law, who has followed the case from the start and filed amicus briefs opposing Mr. Obama’s claim of powers.

At issue is the Take Care Clause, which is what scholars call the Constitution’s charge to presidents to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”

That clause has been read to be both empowering to presidents, emboldening them with independent authority to see through the execution of laws, but also as a check — that, in the end, he carry out laws rather than write them.

PHOTOS: See Obama's biggest White House fails

For many, Mr. Obama’s deportation amnesty for illegal immigrants, announced in November 2014, strays too far into lawmaking.

At that time, Mr. Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced a policy of granting nearly half of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. a proactive stay of deportation, along with the promise of work permits, entitling them to driver’s licenses, Social Security numbers and some taxpayer benefits.

Texas led 25 other states in suing, arguing that they suffered economic harm from the amnesty and that it would likely lead to even more illegal immigrants. The states said Mr. Obama broke administrative law and immigration law, and violated the Constitution.

Lower courts sided with the states and halted the amnesty on statutory grounds, and never reached the constitutional questions. But the justices, in what Mr. Blackman said was a first, asked both sides to also file briefs on the Take Care Clause.

Immigrant rights advocates say the case should be easy for the justices, pointing to smaller actions taken by Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush that they say paved the way for Mr. Obama. Those advocates say immigration legislation passed by Congress appear to approve of the “deferred action” power Mr. Obama used to halt deportations and grant work permits.

If Congress granted the president that kind of broad authority, then it’s legal and constitutional, said Brianne J. Gorod, chief counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center.

“If the court concludes, as I think it will and should, that these executive actions are consistent with the laws passed by Congress, then it necessarily follows that they are consistent with the Constitution,” she said.

But John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said Mr. Obama’s intention in this instance wasn’t to carry out the law, but rather to undermine it by halting deportations — and granting a future get-out-of-jail card.

“The president gets to make the policy decisions about how the law is enforced. But he can’t take it all the way to say I’m not going to enforce it at all, and I think that’s where the line is crossed,” said Mr. Yoo, who served in the Bush administration and helped explore the limits of presidential war powers.

Mr. Obama has complicated his case by his own words. Before his 2014 announcement, he repeatedly and forcefully denied having the power to use deferred action so broadly. But after Congress refused to act on his immigration proposals, he reversed himself and claimed he did, after all, have the power.

Then just days after he announced the policy, he told an audience he “took an action to change the law” — a power that is supposed to be reserved for Congress.

Lower courts noted both of those statements in ruling against Mr. Obama, but Mr. Yoo said they are not likely to have much effect on the justices. He said it’s similar to how Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. didn’t give much credence during the Obamacare case to the president’s initial claim that the health care law wasn’t a tax.

Indeed, the justices eventually ruled that the reason Obamacare was constitutional is because it was a tax, no matter what Mr. Obama told voters.

Legal analysts said the case could decide the limits of presidential powers for years to come. Mr. Yoo said if the justices side with Mr. Obama, it opens the way for a future Republican president to use prosecutorial discretion to stop enforcing tax laws.

He also said Mr. Obama’s expansive interpretation of carrying out laws could frighten Congress away from dealing with the White House.

“He’s actually damaging the presidency for the future, because if you’re Congress in the future, and you’re working out some deal with the president, you can’t trust any deal you make with the president again,” he said.

A ruling is expected from the justices by the end of June.

But with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the eight-member court could deadlock 4-4. That would leave the appeals court’s decision in place, which would be a victory for Mr. Obama’s opponents.

A tie ruling, though, would also mean the court wouldn’t issue a definitive statement on Mr. Obama’s claims of power. That would leave for a future court the question of just how far a president can go to shape or, as Mr. Obama said, to “change” the law unilaterally.

Ms. Gorod said the justices may not even reach the big issues in the case. She said there is a good chance they throw out Texas’ challenge altogether, ruling that the state can’t show it’s has been harmed by the president’s action.

She said Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy were skeptical of similar claims in other cases.

Hispanic rights groups say the issue is already baked into the November elections no matter what the justices do and that voters are prepared to reward Democrats for backing Mr. Obama and punish Republicans for opposing him.

By a 5-1 margin, Hispanic voters say they are less likely to vote for a candidate who fought the amnesty. They also said they increasingly see Republicans as “hostile” toward Hispanics and view Democrats as “increasingly welcoming,” according to polling conducted by America’s Voice, a major advocacy group for immigrants’ rights.

Mr. Obama has argued that legalizing illegal immigrants and giving them a chance to work could pour billions of dollars into federal and state treasuries, bringing the immigrants into the above-ground economy, where their wages will be higher.

But the legal fight over the amnesty has proved damaging to the president, after the Homeland Security Department admitted it violated a lower court’s order halting the entire program early last year. Judge Andrew S. Hanen is still pondering whether to sanction the Justice Department for its behavior, saying the lawyers misrepresented some facts in the case.

On Friday, the Justice Department insisted it didn’t try to mislead the judge, saying there was an “unintentional miscommunication that occurred here.”

Judge Hanen issued an order in February 2015 keeping Mr. Obama’s broad amnesty from taking effect, and last year a federal appeals court, in a 2-1 decision, upheld that ruling.

3148,3148,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/24/dnc-chair-gops-infighting-far-eclipses-sanders-cli/,Right,"Infighting on the Democratic side of the 2016 presidential race is mild compared to the GOP side, a top party official said Sunday, even as Sen. Bernard Sanders’ attacks on front-runner Hillary Clinton dent her favorability ratings.

Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, said Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, the upstart socialist from Vermont, are sticking to substance, by and large, but she wants both sides to keep an eye on the November election.

“It’s going to get a little more intense, but need to make sure we can focus on the endgame,” Mrs. Schultz told “Fox News Sunday.”

She said the candidates have to make sure their primary attacks don’t make it more difficult for the party to unify against the Republican nominee.

But it’s unclear if Mr. Sanders, who is lagging far behind in delegates, will heed that advice.

Ahead of make-or-break East Coast primaries, Mr. Sanders repeatedly has attacked Mrs. Clinton for failing to stand up to big banks and drug companies, and for declining to release transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street.

Recent polling suggests the attacks are hurting Mrs. Clinton’s favorability ratings, though Mrs. Schultz insisted that is not a problem, since GOP front-runner Donald Trump’s ratings are even worse.

“It pales in comparison to what’s played out on the other side of the aisle,” she said.

She said while Mr. Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz careen toward a floor fight at the GOP convention in Cleveland, her party will coalesce around their nominee.

“Both of our candidates are focused on achieving the same goal,” she said.

3172,3172,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/3/bernie-sanders-wins-indiana-primary/,Right,"Sen. Bernard Sanders captured a surprise win in the Indiana primary Tuesday, giving his campaign more fuel to fight until the Democratic National Convention in July and frustrating Hillary Clinton, who desperately wants to shift into general election mode.

Networks called the race by 9:10 p.m. EDT, just over two hours after the Indiana polls closed. With 84 percent of the vote counted at 10 p.m., Mr. Sanders had 53 percent compared with 47 percent for Mrs. Clinton.

The Indiana win ends an impressive string of victories for Mrs. Clinton, who captured six of the past seven contests heading into Tuesday. The Sanders victory also prolongs a race that the former first lady is eager to put behind her as she turns her attention to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

Despite having little realistic path to his party’s nomination, Mr. Sanders appears intent on remaining in the race to continue pushing Mrs. Clinton further left on issues such as Wall Street reform and income inequality.

Speaking to supporters in Louisville, Kentucky, Mr. Sanders said his message is resonating with key constituencies in the Democratic Party, and that the platform he crafted has struck a chord across the country. He gave no indication that he is taking his foot off the gas pedal anytime soon.

“I’ll tell you what is extremely exciting for me, and that is that in primary after primary, caucus after caucus, we end up winning the vote of people 45 years of age or younger, and that is important because if tells me that the ideas we are fighting for are the ideas for the future of America, and the future of the Democratic Party,” Mr. Sanders said before blasting income inequality, Wall Street, college debt and other issues that have become central themes in his stump speech.

“In America today, we have millions of people working longer hours, for lower wages,” he said. “We have families today where mom is working 40 hours, dad is working 40 hours, the kids are working and they’re still not earning enough money to provide for their family. That is why we are going to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.”

Despite the outcome in Indiana, the race increasingly looks like Mrs. Clinton’s to lose. Heading into Tuesday’s primary, she had a substantial lead over Mr. Sanders in the delegate race, 2,165 to 1,357, according to an Associated Press tally.

Among pledged delegates, Mrs. Clinton still leads 1,645 to 1,318. Among superdelegates, she is ahead 520 to 39.

There are 83 pledged delegates at stake in the Indiana primary, and the state also has nine superdelegates, seven of whom have said they will support Mrs. Clinton.

With such a substantial lead, Mrs. Clinton has made clear that she intends to virtually ignore attacks from the Sanders campaign and will instead focus on the general election, where she almost certainly will face Republican Donald Trump.

Mr. Trump’s chief competition, Sen. Ted Cruz, dropped out of the Republican race Tuesday night after a crushing defeat in Indiana.

“I’m really focused on moving into the general election,” the former first lady told MSNBC on Tuesday. “I think that’s where we have to be, because we’re going to have a tough campaign against a candidate who will literally say or do anything. And we’re going to take him on at every turn on what’s really important to the people of our country.”

But Mrs. Clinton already has stumbled in the early phase of her general election campaign.

On Monday, an out-of-work coal miner confronted Mrs. Clinton in West Virginia and questioned her about past statements that more coal miners will be out of work under her administration and that the entire industry would be put “out of business” as she transitions the nation to clean energy.

Mrs. Clinton was touring Appalachia ahead of next week’s West Virginia primary and the May 17 contest in Kentucky. The two states remain the heart of the U.S. coal industry, and Mrs. Clinton’s comments could carry political consequences in her contests against Mr. Sanders.

At a town hall meeting in West Virginia, she tried to clarify her position.

“I don’t know how to explain it other than what I said was totally out of context from what I meant because I have been talking about helping coal country for a very long time, and I did put out a plan last summer,” she said. “I didn’t mean that we were going to do it. What I said was that is going to happen unless we take action to try to help and prevent it.”

Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, has mounted a campaign aimed at persuading superdelegates to change their minds at the party convention in July, saying he has a better shot at defeating Mr. Trump in the fall than does Mrs. Clinton. Indeed, polls show him faring better against the billionaire businessman than his opponent.

The Sanders campaign also continues to attack Mrs. Clinton on a host of issues, some of which could weaken her in a general election by fueling the notion that she is dishonest and untrustworthy.

On Tuesday, for example, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told supporters that the Clinton campaign is skirting campaign finance laws and misleading Democratic donors by holding joint fundraisers with other Democratic Party organizations.

The system allows donors to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars into the Hillary Victory Fund, which is supposed to benefit both the Clinton campaign and state Democratic parties.

A Politico investigation this week found that about 99 percent of the $61 million raised by the Hillary Victory Fund has been used on the Clinton campaign. The Sanders campaign capitalized by circulating a petition calling on Mrs. Clinton to return millions of dollars to the state party organizations.

“It’s unfortunate that Hillary Clinton has benefited from tens of millions of dollars in cash transfers and advertising to campaign against us in the primary. But it’s not too late for her campaign to do the right thing by the state parties we’re going to need to win elections up and down the ticket this November,” Mr. Weaver said in an email.

3173,3173,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/4/working-class-voters-clinton-fatigue-are-key-donal/,Right,"Donald Trump’s path to victory in November runs through disaffected white working-class voters who Republicans hope can force the election into Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and other states that haven’t been in play for decades.

Analysts said it’s a tricky path fraught with potential pitfalls — not the least of which is Mr. Trump’s brash style, which could alienate millions of moderate and independent voters and help keep minority turnout at the 2008 and 2012 rates that powered President Obama to two victories.

But Mr. Trump’s appeal to economically suffering voters could tap veins in populous Rust Belt states that have voted reliably for Democrats for years.

“Donald Trump could scramble the map,” said Whit Ayres, who served as a pollster for Sen. Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign. “Conceivable he might put some overwhelmingly white states of the Great Lakes region into play for Republicans with a large blue-collar white [voter] turnout.

“But both sides get to play this game,” Mr. Ayres said. “He would also put Republican-leaning states with large nonwhite populations into play given his toxic numbers among Hispanics and African-Americans.”

Mr. Trump solidified himself as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee this week after he chased from the race his last remaining opponents, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

He now begins to prepare for a November showdown — most likely with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who while facing a nagging challenge from Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont is expected to emerge as the Democratic nominee.

A CNN/ORC poll released Wednesday shows the challenge for Mr. Trump, putting him 13 points behind Mrs. Clinton, at 54 percent to 41 percent.

The survey showed Mrs. Clinton claiming 94 percent of self-identified Democrats, while Mr. Trump gets 84 percent of Republicans. Mrs. Clinton also leads 51 percent to 40 percent among independents.

The candidates poll evenly among men, at 47 percent apiece, but women break overwhelmingly for Mrs. Clinton, 61 percent to 35 percent.

Mr. Trump did lead among white voters, 52 percent to 43 percent, but Mrs. Clinton had an overwhelming advantage among racial and ethnic minorities, 81 percent to 14 percent, signaling the importance for her campaign to maximize turnout from those communities.

With the Electoral College controlling the presidential election, the key battles will be state by state. Analysts said Mr. Trump could end up losing traditionally Republican Sun Belt states such as Arizona and Georgia, even as he tries to put Rust Belt states into play.

Democrats in the past four presidential elections have consistently won states that account for 246 electoral votes, close to the 270 needed to win the White House. Republicans won just 179 Electoral College votes from states that supported them in each of the past four elections.

In other words, Mrs. Clinton could win the November election by defending the Democratic strongholds and winning Florida with the help of the state’s Hispanic population, which has been turned off by Mr. Trump’s hard-line stance on immigration.

“The easiest job in American politics in 2016 goes to the Democratic operative tasked to dramatically increase Hispanic participation to stop Donald Trump,” Mr. Ayres said.

Mr. Trump plans to counter by striking out into territory that has voted Democratic in recent elections.

“I’m sure I’ll win Pennsylvania. I’ll win Florida,” he told CNN on Wednesday. “I will put states in play that no other Republican will even talk about or go to.”

He also predicted victory in Michigan and said he will make New York competitive by running up huge margins in the state’s economically challenged areas, such as Buffalo.

But Mr. Trump’s best chance is to try to poison voters against Mrs. Clinton.

“If the election is a referendum on him, you’d have to think he is going to be in a little trouble, but if he successfully makes it a referendum about her, she is toast,” said Michael McKenna, a Republican Party strategist. “She personally can’t stand scrutiny. She is not a very likable person. She is not a very friendly person, and her record is shaky at best.”

Mr. McKenna said working-class voters who have been in the Democratic camp in recent elections could flee to Mr. Trump, and Mrs. Clinton will likely have a smaller share of the black vote than Mr. Obama did in states such as Ohio and Virginia.

Mr. Trump’s path to the nomination also could expand if the fundamentals of the race change through a world event or economic downturn, Mr. McKenna said.

Frank Cannon, president of the American Principles Project, said Mr. Trump has masterfully branded his opponents and will need to do the same to take down Mrs. Clinton.

“He will go right for the jugular,” he said. “He will say, ‘How did you defend the women that your husband brutalized and attacked? You were part of the effort to discredit and hurt those women. How are you the defender of the women?’ So everything will be in bounds, and he will not allow things to be said that are naked strengths of Hillary’s without there being a counterattack.

“The question is: Are his branding skills good enough to work with non-Republicans?” Mr. Cannon said.

Mr. Trump has accused Mrs. Clinton of playing the “women’s card” — suggesting that her eight years as first lady, eight years as a senator from New York and four years as secretary of state have not prepared her for the presidency.

He has already nicknamed her “Crooked Hillary,” a reference to the ongoing investigations into Mrs. Clinton’s violation of State Department policy by keeping a secret email account.

“She should not be allowed to run in the election,” Mr. Trump said Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “She should suffer like other people have suffered who have done far less than she has.”

Mr. Trump also has touted polls showing him running strong against Mrs. Clinton, including a recent George Washington University Battleground poll that showed the former first lady with a 46 percent to 43 percent lead over Mr. Trump.

Ed Goeas, a Republican Party pollster who helped conduct the battleground survey, said the poll included stark warning signs for Mr. Trump — showing Mrs. Clinton up 12 points in the tossup states, with a higher net favorable rating and with more room to grow among undecided voters.

“So, he really has two plays here,” he said. “One is he has to drive her unfavorables up, specifically with conservative Democrats, because quite frankly independents don’t like either one of them. And the other hope has to be that you take that race with independents not liking either one and undecideds not liking either one, maybe they all stay home and that at least makes it a closer race.”

3196,3196,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/19/house-leaders-push-new-puerto-rico-bill/,Right,"House leaders urged members Thursday to rally behind their latest attempt to rescue Puerto Rico from its crippling $72 billion in bond debt, striking a deal to impose more fiscal oversight on the territory but insisting there will be no U.S. taxpayer bailout.

Both Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi endorsed the compromise they struck after weeks of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, who expressed reservations but called it a “comprehensive and workable” solution.

“We got this bill exactly where we wanted it,” Mr. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said. “We wanted to make sure that the restructuring worked, and that the restructuring is done in a way that it prevents any taxpayer bailout, or some precedence that could affect the bond markets. And we’re very confident that we’ve achieved that.”

The bill would impose an oversight board to review Puerto Rico’s fiscal decisions, and ensure that it makes the reforms necessary to reach financial solvency. But Republicans agreed to tweak the way the oversight board members are appointed, and dropped a provision Democrats and environmentalists disliked that would have transferred land on Vieques Island.

Mr. Ryan insisted the bill is not a “bailout,” and will ensure taxpayers don’t end up on the hook for the island’s mistakes.

Yet lawmakers in both parties withheld their support, saying they need to evaluate whether the bill is unfair to creditors or islanders who are reeling from cuts to social services.

Puerto Rico has already defaulted on $370 million in bond payments, and it faces a $1 billion payment on July 1, ratcheting up pressure on Congress to act.

For months, the Natural Resources Committee had been trying to reach a deal. An earlier draft from Chairman Rob Bishop, Utah Republican, drew opposition from Democrats.

Democrats framed the new bill as a breakthrough, even if they didn’t get everything they wanted. Mrs. Pelosi said she failed to remove provisions that could lower the island’s minimum wage or change overtime rules, but noted those provisions are now “less harmful than originally proposed.”

The White House also reacted positively, saying it is imperative that both chambers agree on a product that Mr. Obama can sign.

“We urge members of Congress in both parties to stand firm against the special interests attempting to undermine this essential legislation,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.

But Heritage Action, a conservative pressure group, threw cold water on the bill, saying it didn’t appear to move in a “conservative direction” and failed to “remain neutral in the tussle among creditors.”

Conservatives worry that some bondholders would be forced to swallow a bad deal through restructuring mechanisms in the bill, should voluntary negotiations fail. That would set a bad precedent for states that overextend themselves and seek help, they say.

“Potentially, what could happen was that bondholders could be left holding the bag, and pensioners — people who’ve gotten these very lavish pensions — and unions could come out whole,” said Rep. John Fleming, Louisiana Republican. “Funding those things is what helped get this territory into problems.

3200,3200,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/20/trump-second-amendment-under-threat-never-before/,Right,"LOUISVILLE — Likely GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday slammed Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton as historically hostile to gun rights and warned that Mrs. Clinton will get the chance to appoint up to five U.S. Supreme Court justices if she’s elected president.

“The Second Amendment is under a threat like never before,” Mr. Trump said at the NRA-ILA Leadership Forum at the National Rifle Association’s annual meetings here. “Crooked Hillary Clinton is the most anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment candidate ever to run for office.

“And as I said before, she wants to abolish the Second Amendment,” he said. “She wants to take your guns away.”

Before he spoke, Mr. Trump was officially endorsed by the NRA, which he called a “fantastic honor.”

Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton wants to reverse the 2008 District of Columbia v. Heller U.S. Supreme Court decision that affirmed the individual right to keep and bear arms.

“Hillary said the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. That’s bad,” he said.

Congressional Republicans have said they do not plan to hold hearings or a vote this year on Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama’s pick to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.

Mr. Trump said “it could even be five” judges that the next president will nominate for the high court.

“If she gets to appoint her judges, she will as part of it abolish the Second Amendment,” he said.

Mr. Trump said he plans to add to a list of 11 potential Supreme Court picks he recently released, and said he’d like to call on Mrs. Clinton to release a list of her own.

“I think that in addition to calling for them to name judges, we’ll also call them and let their bodyguards immediately disarm,” he said. “They should immediately disarm. And let’s see how good they do. Let’s see how they feel walking around without their guns [on] their bodyguards.”

Mr. Trump said the Second Amendment is “on the ballot” in November.

“The only way to save our Second Amendment is to vote for a person that you all know named Donald Trump,” he said.

“I will never let you down. I will protect our Second Amendment. I will protect our country,” he said.

3217,3217,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/23/facebook-admits-rogue-employees-may-have-shown-bia/,Right,"Facebook announced this week it was sending employees out for retraining and would discontinue some of its practices as it sought to defend itself against charges of political bias against conservatives.

The online giant denied that it’s shown “systematic political bias,” but admitted employees played a bigger role than previously acknowledged in determining what news is highlighted in the trending topics section.

Facebook also acknowledged that it couldn’t rule out the possibility that rogue employees unintentionally discriminated against conservative stories or even acted with malice in “isolated improper actions.”

In one instance Facebook rejected a story this year about the opening of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference — the largest gathering of right-wing activists in the country. Facebook says that was likely because there were already enough stories about the Republican presidential primary. But the company said since it allowed CPAC posts in 2015, and covered other parts of the 2016 conference, there wasn’t any discrimination.

“Our investigation has revealed no evidence of systematic political bias in the selection or prominence of stories included in the Trending Topics feature. In fact, our analysis indicated that the rates of approval of conservative and liberal topics are virtually identical in Trending Topics,” Colin Stretch, the company’s general counsel, said in an extensive reply to Sen. John Thune, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, who is probing the allegations of bias.

Former Facebook employees told Gizmodo earlier this month that they detected bias in the way news was “curated” by the site, with stories on top GOP figures, conservative commentators and right-wing causes getting short shrift.

Conservative groups chimed in, saying they’d also seen evidence that stories about their issues and actions weren’t getting the attention they’d thought warranted. The American Conservative Union, which organizes CPAC, said stories about the conference on Facebook did poorly, even though they did well on other online platforms such as Twitter — suggesting bias.

Facebook said it probed seven separate allegations, including treatment of CPAC, conservative host Glenn Beck, former IRS senior executive Lois G. Lerner, the Drudge Report and others, and concluded there were no substantiated instances of political bias.

Instead, some stories were rejected because the news sources were questionable, or because the topic was already represented, the company said.

It said liberal and conservative topics saw “virtually identical” treatment, while “moderate” topics fared the best because they were “popular across the political spectrum.”

Still, Facebook said it will retrain employees and impose new “controls and oversight” to try to cut down the chances for bias. It is also discontinuing the use of 10 outlets it used to judge stories’ importance — a list that included Fox News, but also included the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, NBC News and BuzzFeed.

Mr. Thune said the review was a good start, and said the fact that the company admitted its limitations — including the larger role employees played — “lends credibility” to the findings.

“Facebook’s description of the methodology it uses for determining the trending content it highlights for users is far different from and more detailed than what it offered prior to our questions,” the South Dakota Republican said. “We now know the system relied on human judgment, and not just an automated process, more than previously acknowledged.”

Democrats had blasted Mr. Thune’s questions to Facebook, saying he was wasting taxpayer money in pursuing the probe.

But with nearly two-thirds of Facebook users saying they get at least some of their news from the online platform, conservatives said any chance of bias could skew political conversations.

Mr. Thune said he’s open to new information, but signaled the letter answered most of his questions.

Earlier in the day, though, the ACU sent a letter of its own, asking Mr. Thune to seek out and interview whistleblowers to get to the bottom of their accusations.

“This issue it still unresolved, even after these admissions of wrongdoing by Facebook,” said ACU chairman Matt Schlapp. “Facebook has admitted to harming CPAC, but they have not called us to apologize, and they have failed to explain what they did.”

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arranged a meeting with conservative figures last week to talk out the issue — a meeting Mr. Schlapp sat out — and tried to assuage concerns. The company’s letter Monday to Mr. Thune also gave more detail about its operations.

Facebook said most users get their news from their news feeds. But the company also runs a “Trending Topics” section that promotes some stories, and that’s where the bias charges focused.

The section was launched in 2014, and was based on an algorithm designed to pick out popular stories.

But the company acknowledged in its reply Monday that employees play a significant role.

“We currently use people to bridge the gap between what an algorithm can do today and what we hope it will be able to do in the future — to sort the meaningful trends from gibberish and duplicates, and to write headlines and descriptions in clear, natural-sounding language,” Mr. Stretch said.

He said up to half of the topics selected by the algorithm are rejected by employees because they are duplicates or “do not make sense at the time.”

Some topics that are removed were put on a “blacklist,” meaning they couldn’t be renewed for up to 24 hours, while employees tried to figure out the sourcing of the story or whether the story was already old news.

Facebook said some stories were sidelined because employees questioned the reliability of sources, but said that put too much power in the hands of the reviewers. The company said it will cancel that power as part of its new steps.

3221,3221,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/26/obama-says-trump-has-rattled-foreign-leaders/,Right,"President Obama said Thursday that Republican Donald Trump has “rattled” world leaders by showing an “ignorance” of foreign affairs.

Speaking to reporters at a summit in Japan, Mr. Obama said foreign leaders are surprised by Mr. Trump and unsure whether to take his comments about world affairs seriously.



“They are paying very close attention to this election,” the president said. “I think it’s fair to say they are surprised by the Republican nominee. They are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements. But they’re rattled by them, and for good reason.”



Many of Mr. Trump’s proposals, Mr. Obama said, “display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe and secure and prosperous and what is required to keep the world on an even keel.”



The president downplayed Democratic concerns about the unfinished primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders, saying sometimes in a primary people get “grumpy.”

In an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Mr. Trump said his proposal to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. could theoretically lead Muslim judges to single him out and treat him unfairly.

“It’s possible, yes. That would be possible, absolutely,” Mr. Trump said when asked about the prospect of getting a fair hearing in front of a Muslim judge.

Mr. Trump has come under intense fire — including from some fellow Republicans — for saying U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is of Mexican heritage, is biased against him. Judge Curiel is presiding over a lawsuit brought against Trump University.

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, and others on Sunday said the comments were not right, but Mr. Trump has refused to back down.

“But I say he’s got bias. I want to build a wall [between the U.S. and Mexico]. I’m going to build a wall. I’m doing very well with the Latinos, with the Hispanics, with the Mexicans, I’m doing very well with them in my opinion,” the billionaire businessman told CBS.

As for the Muslim ban, Mr. Trump said it would be temporary prohibition until the U.S. figures “what’s going on” with the problem of radical Islamic terrorism.

Bernard Sanders Thursday morning in the Oval Office, hoping to give the populist presidential candidate a tactful push toward a clear surrender to Hillary Clinton in their hard-fought battle for the Democratic nomination.

With some Sanders’ supporters urging their candidate to keep pressing on toward the Democratic convention next month, Mr. Obama has the delicate job of trying to show a clear end to the primary season so he and Mrs. Clinton can focus on presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.

But Mr. Obama also doesn’t want to appear to be applying too heavy a hand with Mr. Sanders, whose millions of liberal supporters will be needed by Mrs. Clinton in the general election.

He said the contested primary has been “a healthy thing for the Democratic Party.”

3264,3264,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/23/supreme-court-blocks-obama-immigration-plan/,Right,"President Obama lost his bid to kick-start his deportation amnesty Thursday after the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4, keeping in place a lower court’s injunction, nixing the policy for the rest of Mr. Obama’s tenure and igniting political and legal debates that will carry on well beyond.

Mr. Obama said the ruling “takes us further from the country we aspire to be,” and vowed to protect most illegal immigrants from deportation anyway, saying his discretionary powers remain intact.

But the decision is a devastating blow to his hopes of a legacy-building amnesty, known by the acronym DAPA, that would have granted as many as 5 million illegal immigrants a stay of deportation and the keys to a more normal life in the U.S.: work permits and Social Security numbers enabling them to obtain driver’s licenses and other taxpayer benefits.

The ruling could have been even worse. Had Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, still been on the court, Mr. Obama would likely have lost in a 5-4 decision that could have spanked him on broad constitutional grounds and imposed limits on future presidents, analysts said.

Instead, the tie decision leaves in place rulings by a district judge in Texas and by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Mr. Obama broke the law when he claimed he had the categorical power to grant “deferred action” to nearly half of the illegal immigrants in the country.

Republicans hailed it as a blow to Mr. Obama’s expansive claims of power, saying the court restored some of the balance that the country’s founders envisioned in the Constitution.

SEE ALSO: Obama: Most illegals still won’t be deported

“The Supreme Court’s ruling makes the president’s executive action on immigration null and void. The Constitution is clear: The president is not permitted to write laws — only Congress is. This is another major victory in our fight to restore the separation of powers,” said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who is leading a similar lawsuit against Obamacare.

Mr. Obama was not cowed. He said the justices never reached the big issues of the case, so it doesn’t affect any of his other policies, such as global warming and Obamacare.

He said he will abide by the ruling, effectively ending his plans for the DAPA program. But he said most of those who would have qualified still won’t be deported because they are likely to have ties to the community and relatively clean criminal records.

“They will remain low priorities for deportation,” he said.

Hispanic rights groups vowed to make Republicans pay at the ballot box in November. They said the clearest way for illegal immigrants to gain legal status is to elect lawmakers who support a path to citizenship.

“This act of cruelty delivered on immigrants by the Republican Party will serve as another watershed moment in the complete collapse of Latino and immigrant support for the GOP and its candidates,” said Kica Matos, director of immigrant rights at the Center for Community Change Action. “Our movement gets stronger when faced with anti-immigrant attacks. We expect the decision to be another factor in record Latino and pro-immigrant voter turnout in 2016.”

Justices didn’t release an opinion in the deadlock, and they don’t say who voted on which side of the question — though based on oral arguments, it’s fairly certain the four justices appointed by Democratic presidents sided with the administration and the Republican-appointed justices sided with Texas.

Texas argued that the program forced it to issue driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants and to pay for education and health care benefits that the illegal immigrants would also be entitled to under DAPA.

They said the DAPA program broke federal procedural law because it was a major policy change never put out for public comment, that it broke immigration law by granting legal status to too many people and that it violated the president’s constitutional limits on power.

U.S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen sided with Texas on the procedural law question, and then the 5th Circuit sided with Texas on the immigration law challenge. Neither court reached the bigger constitutional questions.

Legally, the ruling leaves a number of unanswered questions.

The lower courts’ injunction applies nationwide, but some states have challenged that, saying that it should apply only in Texas and the 25 other states that sued to halt the amnesty. If they are successful in getting the injunction narrowed, it could leave a confusing patchwork, with illegal immigrants in some states eligible for amnesty and those in other states denied it.

It’s also unclear how much more Mr. Obama can push his nondeportation policies. But he took any further action off the table.

“I don’t anticipate that there are additional executive actions,” he said.

He had said words to that effect before, however, and then reversed himself. Indeed, in the years before his 2014 announcement of the DAPA program, he repeatedly said he didn’t have the power to grant such a broad amnesty because such a claim would make him a “king,” not a president.

He began to change his mind after Congress deadlocked on legislation to grant the chance at full citizenship rights to most illegal immigrants.

In November 2014, after massive defeats for Democrats in the midterm congressional elections, Mr. Obama announced he had been mistaken and that he did, in fact, possess broad powers to grant tentative legal status to illegal immigrants. His legal advisers said he could use “deferred action” on anyone who had a speculative path to legal status — in this case, millions of immigrants with children in the U.S. legally.

On Thursday, Mr. Obama said the court’s ruling squanders a chance to “bring rationality” to the immigration system. He said it’s now up to voters to impose their will, and they need to use November’s elections to send a message.

“Now we’ve got a choice about who we’re going to be as a country, what we’re going to teach our kids and how we want to be represented in Congress and the White House,” he said.

Mr. Obama’s 2012 amnesty, which applies to a much smaller group of Dreamers, or young adult illegal immigrants, remains in place. It was not part of the legal challenge.

The ruling also does not affect other parts of Mr. Obama’s 2014 executive actions, which included streamlining the citizenship process, giving more leeway to local police to refuse to cooperate with federal authorities and opening more slots for temporary workers.

Homeland Security officials are also working on a policy of expanding “hardship” waivers, which would allow illegal immigrants to remain in the U.S. to care for family members.

3272,3272,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/23/brexit-referendum-turnout-heavy-vote-close/,Right,"The voters of the United Kingdom spoke Thursday and, to the surprise of pundits and their elected officials, declared that they want out of the European Union.

In a historic nail-biter of a referendum, the nation voted to exit the 28-member EU bloc, a result widely seen to have been driven public fear of immigration that has surged in the nation during recent years but which quickly prompted a run on the British currency.

Prime Minister David Cameron, who had campaigned against leaving the EU, announced Friday morning that he will resign in October, saying that “fresh leadership” is now needed in the U.K.

While turnout was at a near record levels, and officials had predicted a tally that was “too close to call,” the major TV networks BBC and ITV called a victory for the “Leave” forces in the so-called “Brexit” vote late Thursday night.

With more than 100 percent of the vote counted, the “Leave” forces had an edge of 51.9 percent to 48.1 percent.

The “remain” forces had carried a slight lead in several areas of the country during early counting on Thursday night. Heading into the referendum, a poll by IPSOS MORI, a leading market research company in the UK and Ireland, had predicted a 4-point victory for Britain to stay in the bloc that it joined in 1973.

Indeed Nigel Farage, head of the anti-EU U.K. Independence Party, had telling reporters Thursday night his side may have come up just short. But later, he was exulting in what he called “Independence Day” for Britain.

“I now dare to dream that the dawn is coming up on an independent United Kingdom,” he said.

The economic effects were swift in early Friday trading in the markets in East Asia. Both Wall Street futures and the British pound had risen strongly Thursday in the belief that the remain forces would win.

The British currency Friday had lost about 12 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar Friday, with the pound worth $1.34, a 30-year low and a 11 percent loss just since Thursday. The Euro was also off against other world currencies, as investors began to doubt the viability of the whole European Union.

The major stock-markets in East Asia all lost significant value, and trading on Japan’s Nikkei Index was reined in automatically under its “circuit breaker” rule, when the market had lost 8 percent of its value.

But on Thursday, the atmosphere was lively across the country. Long lines were reported at many polling stations as many braved torrential downpours and threats of flooding in some areas. Early indications were that turnout topped 70 percent — the highest since the 1997 general election.

Campaign organizers and politicians carried their respective arguments down to the last minute. Prime Minister David Cameron crisscrossed the nation to plead for a vote to stay in the European Union and to “put jobs first, put the economy first.”

“It is a fact that our economy will be weaker if we leave and stronger if we stay,” he told one crowd in Birmingham.

Not all Britons agreed. “We have a strong export capability in Yorkshire from high-tech goods to services,” said Roger Tattersall, assistant director for Vote Leave in the Yorkshire and Humberside region.

“We want to be able to export anywhere in the world without the tariffs that are caused by our membership in the European Union,” Mr. Tattersall said.

Aside from the economic and financial effects of a British exit, U.S. analysts said, a vote to leave would have massive consequences for the European Union and could inspire other eurosceptic groups to follow suit.

“Brexit would inevitably set in motion centrifugal dynamics on the continent, empowering nationalists in countries that have no chance of being successful outside of the EU,” said Dalibor Rohac, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

“From the economic woes of the eurozone, through the political tensions brought about by the refugee crisis, to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s use of propaganda and energy ties to undermine liberal democracy in Central and Eastern Europe, the continent is at a greater risk of descending into chaos than at any point in its postwar history,” Mr. Rohac wrote in a recent commentary.

Brexit proponents said a departure from the European Union would save Britain economically and culturally while freeing the country from the dictates of Brussels on issues such as immigration policy and food standards.

“Our campaign has been about optimism and self-reliance,” said former London Mayor Boris Johnson, who broke with fellow Conservative Mr. Cameron to become a leading voice for the Leave forces.

Despite the differing viewpoints, voters on both sides expressed frustration at how the respective campaigns were handled. “I think it’s been a load of lies on both sides,” said Faith Pearson, 48, an unemployed Brexit supporter from Brompton.

“But I liked Leave because they haven’t told us what the economy is going to be like because they don’t know,” she said. “Remain is telling us, but they can’t make predictions.”

Kieran Clark, a 25-year-old from Yorkshire who voted Remain, wished he had heard more facts. “I’m not too happy with it,” he said, noting a “lot of scaremongering and exaggerated figures.”

“Not a lot of it has been about pure facts and figures,” he said.

Even Britons abroad were irritated with the campaign. “I think it’s made British politics look completely shambolic,” said Fiona Seymour, a 48-year-old Londoner who lives in Berlin. “I think the campaign has been beset with too many in-party rivalries with very little real information being given out, which makes a mockery of the English democratic process.”

The ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Sunday gives Mrs. Clinton a 12-percentage point advantage among likely voters nationwide, besting Mr. Trump 51 percent to 39 percent.

The same poll in May showed Mr. Trump with a 2-percentage point edge on the former secretary of state, 46 to 44 percent.

Roughly two-thirds of the respondents said the billionaire businessman is unqualified to lead the country, including one-third of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Nearly two-thirds of voters, by contrast, said Mrs. Clinton is qualified to be president.

Yet 64 percent of voters who want the nation to move in a different direction prefer Mr. Trump, compared to 26 percent who are backing Mrs. Clinton. And after eight years of President Obama, 56 percent of Americans said they want the next president to chart a new course for the country.

The poll comes more than a week after the massacre at the Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, where 49 people were killed by a gunman who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.

Respondents said they preferred Mrs. Clinton’s response to the terrorist attack to Mr. Trump’s by an 18-percentage point margin.

The poll surveyed 1,001 registered voters from June 20 to 23. It has a plus-or-minus 3.5 percentage point margin of error.

3299,3299,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/9/in-nod-to-sanders-clinton-offers-new-health-care-p/,Right,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — In another nod to primary rival Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton is proposing to increase federal money for community health centers and outlining steps to expand access to health care across the nation.

Clinton’s campaign says the proposal is part of her plan to provide universal health care coverage in the United States. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee also is reaffirming her support for a public-option insurance plan and for expanding Medicare by letting people age 55 year and older opt in.

The announcement Saturday was a clear gesture toward Sanders, who ran a strong primary campaign against Clinton and has held back from endorsing her candidacy as the party’s convention nears.

In a statement, Clinton said: “We have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable health care to everyone in America.”

Clinton’s campaign noted that Sanders had promoted doubling money for primary care services at federally qualified health centers. Money for these centers was increased under the Affordable Care Act, an effort led by the Vermont senator.

According to the Clinton campaign, her proposal would make money for these centers permanent and expand it by $40 billion over the next 10 years. Her campaign said the money would be mandatory and not subject to annual appropriation. The proposal would more than double the money for the centers, which currently get $3.6 billion annually.

Sanders, in a conference call after the Clinton campaign’s announcement, said her proposal “will save lives” and “ease suffering” and represented “an important step forward in expanding health care in America and expanding health insurance and health care access to tens of millions of Americans.”

The health care proposal follows on Clinton’s recent announcement of new ways to tackle college affordability, including a plan that ensures families with annual incomes up to $125,000 pay no tuition at in-state public colleges and universities.

That initiative was seen as a response to Sanders’ call for free tuition at all public colleges and universities, an idea popular with the young voters who flocked to his rallies.

Clinton’s policy overtures come as Sanders appears to be close to supporting her candidacy.

Two Democrats with knowledge of Sanders’ plans told The Associated Press that Sanders was closing in on offering his public endorsement of Clinton. The Democrats spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations they were not authorized to disclose.

Clinton’s campaign has announced a stop in New Hampshire on Tuesday but did not say whether Sanders also would attend.

Sanders told reporters that the two campaigns “are coming closer and closer together in trying to address the major issues facing this country.” He added: “We’ll have more to say, I think, in the very near future.”

Clinton and Sanders frequently clashed over health care during the primaries. Sanders campaigned on a “Medicare for all” plan that would have provided universal coverage. Clinton said that would undercut President Barack Obama’s health law, rely too heavily on GOP governors and reopen a contentious debate with Republicans in Congress.

Clinton’s health care priorities have centered on capping out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and providing tax credits for families facing high medical costs.

Clinton has reiterated her support for a “public option” for states to set up their own health insurance plan to compete against private insurers. Sanders was instrumental in passing legislation that would allow that.

Both supported a public insurance option at the national level but opposition from moderate Democrats prevented that proposal from being included in the health overhaul law.

3355,3355,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/5/us-adds-255k-jobs-unemployment-stays-49-pct/,Right,"WASHINGTON — U.S. employers added a healthy 255,000 jobs in July, a sign of confidence in the economy that will likely ease concerns about signs of weak growth in the midst of the presidential race.

The unemployment rate remained a low 4.9 percent, the government said Friday in its monthly jobs report. Many more Americans began looking for a job, and nearly all were hired. But the influx of job seekers meant that the number of unemployed fell only slightly.

The figures suggest that employers were unfazed by either Britain’s late-June vote to quit the European Union or the U.S. economy’s tepid growth in the first half of the year: Just 1 percent at an annual rate. Most analysts expect the solid hiring to fuel an economic rebound in the second half of this year, with more paychecks and higher pay fueling spending and growth.

A sharp fall-off in hiring in May, when only 24,000 jobs were added, had spurred fears about an economic slowdown. But job growth roared back in June with a gain of 292,000. July’s increase provided further evidence that May’s slowdown was likely temporary.

“It puts to bed a lot of the concerns that had risen up after the May report that we had come to a screeching halt in the job market,” said Curt Long, chief economist at the National Association of Federal Credit Unions.

Investors appeared pleased by the data, with the Dow Jones industrial average surging about 160 points — nearly 1 percent — in midmorning trading.

Some economists raised the possibility that the job gains will embolden the Federal Reserve to resume raising rates later this year, though perhaps not before December. The Fed raised its benchmark rate from a record low in December last year but has since held that rate steady in the face of economic uncertainty.

“These job numbers are good enough to keep the Fed on track for a December rate increase despite sluggish GDP growth in the first half of this year,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at the Bank of the West.

Average hourly pay picked up in July and is 2.6 percent higher than it was a year ago, matching the fastest pace since the Great Recession officially ended in mid-2009. With unemployment low, some employers are likely being forced to compete with one another for new hires by offering higher pay.

Solid hiring occurred last month across a range of industries, including middle- and high-wage jobs, one factor that likely boosted average pay. Professional and business services, a category that includes architects, engineers and managers, added 70,000 jobs, the most since October.

Financial services added 18,000 and construction 14,000. Government positions rose 38,000, the most in more than a year.

Health care, which includes jobs at all pay levels, gained nearly 49,000 new jobs. Hotels and restaurants added 27,000.

July’s robust job gain may be enough to reassure investors — and perhaps Fed policymakers — that the economy will pick up. The sluggish growth it has managed to achieve since last fall has been driven mainly by consumers, who ramped up spending in the April-June quarter at the second-fastest pace since the recession.

One of the most optimistic outlooks for the economy has come from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta: It predicts that annualized growth will reach 3.7 percent in the current July-September quarter.

Public perceptions of the economy have been largely negative during this election season despite low unemployment. A top adviser to Donald Trump said last week that the annual economic growth rate of just 1.2 percent in the April-June quarter was “catastrophic.”

Hillary Clinton has tended to credit the Obama administration for rescuing the economy from the Great Recession but has also said “none of us can be satisfied with the status quo.”

Other recent economic data have been mixed. Americans are confident enough to step up home purchases, aided by near-record-low mortgage rates. Sales of existing homes reached a nine-year high in June, and sales of new homes accelerated to an eight-year high.

Services companies, which range from retailers to banks to shipping firms, expanded at a healthy pace in July, according to a survey by the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group. Their expansion slowed a bit from the previous month. But new orders picked up, a sign that growth could remain healthy.

But manufacturing continues to struggle and is weighing on hiring. Factories received fewer orders in June for a third straight month. Weak growth overseas and a stronger dollar have cut into many companies’ overseas businesses. And auto sales have leveled off, according to data released this week.

The slowdown in manufacturing has cost jobs: Factory employment has fallen about 30,000 in the past year, depriving the economy of key middle-income positions.

3357,3357,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/7/jill-stein-taps-bernie-sanders-movement-in-green-p/,Right,"Short of adopting wire-frame glasses and a Brooklyn accent, Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein did everything possible last weekend to blur any distinction between herself and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont.

“It is such an honor to be also running in alliance with the Bernie Sanders movement,” Ms. Stein said to thunderous applause at the Green Party Presidential Nominating Convention in Houston. “We are Bernie Green!”

To nobody’s surprise, Ms. Stein, a Harvard-educated physician and prohibitive front-runner, won the nomination Saturday at the University of Houston. She will run on a ticket with human rights activist Ajamu Baraka.

That Mr. Sanders has endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton matters little to the Greens, a third party poised to make an enormous electoral leap in November if Ms. Stein can persuade Mr. Sanders’ ground troops to line up behind her instead of staying home or voting Democrat.

The Greens suffered a setback Friday when a federal court ruled that the Commission on Presidential Debates has the right to exclude third-party candidates such as Ms. Stein and Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson from televised forums if they don’t meet polling criteria.

The ruling all but guarantees that Ms. Stein will be excluded from the debates, given that the commission requires participants to reach at least 15 percent in the polls. A McClatchy-Maris survey released Friday shows Ms. Stein with 6 percent, and even that is a recent high-water polling mark.

Even so, the Greens have reason for optimism. For one, that 6 percent figure is far higher than the 0.36 percent that Ms. Stein earned as the party’s presidential candidate in 2012.

For another, Ms. Stein has new high-profile allies in former Ivy League professor Cornel West and WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange.

Mr. Assange, who released 20,000 hacked emails last month showing Democratic National Committee officials plotting against the Sanders campaign, urged left-of-center voters via live feed Saturday not to cast a lesser-of-two-evils vote for Mrs. Clinton.

“What the Clinton campaign is doing at the moment is trying to say, ‘Well, OK, yes, maybe we’re committed to arms dealers and to Saudi Arabia, and yes, maybe we subverted the integrity of the Democratic primary, etc., etc., but you’ll just have to swallow that. You’ll just have to swallow that, or else you’ll get Donald Trump,’” he said.

“That’s a form of extortion,” Mr. Assange told the enthusiastic crowd from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he has lived since being granted asylum amid sexual assault charges.

That message may be taking hold with voters like Angelica Duanes, a Sanders supporter from Los Angeles who attended the convention.

“I am still a Democrat but I guess you could say we’re a flight risk, so we’re really looking at our options now,” Ms. Duanes told Russia Today television. “We really can’t stand with Hillary Clinton as our nominee. We definitely can’t stand with Donald Trump. So at this point, we’re looking at what our options are.”

As for the argument that a vote against Mrs. Clinton is a vote for Mr. Trump, Ms. Duanes said that’s the Democratic Party’s fault, not hers.

“We feel that they had an opportunity to choose a stronger candidate that would definitely beat Donald Trump come November, and they did not,” said Ms. Duanes. “At this point, we’re not going to be influenced by fear tactics and the boogeyman narrative that they’re painting. We’re looking for someone to vote for rather than vote against.”

The Sanders loss, combined with the evidence of DNC favoritism, has given the Greens their best opportunity for a strong showing since well-known consumer advocate Ralph Nader headed the party ticket in 2000.

“We are at such an incredibly powerful, unprecedented moment in history,” Ms. Stein told delegates. “We have an incredible opportunity, we have an incredible responsibility to stand up and lead the way forward to the transformative change.”

This year’s presidential election “really is that moment that so many of us I think have dedicated our lives to creating and that we never thought we’d see actually happen in our lifetimes,” she said. “We are closer to that now than we’ve ever been.”

Ms. Stein called the election a “perfect storm, because the American people are tired of a rigged economy of the rigged political system that keeps us trapped in that rigged economy.”

But an effort by Ms. Stein and her Libertarian counterpart to break through one element of that “rigged political system” failed Friday when U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer turned away their challenge to the right of the Commission on Presidential Debates to exclude them.

Judge Collyer ruled that the commission is a private entity, not a “public forum,” and rejected arguments by Mr. Johnson and Ms. Green that the commission is essentially a government actor, performing an important role in U.S. democracy, and therefore should be subject to public oversight.

“This court could not require defendants to include plaintiffs in the debates because such an order would violate the First Amendment prohibition on forced speech and forced association,” Judge Collyer found.

Mr. Johnson’s campaign said it was disappointed with the ruling and spotted “several serious flaws” that could lead to an appeal.

The Green convention came as a reminder that the Green platform isn’t for everyone, even progressives. Ms. Stein has long taken a hard line on Israel, referring in her remarks Saturday to “war crimes” committed by Israeli troops in the “occupation” against Palestinians.

At the same time, she played up issues popular with Sanders voters, such as opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, banning hydraulic fracturing, erasing student loan debt, instating a single-payer health care system, releasing nonviolent prisoners convicted of drug offenses, and legalizing marijuana.

Ms. Stein also dropped Mr. Sanders’ name repeatedly in several speeches and interviews during the three-day convention, even though the senator was nowhere to be found.

Her supporters chanted, “Jill, not Hill,” although polling shows Mrs. Clinton is more likely to attract Sanders voters than is Ms. Stein.

A CNN/ORC survey released Aug. 1, two days after the Democratic National Convention, showed that 69 percent of Sanders supporters now favor Mrs. Clinton, versus 13 percent for Ms. Stein, 10 percent for Mr. Johnson and 3 percent for Mr. Trump.

The figures represent a 5 percent increase in support for Mrs. Clinton, within the poll’s margin of error, but also a 7 percent boost for Ms. Stein.

Oddly enough, Mr. Trump’s decline in the polls could wind up benefiting the Greens — and hurting the Clinton campaign — by reducing the perceived urgency among left-of-center voters to vote Democratic in order to defeat the Republican ticket.

“There’s a cost to violating principles, even if there’s also a cost to yourself, even if you don’t like the risk — which seems to be getting very small — the risk that Donald Trump becomes president,” Mr. Assange said.

For those still unconvinced, Ms. Stein argued that voting for one candidate in order to avoid the other has “brought us everything we were afraid of.”

Ms. Stein had urged Mr. Sanders to step in and run as the Green Party candidate. Although he didn’t accept her offer, the convention was evidence that he won’t be forgotten on the campaign trail. Far from it.

“We owe Bernie such a debt of gratitude for lifting up this revolution that has been smoldering for decades. You broke through the media blackout. You lifted us up and you refused to be shut down by the DNC,” Ms. Stein said in her acceptance speech. “Thank you to the Bernie campaign!”

3369,3369,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/10/hillary-clintons-republican-supporters-are-her-cul/,Right,"OPINION:

Many elections redefine political parties.

The rise of George McGovern’s hard-left agenda in 1972, followed later in the decade by Jimmy Carter’s evangelical liberalism, drove centrist Democrats into the arms of Richard Nixon and later Ronald Reagan.

These so-called neoconservatives (“new conservatives”) grew tired of liberals’ perceived laxity about fighting the Cold War. In foreign policy, the neoconservatives were best known for supporting idealistic nation-building abroad. They distrusted the rise of what would become political correctness and ever more government. They worried about violent crime and higher taxes. So decades ago, these Democrats joined the Republican Party.

Since the 1980s, the neoconservatives have made up the elite of their newly adopted party — despite their unease with the conservative orthodoxy of border enforcement, fierce resistance to gun control and opposition to abortion.

Now, a few neoconservatives are reinventing themselves again and returning to the Democrats to support Hillary Clinton. We could call them “neoliberals.”

They believe that socialist Bernie Sanders made the hard-left Mrs. Clinton seem like an acceptable centrist. As neoliberals, they hope that beneath her opportunistic embrace of Obamism, Mrs. Clinton still could recalibrate herself as more of a Democrat of the 1990s, a period when her husband, President Bill Clinton, championed balancing the budget while intervening abroad.

Neoliberals — along with some members of the conservative establishment — consider Republican Party nominee Donald Trump to be toxic. Many of them are supporting Mrs. Clinton because they do not like Mr. Trump’s idea of building a wall on the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration. Nor do they appreciate Mr. Trump’s slogans about “putting America first” when negotiating trade deals, conducting alliances and avoiding optional foreign interventions. They hate Mr. Trump’s crude, take-no-prisoners invective more than Hillary’s polished and refined lying.

The 2016 neoliberals were never very culturally conservative. So they are certainly not bothered by Mrs. Clinton’s pro-choice advocacy. They do not mind her promotion of gun control, and they are open to global warming agendas and soft multiculturalism. They see Mrs. Clinton as preferable to Mr. Trump and his unapologetic nationalism. Many of the neoliberal converts supported the Obama-Clinton intervention in Libya and oppose Mr. Trump’s get-tough trade stance on China.

Neoliberals also find themselves more in the same class — defined by income, education and cultural tastes — with Mrs. Clinton’s elite Democrats than with Mr. Trump’s new army of lower-middle-class cultural and economic populists.

Neoliberals get along well with the small elite class that fuels the Clinton machine — similarly wealthy, well-educated grandees on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, along with those in big media, academia, the arts and the top echelons of state and federal bureaucracies.

Democrats no longer win over the middle classes, who lack the culture of the elite and the romance of the distant and subsidized poor. NASCAR and the NRA are anathemas to Democrats and were never popular with neoconservatives, either.

Will the old neoconservatives-new neoliberals who support Mrs. Clinton instead of Mr. Trump ever come back to the Republican Party after the election?

It depends on three unknowns.

If Mr. Trump loses big, the neoliberals will remind Republican Trumpers that they had warned them about their populist folly. The neolibs will seek to expunge populists and to rebuild a defeated Republican Party in their own image as an improved version of the conservative establishment represented by the likes of Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush.

They may re-emerge as old Republican neoconservatives who will promote unfettered free trade, democracy-building abroad and “comprehensive immigration reform” while downplaying social issues.

If Mr. Trump squeaks by, then the neoliberals certainly will be orphaned for good. As apostates, they will not be welcomed back as neoconservatives by the Republican winners, nor will they be seen by Democrats as converts having any further political value.

But if Mr. Trump loses by a point or two, the neoliberals will likely stay with the winning Clinton team. They will claim some credit for helping her just get over the top — even as they are blamed by irate Trumpers as traitors for sabotaging what otherwise could have been a winning new Republican strategy.

Apart from opportunistic careerism, the subtext to this realignment is a larger issue of culture, education and class. A mostly urban, highly educated and high-income globalized elite often shares more cultural and political affinities with their counterparts on the other side of the aisle than they do with the lower-middle and working classes of their own parties.

Just as Hillary Clinton may feel more comfortable with the old neoconservatives, Trump supporters have little in common with either Clintonites or neocons.

Clinton versus Trump is a war of NPR, CBS and The New York Times against the National Enquirer, conservative talk radio and the Drudge Report. Clinton supporters such as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, onetime Bush officials Hank Paulson and Brent Scowcroft, and billionaire Meg Whitman certainly have nothing in common with Republican Trump supporters such as Mike Huckabee and Rush Limbaugh.

Culture, not just politics, is rapidly destroying — but also rebuilding — traditional political parties.

3371,3371,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/15/trump-will-target-radical-islamic-terrorism-he-lay/,Right,"Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says part of Donald Trump’s foreign policy speech on Monday in Ohio will focus on the “war of ideas,” in addition to the need to fight radical Islamic terrorism.

“I think maybe two big takeaways will be obviously he’s going to use the word radical Islamic terrorism, unlike the president and Mrs. Clinton,” Mr. Giuliani said on “Fox and Friends.”

“But second, he’s going to talk about the war of ideas,” he said. “Not only are we not fighting the military war…but we’re not fighting the war of ideas.”

“We are not doing what we did during the Cold War,” he said. “We’re not proclaiming and sending into countries that disagree with us the values of our country, the values of our civilization.”

“We’re not talking about what happens to women in these countries under Sharia law - how they’re stoned, and how they’re hurt, and how they’re harmed and how they’re misused,” Mr. Giuliani said.

“I’d like to hear Hillary Clinton talk about that,” he said. “She’s [a] so-called feminist, but she’s taken a lot of money from some of these countries. Maybe she can’t talk about [it.].”

In the speech in Ohio, Mr. Trump is expected to say that the U.S. is in an ideological conflict with radical Islam, is planning to call for a new ideological test for immigrants entering the U.S., and is expected to describe the need to temporarily suspend visa issuances to geographic regions with a history of terrorism and where adequate screening can’t occur, according to the Associated Press.

3373,3373,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/11/hillary-clinton-vows-to-kill-trans-pacific-partner/,Right,"Hillary Clinton vowed Thursday to kill the Pacific trade deal that she helped push just a few years ago as President Obama’s top diplomat, hoping to win over wavering liberals and steal some of the anti-trade thunder from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

Mrs. Clinton also promised an expansive role for the government in managing the U.S. economy, calling for higher taxes to fund more infrastructure, more regulations to rein in Wall Street, a new phase of Obamacare, a round of school construction and incentives to get businesses to hire blue-collar workers and do more manufacturing in the U.S.

The Democratic presidential nominee took pages from Mr. Obama’s economic plans, echoing his calls for an infrastructure bank and a clean energy surge. Still, she kept the president at arm’s length by acknowledging “very real economic challenges” throughout his eight years in office.

“There is too much inequality, too little upward mobility. It is just too hard to get ahead today,” she said. “But there are common-sense things that your government could do that would give Americans more opportunities to succeed.”

Her solutions also borrowed from Sen. Bernard Sanders, big-business advocates and even her husband, former President Bill Clinton, resulting in an economic plan that tried to offer a little of something to everyone.

For college students, she promised debt-free tuition. For those who don’t want to go to college, she said the government should help them learn skills. For struggling communities, she said she would expand a controversial tax credit. For those worried about income disparity, she said she would impose a minimum tax to force the wealthy to pony up. For those upset over the Wall Street crash, she promised more financial regulations. For small businesses, she said she would simplify their taxes so it’s “as easy as printing out a bank statement.”

Nowhere was she more adamant, though, than in rejecting the free trade spirit that her husband pioneered as a new kind of Democrat in the 1990s and that Mr. Obama continued during his tenure.

“I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,” she said. “I oppose it now, I’ll oppose it after the election and I’ll oppose it as president.”

She said she voted against the only multilateral trade deal to come before the Senate during her tenure but glossed over the rest of her record, including support for six bilateral trade deals, most-favored status for Chinese trade and her husband’s implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization.

Liberal groups were thrilled that she went so far in denouncing the TPP, one of Mr. Obama’s chief foreign policy objectives, and said her speech overall was the kind of leftward shift they wanted to see after she defeated Mr. Sanders in the primary.

“Today’s speech shows that getting some Republicans to say Donald Trump is unfit to be president is not mutually exclusive with Clinton running on bold progressive ideas like debt-free college, expanding Social Security benefits, Wall Street reform, and a public health insurance option,” said Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.

On infrastructure and trade, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump are competing to outdo each other.

Mr. Trump told CNBC on Thursday that he would more than double the $250 billion investment that Mrs. Clinton envisions, and he encouraged massive government borrowing now.

“The interest rates are so low — the numbers are so low — that yes, this is a time to borrow and to borrow long-term,” he said, ticking off spending on the military, veterans, and roads and bridges as areas where the government should go deeper into debt.

But despite their areas of agreement, Mrs. Clinton said voters should be wary of Mr. Trump, who she said built his empire by jilting small-business owners. She pointed to contractors she said worked for Mr. Trump who, when they went to collect, were told to scram — and who didn’t have the kinds of resources to force legal fights with Mr. Trump.

“It wasn’t because Trump couldn’t pay them; it was because he wouldn’t pay them,” she said. “That’s not how we do business in America.”

Republicans warned voters to be wary of Mrs. Clinton’s promises because her record suggests she would embrace free trade once in office.

Her eight years in the Senate earned Mrs. Clinton a lifetime rating of 46 from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce — putting her in the middle of the pack of her Democratic colleagues at the time. Some Southern Democrats posted much higher ratings, while liberal stalwarts in the Northeast and Rust Belt — including Sens. Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden — posted lower scores.

Mrs. Clinton scored well on votes that called for federal investment, but her Chamber of Commerce score suffered based on votes in which she backed union interests, additional red tape or environmental regulations that business groups said would stifle free enterprise.

The National Federal of Independent Business, the chief lobby for small businesses in the U.S., welcomed Mrs. Clinton’s call for easier tax filings and less red tape but said she should detail exactly which of Mr. Obama’s regulations she would end.

Juanita Duggan, president of the business federation, said Mrs. Clinton’s flat rejection of a rate cut for the top income brackets will hurt small businesses, most of which file their taxes that way.

“Cutting their taxes means letting them reinvest in growth and jobs. That’s precisely what the economy needs,” Ms. Duggan said. “We would urge the secretary to reconsider her opposition to reducing small-business income taxes.”

3376,3376,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/5/trump-endorses-ryan-irks-activists/,Right,"Donald Trump on Friday endorsed House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, ending days of hesitation by the Republican presidential nominee to get behind the party’s most powerful elected leader.

“In our shared mission to make American great again, I support and endorse our speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. He’s a good man,” Mr. Trump said at a campaign rally in Mr. Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin.

The endorsement sent a clear message that the New York billionaire was ready to work with the Republican Party establishment that had opposed his candidacy for the start. However, it also infuriated grass-roots conservative who wanted Mr. Trump to help overthrow establishment figures such as Mr. Ryan, who are viewed as fake conservatives or RINOs, the derogatory acronym for those deemed to be Republicans in name only.

Mr. Trump had withheld his endorsement in Mr. Ryan’s primary race against an anti-establishment rival Paul Nehlen, who is a strong Trump supporter. Mr. Trump in recent days had said that he “wasn’t there yet” in backing Mr. Ryan, echoing the speaker’s earlier comments when he resisted endorsing Mr. Trump.

At the rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Mr. Trump said he was following Ronald Reagan’s tenet that an 80 percent ally was not a 20 percent enemy.

“We may disagree on a couple of things, but mostly we agree. And we’re going to get it done, and we’re going to do a lot of wonderful [things],” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Trump also announced endorsements for a couple Senate Republican incumbents in tough races who have been tentative in their support for him: Arizona Sen. John McCain and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte.

The trio of endorsements — especially the one for Mr. Ryan — shocked some of Mr. Trump’s diehard supporters.

“He has broken our heart doing this tonight,” said Trump supporter Sue Payne, a conservative activist working to defeat Mr. Ryan.

“We finally thought we had a voice to stand up against the RINO establishment. He sold us out,” she said. “What happened tonight is the establishment got their claws in him and they are pulling the strings. What do we believe now?”

Mr. Nehlen said he understood Mr. Trump’s decision to back the party leadership.

“Given his stature as our party’s official nominee, Mr. Trump’s decision to support the Republican Speaker is appropriate and is a display of true leadership,” Mr. Nehlen said in a statement.

“Mr. Trump’s early refusal to endorse Ryan sent a clear signal to Wisconsin voters that Ryan is not his preferred candidate in this race. Speaker Ryan’s globalist agenda stands in clear opposition to the will of the Republican electorate, who want safe communities, immigration control, smart trade deals, and leaders who put the needs of the American people first,” he said.

Mr. Nehlen faced an uphill in taking on the powerful House speaker.

Mr. Ryan leads Mr. Nehlen in the Janesville district 80 percent to 14 percent, according to a Remington Research Group poll released Friday.

3382,3382,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/15/trump-wants-extreme-vetting-stop-terrorists-border/,Right,"Donald Trump called for “extreme vetting” to root out potential terrorists attempting to enter the United States, as the Republican presidential nominee Monday rolled out a three-pronged strategy to fight and win what he described as an ideological war pitting radical Islamists against the West.

The immigration plan fine-tuned Mr. Trump’s proposal during the Republican primaries to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S.

Many Democrats and Republicans criticized that plan as unconstitutional and un-American, but Mr. Trump still proposed a temporary travel ban on people from terrorist hotbeds until U.S. officials establish a test to measure cultural and civic compatibility with American values.

Sticking closely to a prepared set of remarks, the presidential candidate said a new immigration policy was needed immediately to stop a pattern of terrorist attacks inside the United States, including the Boston Marathon bombing and the mass shootings in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, Florida.

Mr. Trump said President Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton failed to appreciate or effectively combat the danger.

“A Trump administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration: We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people,” Mr. Trump said in the speech in Youngstown, Ohio.

Focusing heavily on terrorism and conflicts in the Middle East, Mr. Trump offered relatively few remarks on other issues and hotspots around the globe.

Even so, he did include a number of clear breaks with U.S. foreign policy establishment orthodoxy, including arguing for a broad partnership with Russia in the fight against the Islamic State group and saying the U.S. military should have seized and held Iraqi oil after the 2003 invasion to cut off Islamic State funding and provide a source of money to pay for U.S. veterans’ health care and benefits.

Mr. Trump said the pattern of homegrown terrorist who are immigrants or the children of immigrants underscored the need to vet immigrants, asylum seekers and foreign visitors based on their attitudes toward America.

“I call it ‘extreme vetting,’ ” said the New York billionaire. “Our country has enough problems. We don’t need any more, and these are problems like we’ve never seen before.”

The screening would exclude people who support Shariah law, he said, referring to the legal system based on Islam that some followers believe supersedes secular law.

“In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today,” he said.

Presenting the threat of terrorism in the starkest terms, Mr. Trump said tougher immigration policies must be part of an aggressive strategy to eradicate radical Islam’s “ideology of hatred,” much like the U.S. defeated Nazis and the Soviet Union in the 20th century.

Mr. Trump’s plan to test people who want to enter the United States mirrored some of the requirements on the citizenship test. However, the test would be applied to people seeking to visit or temporarily live in the U.S.

Terrorism is a top issue in the presidential campaign and potentially Mr. Trump’s best opening to challenge Mrs. Clinton, who served as secretary of state under Mr. Obama as the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, grew into a global powerhouse.

Mr. Trump began his address minutes after Mrs. Clinton and Vice President Joseph R. Biden were savaging his foreign policy and questioning his fitness to be commander in chief during a joint rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

A Pew Research Center survey last month found that 84 percent of registered voters nationwide named the economy as a “very important” concern in the election, and 80 percent named “terrorism.”

Clinton and the Islamic State

A week after accusing Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton of being founders of the terrorist group, Mr. Trump detailed how the Islamic State spread on Mrs. Clinton’s watch as secretary of state, including her failed policies in Libya and Syria.

“Incident after incident proves again and again: Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment, the temperament and the moral character to lead this nation,” he said. “Importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all the many adversaries we face — not only in terrorism, but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn this country around.”

The other two prongs of Mr. Trump’s strategy against terrorism involved foreign policy.

Mr. Trump advocated for a concerted effort abroad to destroy the Islamic State and other radical Islamic terrorist groups, including military strikes on their strongholds, cutting off their financial resources and using cyberwarfare to shut down their online propaganda and recruiting tools.

In supporting those efforts, he proposed to end U.S. nation-building efforts in troubled states and to team up with countries that back the campaign against radical Islamic groups. He said Cold War foe Russia could be a valuable ally in the fight despite tensions on other fronts.

“We cannot always choose our friends, but we can never fail to recognize our enemies,” said Mr. Trump.

John R. Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who has been supportive of Mr. Trump, told Fox News that the candidate demonstrated “command on the subject matter” and appeared presidential.

However, the speech did little to satisfy Mr. Trump’s critics in national security circles.

“The policies and ‘pillars’ that were offered as solutions were often vague, and it is not clear they’d actually solve the serious challenges that exist in the region,” said Brian Nussbaum, a terrorism analyst at Rockefeller College of Public Affairs & Policy at the University at Albany, State University of New York. “As in several other areas of policy, Trump’s approach to foreign policy and national security seems a bit nebulous, focused on slogans rather concrete policies.”

Ahead of the speech, the Clinton campaign called Mr. Trump “erratic,” “thin-skinned” and “vindictive” and blasted his foreign policy proposals.

“Simply put, Donald Trump is unfit to be our commander in chief. This isn’t overcranked campaign rhetoric — national security experts across the political spectrum are issuing the same warning,” Clinton campaign senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan wrote in a memo.

The ferocity of the pre-emptive strike against Mr. Trump underscored how vulnerable Mrs. Clinton is to criticism about terrorism and her record as secretary of state.

The memo argued that Mrs. Clinton, who also was first lady and a U.S. senator, was “uniquely qualified” to be commander in chief, compared with Mr. Trump, who he said was “uniquely unqualified.”

“The choice is clear,” Mr. Sullivan wrote. “It’s not a choice between a Democrat and a Republican, but between a responsible leader who will keep us safe, and a volatile man who threatens our security.”

3390,3390,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/22/donald-trump-im-not-flip-flopping-immigration/,Right,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump said Monday he’s not “flip-flopping” on immigration, calling for a “fair but firm” answer and saying that “we have to be very, very strong” when people enter the country illegally.

“No, I’m not flip-flopping — we want to come up with a really fair but firm answer. It has to be very firm,” he said on “Fox and Friends.” “But we want to come up with something fair.”

Mr. Trump, who has made building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and mass deportations of illegal immigrants cornerstones of his campaign, met with members of a National Hispanic Advisory Council over the weekend.

“These were great people. These are highly respected people within the community — unbelievable people,” Mr. Trump said.

“We’re dealing with people. We have to be very firm; we have to be very, very strong when people come in illegally,” he said.

“We have a lot of people that want to come in through the legal process. It’s not fair for them, and we’re working with a lot of people in the Hispanic community to try and come up with an answer,” Mr. Trump said.

Asked if Mr. Trump’s immigration plans include a “deportation force,” which he previously mentioned, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on CNN Sunday that’s “to be determined.”

“I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds, looking for a larger venue,” Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday.

The campaign had pushed back a planned speech on the subject in Colorado last Thursday as Mr. Trump got more advice on the subject.

He said last week at a Fox News town hall that there could be a distinction between illegal immigrant criminals and those with longstanding ties to the United States in terms of the deportations that will be prioritized.

“There certainly can be a softening, because we’re not looking to hurt people … but we’re going to follow the laws of this country,” Mr. Trump said.

“There’s no amnesty, but we work with them,” he said.

Mr. Trump has since said there will be no path to legalization for illegal immigrants who remain in the country.

“I don’t think it’s a softening,” he told CNN. “I’ve had people say it’s a hardening, actually.”

Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on “Fox News Sunday” that the “softening” is “more approach than policy.”

“If you enforce the law and you deal with those agencies that already exist to enforce the law, then we’ll see what we’ve got,” Ms. Conway said.

“The signature piece of his legislation has, and his campaign, has always been build the wall. That has not changed,” she said. “Build the wall. No amnesty. No citizenship. No more sanctuary cities.”

“Let’s be very clear: Nothing has changed about Donald Trump’s position on dealing with illegal immigration,” the Indiana governor said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Mr. Trump has encountered criticism form his conservative base after saying he is “softening” his position on illegal immigration, a move that coincided with increased efforts to woo Hispanic voters.

Mr. Pence said that Mr. Trump had remained consistent on his pledge to build a wall on the United State’s southern border, crack down on illegal immigrants finding work in the U.S. and create a “mechanism” for dealing with the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the country.

He stressed that the mechanism would be “humane,” a word Mr. Trump repeatedly has used.

“You heard the word humanely again,” said Mr. Pence. “It’s going to be fair. It’s going to be tough. There will be no path to legalization, no path to citizenship unless people leave the country.”

Earlier in the campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to deport all illegal immigrants and establish a deportation force to do the job. But he had dropped that rhetoric from his stump speech months ago.

The FBI is investigating how hackers compromised the personal information of voters in June. Ken Menzel, General Counsel for the Illinois Board of Elections, told Yahoo News that he was “highly confident” that records were not altered.

“In the case of Arizona, the officials there say that they believe that someone downloaded a virus and may have compromised access into the system,” CNN’s Justice Correspondent Evan Perez said Monday. “The FBI is very much worried about personal information of voters that may be stolen by criminal groups that want to use it to steal money.”

Authorities said both of the systems are not connected to the internet, which helps to ensure that hackers cannot change election results this November.

The database breach comes just one month after the FBI sent out a “flash” alert encouraging election officials to beef up security.

“This is a big deal,” said Rich Barger, chief intelligence officer for the cybersecurity firm ThreatConnect, Yahoo New reported. “Two state election boards have been popped, and data has been taken. This certainly should be concerning to the common American voter.”

Michael Isikoff, Yahoo’s chief investigative correspondent who broke the story, said that reaching “hard conclusions” in terms of identifying the perpetrators would be difficult.

3429,3429,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/4/labor-day-testifies-to-capitalisms-strength/,Right,"OPINION:

Today’s holiday is the 122nd anniversary of the first national Labor Day, a date that in 1894 union workers thought would long be a rallying time for blue-collar labor against management — much in the fashion of the May Day associated with Marxism.

Ironically, however, Labor Day, like May 1 abroad, has not only lost the sting of its anti-management origins but is really testimony to the strength of capitalist dogma. It is also testimony to the errors of Marxism, which maintained that workers would ultimately fight against and prevail over their capitalist bosses.

For today American labor unions are on the ropes, and the once-communist countries of eastern Europe and much of Asia are immersed in capitalist planning. Instead of working classes coming together on Labor Day, as Marxist strategists predicted, their counterparts (corporate workers, small business employees, self-employed consultants, professional people in general or what Marxism would dub the bourgeoisie) are coming together throughout the world. And not just today, but on any given day of the year. Even on this holiday many will be in hotel rooms or airplanes preparing for meetings in countries that don’t honor the first Monday in September as special.

These individuals don’t consider themselves workers so much as they do professionals. They are formally educated as well as schooled in the nuances of their field. Their most frequent place of meeting is likely to be in airport lounges, at gates waiting to board or even in airplane seats. They exchange business cards as a minimum sort of rite-of-passage and sometimes follow up with an email, text or phone call.

In place of the raucous cries of blue-collar workers on strike or protest, their conversation is polite, rarely heated or finger-pointing, often punctuated by humor or small talk. Their reading materials are technical periodicals, their flags or ornaments of identification are briefcases and the latest models of mobile devices. These working people in and of the world rarely unite — as the proletariats in Marxist society were supposed to. They’re strongly individualistic, hoping to get ahead of their colleagues, but their folkways belie any struggle, although the current National Labor Relations Board, dominated by Democratic appointees, is attempting desperately to define them in blue-collar terms so as to effect unionization.

To be sure, these individuals appear to be getting ready for battle. At hotels from Portland, Oregon to Hong Kong, they huff and puff in fitness rooms or by swimming laps and jogging. Their body armor is measured in abs. Increasingly, they shun alcohol, even in the first-class airplane seats where it is free. And they recognize as well that smoking is not only a health hazard but can be a definite impediment to their upward mobility.

If the proletariat of Marxism looked forward to a heavenly city of classlessness and more power, this new breed of world travelers has a much more limited vision, focused mostly on time and predictability. Namely, the hope is that airline schedules will be kept, meetings attended or negotiations begun and effected as scheduled.

These new workers of the world hope for a clean and quiet hotel room, a good night’s sleep, pleasant receptionists, flight attendants, waiters and waitresses and cab drivers who not only know the shortest way to the airport but know when to converse and not to. Instead of criticizing the machine age that was the bane of the proletariat who feared it would hurt or replace them, they praise the mobile devices that have made their work and life instantaneous and seamless.

And they are religious in a sense. As they plan to venture from one spot in the globe or nation to another, their prayers are silent and modest, namely, that nobody will be sitting next to them on the next day’s flight.

3459,3459,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/21/charlotte-police-insist-protesters-have-wrong-stor/,Right,"After a night of violent protests and looting, police in Charlotte tried to assuage outrage over Tuesday’s fatal shooting of a black man by an officer, calling for calm Wednesday and saying that the version of events leading up to the shooting being cited by members of the public was based on incorrect information.

Neighbors and a relative said that Keith Lamont Scott was reading a book in his car while he waited for his son to get off a school bus, but police said the 43-year-old father had a gun that he repeatedly refused to drop when ordered by officers and which was recovered at the scene of the shooting.

“It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Wednesday during a news conference.

Tuesday’s police shooting of Mr. Scott and Friday’s fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a white police officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma, stoked racial tensions locally and nationally, drawing comments from the presidential nominees and the attention of the Justice Department.

Protests had been peaceful in Tulsa but became destructive overnight Tuesday in Charlotte. Sixteen police officers were injured and businesses damaged and looted when protests turned violent.

Violent protests began again after sundown in downtown Charlotte as demonstrators rushed police in riot gear at a downtown hotel, forcing officers to fire multiple tear gas rounds at several sites. Protesters threw some of the canisters back at the police, along with bottles and other debris.

SEE ALSO: Donald Trump laments ‘lack of spirit’ after second night of Charlotte protests

CNN reporter Ed Lavandera was tackled by a rioter while doing a live feed and interview with host Anderson Cooper; Mr. Lavandera later shrugged it off by disparaging his attacker’s football skills.

The city of Charlotte said one person had been shot in the head during the protests and is on life support. But officials said the shooting was civilian-on-civilian and did not involve the police.

At least one nearby store was looted, CNN’s live footage showed.

Videos of the fatal shooting of Terrence Crutcher in Tulsa have provided fodder for his family to publicly contest the version of events described by police, who quickly released footage of the event and do not dispute the fact that Mr. Crutcher was unarmed.

But it’s unclear whether videos of Tuesday’s shooting of Mr. Scott in Charlotte will soon become public. The black police officer who opened fire on Mr. Scott was not wearing a body camera, as Charlotte-Mecklenburg officers are required, but video from other officers’ body-worn or dashboard-mounted cameras may have captured the shooting.

The North Carolina chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is calling for the immediate release of the footage, stressing that a new law that will make it more difficult to release body camera footage is set to take effect in less than two weeks.

“As we’ve seen elsewhere, video footage of police shootings can provide crucial evidence of what took place — especially when there are conflicting accounts from police and community members,” said Karen Anderson, executive director of North Carolina’s ACLU. “Charlotte should set an example for North Carolina by releasing footage of the shooting promptly before the obstacles imposed by the new state law take effect.”

Police are reviewing multiple recordings from the scene. It’s unclear whether there is video that captured the entire incident, which began as officers responded to an apartment complex to serve a warrant on a resident.

There officers encountered Mr. Scott, who officials said exited a vehicle with a handgun and refused multiple commands to drop the weapon before Officer Brently Vinson opened fire.

Chief Putney said Wednesday that the police department does not intend to release video of the shooting until its investigation is complete.

“Right now, we can’t release it,” the chief said, citing state law. “It would have a negative impact on the integrity of the case, and that’s not something we are going to do.”

Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts, appearing on CNN Wednesday afternoon, said she hopes the video can be released “as quickly as possible.”

A woman claiming to be Mr. Scott’s daughter said in a video that was posted to Facebook and widely shared that her father was not armed and was holding a book, not a gun, when he was shot.

Civil rights activist John Barnett said Wednesday that he has spoken with a witness who said Mr. Scott did not make any threatening moves toward police before he was shot.

Mr. Barnett warned that, with different accounts of the events emerging, release of police videos might be necessary to restore calm.

“Just telling us this is still under investigation is not good enough for the windows of the Wal-Mart,” he said, referring to the retail store that was looted when protests turned violent overnight.

Chief Putney rebutted the claims that Mr. Scott was carrying a book, not a gun, saying that officers did not recover a book from the scene but had found a weapon.

Video of police shootings has proven key to investigations of use of force in the past. A South Carolina police officer was indicted earlier this year on federal charges after bystander video showed him shooting an unarmed black man in the back as he ran away after a traffic stop.

Tulsa police were quick to release video capturing Friday’s fatal shooting of Mr. Crutcher.

Videos from a dashboard camera and a helicopter showing the fatal shooting of the unarmed black man were released just three days after he was killed. The videos show Mr. Crutcher walking back to his vehicle with his hands above his head just before he is shot.

A lawyer for the white police officer who opened fire, Betty Shelby, said she fired because she believed Mr. Crutcher was reaching back into his vehicle for a weapon. A vial of PCP was later recovered from Mr. Crutcher’s car but no weapon, police said.

Lawyers for Mr. Crutcher’s family have used police videos that captured the incident to point out what they claim is a flaw in the officer’s account. Attorney Benjamin Crump said the images show that the vehicle’s window is closed and smeared with blood.

“He is not threatening to anyone,” Mr. Crump said. “How can he be reaching into the car if the window is up and there is blood on the glass?”

The Tulsa video has elicited reaction from the presidential nominees.

“People that choke, people that do that, maybe they can’t be doing what they’re doing,” said Republican nominee Donald Trump, referring to the officer who opened fire.

Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton called the contents of the video “unbearable.”

The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into Mr. Crutcher’s death in Tulsa, and it is “assessing” Mr. Scott’s death, said Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch.

“These tragic incidents have once again left Americans with feelings of sorrow, anger and uncertainty,” she said Wednesday. “They have once again highlighted — in the most vivid and painful terms — the real divisions that still persist in this nation between law enforcement and communities of color.”

Ms. Lynch and other leaders urged those angered by the deaths to remain calm as the incidents are investigated.

3464,3464,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/2/rudy-giuliani-donald-trumps-huge-tax-write-off-sho/,Right,"Donald Trump’s team said Sunday that he wasn’t just smart but a “genius” after a leaked tax return from the 1990s showed a nearly $1 billion write-off that likely got him out of paying taxes for years, but it also buttressed accusations by Hillary Clinton that he has avoided taxes.

The Republican presidential nominee’s tax bill was already a burning issue in the campaign, fueled by Mr. Trump’s refusal to follow tradition and release his federal income tax returns, when a bombshell report revealed the huge deduction in 1996 that could have eliminated years of tax debt.

Mr. Trump also teed up the controversy by quipping in a debate with Mrs. Clinton last week that he would have been “smart” if he had avoided paying taxes, as the former first lady charged.

Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended Mr. Trump’s tax moves by boasting that the billionaire businessman was an “absolute genius.”

“It shows you what a genius he is, how smart he is, how intelligent he is, how strategic he is. I want that working for me [as president],” Mr. Giuliani, an adviser to the Trump campaign, said on ABC’s “This Week.”

He stressed that the 20-year-old deduction was “perfectly legal,” noting that years of tax audits never resulted in criminal charges against Mr. Trump.

“We should get that straight immediately. This is a perfectly legal application of the tax code,” he said. “He would have been a fool not to take advantage of it. Not only that, he would have probably breached his fiduciary duty to his investors, to his business.”

Although the write-off had the potential to keep Mr. Trump from owing any taxes for as much as 18 years, the billionaire’s earnings in subsequent years likely exceeded the amount of the deduction and resulted in tax debt, Mr. Giuliani said.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also called Mr. Trump a “genius” who followed the law.

“Politically, he has said he is going to change these laws, and there’s no one who is better suited to change these laws than someone like him that has been subjected to audit after audit by the IRS year after year after year,” Mr. Christie, a former primary rival who now leads the Trump campaign’s transition team, said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Before the 1996 state tax return surfaced Saturday, Mr. Trump was under fire for saying in a debate with Mrs. Clinton last week that he would be “smart” if he got out of paying taxes.

“Maybe he doesn’t want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he’s paid nothing in federal taxes,” Mrs. Clinton said on the debate stage at Hofstra University in New York.

“That makes me smart,” interjected Mr. Trump.

Clinton camping spokesman Brian Fallon said Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Christie were “doubling down” on the debate remark.

“He [should] release all his returns so we see his full brilliance,” tweeted Mr. Fallon.

Sen. Bernard Sanders, a self-identified socialist who was Mrs. Clinton’s primary rival but has become a top surrogate, said Americans were “disgusted” by Mr. Trump’s tax deduction.

He said that billionaires such as Mr. Trump get their lobbyists and “friends on Capitol Hill” to put loopholes in the tax code so that they pay no taxes. But middle-class Americans get stuck with the bill for schools, infrastructure and the military, he said.

“Trump goes around and says, ‘Hey, I’m worth billions. I’m a successful businessman. But I don’t pay any taxes. But you, you make 15 bucks an hour. You pay the taxes, not me.’ That is why people are angry and want real change,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

A 1996 state tax return obtained by The New York Times showed Mr. Trump claiming a $916 million net operating loss. The massive deduction could have shielded him from any tax liability for up to 18 years, according to tax experts.

The report added pressure on Mr. Trump to release his tax returns.

There is no legal prohibition against releasing tax records amid an audit. There also is no legal requirement that he release the returns, although every presidential candidate for the last 40 years has done so.

Mrs. Clinton has released years of federal income tax returns filed jointly by herself and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, which included some eyebrow-raising deductions.

The Clintons previously claimed charitable donations of clothes, including Mr. Clinton’s used underwear, valued at as much as $2 each.

In their 2015 return, they deducted charitable donations, including a $1 million donation to the Clinton Family Foundation, which distributes money to various charities, including to the Clinton Foundation, which pays for some of the Clintons’ expenses such as travel.

The Trump campaign responded to the report by accusing the newspaper of attempting to aid Mrs. Clinton. The campaign did not say if Mr. Trump paid federal income taxes in the years since 1996, although it claimed he paid millions of dollars in various taxes.

“Mr. Trump’s a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,” the campaign said in a statement. “That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes, along with very substantial charitable contributions. Mr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President and he is the only one that knows how to fix it.”

The tax bill issue is tricky for both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton.

It is an open question whether getting out of paying taxes is smart. But Mrs. Clinton’s allegations also fall flat.

Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist refused to agree that avoiding paying taxes was smart. But he insisted that the criticism from Mrs. Clinton was both illegitimate and dishonest.

“The implication is that he’s not paying taxes he owes. I assure you the IRS actually cares about that stuff, and if there was even a hint of that, they’d have been all over him. That’s not the case,” said Mr. Norquist, founder and president of low-tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform.

“One of the problems with the income tax is it violates people’s privacy vis-a-vis the government, and the idea that anybody should open up their personal finances to the government is ridiculous,” he said. “The IRS has all of his stuff. If there was anything wrong, the IRS under this administration would have gone after him a long time ago.”

Accountants who make a living navigating tax laws said the same thing. Bibi Rudstedt, secretary of the Florida chapter of the National Association of Tax Professionals, Mrs. Clinton’s accusation lacked merit.

“Of course everyone pays taxes. I’m sure Mr. Trump pays taxes because, with his income, he must have AMT tax on everything,” she said, referring to the alternative minimum tax that the federal government imposes on the wealthy to prevent them from finding loopholes in tax law.

Mrs. Rudstedt, who has practiced tax accounting with her husband for 25 years in Spring Hill, Florida, bristled at the former secretary of state’s allegation that Mr. Trump weaseled out of paying taxes.

“I think she is stupid because she should know more. A man with that kind of income must pay taxes,” said Mrs. Rudstedt, a Trump supporter. “I don’t know where she got that from.”

Refusing to say it was “smart” to avoid paying taxes, Mrs. Rudstedt said that dodging taxes wasn’t the goal in her accounting office.

“Everybody has to pay his own share,” she said. “We don’t want them to overpay. But it is important that you claim the deductions you have. If you don’t have any deductions, that’s too bad. But I mean those are the things we have to help people with.”

Mr. Norquist’s nonprofit organization does not endorse candidates. However, he has endorsed Mr. Trump’s proposals to cut taxes and reduce federal regulations, and he has criticized Mrs. Clinton’s tax plan for increasing a variety of taxes.

Talking about Mr. Trump’s tax returns, he said, was a tactical maneuver to let Mrs. Clinton avoid talking about her plan to increase taxes and to duck other issues, such as her secret email setup as secretary of state, with which she mishandled classified material.

He also defended Mr. Trump against Mrs. Clinton’s claim that his attempt to minimize his tax burden was unpatriotic.

“Hillary Clinton has gone to great length to move her inheritable money so it won’t be hit by the death tax, even as she wants to raise other people’s death taxes,” said Mr. Norquist.

He was referring to Mrs. Clinton’s plan to increase estate tax imposed on inherited assets from 40 percent to 45 percent and add a 65 percent “death tax” on property valued at more than $500 million for a single person or $1 billion for a couple.

Mrs. Clinton and her husband use financial planning strategy, including putting ownership of their New York home in a residence trust that will avoid estate taxes, according to an analysis by Bloomberg.

“His position that you try to keep your taxes down is her position,” said Mr. Norquist. “It’s kind of goofy. She’s flailing because she doesn’t want to talk about other things. She wise to do that. If you’ve got a problem, keep pointing at other people.”

The remarks were first reported Friday afternoon by the Washington Post, and all six female Republicans in the Senate had weighed in by the same time Saturday.

Susan Collins of Maine told the Portland Press Herald she believes the comments demonstrate why the Republican Party’s candidate is “unsuitable for the presidency,” while Lisa Murkowski of Alaska tweeted that Mr. Trump has “forfeited his right” to the nomination.

Two others — Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Deb Fischer of Nebraska —each signaled support for Mr. Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Ms. Ayotte said she’d write Mr. Pence in on the November ballot while Ms. Fischer said he should take over the GOP presidential campaign.

“The appropriate next step may be for him to reexamine his candidacy,” Sen. Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia said of Mr. Trump in a statement Saturday.

“There is no excuse, and no room for such reprehensible and objectifying talk about anyone, ever,” opined Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa.

Despite calls to exit the race in the aftermath of the recording’s release, a defiant Mr. Trump tweeted Saturday that he isn’t throwing in the towel.

“The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly — I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN!” he wrote on Twitter.

At least nine of the 22 female Republicans in the U.S. House had publicly condemned Mr. Trump’s comments as of Saturday afternoon, CBS News reported, while the remaining members had not gone on the record about the leaked remarks.

The newly unearthed audio included Mr. Trump making vulgar comments while taping a television appearance 11 years ago for “Access Hollywood.”

“You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. I just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,” Mr. Trump said in the audiotape. “Grab them by the p—y. You can do anything.”

Clinton didn’t give a square account of the fallout from her email practices.

A look at some of the claims in the second presidential debate:

TRUMP, asked whether the predatory behavior with women that he described in a 2005 video amounted to sexual assault: “No, I didn’t say that at all.”

THE FACTS: He certainly didn’t own up to sexual assault in his boastful remarks in 2005. But he clearly described groping and kissing women without their permission, using his celebrity to impose himself on them.

“I don’t even wait,” he bragged in the video. “And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.” He went on: “Grab them by the p——. You can do anything.”

He described a specific sexual advance toward a married woman. “I moved on her like a bitch. But I couldn’t get there.”

TRUMP on Hillary Clinton’s behavior when, as a young public defender, she was assigned to represent an accused child rapist: “She’s seen on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman, is here with us tonight.”

THE FACTS: At no point was Clinton seen laughing at the victim.

In 1975, at the age of 12, Shelton was sexually assaulted in Northwest Arkansas. Clinton was asked by a judge overseeing the case to represent her alleged attacker. After the prosecution lost key evidence, Clinton’s client entered a plea to a lesser charge.

In an interview a decade later, Clinton expressed horror at the crime, but was recorded on tape laughing about procedural details of the case. The audio has been seized on by conservative groups looking to attack Clinton’s presidential candidacy but does not convey mirth at the girl’s fate.

TRUMP on women linked to Bill Clinton sexually: “Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.”

THE FACTS: There is no clear, independent evidence that Hillary Clinton “viciously” attacked women who alleged or confirmed sexual contact with her husband.

To be sure, in the 1992 Democratic primaries, she was deeply involved in the Clinton campaign’s effort to discredit one accuser, actress Gennifer Flowers, who alleged she had a long-running affair with Bill Clinton. Both Clintons acknowledged past troubles in their marriage but sought to undermine Flowers’ claims. Bill Clinton later acknowledged in a 1998 court deposition that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers.

Hillary Clinton was also quoted over the years making disparaging comments about other women linked with her husband.

What is lacking is proof that she engineered efforts to smear their reputation. Diane Blair, a political science professor and long-time Hillary Clinton friend who died in 2000, left behind an account of private interviews with Hillary Clinton in which she told her during the Monica Lewinsky affair that she considered the former White House intern a “narcissistic loony toon.”

While there’s indeed no direct, explicit evidence that classified information was leaked or that her server was breached, it was nevertheless connected to the internet in ways that made it more vulnerable to hackers - and the public may never know who saw them. FBI Director James Comey has said: “We assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail account.”

The Associated Press previously discovered that her private server, which has been a major campaign issue for Clinton and the focus of U.S. investigations, appeared to allow users to connect to it openly over the internet and control it remotely. That practice, experts said, wasn’t intended to be used without additional protective measures, and was the subject of U.S. government warnings at the time over attacks from even amateur hackers.

Since the AP in early 2013 traced her server to her home in Chappaqua, New York, Clinton hasn’t fully explained who administered her server, if it received software updates to plug security holes or if it was monitored for unauthorized access. It’s also unclear what, if any, encryption software Clinton’s server may have used to communicate with official U.S. government email accounts.

Comey has said Clinton and her staff “were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.” But he said the FBI won’t recommend criminal charges against Clinton for use of the server while she was secretary of state and closed the investigation.

TRUMP on Bill Clinton: “He lost his license. He had to pay an $850,000 fine.”

THE FACTS: Trump’s facts are, at best, jumbled. In 1998, lawyers for Bill Clinton settled with former Arkansas state employee Paul Jones for $850,000 in her four-year lawsuit alleging sexual harassment. It was not a fine, and there was no finding or admission of wrongdoing.

Trump erred in describing the legal consequences of that case. In a related case before the Arkansas State Supreme Court, Clinton was fined $25,000 and his Arkansas law license was suspended for five years. Clinton also faced disbarment before the U.S. Supreme Court but he opted to resign from the court’s practice instead of facing any penalties.

___

CLINTON: “We are now, for the first time ever, energy independent.”

THE FACTS: Clinton inaccurately overstates the case. For the first time in decades the United States gets more energy domestically than it imports, but it is not yet energy independent as the country continues to rely on oil imports, from the Mideast and elsewhere. Estimates vary as to when the U.S. might achieve energy independence.

Domestic oil production has greatly increased in recent years. And at the same time oil imports as a percentage of consumption have dropped, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oil imports have dropped from 3.58 billion barrels in 2008 to 2.68 billion barrels in 2015.

___

TRUMP: “She (Clinton) wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster…she wants to go to single-payer, which means the government basically rules everything.”

THE FACTS: It’s Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders - not Clinton - who supports a Canada-style government-run health care system.

While Clinton’s health care proposals would expand the government’s role in the health care system, she’s not talking about dismantling the current system, which is a hybrid of employer-sponsored coverage, government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and individually purchased insurance.

As president, Clinton would push for a government-sponsored insurance plan in the health care markets created by President Barack Obama’s health care law, as an alternative to private insurance. But those markets currently cover about 11 million people, while about 155 million have job-based coverage.

In excerpts from Clinton’s paid speeches she gave behind closed doors, though, she did praise Canada’s universal coverage and said that single-payer systems were “as good or better” when it came to basic medical care. But she also noted drawbacks of such health care systems, such as longer wait times for procedures.

___

TRUMP: “I would not have had our troops in Iraq.”

THE FACTS: Trump actually offered lukewarm support for invading Iraq before the war began. He’s repeatedly and erroneously claimed to have come out against the war before it started, telling Howard Stern in September 2002: “Yeah I guess so,” when asked if he would back an invasion.

This time, his claim was slightly different - that if he had been president at the time, he would not have invaded. It’s conceivable, at least, that he would have taken a position in office at odds with his stance as a private citizen. A few months before the March 2003 invasion, he did tell Fox News that the economy and threats from North Korea posed greater problems than Iraq.

___

TRUMP: “I don’t like Assad at all. But Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS.”

THE FACTS: Only partially true. Syria’s President Bashar Assad considers the Islamic State group to be among numerous “terrorist” groups that threaten his government. His overstretched military is mainly focused on combating Syrian opposition groups, some of which are supported by the United States. Assad does use air power against IS-held areas and his ground forces are engaged in fighting with the extremists in Deir el-Zour in the east.

___

TRUMP, asked whether he had ever sexually assaulted a woman: “No, I have not.”

THE FACTS: He’s been accused of it but a case has not been proved.

Trump’s first wife, Ivana Trump, accused him of rape in a deposition in the early 1990s. She later said she didn’t mean it literally, but rather that she felt violated. Trump was also sued for sexual harassment in 1997 by Jill Harth, a woman who, along with her romantic partner, was pitching Trump to get involved in a pin-up competition in the early 1990s.

In a recent interview with The New York Times, Harth said Trump ran his hands up her skirt during dinner in 1992, and on another occasion, she said Trump tried to force himself on her in his daughter Ivanka’s bedroom. “Next thing I know he’s pushing me against a wall and has his hands all over me,” Harth told the newspaper. Harth dropped her harassment lawsuit against Trump after he settled a separate breach of contract lawsuit. Trump has denied Harth’s allegations.

___

TRUMP: “She is raising your taxes and I am lowering your taxes. …She’s raising everybody’s taxes massively.”

CLINTON: “He would end up raising taxes on middle-class families”

THE FACTS: Clinton is not raising taxes on “everybody.” Nearly all of Hillary Clinton’s proposed tax increases would affect the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

Trump is proposing massive tax cuts for both individuals and businesses. Yet it’s not clear that all Americans would benefit. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax income rise from 0.8 percent to 1.9 percent. The wealthiest 1 percent would see their after-tax incomes rise at least 10.2 percent to 16 percent.

Yet Clinton may be right that Trump’s proposals would increase taxes on many middle- and lower-income families. Trump’s plan eliminates the personal exemption, which currently allows households to reduce their taxable income by $4,050 for each member of the household, including children. He would replace that with higher deductions, but for many single parents and families with three or more children, the standard deduction wouldn’t be large enough to offset the loss of personal exemptions.

___

TRUMP, asked whether his tweets directing people to check out a sex tape showed discipline: “It wasn’t ‘check out a sex tape.’”

THE FACTS: Yes it was. Trump tweeted “check out sex tape and past” of former 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado, a woman whom Clinton discussed in the first presidential debate as an example of Trump’s derogatory comments about women.

Machado has publicly supported Clinton and criticized Trump for body-shaming her by calling her “Miss Piggy” and threatening to take away her crown for gaining weight.

The video Trump appeared to be referring to was from a Spanish reality show. In 2005, Machado, who was a contestant on the show, was filmed in bed, under the covers with a male contestant and speaking sexually about his body parts. The grainy footage doesn’t show nudity, though Machado has said that she was having sex in the footage.

___

CLINTON: “If we repeal (Obama’s health care law) as Donald has proposed, all of those benefits I have mentioned are lost to everybody…and then we will have to start all over again.”

THE FACTS: Clinton is essentially correct. Congressional Republicans have promised their replacement plan for Obama’s health care law would provide coverage for the uninsured, but they have not provided enough detail to allow a rigorous comparison. A complete repeal of the health care law would wipe the slate clean and lawmakers would have to start over.

Republicans have expressed support for some goals of the health care law, such as assuring that people with health problems can get coverage, but whether a GOP replacement plan would work as well remains to be seen. Trump’s own plan was recently evaluated by the Commonwealth Fund and the RAND Corporation, and the analysis found would increase the number of uninsured people by about 20 million.

3492,3492,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/2/mike-pence-tim-kaine-in-spotlight-in-vice-presiden/,Right,"Donald Trump’s stumble in the first presidential debate and the rough week that followed upped the pressure on his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, to regain the campaign’s footing with a strong performance in Tuesday’s debate with Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine.

The two men have a lot in common and lots of political experience, including stints on Capitol Hill and in governor’s mansions. Both also were relatively unknown before being tapped for the No. 2 spot by their parties’ famous, albeit polarizing, nominees.

“Both of them are going to have to defend the top of the ticket. But after Donald Trump’s performance last week, Kaine will probably walk in thinking he’s got the advantage,” said Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf.

Strategists from both parties have applauded the way Mr. Pence and Mr. Kaine have handled themselves on the campaign trail so far, saying they’ve covered up some of their boss’ blemishes.

They’ve even left some political insiders wishing the veeps were atop the ticket.

“Governor Pence has brought a depth of experience and a strong conservative record to the ticket, helping to unite conservatives and party leaders around Trump-Pence,” said Phil Cox, a GOP consultant. “He’s proven to be a strong, effective defender of Donald Trump and an important character witness for key segments of our party’s coalition.”

On the debate stage in Farmville, Virginia, Mr. Kaine likely will have to answer questions about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s secret email setup as secretary of state, conflicts of interest from corporate and foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation and maybe her role covering up former President Bill Clinton’s extramarital affairs.

Still, Mr. Kaine enjoys an advantage from the past week’s news coverage that focused on Mr. Trump’s debate fumbles and his repeated defenses of calling 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado “Miss Piggy” when she gained weight after winning the Trump-owned pageant that year.

Mr. Kaine, 58, a former Virginia governor, has a homespun style, boasts a relatively modestly lifestyle and often harkens to his working-class upbringing in a Catholic family in Kansas City, Missouri.

“My folks weren’t much into politics. My dad ran a union ironworking shop and my mom was his best salesman,” he said in his acceptance speech the Democratic National Convention. “My parents, Al and Kathy, here tonight and going strong — they taught me about hard work, and about kindness, and, most especially, faith.”

Mr. Pence, 57, describes himself as a “Christian, a conservative and a Republican — in that order.”

Born into an Irish Catholic family, Mr. Pence later became a member of an Evangelical Christian church, referring to himself as “born-again, evangelical Catholic.”

A polished public speaker, Mr. Pence is a former member of the House GOP leadership team and a former talk-radio host. But he’ll be put the test because of the way the conversation has shifted since the Clinton campaign marched out Ms. Machado as part of its push to brand Mr. Trump as a sexist and anti-woman.

Mr. Trump hit back, bringing up the beauty queen’s sex romp on a Mexican reality TV show, and teasing the idea that he is going to put more emphasis on Mr. Clinton’s extramarital affairs.

As a result, the GOP establishment is hopeful that Mr. Pence can put an end to the tabloid-like atmosphere of the past few days and get the campaign back on track by refocusing the conversation on Mrs. Clinton and making the case that the nation can’t afford another four years like the last eight.

“I think Mike Pence has to do what he does best, which is to show his substance, depth, his solid balance, his good judgment, his even temper, and his empathy — all of which have been hallmarks of his career and I think will turn up in the debate,” said Fred Malek, a veteran GOP consultant. “Many people I talked to wish the tickets were reversed — in which case you could be assured of a reasonably happy ending.”

There was a generational chasm in last two vice presidential debates, with Joe Biden, 73, facing off against then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, 52, in 2008 and House Speaker Paul Ryan, 46, in 2012.

Mr. Kaine and Mr. Pence were born a little over a year apart, and each of them have at least 15 years of public service under their belts.

With health questions swirling around Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump having recently celebrated his 70th birthday, there has been more attention paid to the idea that Mr. Kaine or Mr. Pence could end up as commander in chief.

3502,3502,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/18/undercover-video-shows-democrats-saying-they-hire-/,Right,"Two top Democratic strategists have exited the presidential campaign after explosive undercover videos showed them discussing voter fraud and their roles in planting paid agitators at campaign events for Republican candidate Donald Trump.

Robert Creamer, founder of Democracy Advocates and the husband of Rep. Janice D. Schakowsky, Illinois Democrat, stepped down from the campaign Tuesday, a day after Scott Foval was fired from his post as national field director of Americans United for Change.

Mr. Trump, who has long complained of a “rigged” election system, said at a Tuesday rally in Colorado that the video released by the conservative group Project Veritas Action confirmed his suspicions of Democrat-sponsored political chicanery.

“The protesters are paid a lot of money by the [Democratic National Committee], and they kept saying, ‘I wonder why those people are here, because they never seem to have much on their mind other than stand up and protest,’” Mr. Trump told a crowd in Colorado Springs. “And yesterday it came out, but it was barely covered by the media. But it’s all over the internet. They were busted.”

Brad Woodhouse, Americans United for Change president, said in a late-Monday statement that Mr. Foval “is no longer associated with Americans United for Change.”

He insisted that the Democratic political consulting firm has “always operated according to the highest ethical and legal standards.”

Mr. Creamer, a four-decade Democratic strategist who pleaded guilty in 2005 to charges of bank fraud and tax violations, said in a statement that he was “unwilling to become a distraction to the important task of electing Hillary Clinton.”

“We regret the unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations that were captured on hidden cameras of a temporary regional contractor for our firm, and he is no longer with us,” said Mr. Creamer, who is also featured in the videos.

The two 16-minute videos were released Monday and Tuesday after a yearlong undercover investigation headed by Project Veritas’ James O’Keefe, known for his hidden-camera probes into Planned Parenthood, ACORN and voter fraud.

Mr. O’Keefe said the investigation reveals “compelling evidence of a dark-money conspiracy” and that he would continue to release videos as part of a series titled “Rigging the Election” until voters go to the polls on Nov. 8.

The first video shows Democratic strategists discussing how they hire agitators — including union members, homeless people and the mentally ill — to incite violence by provoking Trump supporters on camera at campaign stops.

Project Veritas released a second video Tuesday showing Mr. Foval brainstorming over ways to commit voter fraud, such as by busing people from one state to another, while appearing to indicate that it had already been done in Iowa.

“It’s a pretty easy thing for Republicans to say, ‘Well, they’re busing people in,’” Mr. Foval said. “Well, you know what? We’ve been busing people in to deal with you f—-ing assholes for 50 years, and we’re not going to stop now. We’re just going to find a different way to do it. So, I mean I grew up with that idea. They used to bus people out to Iowa. If they needed people, there we’d bus people out to Iowa.”

The same video shows Mr. Creamer discussing a proposal by a Project Veritas investigator to register people to vote illegally by setting up a shell corporation.

“I’m going to write down these options,” Mr. Creamer said. “Let me see if I can chat with the people who are most involved in Hispanic voter registration.”

Mr. Foval, who has worked for the George Soros-funded People for the American Way, said his paid agitators fueled a Chicago protest in March that forced the Trump campaign to cancel its event.

“They’re starting confrontations in the line, right?” said Mr. Foval. “They’re not starting confrontations in the rally. Because once they’re inside the rally, they’re under Secret Service’s control. When they’re outside the rally, the media will cover it no matter where it happens. The key is initiating the conflict by having leading conversations with people who are naturally psychotic.”

Inciting Trump supporters was easy, he said.

“I mean, honestly, it’s not hard to get some of these assholes to pop off,” Mr. Foval said. “It’s a matter of showing up, to want to get into the rally, in a Planned Parenthood T-shirt. Or, ‘Trump is a Nazi,’ you know. You can message to draw them out and draw them to punch you.”

Another operative, Aaron Black, who identified himself as “deputy rapid response director for the DNC for all things Trump on the ground,” said he was with Mr. Creamer’s group Democracy Partners but that his work was supposed to be a secret.

“Nobody’s really supposed to know about me,” Mr. Black said. “So the Chicago protest, when they shut all that, that was us. It was more [Mr. Creamer] than me, but none of this is supposed to come back to us because we want it coming from people. We don’t want it to come from the party.”

He said the idea is for the protests to appear spontaneous, not orchestrated by the DNC.

“So if we do a protest and if it’s branded a DNC protest, right away the press is going to say, ‘partisan,’” said Mr. Black, also known as “Aaron Minter,” according to the video.

“But if I’m in there coordinating with all the groups on the ground and sort of playing field general but they are the ones talking to the cameras, then it’s actually people, but if we send out press advisories with DNC on them and Clinton campaign, it just doesn’t have the same effect,” he said.

The same day the video was released, Mr. Black posted a photo on Twitter showing protesters outside Trump Tower holding signs with messages such as, “Trump Demeans Women.”

Keeping the protesters’ connection to the DNC hidden from the press was a priority, Mr. Foval said.

“We have to be really careful because what we don’t need is for it to show up on CNN that the DNC paid for X people to — that’s not going to happen,” he said.

Mr. O’Keefe said the first video raises questions about whether the Clinton campaign is coordinating with super PACs and independent expenditure committees in violation of campaign finance rules.

The Clinton campaign, DNC, Americans United for Change and Democracy Partners did not return requests for comment Tuesday.

The only public criticism of the videos has come from foes of Mr. O’Keefe’s past work such as Salon’s Brendan Gauthier, who said Project Veritas has been criticized for “strategically editing footage to make false accusations.”

In the video, Mr. Foval made clear his connections to the DNC and the Clinton campaign.

“We are contracted directly with the DNC and the campaign both. I am contracted to [Mr. Creamer]. But I answer to the head of special events for the DNC and the head of special events and political for the campaign,” said Mr. Foval.

He goes on to say, “The campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval Group, the Foval Group goes and executes the sh— on the ground.”

Mr. Creamer indicated that he was in close contact with the Clinton campaign, saying, “We have a call with the campaign every day to go over the focuses that need to be undertaken.”

“Wherever Trump and Pence are going to be, we have events,” Mr. Creamer said. “And we have a whole team across the country that does that. Both consultants and people from the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party apparatus and people from the campaign, the Clinton campaign. And my role in the campaign is to manage all that.”

Another activist, Zulema Rodriguez, told the Project Veritas investigators, “I just had a call today with the campaign and the DNC. Every day at 1 o’clock.”

She also took credit for being involved with two anti-Trump events in March: the Chicago rally and another in Arizona in which anti-Trump protesters blocked a highway.

Federal Election Commission records unearthed by Project Veritas show that Ms. Rodriguez was paid nearly $2,000 on Feb. 29 by the Hillary for America campaign.

In conversations with Project Veritas reporters, Mr. Foval described his operation as “bird dogging,” meaning that he places hired protesters in key positions at Republican campaign events, often in front of rallies or lines.

He said he has training centers in New York, Washington, Las Vegas, Colorado and Minneapolis, and that trainees include the mentally ill and homeless people.

“I’m saying we have mentally ill people that we pay to do sh—, make no mistake,” Mr. Foval said. “Over the last 20 years. I’ve paid off a few homeless guys to do some crazy stuff, and I’ve also taken them for dinner and I’ve also made sure they had a hotel and a shower and I’ve put them in a program. I’ve done that.”

He also has contacts with unions such as the AFL-CIO. “But the reality is, a lot of people, especially our union guys, a lot of union guys, they’ll do whatever you want,” Mr. Foval said. “They’re rock ‘n’ roll.”

Mr. Foval also made it clear that he viewed Mr. Creamer as a mentor.

“I work for Bob Creamer one to one,” Mr. Foval said in the video. “I’m the white hat. Democracy Partners is kind of dark hat. Bob Creamer is diabolical, and I love him for it.”

3514,3514,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/24/obamacare-premiums-rise-sharply-choices-dwindle-ad/,Right,"Obamacare premiums will soar in 2017, the administration acknowledged Monday, with the price of the most popular benchmark plans jumping an average of 22 percent as the law continues to rely on older, sicker customers than its backers had envisioned.

The number of insurers offering plans on the federally run exchange will also plummet as companies tap out, saying they can’t figure out a way to make the economics work — and raising the risk of lower competition and worse premium increases.

Roughly one in five customers will have only a single insurer as an option next year after major players such as UnitedHealth Group and Aetna withdrew from most states and nearly all of Obamacare’s co-op plans failed.

That’s particularly rough news for President Obama, who is trying to boost his legacy in his final months in office, and for Hillary Clinton, his would-be Democratic successor, who has defended the law.

“This shows why the entire program must be repealed and replaced,” said Jason Miller, a spokesman for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

Congressional Republicans, struggling to maintain their majorities in both chambers, also seized on the news, warning voters that electing Democrats would cement the Affordable Care Act into law.

Obamacare customers — who at this time of year are also voters — can get a first look next week at their own rates when they log onto the federal HealthCare.gov website. Open enrollment for 2017 begins Nov. 1.

The Health and Human Services Department urged consumers to shop around to try to find the best deals and said 80 percent of customers won’t feel the full sticker shock because they qualify for taxpayer-funded subsidies.

HHS said nearly three-quarters of customers in 2017 will be able to find a plan for $75 or less per month after that tax credits kick in.

“I know that there has been much talk and discussion about marketplace rate increases this year. But headline rate changes don’t actually reflect what the vast majority of consumers will pay,” HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell has said about open enrollment.

Yet several million customers do not qualify for government subsidies or purchase insurance off the exchanges, so they will feel the full brunt of the increases.

Taxpayers will also have to shell out more money to cover the subsidies for those who do qualify — meaning Obamacare’s costs will continue to rise.

On Monday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to detail just how much of a burden taxpayers are shouldering.

“While the administration continues to focus on premium ‘affordability,’ it ignores the undeniable fact that federal taxpayers are subsidizing these premium increases through tax credits,” wrote Rep. Fred Upton, Michigan Republican and the panel’s chairman, along with other leading members. “The committee is concerned that the federal taxpayer continues to bear the burden of subsidizing the growing cost of health care insurance.”

Analysts for months had warned of massive premium increases, saying the Obamacare program is still struggling to entice healthy customers who are needed to make the economics work.

Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, recently said the law “is no longer affordable for an increasing number of people.” Tennessee Insurance Commissioner Julie McPeak said the state’s Obamacare exchange is “very near collapse.”

“The fact that premium increases in the ACA marketplaces are going to be substantially higher in 2017 has been known for months, so there’s no October surprise here,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. “The start of open enrollment just means that these increases are becoming more tangible for those consumers who are affected.”

Increases will vary widely from place to place, though some of the figures are eye-popping: In Arizona, a 27-year-old’s average monthly premium for the second-lowest silver, or “benchmark,” plan jumps $196 to $422, a 116 percent increase, before subsidies.

In Oklahoma, that same customer would get a 69 percent increase. Customers in Indiana and Massachusetts, which runs its own exchange, would be the only ones to see a decrease, of 3 percent, according to the HHS report.

The administration said things could get worse if the federal courts do not overturn a judge’s decision in May that sided with House Republicans, who say the Treasury is unlawfully reimbursing insurers for losses under the 2010 health care overhaul.

In court papers Monday, the Justice Department said Republicans shouldn’t have been allowed to sue over the cost-sharing program, which is designed to pay back insurers who must help poorer enrollees with out-of-pocket expenses.

Millions of Obamacare customers with incomes from 100 percent to 250 percent of the poverty line rely on the payments, and health care plans are required to reduce their out-of-pocket costs, whether they are reimbursed or not.

“If the government stopped making cost-sharing reduction payments, insurers would still be required by statute to reduce the cost-sharing charges they impose on eligible individuals,” administration attorneys wrote. “Instead of recouping those costs as required by the statute, the insurers would make up the difference by raising their premiums.”

Despite headwinds, Mrs. Burwell is predicting that the marketplace will expand by roughly 1 million customers in 2017 as insurers bring their prices in line with actual costs.

She estimated that 13.8 million people will buy plans during open enrollment on the exchanges, compared with 12.7 million who initially signed up for 2016.

That is still short of the 15 million that congressional scorekeepers predicted just a few months ago.

Even Mr. Obama has said his law will need changes after he is out of office, including a government-run plan, or “public option,” to bolster competition in the exchanges.

As it stands, the number of insurers participating on HealthCare.gov has dwindled from 232 this year to 167 in 2017.

HHS said customers on HealthCare.gov, which serves 39 states, will still be able to choose, on average, from 30 plans with different combinations of premiums, out-of-pocket costs, networks of hospitals and physicians, and prescription drug coverage options.

3517,3517,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/22/donald-trumps-closing-argument-battle-cry-against-/,Right,"Donald Trump over the weekend delivered a closing argument against Hillary Clinton and the “totally rigged system” he says enables her — but the businessman’s presidential campaign expressed open frustration Sunday that a policy-centric message once again has been drowned out.

Trailing badly in virtually all polls, Mr. Trump outlined plans for his first 100 days in office during a speech in Gettysburg on Saturday. In his attempt to put the focus on issues during the home stretch of the campaign, the Republican nominee offered himself as a “once in a lifetime” agent of change to revive the economy and stamp out Washington corruption, and he drew a stark contrast between his plan and the more-of-the-same government that he said Mrs. Clinton would run to benefit herself and her cronies.

But much of Mr. Trump’s pitch was lost as headlines instead focused on his vow to sue the 11 women that have come forward in recent weeks to accuse him of sexual assault. The Republican certainly contributed to such media coverage by calling the women liars and charging that the news media presented their claims “with virtually no fact-checking whatsoever.”

“All of these liars will be sued when the election is over,” the New York billionaire said in Gettysburg.

Mr. Trump said the smears used against him underscore the corrupt power wielded by the political establishment, which he said poses an even greater threat to working Americans.

“If they can fight somebody like me with unlimited resources to fight back, just look at what they can do to you — your jobs, your security, your education, your health care, the violation of religious liberty, the theft of your Second Amendment, the loss of your factories, your homes and much more,” Mr. Trump said.

As was the case during his final presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday night, debates about issues took a backseat over the weekend. At the debate, his back-and-forth with Mrs. Clinton over gun rights, abortion, and the economy was overshadowed by his refusal to say he’ll accept the results of the Nov. 8 election.

In the case of his Saturday speech, headlines were dominated by his lawsuit threat, not his detailed policy prescriptions.

Trump campaign officials also have struggled to fend off a growing narrative that says the race is all but over. Polls have shown Mrs. Clinton with a significant lead. Surveys also have shown the former first lady ahead in many battleground states, though polls show tight races in Florida, Ohio and other key states.

The most recent Real Clear Politics average of all polls gives Mrs. Clinton a 6-point edge; other recent polls have given her a double-digit lead.

Mrs. Clinton herself clearly believes the race has been won. Over the weekend, she turned much of her fire on Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and other Republicans locked in close re-election battles, hoping to deliver a Democratic landslide that would give the party control of both houses of Congress.

She made clear she’ll spend little time engaging with Mr. Trump directly and instead will focus on congressional races.

“He can say whatever he wants to. He can run his campaign however he wants to,” she told reporters after a campaign event in Pennsylvania. “We’re going to be emphasizing the importance of electing Democrats.”

The Trump campaign insists the polls are wrong and that the race will turn around.

In an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” program on Sunday, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the close relationship between some media outlets and the Clinton campaign has resulted in a host of stories claiming the White House contest is finished even though the election is still more than two weeks away.

“We feel very frustrated. It’s not all members of the media. It’s not even most members of the media, but look at the stories being written now,” she said. “The path to 270 [electoral votes] is narrow, the path to 270 is over. That is so unfair to the voters who are yet to go to the ballot box and exercise their constitutional rights to tell us who should be president of the United States and commander in chief.”

The Clinton campaign is actively pushing its supporters to get the polls over the next several weeks during early voting periods and has downplayed the notion that it has the election in the bag.

“We’ve got to stay focused, and what’s important to us is we don’t want anybody to wake up after election day … and they didn’t have a chance to participate,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN on Sunday.

As for his own pitch, Mr. Trump is painting himself as the only candidate in the race capable of delivering change. He called his opponent the very embodiment of a political establishment that he says is rigged against working-class Americans.

“I’m asking the American people to rise above the noise and clutter of our broken politics and to embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been the central ingredient in the American character, and there is nothing better or stronger than the American character,” he said. “Hillary Clinton is not running against me. She is running against change and she is running against all the American people and all the American voters.

He also presented a 100-day “action plan,” which he described as his contract with the American people. It began with an ambitious agenda for his first day in office:

⦁ Submit a Constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress.

⦁ Institute a hiring freeze on federal employees to begin thinning the federal workforce through attrition, with exemptions for defense, public health and public safety jobs.

⦁ Require that every new federal regulation be accompanied by the elimination of two existing regulations.

⦁ Impose a five-year ban on White House and congressional officials becoming lobbyist.

⦁ Impose a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.

⦁ Institute a “complete ban on foreign lobbyists” raising money for American political campaigns.

Most of the agenda echoed themes from throughout Mr. Trump’s campaign, although he added urgency with the timeline for enacting his plans.

Mr. Trump also confronted climate change vowing to end billions of dollars in payments to the United Nations climate change program and use the money instead to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure.

“We’re going to fix our own environment,” he said.

3523,3523,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/28/james-comey-fbi-director-reopens-clinton-email-inv/,Right,"The FBI has renewed its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s secret emails, Director James Comey told Congress in a new letter Friday, heightening the stakes for the Democratic presidential nominee with less than two weeks before Election Day.

Mr. Comey said his agents learned of new emails “pertinent” to their probe while working on an unrelated case. He said his agents need to review those messages to see whether they contain classified information and whether they affect his previous decision.

In July, Mr. Comey announced that while he determined Mrs. Clinton did mishandle classified information, she was too inept to know the risks she was running, so he couldn’t prove she did it intentionally — undercutting a criminal case.

His new announcement Friday threatened to upend the presidential campaign.

John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, demanded Mr. Comey explain what new information he’s found, and blamed Republicans for “browbeating” the FBI into Friday’s decision.

“Director Comey’s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant,” he said.

VOTE NOW: Will the FBI find evidence to prosecute Hillary Clinton?

“It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.”

Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, said Mr. Comey owes the campaign and the public a “clearer accounting” of the new information.

“When you do this 11 days before a presidential election, and you don’t provide many details — but details apparently are being given by the FBI to the press — this is very, very troubling,” Mr. Kaine told VICE News. “We hope that the director, and we really think that he should, give a clearer accounting of exactly what’s going on right now.”

Mr. Podesta predicted the FBI would come to the same conclusion this time as it did in July, and he pointedly noted that the letter was sent to eight Republican committee chairman in Congress. But it was also carbon-copied to the ranking Democrats.

Mr. Comey did not explain in his letter to what information the new emails contain, how long it will take to evaluate them, nor how they were obtained.

The New York Times reported Friday that the emails were snagged as part of an investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, and allegations he sent illicit messages through text and social media applications to a 15-year-old North Carolina girl. The paper reported that law enforcement officials seized at least one device shared by Mr. Weiner and his now estranged wife, Huma Abedin — a top personal aide to Mrs. Clinton. The couple announced they were separating in August amid Mr. Weiner’s involvement in another sexting scandal, but before the 15-year-old girl’s allegations surfaced.

SEE ALSO: The FBI’s sideways handling of Hillary Clinton

As Mrs. Clinton’s top personal aide, Ms. Abedin also had an account on the secret Clinton email server and exchanged classified information with her boss.

Mr. Comey said he was briefed on the new emails on Thursday and felt it was important to promptly alert Congress of investigators’ latest efforts.

Republican leaders who were among the eight recipients of the letter called for further disclosures by the FBI director, with Sen. Richard C. Shelby urging him to provide additional information before voters go to the polls Nov. 8.

“While I am pleased that the FBI is re-opening this case in light of new information, it is imperative that the Bureau immediately evaluate the material to complete this investigation,” said Mr. Shelby, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. “The American people are electing their next Commander-in-Chief only days from now, and they deserve to know the conclusion of your review prior to Election Day.”

Sen. Charles E. Grassley, who as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee was one of the letter’s recipients, said Mr. Comey owes the country more of an explanation about what he’s found.

“The letter from Director Comey was unsolicited and, quite honestly, surprising. But it’s left a lot more questions than answers for both the FBI and Secretary Clinton,” the Iowa Republican said.

GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, campaigning in Manchester, New Hampshire, said he respected the FBI for reversing itself.

“Perhaps, finally, justice will be done,” he said.

For her part Mrs. Clinton, campaigning in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, did not address the issue, instead sticking doggedly to her stump speech of attacks on Mr. Trump mixed with a plea to voters to focus on issues.

President Obama, who has been saddled by association with Mrs. Clinton, who was serving him during the time she maintained her secret email server, did not respond to questions shouted by reporters Friday afternoon as he left the White House on a campaign trip to Florida to stump for Mrs. Clinton and Democratic Senate candidate Patrick Murphy.

Briefing reporters on Air Force One, deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said Mr. Obama President Obama expects the FBI to “follow the facts wherever they lead” and to act “irrespective of politics.”

Mr. Schultz said the new email development does not affect Mr. Obama’s support of Mrs. Clinton.

Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson said on CNN, “Obviously the FBI didn’t do this lightly. There has to be something there.”

He lamented the prospect of “a president-elect under criminal investigation.”

“That’s what’s going to now be the case, if she is elected,” he said. “She will control those jobs [in the Justice Department] that controls how this issue moves forward, which points to a special prosecutor. This is a mess. It’s a mess. I think Trump is toast, so Hillary moving forward as president-elect? Four years of this? Ugh.”

Congressional Republicans, who have been at odds with Mr. Trump on many issues, found common ground with their nominee in attacking Mrs. Clinton.

“This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators,” said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan.

He again called for the Obama administration to suspend the classified intelligence briefings Mrs. Clinton is getting as the Democratic nominee.

And Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, wondered whether the Justice Department will now convene a grand jury to pursue the case.

He said the FBI had already cleared Mrs. Clinton of mishandling classified information, so to reopen the case suggests either potential new evidence of intent to mishandle secrets, or other potential criminal questions.

“Originally FBI focused on ‘classification rules’ and not broader issues related to government records/obstruction of justice. Will they now?” Mr. Cornyn tweeted.

An FBI spokesman declined Friday to comment on the reopening of the investigation.

The revelation that the investigation is continuing comes too late to affect the 16 million voters who have already cast ballots in absentee or in-person voting.

Republicans have said Mrs. Clinton appeared to mislead Congress in her sworn testimony to the Benghazi probe in 2015.

The staggering reversal by Mr. Comey comes as Mrs. Clinton is reeling from another electronic scandal — the revelations from emails obtained and posted by WikiLeaks from Mr. Podesta’s personal email address.

Mrs. Clinton refused to use an official state.gov email account during her four years as secretary, instead setting up an account on a server she kept at her home in New York. That arrangement shielded her emails from public disclosure for six years, thwarting open-records laws.

She belatedly turned over some 30,000 messages she deemed government-related, but the FBI recovered thousands of others she didn’t — including some that contained classified information.

It had to end sometime. This is the last of the Inside the Beltway weekend candidate reports — that is, until we start tracking outgoing and incoming presidents, transition teams, long goodbyes, short tempers, hanging chads, hysterical journalists and everything else looming on the horizon. On this final weekend before Election Day, here’s where Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will be.

Mr. Trump is concentrating appearances in four states: North Carolina, New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania. He has six major rallies planned. Running mate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence will appear in Florida, North Carolina and Michigan.

Mrs. Clinton and her army of surrogates are rustling and bustling. Or something. There are 33 Clinton campaign events planned in 11 states, with the greatest concentration of activity in Iowa and Colorado. The Democratic nominee herself appears at three events in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio. Also appearing on her behalf: President Obama (four events), Vice President Joe Biden (three events), running mate Sen. Tim Kaine (two), Sen. Bernard Sanders (six), Bill Clinton (three) and Chelsea Clinton (five). Musicians Stevie Wonder, Cher, Jay Z, Katy Perry and Jon Bon Jovi will give seven performances in six cities.

And let’s not forget Libertarian hopeful Gary Johnson, who has five rallies planned this weekend in California, Colorado and Illinois. Not to be outdone, Green Party nominee Jill Stein will appear at four rallies in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia.

BOLTON’S ADVICE FOR COMEY

Former U.N. Ambassador John R. Bolton has advice for FBI Director James Comey as the complex fallout from Hillary Clinton‘s use of a private email system continues, and an FBI investigation of it all continues.

“Jim Comey can redeem himself in history. I think he’s got to go to President Obama, and maybe do it in the form of a public letter, in saying, ‘You have questioned my judgment, my integrity, my competence to do this job. If you no longer have trust and confidence in my ability, then fire me. And if you’re not willing to do that, then let me conduct this investigation without interference from people that are trying to tilt it in Hillary’s direction. I think he’s got to have a direct confrontation,” Mr. Bolton told Breitbart News, calling it “an act of courage” and noting that people “have started comparing the whole Clinton scandal to Watergate.”

PREPARE FOR MAMMOTH MEDIA

Election coverage starts early. Very early. Cable and broadcast networks crank up their programming this weekend, so be prepared.

The Fox News Channel, for example, kicks off at 6 a.m. Saturday in spiffy “America’s Election Headquarters.” The network also will unveil a brand new state-of-the-art studio. NBC gets rolling Sunday; “Meet the Press” originates live from “NBC Election Headquarters.”

It is a similar story elsewhere, constituting a full dress rehearsal for Tuesday, when the airwaves will be jammed with news and non-news of the most hair-raising presidential derby on record. Fox News, in fact, begins its election coverage Tuesday at 4 a.m.; the network’s top prime-time talent will be on parade all day and night, along will be 25 correspondents in 12 states.

WEATHER OR NOT

“This election year, American citizens have endured wall-to-wall breathless tension from our colleagues in the news media, and our forecast calls for a 100 percent chance that will continue through Election Day,” advises The Weather Channel, which has its own programming planned for the big day.

It’s all clouds and rainbows, accompanied by relaxing smooth jazz. Wait, will there be brunch with that? No, but there will be eight hours worth, come Tuesday.

“If you want a break from the pundits, pontifications, predictions and politics, turn to weather. Starting at 3 p.m. ET on November 8, the marathon will include the most beautiful, awe-inspiring, and calming weather video and scenery ever caught on tape,” the channel says.

ONE FOR THE ROAD

“Whether Republican, Democrat, independent, undecided or unrepresented, the one thing that every American seems to agree on is, ‘we can’t wait for the election to be over,’” says Danzka Vodka, a Denmark-based vodka maker that notes the Danes have a word for election exhaustion or disgust — Politikerleden.

That in mind, the company has dreamed up a cocktail of the same name for the “politically weary.” Though there is work involved, here is how to make Politikerleden:

Ingredients: 6 lemons. 4 cups of water. 1 cup sugar cup fresh blackberries 2 oz. Danzka Original Vodka, 1 sprig fresh lavender.

Instructions: With a vegetable peeler, remove zest from four lemons and squeeze enough juice from all lemons to make one cup. In a saucepan, boil two cups of water with sugar, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Add zest, lemon juice and remaining water and cool. In a food processor or blender, puree blackberries and stir into lemon mixture. Pour liquid through a sieve into a container. Blackberry lemonade will keep refrigerated for several days. Serve in a rocks glass filled with ice, add 2 oz. of Danzka Original Vodka, top with 3 oz. of blackberry lemonade. Garnish with a lavender sprig.

3558,3558,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/6/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-says-nothing-new-huma-a/,Right,"The FBI cleared Hillary Clinton for a second time Sunday, saying it hasn’t found anything in the latest emails obtained from Huma Abedin’s laptop to change the findings from this summer that the former secretary of state was reckless with classified information but couldn’t be prosecuted for it.

FBI Director James B. Comey, in a brief letter to Congress, said his agents have gone through all of the messages sent or received by Mrs. Clinton during her four-year tenure in the State Department that were on Ms. Abedin’s laptop.

“Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,” Mr. Comey said.

The letter reverberated across the campaign trail, with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump still insisting that Mrs. Clinton engaged in illegal behavior.

“You have to understand it is a rigged system and she’s protected,” Mr. Trump said at a rally in an airplane hangar minutes after the Comey letter was made public.

Later, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the letter did not clear Mrs. Clinton of wrongdoing.

SEE ALSO: Clinton campaign on Comey announcement: We’re moving on

“Director Comey says it doesn’t change anything. It certainly doesn’t change anything from what we already know,” she told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto. “Nothing changes the fact that she has been very reckless and careless with security information and this disqualifies her.”

The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, said the letter was an exoneration.

“We were always confident nothing would cause the July decision to be revisited. Now Director Comey has confirmed it,” spokesman Brian Fallon said on Twitter.

At a rally with NBA star LeBron James in Cleveland, Mrs. Clinton did not mention the latest turn in the FBI investigation. Her campaign staff traveling with her, however, appeared to be ecstatic over the news.

In July, Mr. Comey said Mrs. Clinton was “extremely careless” with top-secret information and may have had her secret email server hacked by foreign governments. But he said she was so inept that no prosecutor could show she intentionally risked national security — undercutting the chances of a criminal case.

This fall, FBI agents looking into sexting accusations against Ms. Abedin’s estranged husband, former Rep. Anthony D. Weiner, came across emails on a computer that the spouses shared. There was enough concern about the messages to prompt Mr. Comey to renew his probe.

In clearing Mrs. Clinton again, the FBI director gave no details about the search or what his agents found among the more than 600,000 messages they reportedly recovered from the computer.

Mr. Comey did say agents checked through all of the messages that could have involved Mrs. Clinton during her time in the State Department and that none of those messages changed the assessment announced in July after a yearlong investigation.

The director faced intense pressure after announcing late last month that he was renewing the probe, and Democrats from President Obama down said the FBI had goofed by stepping in with such a vague announcement in the days before an election.

Sunday’s correction was seen by Democrats as a belated, though important, move.

“While the original letter should never have been sent so close to an election, the expeditious review of these emails should put to rest — once and for all — the irresponsible speculation indulged in by the Trump campaign and others,” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. “Voters can now make their decision based on the merits, and that decision should be simple: It is the choice between a woman superbly qualified to be commander in chief and a man patently unfit for office.”

But House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said nothing changes the FBI’s original finding that Mrs. Clinton risked national security with her unique email practices.

“She simply believes she’s above the law and always plays by her own rules,” Mr. Ryan said in a statement. “Fortunately, the American people have the opportunity to ensure Secretary Clinton never gets her hands on classified information again. Let’s bring the Clinton era to an end by voting for Donald Trump on Tuesday.”

It was unclear how much the FBI’s reopening of the case affected the presidential contest.

Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, was gaining in polls before the announcement, and that trend continued. Still, Mrs. Clinton has maintained her lead in nearly every national poll in the past two months.

But Mrs. Clinton’s decision to use a secret email, effectively thwarting open-records laws and putting secret information at risk, has been damaging, creating a massive trust deficit, according to polls.

The messages, which the State Department is slowly releasing, will continue to trickle out even after the election and could extend even into a Clinton presidency.

The latest set, released Friday, contained two newly classified messages and showed that the former secretary emailed now-classified material to her daughter and to personal help who were not cleared to view such information.

Mrs. Clinton’s team says the documents weren’t marked classified at the time, though the FBI says that doesn’t mean the information wasn’t secret and shouldn’t have been protected.

Mrs. Clinton says she trusted her aides to decide what was classified, and when they sent her information without markings, she figured she could pass it along.

3559,3559,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/9/hillary-clinton-delivers-emotional-concession-spee/,Right,"An emotional Hillary Clinton emerged Wednesday morning after a crushing presidential election loss at the hands of Republican Donald Trump and a repudiation by the American people, acknowledging that she had been deeply stung but vowing to respect the result while encouraging Americans to keep an open mind about the incoming administration.

In a few agonizing hours Tuesday night, Mrs. Clinton went from becoming the nation’s first female president to a two-time presidential loser caught up in a federal investigation.

Her epic loss to Mr. Trump — a defeat that shook the nation’s political class to its core and erased liberals’ hope for a Democratic dynasty in the White House — shone a light on deep discontent among voters and on how spectacularly flawed a candidate Mrs. Clinton truly was.

Mrs. Clinton was gracious during her concession speech, but the pain on her face was evident as it became clear that her political career likely ended with a dramatic thud rather than the glass-ceiling-shattering win she anticipated.

“I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too. And so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort,” she said at the New Yorker hotel, with her husband and daughter by her side.

“We have seen our nation is more deeply divided than we thought, but I still believe in America and I always will,” she said. “And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power. And we don’t just respect that; we cherish it.”

Mrs. Clinton is staring at a future in which she is remembered as the Democrat who let Mr. Trump into the Oval Office and one in which her mishandling of classified information and serious questions about corruption within the Clinton Foundation remain in the public eye. The State Department still is under court order to continue releasing emails from her private server from her tenure as secretary of state, and watchdog groups say they will keep pushing for more disclosures even though Mrs. Clinton will be a private citizen, not the 45th president of the United States.

The FBI investigation into pay-for-play accusations involving Mrs. Clinton’s State Department and Clinton Foundation ensures that critics’ corruption accusations won’t just disappear now that the presidential race is over.

On the political front, there were many questions about the election loss: How did Democrats’ vaunted get-out-the-vote ground game fall so flat? How did a Democratic nominee lose ground with Hispanic and black voters against an opponent like Mr. Trump? And how was the Clinton political machine crushed so soundly by a political neophyte with minimal grass-roots organization across the country?

In the end, political analysts say, the explanation is simple: Mrs. Clinton was the wrong candidate at the wrong time, the consummate political elitist at a time when voters figuratively were looking to burn Washington to the ground. Making matters worse, there had been a steady groundswell of Republican enthusiasm at the gubernatorial and state legislature level across the country for the past eight years, creating political headwinds that a candidate such as Mrs. Clinton could not overcome.

“To not recognize the fact that this change election has been brewing is to miss the fact that the Republicans wiped the floor with the Democrats in 2010 and 2014, and to miss the fact that Republicans had been growing in strength across the states throughout Obama’s tenure,” said Lara Brown, an associate professor of political management at George Washington University. “Yes, it was about Hillary. … But her loss also wasn’t about her. There were forces culminating in this election.”

Compounding the tone-deaf nature of her candidacy, Mrs. Clinton also was dogged by deep questions about her honesty and trustworthiness, largely because of her private email server and admitted carelessness with classified information.

The FBI cleared Mrs. Clinton of criminal wrongdoing twice, including a public declaration of innocence just days before the election. Conventional wisdom said the FBI announcement would help Mrs. Clinton, but critics say it merely cemented the notion that she was a political elitist held to a different standard than other Americans.

“The corruption of Hillary Clinton was resoundingly rejected, and the frustration the American people felt was that she wasn’t being held accountable,” said Tom Fitton, president of the watchdog group Judicial Watch, which pushed for the release of thousands of Clinton emails through Freedom of Information Act requests.

“Mrs. Clinton exemplified corrupt government officials who were treated differently than a regular American would be if faced with similar accusations,” he said, adding that he believes the incoming Trump administration should appoint a special prosecutor to renew a federal investigation into Mrs. Clinton.

Outside of the political and legal questions, Mrs. Clinton’s electoral defeat was stinging on a personal level. Her attempts to crash through the glass ceiling of American politics have been twice thwarted, first by Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary and Tuesday by Mr. Trump.

She addressed that painful failure in her concession speech and told young women across the country not to be discouraged.

“To all the women, and especially the young women who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,” she said. “I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday someone will, and hopefully sooner than we may think right now.”

3561,3561,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/15/obama-arrives-in-greece-at-start-of-his-final-fore/,Right,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — President Barack Obama opened his final foreign trip as president Tuesday with reassuring words in Greece about the U.S. commitment to NATO even as he prepares to hand off to a Donald Trump administration, saying Democratic and Republican administrations alike recognize the importance of the alliance to the trans-Atlantic relationship.

Without mentioning Trump by name, Obama told Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos that a strong NATO is of “utmost importance” and would provide “significant continuity even as we see a transition in government in the United States.”

Pavlopoulos, for his part, thanked Obama for U.S. support of the Greek people in a time of social and economic crisis, and said he was confident that Trump “will continue on the same path.”

Trump’s election has generated significant unease in Europe because of his tough talk during the campaign suggesting the U.S. might pull out of the NATO alliance if other countries don’t pay more.

Obama’s reassurances reflect an attempt to ease the deep concerns about Trump and the future of America’s treaty alliances. Yet they may be greeted with skepticism: For months throughout the campaign, Obama repeatedly assured world leaders in public and private that Trump would not be elected, only to see him emerge victorious from last week’s election.

Obama also met Tuesday with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, and offered a welcome message of support for the Greeks as they struggle with both economic woes and a huge influx of refugees. Obama pledged to keep pressing his view that “austerity alone cannot deliver prosperity and that it is going to be important both with respect to debt relief and other accommodative strategies to help the Greek people in this period of adjustment.”

Obama and Tsipras were to hold a joint news conference later in the day, and Pavlopoulos was hosting an official dinner for Obama at the presidential mansion in the evening.

Obama is making the first visit to Greece by a sitting U.S. president since Bill Clinton in 1999. Security was tight, with major roads shut down along Obama’s motorcade route and a ban on public gatherings and demonstrations in swaths of central Athens and a southern suburb near a seaside luxury hotel where Obama was staying. Boats were also banned from sailing near the coastline at the hotel’s location.

More than 5,000 police were deployed in the capital’s streets for the two-day visit. Left-wing and anarchist groups have planned protest demonstrations for Tuesday afternoon, while an armed anarchist group has called for “attacks and clashes” to disrupt Obama’s visit. Clinton’s visit, which came during the height of U.S. intervention in the wars ensuing from the breakup of Yugoslavia, was marked with extensive violent demonstrations.

On Wednesday, Obama is scheduled to tour the Acropolis and give a major speech about democracy and globalization before flying on to Berlin. From Germany, Obama will travel to Peru for an Asian economic summit before returning to Washington on Saturday.

Obama said he was looking forward to visiting the Acropolis because “if you come to Greece you’ve got to do a little bit of sightseeing.”

Greece’s government has hailed Obama’s visit as being of “huge importance” for both Greece and Europe. The country’s left-led coalition government has been struggling to pull Greece out of six years of a vicious financial crisis that has devastated its economy and left more than a quarter of the workforce unemployed. Despite the U.S. election, the government has pinned its hopes on the U.S. president to help persuade some of the country’s more reluctant international creditors, such as Germany, to grant it significant debt relief.

Without a cut in its debt, Athens says, it cannot hope to recover economically — an argument also supported by the International Monetary Fund.

Greece has been relying on emergency loans from three consecutive multi-billion euro bailouts from other European Union countries using the euro currency, and the IMF, since 2010. While the United States has not been involved in Greece’s bailout, Athens has long seen it as an ally that could apply pressure on creditors.

The U.S. has praised Greek efforts to overhaul its economy but has repeatedly stressed the country must continue with painful reforms. The country’s bailout funds are disbursed following reviews by international debt inspectors of mandated reforms.

The government will also be looking for recognition of the country’s role in Europe’s refugee crisis, which saw hundreds of thousands of refugees pass through Greece from Turkey on their way to the more prosperous countries of the European north, and for U.S. pressure on the rest of Europe to help shoulder the burden. Following the closure of Balkan land borders and the reluctance of some European countries to host refugees, more than 60,000 people are stranded in Greece, most living in poor conditions in overcrowded camps dotted around the country.

Rights organizations have urged Obama to use his visit to highlight these people’s plight and Europe’s response to the crisis.

Obama should “shine the spotlight not only on abysmal conditions for the tens of thousands of refugees stranded in Greece, but also on the failure of world leaders to adequately address the wider global refugee crisis,” John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Europe director, said in a statement."
3573,3573,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/22/donald-trump-wont-pursue-clinton-email-or-foundati/,Right,"President-elect Donald Trump doesn’t want to pursue further investigations into Hillary Clinton once he takes office, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager confirmed Tuesday.

“I think when the president-elect who’s also the head of your party now … tells you before he’s even inaugurated he doesn’t wish to pursue these charges, it sends a very strong message, tone and content to the members,” Trump transition official Kellyanne Conway said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

“And I think Hillary Clinton still has to face the fact that a majority of Americans don’t find her to be honest or trustworthy, but if Donald Trump can help her heal, then perhaps that’s a good thing,” Ms. Conway said.

“Look, I think he’s thinking of many different things as he prepares to become the president of the United States, and things that sound like the campaign aren’t among them,” she said.

The MSNBC program, citing an unnamed source, had reported Tuesday that Mr. Trump will not pursue investigations into Mrs. Clinton’s email setup or the Clinton Foundation.

On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump had vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to look into Mrs. Clinton’s email setup if he got elected and suggested during one debate that the Democratic presidential nominee would be in jail if he were in charge of the law in the country.

FBI Director James B. Comey said Mrs. Clinton and her aides were careless with the private email setup, but Mr. Comey questioned whether the former secretary of state was sophisticated enough to know what she was doing and declined to recommend charges for mishandling classified information.

Some Democrats are blaming Mr. Comey’s late October announcement that the bureau was looking into relevant emails again, before reaffirming its decision over the summer not to recommend charges just prior to Election Day, for Mrs. Clinton’s stunning loss to Mr. Trump.

Alleged pay-for-play tactics between the Clinton Foundation and Mrs. Clinton’s team had also been a major part of the Trump campaign’s messaging.

The White House reacted to the decision by saying Mr. Comey had already settled the matter when he announced the Justice Department wouldn’t prosecute Mrs. Clinton.

“There was an investigation,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. “His conclusion … is that no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with the case.”

Mr. Earnest added, “The point is, we don’t need staffers in the next White House to resolve the question of whether or not the prosecution should move forward.”

“The meeting is taking place as planned,” Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a text message, according to a pool report.

Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the paper, confirmed that Mr. Trump’s staff told them the meeting was on again.

“He will meet with our publisher off-the-record and that session will be followed by an on-the-record meeting with our journalists and editorial columnists,” Ms. Murphy said, according to another pool report.

Mr. Trump had said on Twitter earlier Tuesday that he canceled the meeting when the terms and conditions were changed.

“I cancelled today’s meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice,” Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday.

The paper disputed this, saying it had always been pushing for an on-the-record session but that Mr. Trump’s team wanted it to be a private meeting.

Mr. Trump held an off-the-record meeting with television news executives and anchors in New York on Monday.

3589,3589,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/1/gen-james-mattis-as-trumps-secretary-of-defense-ma/,Right,"As he kicked off his post-election thank-you tour in Cincinnati, President-elect Donald Trump announced — sort of — that he was naming U.S. Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis as defense secretary. But he told the crowd and the TV cameras not to let it out of the room.

“We are going to appoint ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis as our secretary of defense, but we are not announcing it until Monday, so don’t tell anybody,” Mr. Trump said, referring to the general by his nickname.

“They say he is the closest thing to General George Patton that we have, and it is about time, it is about time,” he said.

The emergence of Gen. Mattis could create a “complex chemistry” between the Pentagon and the White House, analysts already were saying upon the first media reports of the Mattis choice Thursday afternoon.

For the general to assume the post, he would need Congress to waive a federal law that bars anyone who has been on active duty in the last seven years from becoming defense secretary. Gen. Mattis, 66, retired as commander of the U.S. Central Command in 2013 after a more than 40-year career in the Marine Corps.

Despite needing that waiver, the general, who was unceremoniously forced out of the Pentagon by the Obama administration over his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, was already finding strong support Thursday.

The emergence of retired Marine Corps Gen. Mattis as the leading candidate to head President-elect Donald Trump’s Defense Department could create a “complex chemistry” between the Pentagon and the White House, analysts say.

Gen. Mattis, who was unceremoniously forced out of the Pentagon by the Obama administration over his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, is now said to be Mr. Trump’s pick for defense secretary. The Washington Post and several media outlets reported the choice Thursday, citing unnamed sources inside the Trump transition team.

Mr. Trump’s transition team did not confirm the reports, and said Mr. Trump was still considering his options. “No decision has been made yet with regard to Secretary of Defense,” transition team spokesman Jason Miller said on Twitter Thursday afternoon.

Officials from both the House and Senate Armed Services committees declined to comment on the report, noting the Trump team has yet to confirm the former four-star general as the definite pick to lead the Pentagon. Although he will need a waiver because of his recent service in the military, the general is already finding strong support.

“The public will quickly recognize a person of deep character, strong intellect and administrative skills that go beyond the courage and leadership he has shown on the battlefield,” said Paul McHale, a former assistant defense secretary in the George W. Bush administration, and before that a three-term Democratic congressman.

Mr. McHale, who served with Gen. Mattis as platoon commanders in the Marines, said his military experience — both on and off the battlefield — will pay huge dividends as Defense Department chief.

“Jim knows the building cold,” Mr. McHale said. “Just as he has led quite successfully on the battlefield, his leadership in the Pentagon will be extraordinary.”

If confirmed, Gen. Mattis would be the first ex-military officer to head the Pentagon since President Harry Truman selected George Marshall for the post in 1950.

The blunt-spoken Gen. Mattis has long been considered Mr. Trump’s top candidate for the Pentagon job after the president-elect’s initial pick, retired Army Gen. Jack Keane, declined the nomination. The contenders list has also included former CIA Director and retired Army Gen. David Petraeus and Stephen Hadley, who served as national security adviser for Mr. Bush.

Gen. Mattis, nicknamed “Mad Dog,” could face a challenge in working with another general at the top of Mr. Trump’s national security team — retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who will be Mr. Trump’s national security adviser.

Gen. Flynn, who campaigned heavily for Mr. Trump, has gained a reputation for “being somewhat provocative and ‘disruptive’” during his time in uniform, Michael O’Hanlon, a senior national security analyst with the Brookings Institution in Washington, said.

Given Gen. Flynn’s reputation and Gen. Mattis’ penchant for bluntly speaking his mind on national security issues, “there could be some complex chemistry between him and Mattis,” Mr. O’Hanlon said. “I’m not sure that’s bad, but it’s possible.”

If nominated, Gen. Mattis would require a congressional waiver from federal law that bars retired military officials for seven years from taking civilian government posts. He retired from the Marine Corps in May 2013.

But given Gen. Mattis’ strong reputation on Capitol Hill, along with the fact that the GOP holds majorities in both the House and Senate, securing a waiver will not be difficult, Mr. O’Hanlon said. Fox News reported Thursday that lawmakers on Capitol Hill are already working up draft legislation specifically allowing Gen. Mattis to take the post.

Rep. Mac Thornberry, Texas Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, called Gen. Mattis “an excellent selection” and signaled that he’d help push the needed waiver.

“I will work with my colleagues in the coming days to clear the way for his confirmation by the Senate,” he said.

Sen. Dan Sullivan, Alaska Republican and a member of that chamber’s Armed Services Committee, called Gen. Mattis an “inspired choice” and, as a former Marine, ended his statement with “Semper Fi!”

He added that he also would “look forward to working with my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle in ensuring the swift confirmation of General Mattis, including any statutory waivers required by the Congress.”

3594,3594,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/30/nancy-pelosi-re-elected-leader-house-democrats/,Right,"House Democrats renewed Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s lease on power Wednesday, voting to keep her as party leader and insisting she bears no blame for her party’s staggering electoral losses over the past six years.

She faced her toughest challenge yet in her 14 years at the helm, ceding more than 60 votes to Rep. Tim Ryan, a 43-year-old Ohio Democrat who said the party had lost touch with middle America and needed a shake-up to begin connecting — and winning — again.

Mrs. Pelosi’s backers agreed that the party must do more to reconnect with voters in the “flyover” states but said Democrats’ problems are the fault of others. They said the 76-year-old has the political mettle and fundraising prowess to be what one lawmaker called their “comeback leader.”

“This is a time, I think, that we need someone who is battle-tested. And there is no stronger battle-tested person than Nancy Pelosi,” said Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland.

Mrs. Pelosi won on a 134-63 vote, held behind closed doors.

Democrats also kept the rest of their top leadership, electing Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, 77, of Maryland to the No. 2 job of whip, and Rep. James E. Clyburn, 76, of South Carolina to the No. 3 post of assistant leader.

That lineup hasn’t changed in a decade, as the party won a majority in the 2006 elections then watched it slip away in 2010 and failed to take it back in the three elections since, despite twice winning the presidential popular vote.

Emerging after her victory, Mrs. Pelosi told reporters that she had “a special spring in my step today” and said she could craft a winning message that reaches all parts of the country.

“We know how to win elections,” she said. “We’ve done it in the past. We will do it again.”

Her supporters blamed their party’s electoral misfortunes on factors such as gerrymandering of congressional districts, the WikiLeaks emails and Hillary Clinton’s message on the campaign trail.

“When Hillary Clinton came to my hometown of Toledo, Ohio, and stood at the busiest Amtrak terminal in Ohio, she did not speak about her infrastructure bill,” said Rep. Marcy Kaptur. “She talked about Warren Buffet. … Most people in my district don’t even know who he is.”

Ms. Kaptur said, “I was dumbfounded.”

Mr. Ryan did manage to force some changes. Mrs. Pelosi signaled that she would try to give more junior members a bigger say in decisions.

But his supporters questioned how Mrs. Pelosi could help the party become more competitive with blue-collar voters in the Rust Belt and Midwest that helped power Donald Trump to victory over Mrs. Clinton and helped give Republicans key wins that kept their majorities in the House and Senate.

“I don’t know how someone gets elected in the Midwest when they say, ‘Elect me; I am going to make Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the House,’” said Rep. Stephen F. Lynch of Massachusetts. “I don’t know how we win with that message.”

The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, said Democrats are tone-deaf.

“This year, voters went to the polls and made a bold statement for change in Washington, but House Democrats just doubled down on the status quo,” the RNC said in a statement. “The American people have been trying to send the Democrat Party a message by selecting historic numbers of Republicans for office at nearly every level of government but Nancy Pelosi’s re-election shows Democrats aren’t listening.”

Mrs. Pelosi has become one of the more polarizing figures in Washington since taking over in 2003 as leader of the House Democratic Caucus.

She became the first female speaker of the House in 2007 and watched over the party as its majority grew to 256 seats in 2009. But House Democrats have since suffered through a series of electoral stumbles and generated rumblings about Mrs. Pelosi’s leadership.

In 2010, Rep. Heath Shuler of North Carolina ran against Mrs. Pelosi and garnered 43 votes.

When the next Congress convenes in January, Republicans are poised to have at least 240 seats and Democrats will hold 194 seats. Control of one Louisiana seat will be decided in a Dec. 10 runoff.

Channeling the anxiety over the electoral setbacks, Mr. Ryan came closer than anyone else to stripping Mrs. Pelosi of her leadership title. He said after the vote that he was disappointed but proud of his showing and the impact the effort had on the party.

“You know, we made a few enemies, we cracked a few eggs along the way, but you know, [you] can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs,” he told reporters.

Mrs. Pelosi, in announcing her bid to keep her position, said she had the support of two-thirds of her Democratic colleagues — and she ended up with almost exactly that tally.

As the vote neared, Mrs. Pelosi rolled out a series of changes to caucus rules aimed at giving junior lawmakers more say. But more experienced members, particularly those in the Congressional Black Caucus, said the proposed changes were unfair because they punished seniority.

3599,3599,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/29/donald-trump-nominate-tom-price-health-and-human-s/,Right,"President-elect Donald Trump signaled his intent Tuesday to follow through on unraveling Obamacare, selecting an ardent foe of the law to be his health secretary and tapping a conservative policy guru from Indiana to oversee Medicare and Medicaid.

Conservatives cheered the picks of Rep. Tom Price to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, and of Seema Verma, president and CEO of a health consulting company, to serve as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, saying both nominees bring extensive expertise and a firm commitment to reform.

Mr. Trump also said he will nominate Elaine L. Chao, who ran the Labor Department under President George W. Bush, as his transportation secretary — a position that could be key to the president-elect’s plans for a massive infrastructure program that includes rebuilding roads and bridges throughout the country.

According to multiple reports, Mr. Trump also has chosen Steven Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary, a choice whose Wall Street ties Democrats quickly touted as a betrayal of Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to “drain the swamp” of special interests in Washington.

Although Democrats suggested an openness to Ms. Chao, who is the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, they said they’ll also rally against Mr. Price, a staunch pro-life advocate and architect of House Republicans’ budgets the last two years — blueprints that envisioned major changes to Medicare and called for fast-track procedures to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

Republicans plan to rely on those same fast-track tools to attempt a repeal in 2017, when they’ll have GOP allies in the administration.

“We could not ask for a better partner to work with Congress to fix our nation’s health care challenges,” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said.

Mr. Price offered his own legislative alternative to Obamacare for years, pushing for the repeal of heavy government mandates while maintaining some form of tax credits to help Americans to buy insurance, allowing insurers to sell their products across states lines and setting up high-risk pools in states — ideas that Mr. Ryan incorporated into his election-year outline for replacing Mr. Obama’s overhaul with a GOP president.

The incoming Republican president, Mr. Trump, said he’s counting on Mr. Price to manage the GOP’s tricky path ahead.

“He is exceptionally qualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare, and bring affordable and accessible health care to every American,” Mr. Trump said.

Democrats were spoiling for a fight.

“Nominating Congressman Price to be the HHS secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house,” said incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat.

Mr. Price succeeded Mr. Ryan as chairman of the Budget Committee in 2015, and adopted Mr. Ryan’s push to morph Medicare into a premium-support program. That idea is a political lightning rod that didn’t win over Mr. Trump on the campaign trail.

Mr. Price also has supported turning Medicaid coverage for the poor into a block grant to the states and stripping federal funding from Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider.

Democrats said as health secretary, Mr. Price would have control over funding and policies governing federal policies on abortion and contraceptives — areas where they said the pro-life congressman could undo Obama administration decisions.

Though a less prominent role than HHS secretary, Ms. Verma would have direct management over the Affordable Care Act’s twin pillars — web-based exchanges where consumers can shop for private coverage, often with the help of taxpayer-funded subsidies, and the state-by-state expansion of Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor.

Ms. Verma rose to prominence by setting up the Healthy Indiana Plan, the state’s conservative twist on Medicaid expansion that started under former Gov. Mitch Daniels and was modified under Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the state’s current governor.

“She’s an outstanding choice. She’s the godmother of conservative thinking on how to make Medicaid more efficient and more effective,” said Robert Laszewski, a health care policy consultant in Alexandria, Virginia.

Analysts said Ms. Verma could serve as a powerful bridge for red states, using her waiver authority to grant them wide latitude in how they implement Medicaid until the GOP decides whether to overhaul the program.

For instance, Republican governors who’d fought with the Obama administration over work requirements or charging premiums on certain enrollees will now find a sympathetic ear in Ms. Verma.

“Before and after any legislative changes, she has the ability to let individual states make the kind of reforms they might be interested in,” said Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president at Avalere, a D.C.-based health consultancy.

Managing the exchanges could pose a tougher test, analysts said, if insurers flee a politically doomed program before Republicans figure out how to cover the millions of people who gained taxpayer-subsidized coverage through HealthCare.gov and state-run websites.

Republicans had hoped to have a replacement to go along with the repeal of Obamacare, but House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday signaled their new strategy could involve a quick repeal, then a longer-term effort at replacement.

He said they would probably create a “transition” period to give stakeholders — including governors and state insurance commissioners — space to weigh in on what the replacement package would look like, though he didn’t provide a timeline.

Mr. McCarthy said the repeal can be done through fast-track procedures that only require a majority vote in the Senate, but any replacement plan would need 60 votes to overcome an expected Democratic filibuster. At best, Senate Republicans will hold 52 seats in the coming Congress.

Obamacare is already failing and cannot sustain itself, Mr. McCarthy argued, so Democrats will be under pressure to come to the table if the law is repealed and both sides have a deadline to move forward with something else.

“When that date came and you did nothing — if you want to play politics, I think blame would go to people who didn’t want to do anything,” he said.

Sen. Joe Manchin III, West Virginia Democrat, signaled Tuesday he’d be open to working with Republicans, but only if they show their cards from the start.

“I would like to see what they put forward,” he said. “I am amicable to anything, but [only] if it makes sense. I have always said this: If I can’t go home and explain it, I can’t vote for it.”

Rallying eight or so Democrats around a GOP replacement would be a tall order, analysts say, and could lead to a messy round of Capitol Hill finger-pointing if Republicans scrap the law and then nothing new is passed.

“It’s one thing to talk about repeal in the abstract, and it’s another thing to talk about repeal and replace, where you have a clear plan with winners and losers,” said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia who closely tracks the debate.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obamacare set a “pretty high bar” by knocking down the uninsured rate and ushering in consumer protections, such as forbidding insurers from rejecting the sick or charging women more than men.

He also said the HHS nominee will need to take direction from Mr. Trump rather than devising his own plan to replace Obamacare.

“With all due respect to Congressman Price, it will be his job to implement the president’s plan, not his own,” Mr. Earnest said. “We’ll see if ‘Trumpcare’ measures up.”

3602,3602,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/27/bernie-sanders-downplays-wisconsin-recount-nobody-/,Right,"Sen. Bernard Sanders on Sunday dismissed the presidential vote recount in Wisconsin, saying “nobody cares” about it and that it’s unlikely to affect the outcome of the election in any way.

Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” the Vermont independent and former presidential hopeful said the recount, while perfectly justified, simply is not a big deal.

“It’s taking place. The Green Party has the legal right to do it … No one expects there to be profound change, but there’s nothing wrong with going through the process,” Mr. Sanders said, going on to throw cold water on any notion that the result in Wisconsin could change.

“This is exactly the issue — nobody cares,” he said. “I don’t think Hillary Clinton, who got 2 million more votes than [President-elect Donald] Trump in the popular election, thinks it’s going to transform the election. But do people have the legal right to do it? Yeah, we do.”

Mr. Trump narrowly defeated Mrs. Clinton in the state, garnering 1404,000 votes to 1,381,823 for the former first lady, according to the Wisconsin Election Commission.

The recount has been spearheaded by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who raised millions of dollars for the effort in just a few days. Over the weekend, the Clinton campaign said it would join the effort despite having no evidence of voter fraud or miscalculation.

The Green Party also is pushing recounts in other battleground states.

Mr. Trump dismissed the effort.

“This recount is just a way for Jill Stein, who received less than 1 percent of the vote overall and wasn’t even on the ballot in many states, to fill her coffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculous recount,” the president-elect said in a statement.

3609,3609,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/6/donald-trump-rattles-us-businesses-with-twitter-th/,Right,"Donald Trump promised to make better deals as president, and wasted no time brokering what he said Tuesday would be a $50 billion investment in the U.S. by a Japanese telecom company, but his hard-bargaining style also is rattling some American businesses.

Boeing’s stock price took a nosedive after Mr. Trump posted a Twitter message Tuesday morning declaring that the Pentagon should cancel its $4 billion contract for a new Air Force One, just days after the president-elect stirred fears of trade wars by threatening — also on Twitter — to slap a 35 percent punitive tax on companies that move factories abroad.

Whether making threats against American companies or announcing the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in the U.S., Mr. Trump’s moves were entirely unpredictable — a quality that tends to unnerve financial markets.

Mr. Trump emerged from an elevator in the lobby of Trump Tower accompanied by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, surprising reporters there with an announcement that the Japanese telecom executive had committed to a $50 billion investment in U.S. startup companies that would create an estimated 50,000 jobs.

It was the second time before taking office that Mr. Trump scored on the jobs front. Last week he announced that he helped convince Carrier to reverse plans to close its Indiana factory and move to Mexico, saving 1,100 jobs.

“He is one of the great men of industry,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Son, with whom he met during a day otherwise occupied with interviews for Cabinet posts. “One of the truly great men.”

SEE ALSO: Most Americans say Donald Trump will put country ahead of family finances: Poll

“I just came to celebrate his new job,” Mr. Son said. “I said, ‘This is great, the U.S. will become great again.’ “

Earlier in the day, it was Boeing that got taken by surprise. Mr. Trump tweeted: “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!”

The price tag cited by Mr. Trump includes the lifetime cost of the whole program, including research and development and the actual building cost for the two aircraft needed for the Air Force One fleet. The Pentagon ordered the two specialized airplanes last year, and they are scheduled to be ready in 2023.

Shares of Boeing stock dropped by more than 1 percent in premarket trading after the tweet, but the price climbed back by the end of the day.

Mr. Trump’s sparring with U.S. companies comes as he stacks his Cabinet with business titans, including naming hedge fund billionaire Steve Mnuchin as treasury secretary, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as commerce secretary and retail billionaire Betsy DeVos as education secretary.

He interviewed Exxon CEO Rex W. Tillerson for secretary of state Tuesday.

The jab at Boeing, which Mr. Trump later accused of “doing a little bit of a number” on taxpayers, ruffled feathers at America’s biggest exporter and irked financial analysts.

“The chilling effect on industry is huge, if you are a contractor,” Franklin Turner, a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English, told Reuters news agency. “To think that in 140 characters the president can cancel a program is ridiculous. There would be a detailed review by legal professionals on the merits of the termination.”

Mr. Trump experienced similar backlash from Republicans on Capitol Hill when he tweeted about punishing U.S. companies with a 35 percent tariff on their products. They warned he would start a trade war and that U.S. businesses from automobile companies to farms would suffer.

Doug Oberhelman, chairman of the Business Roundtable, conceded that Mr. Trump’s tactics could be uncomfortable for those taking their turn “in the bull’s-eye,” such as Boeing or Carrier.

“If we combine that with policy of a very aggressive pro-job creation environment, I think we’re going to be happy with the end of that,” said Mr. Oberhelman, who is chairman of Caterpillar Inc.

Mr. Trump didn’t go into details about the Boeing deal but said the price tag was just too big.

“We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,” he told reporters during an earlier appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower.

Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller said that the details of budget-cutting decisions would be announced after Mr. Trump takes office Jan. 20. In the meantime, he said, the president-elect was signaling his intention to be a careful steward of taxpayer dollars.

“The message is clearly been sent that we are going to look to save taxpayers’ money,” he said. “People are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs, even in addition to this one. So we are going to look for areas where we can keep costs down and look for ways where we can save money.”

In a statement responding to Mr. Trump’s tweet, Boeing said its current contract is only worth $170 million, presumably not including sunk costs and later contracts should the program come to fruition.

“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” the statement said.

The presidential aircraft is more expensive than a 747 made for one of the airlines because of the advanced communications equipment, security measures and other special features that make Air Force One a flying Oval Office.

Aerospace industry expert Richard Aboulafia called Mr. Trump’s criticism of the cost “complete madness.”

“It’s actually what it costs to have two airplanes that can survive a nuclear war and transport the president in times of national emergency, and any other time for that matter,” he told Seattle’s Morning News. “Is Boeing getting rich on this deal? No, far from it.”

The life span of the aircraft is about 30 years. The current fleet is more than 20 years old.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest, flying aboard Air Force One, defended the contract to build a new plane and suggested Mr. Trump had incorrect information.

“Some on the statistics that have been cited, shall we say, don’t appear to reflect the nature of the financial agreement between Boeing and the Department of Defense,” Mr. Earnest told reporters.

He noted the “unique technical requirements” of Air Force One and said Americans “would expect that future U.S. presidents would benefit from unique and upgraded capabilities while they are traveling and representing the interests of the United States around the world.”

He said the current Air Force One is nearing the end of its projected life, and said the administration’s work would ensure that future presidents have a “modern presidential aircraft.”

3622,3622,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/27/donald-trump-alleges-serious-voter-fraud-virginia-/,Right,"President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to allege, without specific evidence, that there was massive voter fraud in the election he just won.

In one tweet, Mr. Trump also attacked the media and accused it of not reporting on “serious voter fraud” in three states won by Democrat Hillary Clinton.

“Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn’t the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!” he tweeted.

On Monday officials in Wisconsin will announce a recount in that state, which Mr. Trump won, at the request of the Green Party and candidate Jill Stein. Mr. Trump’s tweets seem to be pushback at the claims among some Democrats and progressives (also made without evidence) of a rigged election in key swing states.

Mr. Trump alleged an even bigger fraud earlier Sunday, saying (again without proof) that “millions” of illegal immigrants had voted for Mrs. Clinton.

“In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” Mr. Trump said.

And in a sign that liberals and progressives are getting under his skin, he rebutted their frequent (and irrelevant) claim that Mrs. Clinton won the popular vote, which would somehow undermine Mr. Trump’s legitimacy.

“It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4-states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!” he said over two tweets.

The pushback against Democrats using the stories in a bid to delegitimize the Trump presidency, however, spurred new criticism that he is at odds with the U.S. intelligence community and coincided with bipartisan calls for a congressional probe into the Russian hack scandal.

“I think it’s ridiculous. I think it’s just another excuse. I don’t believe it,” Mr. Trump said in an interview on the “Fox News Sunday” program. “Every week, it’s another excuse.”

He said the bottom line in the election was that he won by a “massive landslide victory” in the Electoral College, comfortably surpassing the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win, getting 306.

The president-elect questioned who was behind the news reports, which cited anonymous sources in claiming that the CIA confirmed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime hacked into Democratic email accounts with the express purpose of helping Mr. Trump.

“I’m not sure [the CIA] put it out. I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country,” said Mr. Trump. “I think they’re putting it out. It’s ridiculous.”

President Obama last week ordered intelligence agencies to do a review of Russian hacking during the election and report back before he leaves office Jan. 20.

Mr. Trump, who has made improving U.S. cybersecurity a priority for his administration, stressed that he supported Mr. Obama’s effort.

“I don’t want anyone hacking us. And I’m not only talking about countries. I’m talking about anyone, period,” he said. “But if you’re going to do that [investigation], I think you should not just say Russia, you should say other countries also, and maybe other individuals.”

During the campaign, Hillary Clinton’s team charged that Russia was trying to boost Mr. Trump by hacking email accounts and turning the emails over to WikiLeaks, including messages that showed the Democratic National Committee plotted to undermine primary rival Sen. Bernard Sanders.

Mr. Trump also was criticized for praising the Russian president’s leadership style and suggesting he could help the U.S. battle Islamist terrorism in the Middle East, prompting allegations that he would be Mr. Putin’s puppet in the Oval Office.

U.S. intelligence officials long have said Russia was likely behind the hacks, but the new reports purported to confirm that Mr. Putin ordered it to put Mr. Trump in the White House.

SEE ALSO: James Clapper: We ‘don’t have good insight’ into alleged Russian hacking

The Washington Post reported that the CIA identified people with connections to the Russian government who supplied the stolen emails to WikiLeaks. The New York Times reported that Russia also hacked the Republican National Committee but didn’t let the messages go public, a claim rejected by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff.

“The RNC was not hacked,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program. “Why would the press run with something that wasn’t true?”

He also defended Mr. Trump’s assessment as not a denigration of U.S. intelligence agencies.

“Of course he has confidence in America’s intelligence. But we don’t have confidence in The New York Times releasing a report of unnamed sources of some kind of study that itself and The Washington Post said was inconclusive,” he said, referring to disagreements among various intelligence agencies.

Questions persist about Mr. Putin’s motives or the scope of Russian involvement.

As recently as Nov. 17, James R. Clapper, the nation’s top intelligence officer, told Congress his agencies “don’t have good insight” into a direct link between WikiLeaks and the emails supposedly hacked by a Russian operation from Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign.

Still, the reports fueled concerns that Mr. Trump and some of his potential Cabinet picks, especially ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as a top candidate for secretary of state, were too cozy with Mr. Putin.

On Capitol Hill, a proposed investigation into the Russian hack attacks found bipartisan support.

“Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American,” four high-profile senators said in a joint statement.

“This cannot become a partisan issue,” it said in calling for a probe. “The stakes are too high for our country.”

The statement was issued by incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and three members of the Senate Armed Services Committee: Chairman John McCain, Arizona Republican; Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the panel’s ranking Democrat; and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican and a former presidential primary rival of Mr. Trump.

The statement was issued shortly before Mr. Trump’s interview aired.

Both Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham opposed Mr. Trump during the campaign. Mr. McCain withdrew his endorsement in October when an 11-year-old videotape surfaced in which Mr. Trump was caught on a hot mic using vulgar language about women.

Mr. McCain said Sunday that the investigation was necessary to determine Russia’s motives but that Russian involvement was not in question.

“It’s clear the Russians interfered. Whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were trying to elect a certain candidate, I think that’s a subject of investigation,” he said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “But facts are stubborn things. They did hack into this campaign.”

Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, agreed that a congressional probe would help determine Russia’s motive. But he said Mr. Trump’s comments indicate a lack of appreciation for the threat posed by Mr. Putin.

“Russia is not our friend. They are very much trying to undermine America. They are a bully. It is a corrupt regime. We need to stand strong,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“We have the best intelligence network in the world. It’s critically important that the Trump administration work with our intelligence community in the best interest of America,” he said. “We need to make sure that we work with the intelligence community [and] stop being naive. Russia is not our friend. We know that. Look at their actions. Look at what they’ve done in Ukraine.”

Mr. Putin, an elected autocrat, is conducting information warfare against European states, using hacking and propaganda to instill a lack of citizen confidence in the Western democracies while at home preaching the rise of Russia.

A month before the election, Mr. Clapper issued a statement saying the intelligence community was confident “that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.”

He said the disclosures by WikiLeaks and two other sites “are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.”

But he told the House committee Nov. 17 that his agencies “don’t have good insight” on whether Russia-directed people provided the actual emails to Wikileaks.

It is possible new information has arisen. The DNI headquarters did not immediately comment.

Mr. Putin’s motivation for trying to interfere in the U.S. election might be the praise he has heard from Mr. Trump, who called him a “strong” leader.”

“I don’t believe they interfered. That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say, ‘Oh, Russia interfered,’” Mr. Trump told Time magazine in an interview published Wednesday. “It could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.”

3649,3649,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/17/donald-trump-picks-debt-warrior-mick-mulvaney-head/,Right,"President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he’ll tap Rep. Mick Mulvaney to be his budget director, putting an ardent conservative in the job that has the most control over the size of the federal government.

Mr. Mulvaney, a South Carolina Republican, was elected to Congress as part of the 2010 tea party wave, and carved out a role as one of House conservatives’ fiercest fighters for cutting spending.

He voted against the 2011 debt deal and against most of the omnibus spending bills that have come to the floor during his six years in office.

“We are going to do great things for the American people with Mick Mulvaney leading the Office of Management and Budget,” Mr. Trump said in a statement.

The OMB is the nerve center for the federal government, serving as the White House’s chief oversight over the departments and agencies that dole out money and write regulations.

While not as high-profile as other administration jobs, the OMB director has extensive influence over nearly every midlevel and major decision.

Mr. Mulvaney takes cutting seriously, regularly coming in under the budget for his House office and returning unused money to the Treasury Department. He’s also sponsored a constitutional amendment to impose term limits, and has tried to end the abuse of war-funding bills to break budget caps.

“Mick Mulvaney is the absolute right choice,” said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. “In Congress, he has been a conservative reformer from day one, proposing solutions to fix the budget process and our regulatory system.”

3673,3673,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/3/trump-blasts-house-gop-weakening-ethics-office/,Right,"President-elect Donald Trump blasted House Republicans Tuesday for attempting to weaken their own independent ethics watchdog, saying they have a lot of bigger things to focus on.

“With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it ….. may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!” he said via Twitter.

He followed it with “DTS” — the acronym for “Drain the swamp,” which was his campaign-season promise to overturn the cozy back-scratching relationships that have fed Washington for decades. Analysts say an anti-Washington revolt helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.

His tweet was a response to GOP lawmakers who, in a secret vote Monday, decided to change the chamber’s rules and bring the independent Office of Congressional Ethics under the control of the House Ethics Committee, which is run by the lawmakers themselves.

Under the new rules, the independent ethics office cannot accept any anonymous tips, and the Ethics Committee will have final say on what investigations can proceed and what information is made public.

The change is expected to be voted on by the full House Tuesday.

SEE ALSO: Kellyanne Conway defends House ethics office move

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he wished his colleagues had waited to make the change, but defended it, saying the independent ethics office needed the guidance of members of Congress to work properly.

“These are just reforms to the Ethics Committee,” he said. “Every entity across America, government entity, has somebody to oversee it from an accountability process. We made that the Ethics Committee.”

The independent office “is still its same entity,” he told reporters. “It still has its same principles going forward.”

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who also opposed making the change now, said in a statement that he has instructed the Ethics Committee not to interfere with the independent office, and said the new oversight is designed to make sure the independent office is following its own rules.

“The office is not controlled by the committee, and I expect that oversight authority to be exercised solely to ensure the office is properly following its rules and laws, just as any government entity should,” he said.

But both conservative and liberal watchdog groups blasted the move, and Democrats said it was a poor start for the new Congress.

“Republicans claim they want to ‘drain the swamp,’ but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. “Evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress.”

The ethics office could be the first of a number of areas where Mr. Trump finds more common cause with Democrats than with his own party in Congress, raising the possibility of strange new coalitions emerging from Capitol Hill.

Mr. McCarthy said the GOP conference’s ability to ignore leadership’s concerns didn’t faze him, since Mr. Ryan promised an open process in which members propose changes, debate them and vote.

“I think that’s rather healthy,” he said.

He also insisted there wasn’t much daylight between himself and the president-elect, arguing both men focused on the timing, rather than the substance, of the reforms.

“Well, I read the tweet. Those are the same arguments I made last night in conference,” he said.

Mr. McCarthy said he didn’t get a heads up from Mr. Trump before the mogul spoke out, but he isn’t worried that Mr. Trump will mainly speak to leadership through social media.

He said he communicates with the president-elect “quite often.”

“I think he’s prepared to listen and understand how they got to the conclusions they did,” incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Friday on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

“The president-elect, I think, has a healthy skepticism of everything, and that’s important,” Mr. Spicer said.

Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper testified to Congress Thursday he’s confident Russia was behind the campaign season hacks of Democratic officials, but Mr. Trump has consistently been skeptical of Russian involvement.

President Obama was briefed on the matter Thursday, and Mr. Trump is scheduled to get a briefing on Friday. Parts of the classified intelligence report could be made public next week.

“Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!” tweeted Mr. Trump, who weathered unrelenting criticism during the campaign for heaping praise on Mr. Putin.

The tweet suggested that Mr. Trump, who made his deal-making skills a chief argument for his presidential run, will be open to negotiating with Russia over the status of the sanctions once he takes office Jan. 20.

Mr. Putin condemned the new round of sanctions President Obama imposed against Russia for allegedly using computer hacking to interfere with the U.S. presidential election. But the Russian president said he would not retaliate.

Mr. Obama hit Russia with sanctions that included expelling 35 Russian intelligence agents and closing two Russian compounds in the U.S. The parting shot at Russia was the latest rift between Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, who urged the administration to move on from the hacking allegations.

3693,3693,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/10/jeff-sessions-fight-racism-charges-senate-hearing-/,Right,"Sen. Jeff Sessions will fight back against the assault on his character Tuesday, defending his reputations against painful accusations that he is a racist, sexist and homophobe at a Senate hearing on his nomination to become attorney general.

The former federal prosecutor and Alabama attorney general will insist that his lifetime commitment to law and order includes the protection of the rights of every American.

“I deeply understand the history of civil rights and the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters. I have witnessed it,” Mr. Sessions plans to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to his prepared opening remarks.

“I understand the demands for justice and fairness made by the LGBT community. I understand the lifelong scars born by women who are victims of assault and abuse,” the Alabama Republican says in the statement.

Mr. Sessions is the first of President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees to face the scrutiny of a Senate confirmation hearing, and he is one of the most controversial nominees.

He is the chief target of liberal groups hoping to derail Mr. Trump’s agenda. Activists for civil rights, gay rights, illegal immigrants and marijuana legalization are pressuring Senate Democrats, some of whom have served alongside Mr. Sessions for 20 years in the Senate, to oppose him.

But Mr. Sessions will try to present himself to his colleagues and the American people as someone not only qualified for the job but also reverent of the responsibilities of serving as the country’s top law enforcement officer.

“I feel the weight of an honor greater than I have aspired to. If I am confirmed, I commit to you and to the American people to be worthy of that office and the special trust that comes with it,” he says. “While all humans must recognize the limits of their abilities — and I do — I am ready for this job. We will do it right.”

The chief complaint about Mr. Sessions has been over race, stemming from accusations that as U.S. attorney in Alabama in the 1980s he improperly prosecuted black voting rights activists and made racially insensitive comments. He is accused of joking one time that he thought the Ku Klux Klan was OK until he learned its members smoked marijuana.

In 1986, the same accusations derailed his nomination for the federal bench when he also was grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Mr. Sessions has vehemently denied making racially insensitive statements or holding racist views. He has pledged to uphold the law fairly and equitably. But his critics are far from satisfied.

“I come before you today as a colleague who has worked with you for years, and with some of you for 20 years. You know who I am. You know what I believe in. You know that I am a man of my word and can be trusted to do what I say I will do,” Mr. Sessions says in the opening statement.

“You know that I revere our Constitution and am committed to the rule of law. And you know that I believe in fairness, impartiality, and equal justice under the law,” he says.

Mr. Sessions will outline goals for battling gun crimes, illegal immigration, drub-trafficking cartels and other criminal gangs. He also will pledge to protect voting rights, support local law enforcement agencies and build mutual respect between police and minority communities.

“In my over 14 years in the Department of Justice, I tried cases of nearly every kind — drug trafficking, firearms, and other violent crimes, significant public corruption cases, financial wrongdoing, civil rights violations, environmental violations, and hate crimes,” he says. “Protecting the people of this country from crime, and especially from violent crime, is the high calling of the men and women of the Department of Justice. Today, I am afraid, that has become more important than ever.”

3698,3698,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/6/shots-fired-ft-lauderdale-airport-report/,Right,"An airline passenger arriving at the Fort Lauderdale airport retrieved a firearm from his checked luggage and opened fire at a baggage claim Friday afternoon, killing five people and injuring eight others.

The gunman was taken into custody and is being interrogated by law enforcement, but authorities said Friday it was too soon to say whether the shooting was terrorism-related.

While authorities have declined to release the names of either the victims killed or the gunman, Sen. Bill Nelson identified the gunman as Esteban Santiago and said the man was carrying a military ID card that authorities were still working to authenticate.

Relatives of the gunman confirmed his identity and told reporters that the 26-year-old had recently been treated for mental health issues.

An aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, told NorthJersey.com that Mr. Santiago had appeared happy after recently becoming a father but that about a month ago he began experiencing a mental health crisis.

“Like a month ago, it was like he lost his mind,” she said “He said he saw things.”

She said Mr. Santiago, who was born in Puerto Rico, had spent time in Iraq with the Army National Guard and was currently living in Anchorage, Alaska.

The suspected gunman’s brother, Bryan Santiago, told the Associated Press that his family had recently gotten a call from his brother’s girlfriend saying that he was getting psychological treatment in Alaska where the couple lived.

Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel declined to comment on whether the gunman had just arrived to the airport on a flight, but Broward County Commissioner Chip LaMarca wrote in a post to Facebook that the gunman was a passenger on a flight that landed at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and had checked his gun in his baggage. After landing at the Florida airport, the gunman retrieved his luggage, went into a bathroom to load his firearm and subsequently began shooting people in the baggage claim area, Mr. LaMarca said.

Sheriff Israel dispelled rumors that there was a second shooting at the airport, saying the baggage claim in Terminal 2 where the gunman opened fire was the only site of gunfire.

“At this point, it looks like he acted alone,” Sheriff Israel said, adding it was too early to speculate on the gunman’s motive for carrying out the shooting.

He said when deputies arrived on scene that the gunman was taken into custody “without incident” but declined to elaborate.

No flights were arriving or leaving the airport Friday afternoon and airport Director Mark Gale said it was unclear how long the airport the would remain closed.

Law enforcement officials said they first began receiving calls reporting gunfire in Terminal 2 of the airport at 12:55 p.m Friday.

News footage from the scene showed people evacuating from the airport and standing on the tarmac as first responders rushed to the scene. Throughout the afternoon, people could be seen streaming out of airport exits and at various points crouching behind emergency vehicles to take cover.

Former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer tweeted that he was at the airport when shots were fired and that “everyone is running.” He later wrote that the scene seemed calm and that “the police aren’t letting anyone out of the airport.”

Florida Gov. Rick Scott called the shooting “a senseless act of evil” and late Friday said some of those injured and hospitalized were fighting for their lives.

President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Friday, after emerging from an intelligence briefing on Russian hacking, that he was also monitoring the situation.

“Monitoring the terrible situation in Florida. Just spoke to Governor Scott. Thoughts and prayers for all. Stay safe!” Mr. Trump wrote.

The Federal Aviation Administration issued a statement indicating that as of 2:15 p.m., any flights inbound and within 50 miles of the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport would land at the airport but that other flights might be delayed or diverted.

Airport officials later provided an update saying the airport would be closed for an extended period of time and that no flights are currently taking off from or landing at Fort Lauderdale.

3709,3709,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/13/house-passes-budget-begin-obamacare-repeal/,Right,"The House passed a 2017 budget Friday that lays the groundwork for dismantling Obamacare, brushing aside intra-GOP anxiety and defiant Democrats to launch the repeal-and-replace strategy staked out by President-elect Donald Trump.

Nine Republicans balked at the politically thorny plan — the budget doesn’t balance, and the party hasn’t coalesced around a health bill of its own. But their defections weren’t nearly enough to tilt the 227-198 vote, which imposes a Jan. 27 deadline for crafting legislation that guts the Affordable Care Act.

“The ‘Unaffordable’ Care Act will soon be history!” Mr. Trump posted on Twitter before the vote.

The Senate approved the plan early Thursday on a 51-48 vote that brought in support from all but one Republican in the chamber, clearing the way for an eventual repeal vote that cannot be filibustered by Democrats.

The path forward is fraught with political risk for Republicans, who’ve railed against Obamacare for nearly seven years and promised 2016 voters they would deliver “relief” from soaring rates and dwindling choices under the program.

Party leaders are using a fast-track budget process to repeal and replace as much of the law as they can in the first several weeks of Mr. Trump’s administration. And they’re counting on the incoming president to issue administrative actions that smooth the transition away from Obamacare.

Yet Republicans are still mulling a legislative alternative, emboldening Democrats who say their political rivals are jumping off a cliff without a safety net for 20 million people who gained coverage under Obamacare, which expanded Medicaid coverage for the poor in 31 states and doles out taxpayer-funded subsidies to qualified persons seeking private plans on web-based exchanges.

The say repeal without a replacement will also ripple through the economy, particularly in the health sector, as patients show up for medical care with no way to pay for it.

If the GOP has its way, “the American people will be screwed,” said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, New York Democrat. “People in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio — screwed. Seniors in Florida — screwed. People on the West Coast and the East Coast — screwed. People in Appalachia and rural America — screwed.”

Mr. Obama and his party allies say Obamacare could be fixed by adding a government-run plan, or “public option,” to improve competition in the exchanges, or boosting the taxpayer-funded subsidies to entice more people to sign up.

GOP leaders have rejected both ideas as “more Obamacare.” Instead, their election-year blueprint calls for replacing Mr. Obama’s heavy federal mandates with a plan that doles age-based tax credits and unleashes market forces to entice people into health coverage, while setting up high-risk pools to take care of sick customers who’ve been priced out of the individual insurance market.

They said insurance rates and deductibles are spiraling out of control under Obamacare, even as the number of companies offering plans in many counties is dwindling. A third of counties have just a single active insurer, the GOP says.

“My colleagues, this experiment has failed. This law is collapsing as we speak. And we have to step in before things get even worse,” said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, urging his troops to support the budget that opens the door to repeal.

The speaker of the House rarely votes, but Mr. Ryan put himself on record Friday in favor of the budget, underscoring the magnitude of the effort.

Yet a mix of conservatives and GOP centrists voted “no,” citing concerns over spending or the way forward on health care: Reps. Justin Amash of Michigan, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, John Katko of New York, Raul Labrador of Idaho, Walter Jones of North Carolina, Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Tom McClintock of California.

While there are no hard deadlines for replacing the law, Republicans say there will be a smooth transition to a GOP overhaul that will be vetted by Capitol Hill committees and moved in pieces, rather than one large bill.

Mr. Trump has egged them on, pressuring the party to repeal and replace Obamacare “essentially simultaneously” within weeks of his swearing-in, though that timeline appears to be unrealistic.

GOP leaders hope to emerge from a post-inaugural retreat this month with more details, though Senate Republicans who hold 52 seats in the upper chamber will need to win support from at least eight Democrats to overcome a filibuster of any replacement.

As it stands, the parties are bitterly divided — no Democrats in either chamber voted for the budget that unlocks the door to repeal.

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, says Republicans are heading into a “boxed canyon” and should come to the negotiating table before it’s too late.

Democratic state leaders have also urged Republicans to pump the brakes on repeal.

“Before you vote to repeal the ACA, every American has the right to know exactly what, if anything, you intend to replace it with,” California Insurance Commissioner Mike Jones wrote Thursday to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. “A vote to repeal the ACA, without a specific replacement, would create crippling uncertainly, causing instability in the insurance market which could bring about the collapse of our health care system.”

3713,3713,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/8/lindsey-graham-us-senator-on-russian-hacking-donal/,Right,"Sen. Lindsey Graham implored President-elect Donald Trump Sunday to change his tune and punish Russians accused of interfering in the U.S. election, reasoning that the real estate mogul is hesitant to delve into what happened because it would undermine his legitimacy on the cusp of his inauguration.

Mr. Graham said there is no doubt that Russians were behind the hacks of Democratic emails revealed during the campaign, so Mr. Trump should make aggressive moves to ensure it doesn’t happen again.

“You can’t go on with your life as a democracy when a foreign entity is trying to compromise the election process. So Mr. President-elect, it is very important that you show leadership here,” the South Carolina Republican told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

The U.S. intelligence community concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to lose the election and clearly preferred Mr. Trump, according to its assessment report released Friday.

Russian intelligence had access to the Democratic National Committee’s network from July 2015 through at least June 2016, with its military intelligence service compromising Democratic Party officials’ email accounts between March and May of 2016, the U.S. agencies said.

Russian intelligence then had the information shared through WikiLeaks and other online leakers, the U.S. agencies said.

Mr. Trump, who has questioned the U.S.’ version of events, was briefed on the report Friday and afterward released a statement that seemed to spread blame around.

“While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,” he said.

Mr. Trump also said that, as president, he will form a task force to make recommendations about how to defend against cyberattacks, though he insisted the hacking did not affect the election results.

“Here’s the deal for me,” Mr. Graham said. “I think he’s worried that inquiring into what Russia did in the election is going to undermine his credibility and his legitimacy. Quite frankly, I haven’t heard any Democrat at all of prominence say that we doubt that Donald Trump won.”

“Putin’s not the reason that Clinton lost and Trump won. I don’t think anybody’s saying that,” he said. “So Mr. President-elect, that’s not what we’re trying to do. What we’re trying to do is find out what the Russians did in our elections and make sure that other people including the Russians won’t do it next time.”

Mr. Graham prodded the incoming president to target Mr. Putin more aggressively, saying that intelligence has revealed that Russia was behind the hacks — not some teenager or 300-pound guy at home, as Mr. Trump once suggested (though the mogul referred to a 400-pounder).

The senator and his congressional compadre — Arizona Sen. John McCain — said intelligence communities have been wrong before, namely in the run-up to the Iraq War, but that this intelligence appears to be solid.

Mr. McCain said the cyber threat extends beyond elections, so it is time to push back.

“It is across the board, including military secrets that we have, including the ability to shut down satellites, including the ability to shut down power plants,” he said. “I mean, they can do grave danger to the United States of America. We never tried to do anything like that.”

The Arizona Republican said he wishes that Mr. Trump could have visited Eastern Europe with them, to see the anxiety-filled fallout from Russia’s annexation of Crimea and incursions into eastern Ukraine.

“They have slaughtered Ukrainians. They have dismembered a country,” Mr. McCain said. “And I don’t think they are through. And they’ve done so in violation of all international norms of behavior. And they’re putting strains on the post-World War II new world order, the likes of which we’ve never seen.”

3716,3716,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/18/sonny-perdue-nominated-be-agriculture-secretary/,Right,"President-elect Donald Trump intends to nominate former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue to serve as agriculture secretary, according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to speak publicly before it is announced.

Mr. Perdue, 70, would be the first Southerner to lead the Agriculture Department in more than two decades. He comes from the small city of Bonaire in rural central Georgia, where he built businesses in grain trading and trucking.

The agriculture secretary job is the last Cabinet position for which Mr. Trump hasn’t named a candidate.

Mr. Perdue began his political career as a Democrat in the state Legislature in the 1990s. But it was after switching his allegiance to the Republican Party that Perdue made Georgia history.

In 2002, Mr Perdue was elected the state’s first Republican governor since the end of Reconstruction more than 130 years earlier. Mr. Perdue’s victory over an incumbent Democrat completed Georgia’s shift to a solidly Republican state, ending generations of Democratic control of state government.

Despite the seismic political change, Mr. Perdue showed little interest in pushing big programs or signature legislation during his two terms. Instead he focused on finding ways to save money while improving customer service by state agencies – such as reducing wait times for renewing driver’s licenses. He often referred to himself as Georgia’s CEO.

“If I could choose my legacy it would be the epithet that he made government work,” Mr. Perdue told The Associated Press in 2010 before he left office. “That’s really what I’ve focused on. It’s not some big monument.”

Critics accused Mr. Perdue of failing to tackle some of Georgia’s biggest problems, such as struggling public schools.

Mr. Perdue didn’t rely only on his business acumen as governor. A devout Southern Baptist, he also found a place for faith in his administration. In 2007, when a withering drought gripped Georgia and neighboring states, Mr. Perdue held a prayer rally in front of the state Capitol in Atlanta to pray publicly for rain.

It was also Mr. Perdue who brought an end to Georgia’s long-standing conflicts over a state flag that featured the Confederate battle emblem. The controversial flag was replaced by lawmakers under Mr. Perdue’s Democratic predecessor, but the new design proved unpopular. Mr. Perdue insisted Georgia voters should pick the flag. A referendum was held in 2004, though Southern heritage groups were outraged that the options did not include the old flag with the Confederate symbol.

Under Mr. Perdue’s watch, Georgia adopted tough new food-safety regulations after a deadly U.S. salmonella outbreak was traced to Georgia-made peanut butter. He moved the state office that issues water permits for irrigation and other agricultural uses from Atlanta to rural south Georgia, where it would be closer to farmers. And Mr. Perdue poured millions of state dollars into Go Fish, a program that aimed to lure bass fishing tournaments to the state.

The ex-governor, whose full name is George Ervin Perdue III, grew up in central Georgia. He attended the University of Georgia, where he played football as a walk-on and earned his doctorate in veterinary medicine. Following a stint in the Air Force, Mr. Perdue returned to Georgia and settled in Bonaire, a city of about 14,000 people.

Mr. Perdue already has family serving in Washington. His cousin, former Dollar General CEO David Perdue of Sea Island, Georgia, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2014."

John Lewis dominated political chatter in Washington over the weekend, highlighting questions of legitimacy and racism that Democrats hope will dog the next administration.

The fallout from Mr. Trump’s tweets blasting Mr. Lewis after the Georgia Democrat said he doesn’t see the Republican as a “legitimate president” was the lead story on every Sunday political talk show, with the Trump transition team defending the president-elect.

Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, called on President Obama to tell Democrats to stop trying to delegitimatize the election of Mr. Trump.

“President Obama could step up,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”

“The administration can do a lot of good by telling folks that are on their side of the aisle, ‘Look, we many have lost the election on the Democratic side, but it’s time to come together and stop questioning legitimacy,’” he said.

Mr. Lewis isn’t the first Democrat to challenge Mr. Trump’s legitimacy. But his blunt declaration in a TV interview just before Martin Luther King Jr. Day — and Mr. Trump’s forceful response on Twitter — created the perfect political storm.

Mr. Lewis said in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that aired Saturday that the inauguration this week will be the first he will miss since his election to Congress in 1986.

“I don’t see this president-elect as a legitimate president,” said Mr. Lewis, who led the “Bloody Sunday” march in Selma, Alabama. “I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected, and they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.”

Democratic leaders have increasingly questioned the legitimacy of Mr. Trump, citing evidence that Russian hackers attempted to interfere in the election and allegations that Mr. Trump was involved.

The allegation that Mr. Trump or his associates contacted the Russians during the campaign about email hacks aimed at hurting Mrs. Clinton were in a purported Russian spy dossier, which U.S. intelligence officials and news organizations have not authenticated.

Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. Lewis in a series of Twitter posts, saying the congressman should focus on problems in his Atlanta district. He tweeted: “All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!”

Mr. Trump later tweeted: “Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!”

Democrats, including prominent black lawmakers such as Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey, characterized Mr. Trump’s rebuttal as racist, a label critics have applied to Mr. Trump since he launched his presidential campaign.

“Cory Booker and John Lewis are right about is to talk about the racist past of Donald Trump,” Sen. Bernard Sanders, Vermont independent, said on the ABC show. “We all remember that Trump was one of the leaders of the so-called birther movement trying to delegitimize the presidency of our first African-American president, Barack Obama, which is an outrage.”

Mr. Trump later canceled a visit scheduled for Monday to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. He cited scheduling conflicts, but Democratic critics said it was because of blowback from his clash with Mr. Lewis.

Mr. Priebus said Mr. Lewis’ attack on Mr. Trump’s legitimacy was “insanity, and it’s wrong.”

White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said Mr. Obama has publicly vouched for the legitimacy of Mr. Trump’s election. He noted that he said as much in his final speech as president, referring to Mr. Trump as “the freely elected president of the United States.”

However, Mr. McDonough said allegations of Russian hacking and potential complicity by Mr. Trump “are by no means trivial concerns.”

Mr. McDonough also said it was Mr. Trump who should be extending an olive branch to Mr. Lewis.

“My hope would be that the president-elect will reach out to someone as consequential and who is such a leader as John Lewis — who has done so much in the course of his life — to try to work this out,” Mr. McDonough said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Sen. Joe Manchin III, West Virginia Democrat, defended Mr. Trump.

“I’ve got the utmost respect for congressman Lewis. He’s an icon, if you will, and we all have the most respect for him. I just think that was uncalled for,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

Mr. Manchin said the divisive rhetoric was playing into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s bid to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral process.

“If we’re concerned about the Russians and we know the Russians want to be involved, Putin wants to be involved in altering our process, then he will succeed if he sees this bickering going back and forth. That’s what we have to stop. We’re bigger than this,” he said.

Mr. Manchin has emerged as one of Mr. Trump’s primary allies among Senate Democrats. He also sits in one of the party’s most vulnerable Senate seats in 2018.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of Mr. Trump’s former Republican primary rivals, said Mr. Lewis’ legendary activism shouldn’t render him immune to criticism.

“I do appreciate him being a civil rights icon, but I would also say that that doesn’t make us immune from criticism or debate,” he said on “CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“None of us actually want to be considered to be racially insensitive, and so it’s a very, very important subject, but I think we shouldn’t ignore that people are partisan,” said Mr. Paul.

3731,3731,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/23/trump-pull-out-trans-pacific-partnership/,Right,"Putting into action his campaign’s tough talk on trade, President Trump signed an executive order Monday that formally withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade deal.

Mr. Trump could end the U.S. participation with 11 other Pacific Rim nations with the stroke of a pen because Congress had not ratified the ambitious accord despite strong support from business groups and President Obama. Nevertheless, the withdrawal put Capitol Hill and foreign governments on notice that the president would demand better deals on a one-on-one basis.

After signing the document, Mr. Trump declared that it was a “great thing for the American worker.”

The president’s populist stance on trade shook up alliances in Washington. Mr. Trump got a round of applause from union leaders during a meeting at the White House, but prominent Republican lawmakers vowed to defend their party’s traditional support for open markets and free trade.

“We’re going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country, and it’s going to be reversed,” Mr. Trump told the labor leaders, including some representing ironworkers and sheet metal workers. “Companies that left are going to come back to our country, and they’re going to hire a lot of people.”

His focus was on the economy and jobs for his first full day in the Oval Office. He began with a breakfast meeting with prominent business leaders, outlining a plan for massive reductions in taxes and federal regulations to spur economic growth.

Mr. Trump also took action on thorny social issues and the federal workforce.

He signed executive orders freezing nonmilitary federal hiring and reinstating the Mexico City Policy that effectively limits federal funding for abortions abroad.

The abortion rule has routinely been adopted by Republican administrations and canceled by Democratic administrations since President Reagan enacted it in 1984. By carrying on the tradition, Mr. Trump gave a nod to his evangelical and pro-life supporters in the run-up to the March for Life rally Friday in Washington.

It also added fuel to the fiery opposition from liberal and pro-choice groups, hoping to build on the momentum from large anti-Trump rallies led by women’s groups in Washington and other cities over the weekend.

In an email to supporters, the liberal Center for American Progress proclaimed that Mr. Trump was “already threatening women worldwide.”

The three executive orders signed Monday and the orders signed after the inauguration Friday, including one blocking Obamacare regulations and another delaying all pending Obama administration regulations, fell short of the more than dozen actions that, as a candidate, Mr. Trump promised to take on Day One.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the administration was pacing its executive actions.

“There’s a way that we can do this to make sure that we’re getting all of those things that he promised the American people done in short haste and doing it in a way that doesn’t just jam them out in a fire hose,” he said at his first press briefing.

Keeping a promise

Getting the U.S. out of the TPP, which Mr. Trump had described as a “bad deal” and a “death blow for American workers,” was a top campaign promise and part of the America-first agenda that he says will create jobs.

With many Democrats also having come to oppose the Asian trade agreement, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, dismissed the formal withdrawal from the deal as meaningless.

“TPP was dead long before President Trump took office. We await real action on trade,” Mr. Schumer said.

But Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, said trashing the TPP was “a serious mistake that will have lasting consequences for America’s economy and our strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region.”

“This decision will forfeit the opportunity to promote American exports, reduce trade barriers, open new markets, and protect American invention and innovation,” he said. “It will create an opening for China to rewrite the economic rules of the road at the expense of American workers. And it will send a troubling signal of American disengagement in the Asia-Pacific region at a time we can least afford it.”

But the move got applause from Sen. Bernard Sanders, the Vermont independent who emerged from his presidential run as a leader of the Democratic Party’s liberal wing.

“I am glad the Trans-Pacific Partnership is dead and gone,” he said. “If President Trump is serious about a new policy to help American workers, then I would be delighted to work with him.”

Mr. Trump is expected in coming days to sign an executive order to begin renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Mr. Trump has blamed NAFTA for the massive exodus of manufacturing jobs from the U.S. since it went into effect in 1994.

At the breakfast meting with business executives, Mr. Trump said he wanted American firms to “make our products here again.”

“We don’t want to bring them in. We want to make them here,” he said. “That doesn’t mean we don’t trade because we do trade. But we want to make our products here again.”

Seated around the conference table were the top executives from Dell Technologies, Ford Motor Co., Lockheed Martin Corp., Dow Chemical Co., Under Armour Inc., Whirlpool Corp., Johnson & Johnson, U.S. Steel Corp., SpaceX, International Paper and Corning Inc.

Mr. Trump said he planned to reduce corporate tax rates from the current 35 percent to as low as 15 percent. But he said rolling back federal regulations that impede business growth would have a bigger impact.

“The problem with the regulation we have right now is you cannot do anything,” he said, adding that he intends to reduce the federal regulatory burden by 75 percent.

Mr. Trump said he also plans to cut income taxes for middle-class families.

He stressed that fewer regulations didn’t mean increased dangers for consumers or the environment.

“I’m a very big person when it comes to the environment. I’ve won awards on the environment. But some of that stuff makes it impossible to get anything built,” he said.

3736,3736,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/25/donald-trump-calls-major-investigation-voter-fraud/,Right,"President Trump on Wednesday said he plans to ask for a “major investigation” into voter fraud, after the White House said Tuesday Mr. Trump believes that between 3 million and 5 million people could have voted illegally in the 2016 election.

“I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and … even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!” Mr. Trump tweeted.

In a meeting with congressional leaders at the White House earlier this week, Mr. Trump apparently repeated an earlier contention that he would have won the popular vote had millions not voted illegally.

“I think he’s stated his concerns of voter fraud … and people voting illegally during the campaign, and he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday.

Rep. Chris Collins, New York Republican, said Wednesday that he would support anything to make sure elections are more secure and that only U.S. citizens vote.

“He’s certainly entitled to his own opinion, and that’s what he’s expressing,” Mr. Collins said on CNN’s “New Day.”

Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said later on the program that an investigation during the George W. Bush administration turned up no voter fraud.

“He seems to be questioning the legitimacy of his own election, all while for the last couple of months touting how legitimate and huge his election was and how historic it is,” said Mrs. Wasserman Schultz, Florida Democrat. “It can’t be both.”

3742,3742,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/3/donald-trump-delay-major-new-rule-financial-advise/,Right,"President Trump signed a memorandum Friday to delay — and potentially cancel — a sweeping federal rule that would impose new responsibilities on financial advisers, a move guaranteed to provoke heated objections from consumer advocates and liberal lawmakers.

The memorandum targets the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule that, when it begins to phase in April 10, would elevate all financial professionals dealing with retirement plans to the level of fiduciary, with increased ethics and legal duties that could effect the retirement accounts they offered and their relationship with clients.

The Trump administration, siding with the financial services industry, said the rule will force advisers to limit the investment choices offered to clients.

“We think this was a complete miss on what they were trying to do. It has completely unintended consequences,” a senior White House official said. “It took away a huge amount of investment options.”

Supporters of the fiduciary rule argue that it protects consumers by requiring commission-based brokers and insurance agents to disclose conflicts of interest and forcing them to recommend the lowest cost 401(k) plans, individual retirement accounts or other retirement savings plans.

The rule would affect more than $3 trillion of retirement assets in the U.S.

Former President Barack Obama’s administration estimated it would protect consumers who lose an estimated $17 billion a year from retirement investments due to advisor conflicts of interest.

The Trump memorandum directs the labor secretary to delay implementation of the rule, review it and propose further action.

“They might determine that it is completely unnecessary,” the official said.

Mr. Trump also is expected to sign an executive order for a re-examination of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and its Volcker Rule that restricts banks from making certain speculative investments.

The order directs the treasury secretary to consult with regulatory agencies about possible changes to the laws and to report back to the president with recommendations, according to the White House

The White House official described the Dodd-Frank law as a “massive overreach” that imposed burdensome red tape on banks while failing to address the worst problems related to the 2007 financial crisis. Those unaddressed problems included too-big-to-fail banks, taxpayer bailouts and government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the official said.

It would take an act of Congress to repeal or significantly alter Dodd-Frank. The administration instead is looking for ways to loosen or tweak the regulatory requirements.

“This is not an attempt to undo Dodd-Frank,” the official said. “There are quite a few things we can do on Dodd-Frank and Volcker Rule that we think will have a significant impact.”

3744,3744,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/26/donald-trump-hits-back-mexico-best-if-meeting-canc/,Right,"President Trump said Thursday that it may be for the best if Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto cancels his planned visit here next week, unless he’s willing to pony up money for the border wall.

Mr. Trump’s Twitter post came a day after Mexican officials, angered over his new executive orders on immigration, said they were considering nixing next week’s trip.

“The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico. It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers of jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is unwilling to pay fo the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting,” Mr. Trump said in his new tweet.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump issued executive orders laying out early plans to build his proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Mr. Pena Nieto, in a video posted to Twitter, again repeated his vow never to foot the bill, and said he’s ordered Mexico’s extensive network of consulates in the U.S. to do what they can to shield Mexican migrants.

An official also told the Associated Press that Mr. Pena Nieto is considering canceling his visit in retaliation for Mr. Trump’s forceful new moves.

SEE ALSO: Enrique Pena Nieto, Mexico president, considers cancelling Trump visit

The Mexican leader is under intense political pressure to figure out how to handle Mr. Trump. An invite last year, during the presidential campaign, did not go so well, with the two men publicly disagreeing over whether they’d even broached the topic of paying for the wall.

Mr. Pena Nieto’s approval rating reportedly fell after that encounter, and he’s since been struggling to figure out a tactic to take with his country’s most important neighbor.

Mr. Trump’s executive orders Wednesday also instructed U.S. agents to begin making use of a part of the law that says illegal immigrants caught entering from the Mexican border can be shipped back to Mexico while they await their deportation hearings in the U.S.

That move could force Mexico to step up its own enforcement. Currently, for some migrants such as Haitians, Mexico issues 20-day transit passes — just enough time for the migrants to go from southern Mexico to the U.S. border.

Analysts expect that if those Haitians, once caught, were then shipped back to wait in Mexico for processing, the Mexican government may not be as willing to let them cross in the first place.

The Mexican government didn’t respond to a request for comment Wednesday on that new order by Mr. Trump.

3749,3749,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/7/elizabeth-warren-punished-attacks-jeff-sessions/,Right,"Fed up with what they said were out-of-bounds Democratic attacks on President Trump’s attorney general nominee, Republicans struck back Tuesday night, voting to silence Sen. Elizabeth Warren for inappropriate behavior on the floor of the Senate.

The 49-43 vote, which broke along party lines, meant Ms. Warren was not able to continue her floor speech attacking Sen. Jeff Sessions, one of her colleagues and Mr. Trump’s nominee to head the Justice Department.

It marked a new low in already frosty relations in Washington, where Democrats have mounted strenuous objections to Mr. Trump’s agenda. But going after Mr. Sessions, a longtime colleague who has worked with many of the Democrats in the chamber, was too much for the GOP.

Democrats were in the middle of a 30-hour debate, holding the floor to blast Mr. Sessions when Ms. Warren made the comment in question.

“The senator has impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama,” Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in demanding the vote to punish her.

He said Ms. Warren had violated the rules once, had been warned and given an explanation, and “nevertheless she persisted,” notching a second violation that forced him to act.

Democrats were furious, with Ms. Warren saying her offending comments were actually quoting the late wife of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. when she objected to Mr. Sessions’ nomination to a federal judgeship in the 1980s.

“I am surprised that the words of Coretta Scott King are not suitable for debate in the United States Senate,” she said.

In a letter at the time of Mr. Sessions’ earlier nomination, King had accused him of “a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters.”

“Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge,” she wrote in a letter that has been revived now that Mr. Sessions is up for a vote to be attorney general.

Mr. Sessions crossed a key threshold earlier Tuesday when the GOP, joined by a single Democrat, voted to break an attempted Democratic filibuster.

Mr. Sessions is a sitting senator, and under the chamber’s rules, no senator may question the conduct of another.

As Republicans demanded senators come to the chamber to vote on the punishment, Ms. Warren remained defiant.

“Why don’t you just let me finish?” she said.

3755,3755,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/8/jeff-sessions-confirmed-attorney-general-after-bit/,Right,"The Senate approved Jeff Sessions as attorney general Wednesday, installing one of President Trump’s biggest backers at the head of the Justice Department after one of the nastiest confirmation battles in a generation.

Only a single Democrat joined Republicans in the 52-47 vote to confirm Mr. Sessions — a startling snub of a man they spent decades working with but whom they now assailed with thinly veiled accusations of racism and xenophobia.

Mr. Sessions’ to-do list at the department is already lengthy, with the defense of the president’s extreme vetting executive action and a host of other lawsuits piling up against Mr. Trump’s sanctuary city and regulatory policies.

He also will spearhead an immigration crackdown and decide whether to continue to fight some of the legal battles that the Obama administration pursued, including over states’ voter ID and school bathroom policies for transgender students.

“I feel it in my bones, I hope and pray I can be worthy of the trust you gave me,” Mr. Sessions said as he read his resignation letter and delivered his farewell speech.

As a former U.S. attorney and state attorney general in Alabama, and with 20 years of service in the Senate, Mr. Sessions left little doubt about his legal qualifications for the Justice Department’s top job.

But Democrats said they feared Mr. Sessions’ close relationship with Mr. Trump. The attorney general, they said, must be prepared to be a check when the president oversteps legal boundaries. That was particularly true for this presidency, they said.

They worried that Mr. Sessions wouldn’t be strong enough in enforcing civil rights laws and that he would be too zealous in following immigration laws.

Mr. Trump’s decision last week to fire the acting attorney general, an Obama holdover, after she refused to defend his extreme vetting executive order in court, only heightened the debate.

“Many of us worry that Jeff Sessions will not be the independent check on this administration that we need,” said Sen. Thomas R. Carper, Delaware Democrat.

Mr. Sessions’ confirmation marked just the seventh Cabinet-level position approved by the Senate, nearly three weeks into Mr. Trump’s tenure. Presidents Obama and George W. Bush had seven nominees approved on their first day in office.

Republicans said it is the worst blockade any new president has faced since George Washington.

Democrats’ hostility continued Wednesday night, minutes after Mr. Sessions’ confirmation, when they attempted to filibuster Mr. Trump’s nominee for health and human services secretary, Rep. Tom Price. Republicans broke the filibuster on a 51-48 vote, and the Senate will likely hold a final confirmation vote Friday morning.

It’s possible that neither Mr. Sessions nor Mr. Price would have been able to win confirmation if Democrats hadn’t triggered the “nuclear option” in 2013, changing the rules to eviscerate the power of the filibuster to block Cabinet picks and federal judicial nominees other than the Supreme Court.

Mr. Sessions abstained from the vote Wednesday but was on the chamber floor the entire time. Only a single Democrat, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, came to speak to him.

Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia did offer a thumbs-up as he crossed paths with Mr. Sessions. Mr. Manchin was the only Democrat to vote for him.

“I have known Jeff for more than a decade, and he is not only my colleague but I consider him a friend,” Mr. Manchin said. “After working with him in many capacities during my time in the United States Senate, I believe I can work with Sen. Sessions.”

Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Manchin were the only two Democrats to stay in their seats to hear Mr. Sessions’ farewell speech.

Democrats’ chief objections dated back to the 1980s, when Mr. Sessions was a U.S. attorney in Alabama. Most controversial was his prosecution of three black voting rights activists who were gathering absentee ballots from black voters.

The activists said they were trying to help people vote, but the government said they were farming absentee ballots, gathering unmarked ballots from voters and filling them in.

That case was the focus of Mr. Sessions’ 1986 hearing when he was nominated for a federal judgeship — a job he was denied by a Senate vote.

Also part of that 1986 proceeding were accusations that Mr. Sessions made racially insensitive remarks — some of which the senator disputed and others that he said were poor jokes.

Denied the judgeship, Mr. Sessions would later run for the Senate, taking his seat in 1997 alongside some of the very senators who voted against him a decade earlier.

In the two decades since, Mr. Sessions worked with many of those lawmakers and earned a reputation for fierce conservatism but courtly manners.

That counted for little among Democrats, though, who said they had too many ideological differences with Mr. Sessions.

Sen. Cory A. Booker, a black Democrat from New Jersey, broke with tradition and demanded a chance to testify against his colleague in the Senate Judiciary Committee. The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and icon of the civil rights movement, also testified.

Mr. Lewis, who led the 1965 “Bloody Sunday” march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, said Mr. Sessions represented a return to the days of police beatings.

The attacks were too much for some Republicans.

“It’s been tough to watch all this good man has been put through in recent weeks,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “This is a well-qualified colleague with a deep reverence for the law. He believes strongly in the equal application of it to everyone.”

3764,3764,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/13/california-dam-nearly-200000-remain-under-evacuati/,Right,"OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) — Nearly 200,000 people remained under evacuation orders Monday as California authorities try to fix erosion of the emergency spillway at the nation’s tallest dam that could unleash uncontrolled flood waters if it fails.

About 150 miles northeast of San Francisco, Lake Oroville — one of California’s largest man-made lakes — had water levels so high that an emergency spillway was used Saturday for the first time in almost 50 years after its main spillway was damaged during recent heavy rain.

The evacuation was ordered Sunday afternoon after engineers spotted a hole on the concrete lip of the secondary spillway for the 770-foot-tall Oroville Dam and told authorities that it could fail within the hour.

“I’m just shocked,” said Greg Levias, who was evacuating with his wife, Kaysi.

“We have two boys and our dog,” said Kaysi Levias. “All the stuff we could fit in the trunk - clothes and blankets.”

What they couldn’t fit they piled as high as they could in their downstairs Yuba City apartment and joined the line of traffic attempting to leave the city where they had moved just three weeks ago.

Panicked and angry residents sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic hours after the evacuation order was given.

Raj Gill was managing a Shell station where panicky motorists got gas and snacks while they waited for gridlocked traffic to clear. His boss told him to close the station and flee himself, but he stayed open to feed a steady line of customers.

“You can’t even move,” he said. “I’m trying to get out of here too,” he said. “I’m worried about the flooding. I’ve seen the pictures - that’s a lot of water.”

State Fire and Rescue Chief Kim Zagaris said at least 250 law enforcement officers from throughout the state are in the area or on their way to help the people evacuating.

A California Highway patrol spokesman said they would have two planes out Monday to help with search and rescue and traffic control.

Late Sunday, officials noted water was no longer spilling over the eroded area but said the evacuation orders remained in place.

“There is still a lot of unknowns,” said Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea. “We need to continue to lower the lake levers and we need to give the Department of Water Resources time to fully evaluate the situation so we can make the decision to whether or not it is safe to repopulate the area.”

About 188,000 residents of owns in Yuba, Sutter and Butte counties remained under evacuation orders.

Acting Director Department of Water Resources Bill Croyle said officials will be able to assess the damage to the emergency spillway now that the lake levels have been lowered.

The erosion at the head of the emergency spillway threatens to undermine the concrete weir and allow large, uncontrolled releases of water from Lake Oroville. Those potential flows could overwhelm the Feather River and other downstream waterways, channels and levees and flood towns in three counties.

Oroville Lake levels had decreased by Sunday night as they let water flow from its heavily damaged main spillway.

Croyle said the department will continue releasing as much as 100,000 cubic feet per second from the main spillway to try and reduce the dam’s level by 50 feet ahead of upcoming storms forecast to reach the area Wednesday.

Department engineer and spokesman Kevin Dossey told the Sacramento Bee the emergency spillway was rated to handle 250,000 cubic feet per second, but it began to show weakness Sunday after flows peaked at 12,600 cubic feet per second.

Honea said there was a plan to plug the hole by using helicopters to drop rocks into the crevasse. But Croyle said at that no repair work was done after officials looked at the flow and available resources.

Gov. Jerry Brown late Sunday issued an emergency order to fortify authorities’ response to the emergency at the dam and help with evacuations.

Adjunct General David S. Baldwin said at a news conference late Sunday that the helicopters will also be available for search and rescue Monday.

The California National Guard put out a notification to all 23,000 soldiers and airmen to be ready to deploy if needed and will provide eight helicopters to assist with emergency spillway reconstruction, he said.

Baldwin says the last time an alert like Sunday’s was issued for the entire California National Guard was the 1992 riots.

Unexpected erosion chewed through the main spillway during heavy rain earlier this week, sending chunks of concrete flying and creating a 200-foot-long, 30-foot-deep hole that continues growing. Engineers don’t know what caused the cave-in, but Chris Orrock, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, said it appears the dam’s main spillway has stopped crumbling even though it’s being used for water releases.

Officials earlier Sunday stressed the dam itself was structurally sound.

The lake is a central piece of California’s government-run water delivery network, supplying water for agriculture in the Central Valley and residents and businesses in Southern California.

Rodriguez reported from San Francisco."
3767,3767,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/9/trump-travel-ban-muslim-nations-loses-federal-appe/,Right,"A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that President Trump’s extreme vetting executive order is likely illegal, upholding a temporary restraining order that has halted most of the president’s plan and delivering the first serious legal setback of the administration.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the administration bungled the writing of the Jan. 27 executive order by making it too broad and then botched the legal defense in court by failing to back up a number of its claims of expansive presidential powers in the area of national security.

In a unanimous ruling, the judges said that courts must serve as a check on the president, even when he is exercising his national security powers, and that the hassle his order would have caused to citizens, immigrants — both legal and illegal — and their relatives abroad was too much to stomach.

On the other hand, halting the extreme vetting policy while the courts sort out matters wouldn’t harm the government, the judges said.

“The government has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that failure to enter a stay would cause irreparable injury, and we therefore deny its emergency motion for a stay,” the 9th Circuit panel wrote.

Mr. Trump’s reaction to the ruling was almost immediate.

SEE ALSO: Refugees entering U.S. doubled in rate since ruling on Trump travel ban

“See you in court, the security of our nation is at stake!” he wrote in all capital letters on his Twitter account within a half-hour of the court’s ruling.

The Justice Department wouldn’t tip its legal strategy Thursday and declined to say what Mr. Trump’s tweet meant. A spokeswoman would say only that the department “is reviewing the decision and considering its options.”

The ruling maintains a temporary restraining order imposed by a lower-court judge last week, meaning Mr. Trump cannot carry out most of his policy.

The order halted for 90 days visitors from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Libya. It also paused the U.S. refugee program for 120 days. Both delays were intended to give the government a chance to improve vetting procedures, officials said.

Some 60,000 visas were canceled and more than 1,000 people were blocked from getting on planes to travel to the U.S. after the order went into effect.

A number of legal challenges were filed, and the Trump administration quickly issued guidance calling for the admittance of green card holders, signifying legal permanent residence, and Iraqis traveling on visas issued in exchange for their help to the U.S. war effort.

Even after those clarifications, the states of Washington and Minnesota filed a lawsuit in Seattle arguing that most of the policy was illegal.

In defending the order, the Trump administration argued that the courts shouldn’t second-guess the president’s national security decisions, particularly in the area of immigration.

But the 9th Circuit panel — which consisted of William Canby Jr., an appointee of President Carter; Richard Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush; and Michelle T. Friedland, an appointee of President Obama — shot down that claim.

“There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,” the judges wrote.

Trump attorneys also said nobody outside the U.S. has a right to a visa.

But Judge James L. Robart, who issued the temporary restraining order Friday, and the 9th Circuit disagreed.

The appeals court said illegal immigrants in the U.S. have some rights, as do relatives living inside the U.S., to facilitate the travel of their families living outside the country. The court also declined to narrow the scope of Judge Robart’s ruling so that it would not apply to those who have never been to the U.S.

“There might be persons covered by the [temporary restraining order] who do not have viable due process claims, but the Government’s proposed revision leaves out at least some who do,” the judges wrote.

The appellate judges said Mr. Trump botched the order on the whole by writing it so broadly and that it wasn’t their job to rewrite the order to make it legal.

An attempt by Mr. Trump’s attorneys to try to clarify his ruling by exempting green card holders was also rejected. The court said it “seems unlikely” that the White House counsel could legally amend or supersede an executive order signed by the president.

The appellate judges noted their own analysis of the case was preliminary and said they would save for later the debate over whether Mr. Trump’s policy amounts to the “Muslim ban” he promised during the campaign — which, if true, would be an unconstitutional infringement on religion, immigrant rights advocates said.

“In light of the sensitive interests involved, the pace of the current emergency proceedings, and our conclusion that the Government has not met its burden of showing likelihood of success on appeal on its arguments with respect to the due process claim, we reserve consideration of these claims until the merits of this appeal have been fully briefed,” the judges wrote.

The case has already been scheduled for a fuller hearing in March. But if the Trump administration appeals this ruling in the meantime, it could seek either an en banc hearing before the full 9th Circuit or take the case to the Supreme Court.

Even without a clear understanding of how the Trump administration would handle the case, observers were quick to react to the ruling.

Immigrant rights advocates cheered it, saying the court stood up for refugees and immigrants.

“The government’s erratic and chaotic attempts to enforce this unconstitutional ban have taken a tremendous toll on innocent individuals, our country’s values, and our standing in the world,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.

Conservatives, though, said the decision was misguided and potentially dangerous.

“No foreigner has a constitutional right to enter the United States and courts ought not second-guess sensitive national security decisions of the president,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican. “This misguided ruling is from the 9th Circuit, the most notoriously left-wing court in America and the most reversed court at the Supreme Court. I’m confident the administration’s position will ultimately prevail.”

The seven countries singled out in the policy were not chosen by Mr. Trump. They were based on a 2015 law enacted by Congress and a 2016 determination by the Obama administration that those countries didn’t have enough infrastructure or cooperation with the U.S. for American officials to trust that the people coming from there were who they said they were.

“I’m at a total loss to understand how we can vet people from various countries when in at least four of those countries we don’t even have an embassy,” Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly told Congress this week, defending the executive order.

Thursday’s ruling contrasts with a federal district judge in Boston, who upheld the Trump policy in a decision last week.

That judge ruled that Congress had clearly given the president the power to exclude aliens and said foreigners do not have a right to demand a visa.

“Thus, because an alien does not enjoy a property right in a visa, he has no due process right that protects the manner in which a visa is revoked,” Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton wrote in his opinion.

Mr. Trump this week urged other courts to look to at that ruling.

He also said he listened to oral arguments at the 9th Circuit and was dismayed, saying they strayed far from his focus on keeping the country safe from the threats he sees.

“I listened to lawyers on both sides last night, and they were talking about things that had just nothing to do with it,” he told a law enforcement gathering Wednesday.

Polling on the extreme vetting policy has been confusing. One poll taken by Morning Consult this week showed a clear majority — 54 percent — in favor of the temporary ban on visitors from the seven suspect countries, while a CBS News poll found a majority — 51 percent — to be opposed. A CNN poll put opposition at 53 percent.

3773,3773,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/10/michael-flynn-talked-sanctions-russia-trump-took-o/,Right,"National Security Adviser Michael Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador before President Trump took office, according to new reports that prompted the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee to call for Mr. Flynn’s immediate firing.

Mr. Flynn denied he had discussed the sanctions with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to The Washington Post on Wednesday before a spokesman said Thursday that while Mr. Flynn had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he “couldn’t be certain” that the topic never came up.

The Post said its report relied on “nine current and former officials” who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls.

Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One Friday that he hadn’t seen the report, but that he’d “look into that.”

Former President Barack Obama’s administration slapped new sanctions on Russian officials in December in response to alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

If Mr. Flynn did discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador, that would contradict what the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, has said about those talks.

SEE ALSO: Michael Flynn resigns as Donald Trump’s national security adviser

Before Mr. Trump was sworn in, current White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Mr. Flynn had contacted Mr. Kislyak on Dec. 25 to wish him a merry Christmas and then several days later to discuss logistics about setting up a phone call between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin once Mr. Trump took office.

The sanctions imposed by the Obama administration were announced on Dec. 29.

Mr. Pence told CBS News last month that the conversations did not deal with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia, saying he had talked to Mr. Flynn about the matter.

A Trump administration official “stressed that Pence made his comments based on his conversation with Flynn,” The Post report said.

Rep. Eliot Engel, ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Mr. Trump “must relieve General Flynn immediately.”

“Either General Flynn lied to the administration or the administration lied to the American people,” said Mr. Engel, New York Democrat. “In any case, the administration’s sloppy handling of such a serious issue creates a threat smack in the middle of our national security apparatus.”

Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member on the House intelligence committee, said the allegation that Mr. Flynn “secretly discussed” ways to “undermine” the sanctions while Mr. Obama was still in office “raises serous questions of legality and fitness for office.”

“If he did so, and then he and other administration officials misled the American people, his conduct would be all the more pernicious, and he should no longer serve in this administration or any other,” said Mr. Schiff, California Democrat.

Sen. Mike Rounds, South Dakota Republican, said it would be up to Mr. Trump to dole out any potential punishment and that he’s giving the current administration the benefit of the doubt at this point.

The National Security Adviser is not a position that requires Senate confirmation.

“I think the first thing we’ll do is get all the facts,” Mr. Rounds said on CNN Friday.

“And then if the facts lead us in the direction that say that we’ve been misled or that there’s been misinformation provided, he’s an employee of the president. We would expect the president to take appropriate actions,” he said.

“If there needs to be discussions within Congress, that’ll happen. But the president is in charge of his employees and I think — and I’m going to give him the benefit of the doubt on this — I think he’ll act appropriately at the appropriate time with full facts,” Mr. Rounds said.

John McCain “should not be talking about” what constitutes the success or failure of a military mission and that Mr. McCain “doesn’t know how to win anymore” after the Arizona Republican said it would be wrong to call a recent mission in Yemen a success.

“Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy!” the president tweeted Thursday.

“He’s been losing so…long he doesn’t know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in - bogged down in conflict all over the place,” Mr. Trump also tweeted.

“Our hero…Ryan died on a winning mission (according to General Mattis), not a ‘failure.’ Time for the U.S. to get smart and start winning again!” he tweeted.

The White House and Mr. McCain got into a back-and-forth over the recent mission on Wednesday.

“When you lose a $75 million airplane and, more importantly, [an] American life is lost … I don’t believe that you can call it a success,” Mr. McCain said.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer had said Wednesday that the mission was “absolutely” a success.

“I think anyone who would suggest it’s not a success does disservice to the life of Chief Ryan Owens,” Mr. Spicer said, referring to the Navy SEAL who was killed during the mission.

“I think anybody who undermines the success of that [raid] owes an apology … to Chief Owens,” he said.

Mr. McCain also said Wednesday that when he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, there had been an attempt at a rescue.

“Unfortunately, the prison had been evacuated. But the brave men who [went] on that mission and risked their lives in an effort to rescue us prisoners of war were genuine American heroes,” he said.

“Because the mission failed did not in any way diminish their bravery and courage and willingness to sacrifice for their fellow Americans who were being held captive,” he said. “Mr. Spicer should know that story.”

“This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton’s losing campaign,” Mr. Trump tweeted.

“Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia,” he also tweeted.

He said the “real scandal” is that the intelligence community is giving out classified information “like candy.”

“The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy. Very un-American!” the president tweeted.

He also said that the “fake news media” is “going crazy” with conspiracy theories and “blind hatred” and declared CNN and MSNBC “unwatchable.”

“The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!” Mr. Trump tweeted, referring to Fox News’ morning show.

The missives comes as multiple news outlets, including CNN and the New York Times, reported Tuesday that Russian officials were in touch with members of Mr. Trump’s team during the presidential campaign last year.

Advisers close to Mr. Trump were in “constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to US intelligence,” CNN reported.

Among those supposedly communicating with Russian nationals was former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the report said. Mr. Manafort denied that he ever knowingly talked to any intelligence official “or anyone in Russia regarding anything of what’s under investigation.”

“I have never had any connection to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin or the Russian government before, during or after the campaign,” he told CNN.

Mr. Trump and his team have consistently denied any contacts between the campaign and Russian officials ahead of November’s election.

The reports come on the heels of the resignation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The White House said Tuesday Mr. Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about the nature of his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. after the November election but before Mr. Trump was sworn into office.

3804,3804,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/24/trump-hails-conservative-support-cpac-slams-fake-m/,Right,"President Trump received a raucous reception at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference Friday, thanking the “power of the people” for electing him and slamming the “fake news” media for much of his address.

“Now you finally have a president, finally!” Mr. Trump told the cheering crowd at National Harbor. “It took you a long time. And it’s patriots like you that made it happen. The media didn’t think we would win.”

Mr. Trump, who skipped the event last year, said he and conservatives need to define the meaning of “this great, great unprecedented movement” that propelled him into office.

It means America “will put its own citizens first,” the president said to cheers, a standing ovation and chants of “USA.”

The president spent a good portion of his speech criticizing the media, a consistent theme early in his presidency.

“We are fighting the fake news. It’s fake, phony, fake,” Mr. Trump said. “They are the enemy of the people. They have no sources, they just make them up when there are none. They’re very dishonest people.”

He said journalists should be required to stop using anonymous sources.

“I’m against the people who make up stories and make up sources,” he said. “They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name. Let their name be put out there. ‘A source says Donald Trump is a horrible human being.’ Let them say it to my face.”

He said the First Amendment “gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly.”

“It doesn’t represent the people and it never will represent the people,” he said of what he considers fake news organizations, while calling some other media “honorable.”

The president’s appearance gave the annual conservatives’ conference its first Republican president in eight years, and the end of that political drought showed in the enthusiastic reception for Mr. Trump.

Many in the crowd wore “Make America Great Again” caps, and the audience gave the president several standing ovations.

Some people attending the speech could be seen waving small Russian flags emblazoned with the word “Trump.” The flags were apparently a prank; CPAC staff collected them.

Mr. Trump recited his efforts to keep his campaign pledges, saying he is working to repeal Obamacare, build the Keystone and Dakota Access oil pipelines, cut business regulations, build a wall along the Mexican border, cut taxes, bring back manufacturing jobs and crack down on illegal immigration.

“I’m here fighting for you and I will continue to fight for you,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s time for all Americans to get off of welfare and get back to work. You’re going to love it.”

He said he is preparing “a massive budget request for our beloved military.”

“Nobody’s going to mess with us, folks, nobody,” he said. “It will be one of the greatest military buildups in American history. Nobody will dare question our military might again. We believe in peace through strength, and that’s what we will have.”

Several times during his address, Mr. Trump referenced his populist political movement as an effort to reshape the Republican Party.

“The GOP will be from now on the party of the American worker,” he said. “We will not answer to donors or lobbyists or special interests.”

He pledged to work for “forgotten” Americans, and reminded the crowd that Democrat Hillary Clinton had referred to some of them as “deplorables” during the campaign.

“Hillary called them deplorable,” Mr. Trump said as chants of “lock her up” echoed in the room. “They’re not deplorable.”

Then the president added as an aside, “Who would have thought that a word was going to play so badly? That’s the problem with politics. One wrong word and it’s over.”

As he mentioned his to-do list, including cutting spending and rebuilding inner cities, Mr. Trump interjected, “And by the way, we will protect our Second Amendment.”

As the crowd came to its feet again, the president noted, “Wayne [LaPierre] and Chris [Cox] are here from the NRA. They [his speechwriters] didn’t have it [the Second Amendment] on the list. It’s lucky I thought about it.”

Mr. Trump was introduced by American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp and his wife, Mercedes. The president thanked the couple as “fantastic friends and supporters.”

“When Matt called and asked, I said, ‘Absolutely I’ll be there with you,’” Mr. Trump said. “I wouldn’t miss a chance to talk to my friends.”

Gesturing to the crowd, the president said, “These are my friends. I love you people. We’ll see you again next year and the year after that. I’ll be doing this for CPAC whenever I can.”

The moment seemed highly unlikely only one year ago, when Mr. Trump as a candidate skipped the CPAC event and was taunted by rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for being afraid of conservatives.

“I would have come last year, but I was worried I’d be, at the time, too controversial,” Mr. Trump said. “And people considered that controversial, but you didn’t consider that controversial.”

Now, Mr. Trump said, his movement is “the future of the Republican Party.”

3810,3810,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/6/president-trumps-wiretapping-claims-arent-crazy-he/,Right,"OPINION:

President Trump leveled an unproven allegation this weekend that former President Barack Obama tapped his phones at Trump Tower a month before the election.

News outlets are lamenting the lack of proof, with some pundits asserting Mr. Trump made up the entire affair as a way to vent his anger about Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ decision to recuse himself from any ongoing Russian investigations.

Most journalists are just dismissing the allegations as a lie.

There are many reasons to question Mr. Trump’s charges, but still, there are many reasons to take them seriously. Below is a list of why some Republicans are wary at the Democratic response so far, and why Mr. Trump may have a point.

1. Wiretapping was essential in retrieving the conversations of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador, which led to Gen. Flynn’s resignation as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser.

According to The New York Times: “Mr. Flynn, who served in the job for less than a month, said he had given ‘incomplete information’ regarding a telephone call he had with the [Russian] ambassador in late December about American sanctions against Russia, weeks before President Trump’s inauguration.”

How was it discovered that Mr. Flynn gave this “incomplete information?” Because either a transcript or actual recording of the call were overheard by FBI officials and leaked to reporters.

It’s unclear whether the FBI — which uses Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants to eavesdrop — had tapped the Russian Ambassador’s phone or Mr. Flynn’s. This is because …

2. On Oct. 15, 2016, the BBC reported that the U.S. secret intelligence court issued a warrant to investigate two Russian banks in conjunction with the Trump Organization.

The BBC report was corroborated by Heat Street, which reported the “FBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of ‘U.S. persons’ in Donald Trump’s campaign with ties to Russia.”

However, The New York Times and The Washington Post — along with other mainstream outlets — haven’t been able to confirm. But they’ve gotten close.

According to The New York Times: “In the fall, the FBI examined computer data showing an odd stream of activity between a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank, one of Russia’s biggest banks, whose owners have long-standing ties to Mr. [Vladimir] Putin. While some FBI officials initially believed that the computer activity indicated an encrypted channel between Moscow and New York, the bureau ultimately moved away from that view. The activity remains unexplained.”

There is no confirmed evidence — other than the BBC and Heat Street reports — that the FBI got a court warrant to get a wiretap on the Trump Organization or to target specific individuals within Mr. Trump’s campaign, like Mr. Flynn.

But no confirmed evidence, doesn’t mean it’s not out there, just waiting to be exposed by more mainstream outlets.

3. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has lied about U.S. surveillance and wiretapping under oath.

Mr. Clapper offered a full-throated denial of any wiretapping on Trump Tower on Sunday. However, he also denied, under oath and in front of Congress, the scope of the National Security Agency’s surveillance of the American people.

In an exchange with Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden in March 2013, Mr. Clapper was asked — in a yes-or-no question — “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions, or hundreds of millions of Americans?”

His response: “No, sir.”

Mr. Wyden pushed — “It does not?”

Mr. Clapper responded: “Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.”

In June, NSA leaker Edward Snowden’s dump of information revealed the government was in fact doing just that. Later, when asked what triggered Mr. Snowden into releasing the information, he responded it was Mr. Clapper’s 2013 testimony, where he “directly lie[d] under oath to Congress … seeing that really meant for me there was no going back.”

If he lied back then, why couldn’t he be lying today?

3. Mr. Obama issued a carefully worded non-denial.

Mr. Obama’s statement just said that neither he or the White House ordered the wiretapping — not that Mr. Trump’s organization wasn’t tapped.

Here’s Mr. Obama’s statement: “A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.”

David French, at the National Review, pointed out three ways that this non-denial was disingenuous. First, it’s technically the FISA court that orders such surveillance, along with the Justice Department (not Mr. Obama or the White House). The real question is whether Mr. Obama sought such authorization.

Secondly, Mr. Obama has ordered surveillance against American citizens. Mr. French argues, “The notion that Obama would never have an American subject to surveillance is absurd.” He cites drone strikes overseas.

Lastly, FISA national security investigations are different than criminal investigations, in that they’re covert and require a presidential sign-off.

As Mr. French notes: “One of the points in FISA proceedings’ being classified is that they remain secret – the idea is not to prejudice an American citizen with publication of the fact that he has been subjected to surveillance even though he is not alleged to have engaged in criminal wrongdoing.”

4. Mr. Obama expanded NSA’s powers in the days before leaving office.

Mr. Obama, in his final days, allowed the NSA to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government’s other 16 intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections, The New York Times reported.

“The new rules significantly relax longstanding limits on what the N.S.A. may do with the information gathered by its most powerful surveillance operations, which are largely unregulated by American wiretapping laws,” The Times reported. “These include collecting satellite transmissions, phone calls and emails that cross network switches abroad, and messages between people abroad that cross domestic network switches.”

Last week, The Times reported the Obama administration rushed to spread all evidence it collected about Russia’s meddling in the U.S. election and about possible contacts of people within Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russian officials, to ” to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators.”

5. Journalists readily believe the Trump-Kremlin international conspiracy to rig the U.S. election, but immediately put down the idea the Obama DOJ using FISA against Mr. Trump.

Unsubstantiated and anonymously sourced reports have continued to trickle in the news media about Mr. Trump’s team’s collusion with Russian officials, without any actual evidence. Mr. Clapper, of whom most journalists are using to vehemently deny any wiretapping on Trump Tower, also said the DNI found no collusion between Mr. Trump’s team and Russia.

The media, conveniently picking and choosing what they want to report or what leads they want to follow, reeks of media confirmation bias."
3820,3820,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/10/jobs-surge-wages-rise-donald-trumps-first-month/,Right,"The first monthly employment report under President Trump showed businesses adding 235,000 jobs in February, the unemployment rate falling slightly to 4.7 percent and Mr. Trump becoming a believer in what he once derided as a rigged statistic.

In further good news, the Labor Department said wages grew 2.8 percent from February 2016. And the labor participation rate, which shows the share of working-age people in the workforce, rose slightly to 63 percent, the highest since last March. The number of people out of the labor force dropped by 176,000, to 94.2 million.

A grinning White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he specifically asked the president Friday morning if he believed the jobs report.

“They may have been phony in the past, but it’s very real now,” Mr. Trump told his spokesman.

After the New Hampshire Republican primary last year, Mr. Trump said, “Don’t believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number’s probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.”

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, said the report is an early indication that employers are responding to the president’s push for cutting red tape and lowering taxes.

SEE ALSO: Donald Trump now a believer in government jobs report

“This is the beginning of turning the Trump rally into the Trump reality,” Mr. Gingrich said on “Fox & Friends.”

However, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the strong hiring numbers were results of policies of the previous administration. “Thanks, Obama!” Mr. Perez said.

Mr. Perez, who served as labor secretary under Mr. Obama, tweeted that “Trump has had about as much to do with job growth since January 20th as he does with the Washington Wizards’ winning record: absolutely nothing.”

“Trump inherited an economy from Barack Obama with the longest streak of private sector job growth in history,” he said in a statement. Indeed, employers added nearly the same number of jobs — 227,000 — in January as they did in February.

Mr. Perez said Mr. Trump’s policies “are taking us backwards by giving all the benefits to the richest Americans.”

The strong jobs report also reinforces the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen has suggested.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, Texas Republican, called it a “great report” and portrayed it as part of an economic drive that includes a Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Many conservatives aren’t supporting the legislation.

“Ways and Means Republicans voted to deliver relief from hundreds of billions of dollars in health care taxes that have crushed our workers and job creators,” Mr. Brady said. “And we’re not stopping there. We are committed to fully repealing and replacing Obamacare, delivering a tax code ‘built for growth’ and cutting Washington’s red tape to create even more economic opportunities in America.”

Construction jobs rose by 58,000, the most since March 2007, following an increase of 40,000 construction workers in January. Manufacturers added 28,000 jobs in February, a three-year high.

Federal payrolls increased by 2,000 in the first full month of the Trump administration, despite a hiring freeze for agencies not involved in national security.

Gen. Joseph Keith Kellogg Jr. to serve as acting adviser in his place, in the first major shakeup of the still-young administration.

Michael Flynn, the ousted adviser, admitted that he misled Vice President Mike Pence on the contents of phone calls Mr. Flynn placed to the Russian ambassador, in which they apparently discussed sanctions.

At the time, though he was working for the Trump transition team, Mr. Flynn was a private citizen, and such communications to hash out government policy are illegal.

“Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology,” Mr. Flynn said in a resignation letter released by the White House.

Top officials, apparently relying on Mr. Flynn’s account of the conversation, issued a public denial of reports that he had discussed the sanctions imposed on the Kremlin by the outgoing Obama administration over Moscow’s efforts to influence the U.S. election in Mr. Trump’s favor.

But Mr. Flynn later told White House officials the issue of sanctions may have come up. That revelation left the position of Mr. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, untenable.

Democrats said Mr. Flynn had to go, but said it doesn’t end the questions swirling around the Trump team over its promises to the regime in Moscow.

“These alleged contacts and any others the Trump campaign may have had with the Kremlin are the subject of the House Intelligence Committee’s ongoing investigation,” said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on that panel.

“Moreover, the Trump administration has yet to be forthcoming about who was aware of Flynn’s conversations with the ambassador and whether he was acting on the instructions of the President or any other officials, or with their knowledge,” he said.

The Justice Department had warned the White House weeks ago of the conversations and the discrepancy between the public statements and the reality of Mr. Flynn’s behavior, according to the Associated Press.

As the reports piled up, Democrats on Capitol Hill had demanded Mr. Flynn be suspended from his security clearance and fired for his actions.

Mr. Flynn, who was fired from his job as chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency by President Obama in 2014, had been a supporter of Mr. Trump’s during the campaign. He even spoke at the Republican National Convention last summer.

After Mr. Trump’s victory in November, Mr. Flynn was one of the first personnel announcements Mr. Trump made, tapping his booster to be national security adviser.

But over the last few days the White House had given conflicting signals about his job. One senior adviser said Monday afternoon that the president maintained “full confidence” in Mr. Flynn, while another said the president was trying to figure out what to do.

Mr. Flynn is the second person on Mr. Trump’s national security team to bow out already.

Last month Monica Crowley, a GOP foreign policy expert who had previously served as online opinion editor for The Washington Times and as commentator for Fox News,announced she would forgo a senior strategist’s position with Mr. Flynn after accusations by CNN and Politico that she plagiarized some of her work.

In his resignation letter Mr. Flynn said he held “numerous” calls with foreign ministers and ambassadors during the transition period after the election but before the inauguration. He said those kinds of communications “are standard practice.”

He also left with a parting thanks to Mr. Trump, saying the president in three weeks “has reoriented American foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore America’s leadership position in the world.”

According to CNN, retired Gen. David Petraeus will be “coming in” Tuesday to discuss the position. Retired Gen. Kellogg also is a candidate for the permanent post, CNN reported.

“I don’t believe the facts are correct,” Mr. Mulvaney said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

“I’m not just saying that because it looks bad for my political position. I’m saying that based upon a track record of the CBO being wrong before, and we believe the CBO is wrong now,” he said.

He said the CBO assumes, for example, that as soon as the individual mandate in Obamacare is gone, someone would go off of Medicaid.

“Look, the CBO — really good at counting numbers. Maybe not that good at making decisions about coverage,” Mr. Mulvaney said.

The CBO projected on Monday that the Republican health care plan would reduce the federal deficit by more than $300 billion over the course of a decade, but that it would also result in 24 million fewer people having health insurance, including 14 million fewer in 2018.

Mr. Trump, who frequently boasts about his negotiating skills, will head to the Capitol to lobby conservatives who say the plan doesn’t go far enough, and centrists who’ve demanded more help for older Americans whose premiums would rise under the GOP plan.

House Republicans late Monday said they would set aside at least $75 billion to help people who buy insurance on their own but aren’t quite old enough for Medicare, the popular program for seniors, as party leaders scrounge up the 216 GOP votes needed to pass the bill during a floor vote scheduled for Thursday.

Their amended bill doesn’t actually beef up the tax credits for Americans aged 50 to 64 — it simply leaves room for the Senate to do it — though it formalizes agreed-upon changes to Medicaid designed to reel in a vital bloc of conservatives.

“This is our long-awaited chance to finally get rid of Obamacare,” Mr. Trump said at a rally in Kentucky, home to a pair of vocal GOP opponents of the bill in Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Rand Paul.

Mr. Trump said he’s willing to work with Mr. Paul on necessary changes to get the health bill done and then move on tax reform.

The House Freedom Caucus, a group of 30-plus Republicans that frequently spars with leadership, remains the most visible impediment to the bill in the lower chamber. Its chairman, Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, said the group didn’t plan on taking an official position on the bill late Monday, leaving the door open to arm-twisting from Mr. Trump and GOP leadership, though members say the votes simply aren’t there.

“They haven’t changed the bill’s general framework. They don’t have the votes to pass it. They have seriously miscalculated,” Rep. Justin Amash, Michigan Republican, said on Twitter.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and his chief aides have a lot riding on Mr. Trump’s role as the ultimate “closer,” from fulfilling their seven-year pledge to kill Obamacare to maintaining enough momentum to overhaul the tax code before the summer recess.

“These next few days could define us for years to come. We ran for Congress to do big things and save our country from leftist progressivism,” House Majority Whip Steve Scalise said late Sunday in a letter to his whip team. “We ran for Congress to seize the opportunity and achieve the promise that the American people have bestowed upon us.”

Republicans can’t lose more than 21 GOP votes, because every Democrat is expected to reject the bill that repeals most of Obamacare’s taxes and its individual mandate, replaces the ACA’s generous subsidies with refundable, age-based tax credits and reins in and caps spending on Medicaid by 2020.

A “manager’s amendment” submitted late Monday would repeal many of Obamacare’s taxes sooner — this year instead of 2018 — while barring any more states from expanding their Medicaid populations and receiving generous federal matching funds outlined by the 2010 law.

The implementation of the so-called “Cadillac tax” on particularly generous employer plans is moved back from 2025 to 2026.

Democrats said they’ve invited their own cheerleader to the Capitol, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, to rally in defense of Obamacare Wednesday, saying the GOP bill would fully unwind its extension of coverage to more than 20 million Americans.

The House Rules Committee will meet early Wednesday to vet final changes to the GOP replacement and set the terms of debate for floor votes Thursday — the seventh anniversary of Obamacare’s passage. Republicans in the Senate are already mulling its own changes, however, so the House would likely have to revisit the plan down the road.

As written, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the plan would save more than $300 billion but result in an eye-popping 24 million fewer people being insured a decade from now.

Criticism of the plan continued to pour in Monday, as doctors’ groups and America’s Catholic bishops said there were laudable parts of the legislation but that it fell woefully short in maintaining coverage for needy Americans.

Republican leaders have pleaded with conservatives and outside lobbies to give them more time. They say the bill, which leverages budget rules to avoid a Democratic filibuster later on, is simply the first part of a three-pronged strategy to bring health costs down. Phase two involves regulatory action by the Trump administration, while phase three would require Democratic support for future GOP legislation.

Mr. Trump reeled in members of the Republican Study Committee by agreeing Friday to amendments that would make changes to Medicaid, the insurance program for the poor.

The changes would allow states to impose work requirements on able-bodied people in the program and let governors accept a block grant of federal funding for the program instead of a per-capita allotment.

3836,3836,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/10/donald-trump-now-believer-government-jobs-report/,Right,"President Trump, who as a candidate often criticized the government’s jobs’ reports during the Obama administration as “phony,” became a believer on Friday.

The Labor Department, now part of the Trump administration, reported Friday that employers added 235,000 jobs in Mr. Trump’s first full month in office, and the unemployment rate dropped slightly to 4.7 percent.

A grinning White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he specifically asked the president Friday morning if he believed the new jobs report.

“They may have been phony in the past, but it’s very real now,” Mr. Trump told his spokesman.

After the New Hampshire Republican primary last year, Mr. Trump said, “Don’t believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number’s probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.”

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the strong hiring numbers in February were due to the policies of the previous administration.

“Thanks, Obama!” he said.

Mr. Spicer said Mr. Trump’s actions clearly are having an impact with employers.

Asked at the daily press briefing whether Mr. Trump tweeted prematurely about the positive jobs report, Mr. Spicer retorted to a journalist, “Don’t make me make the podium move.”

It was a reference to “Saturday Night Live,” where Melissa McCarthy portrays Mr. Spicer in command of a mobile podium that he plows into the assembled reporters when annoyed.

Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and wife Ivanka have assets valued at more than $200 million. Mr. Kushner, who ran his family’s real-estate company, divested from dozens of holdings to avoid potential conflicts of interest when he joined the administration and resigned from more than 260 positions on various boards and other posts.

Ivanka Trump reported a stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, a share valued between $5 million and $25 million. The documents showed that she earned between $1 million and $5 million from her share of the hotel in 2016 and part of 2017. She announced last week she is taking an unpaid position as an adviser to her father.

Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council and a former top executive at Goldman Sachs, held assets valued at $252 million to $611 million when he joined the White House. He is one of the wealthiest White House employees.

Chief presidential strategist Stephen Bannon held assets of between $10.7 million and $48.6 million when he joined the administration, and earned at least $1.4 million in 2016.

Mr. Bannon formerly was the head of the Breitbart news organization, and also received income from Cambridge Analytica, a data company tied to conservative political donors Robert and Rebekah Mercer.

Mr. Bannon has “an agreement in principle” to sell his stake in Cambridge, according to his disclosure form.

Another top White House aide, Reed Cordish, had assets worth at least $197 million.

White House counsel Don McGahn II had income of $2.4 million last year as a partner at the Jones Day law firm.

The White House said the wealth of some of Mr. Trump’s aides demonstrates their personal sacrifice in coming to work for the administration.

“The president has brought a lot of people into this administration, into this White House, in particular, who have been very blessed and very successful by this country and have given up a lot to come into the government by setting aside a lot of assets,” said White House press secretary Sean Spicer.

Said another White House official, “These are incredibly successful people with very high net worths.”

The financial disclosures are being released for about 180 top White House staffers who earn more than $161,000 per year.

“I made a mistake. I got into a topic I shouldn’t have,” Mr. Spicer said at a Newseum event.

He added, “There’s no comparing atrocities.”

The White House spokesman also said that he felt his comments distracted from an “unbelievable couple of weeks” for President Trump and that he felt especially bad making such comments around the Jewish holiday of Passover.

“Of all weeks, this compounds this kind of mistake,” he said.

Mr. Spicer said he had not spoken to the president since making the comments, but declined to say whether anyone in the administration had given him a message from the president, saying, “I don’t get into private conversations.”

Mr. Spicer also downplayed reports of a growing feud between Steve Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, and other members of the Trump administration.

He said that he felt “palace intrigue [versus] policy is overblown.”

The White House press secretary said that reports of warring staffers is the result of differing opinions.

“There’s a lot of opinions,” he said. “Sometimes you see some of that spill over into the public and that’s unfortunate.”

Mr. Trump said in an interview with the New York Post this week that he likes Mr. Bannon, but also pointed out that he joined the campaign relatively late in the proceedings.

“Steve is a good guy, but I told them to straighten it out or I will,” the president said.

3925,3925,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/20/house-gop-compromise-health-care-reform-emerges-th/,Right,"Under pressure to deliver a win for President Trump, House Republicans are working on a new Obamacare repeal compromise that could bridge the divide between hard-line conservatives and centrists who tanked the first attempt.

The proposal by Rep. Thomas MacArthur, New Jersey Republican, would shift to the states the burden of deciding what services insurers must cover and would let insurers charge healthy customers less, so long as states set up risk pools to subsidize sicker people priced out of the market.

No state could waive the part of the Affordable Care Act requiring insurers to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions, however, preserving the most popular part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

“This amendment will make coverage of pre-existing conditions sacrosanct for all Americans and ensures essential health benefits remains the federal standard,” Mr. MacArthur, chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, said on his Facebook page Thursday after Politico published a one-page description of his plan.

It’s unclear whether the proposal can win over enough holdouts to pass. Republicans’ first go-around last month ended in a mess after leaders were unable to muster the votes and had to yank the bill.

A Republican aide said lawmakers don’t even have legislative text of the proposal so they don’t know whether it can bridge the gap.

Yet President Trump was bullish about their progress, saying House Republicans could revive their plan and hold a vote either next week or shortly thereafter.

“The plan gets better and better and better, and it’s gotten really good,” Mr. Trump said at a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.

House Republicans are under immense pressure from the White House to deliver an Obamacare repeal, a campaign vow that hasn’t been fulfilled as Mr. Trump nears 100 days on the job.

Failing a second time would be a gut punch for the party as it tries prove it can wield all the levers of political power successfully. After health care, Mr. Trump wants to tackle tax reform and a $1 trillion infrastructure plan.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, signaled on Wednesday that negotiators were putting the finishing touches on a plan to bridge rifts within the party over health care, although lawmakers also must focus on a stopgap spending bill to keep the government funded when it returns from its two-week break.

“I want to get both,” Mr. Trump said. “I think we’ll get both.”

Under the MacArthur plan, states could ask Health and Human Services Secretary Thomas Price to waive Obamacare’s “essential health benefits” package, which requires insurers to cover a slate of services such as mental health and maternity care.

They also could scrap community rating, in which insurers are required to charge the same prices to everyone in a given area. Insurers wouldn’t be allowed to discriminate based on gender or age, though older people still could be charged up to five times more than young people.

States could allow insurers to charge sicker consumers more than healthy ones, so long as they set up a “high risk pool” to absorb some of their costs.

That could win over hard-line House Freedom Caucus members, though it may scare off centrists who don’t want to tweak the guarantees of Obamacare.

While sicker customers could still get covered, they might face high premiums, health care analysts said.

The analysts said legislative details will be crucial, including who would be in the high-risk pool and how much they would have to pay to get covered.

“Maybe this is enough to convince the Freedom Caucus people that states can do what they want to do, but I don’t see this as being very popular,” said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia who closely tracks the debate. “It would make coverage unaffordable for many older consumers and would segregate high-cost consumers in coverage that would likely be inadequate unless the high-risk pools were very generously funded.”

Democrats accused Republicans of making a bad bill worse.

“To make the bill more palatable to right-wingers, the big change appears to be the abandonment of the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Yet another Trump promise shattered,” said Sen. Christopher Murphy, Connecticut Democrat. “The Republican health care repeal bill was an unworkable, unpopular piece of garbage a month ago, and it still is today.”

The published plan doesn’t provide much detail on the state waiver process, though it suggests waivers would be easy to obtain.

The HHS secretary is supposed to approve the plan within 90 days of determining it is complete, although states “must attest that the purpose of their requested waiver is to reduce premium costs, increase the number of persons with health care coverage or advance another benefit to the public interest in the state, including the guarantee of coverage for persons with pre-existing medical conditions.”

3951,3951,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/29/donald-trump-harrisburg-mark-his-100th-day-office/,Right,"President Trump’s quarrelsome relationship with the press intensified over the weekend, as he declared that the biggest lesson of his first 100 days in office was discovering the depth of the news media’s dishonesty.

For the majority of the press corps, the animus was mutual and openly on exhibit at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner Saturday, an annual Washington affair where the president traditionally presides as guest of honor, but which Mr. Trump boycotted this year.

“We are here to celebrate the press, not the presidency. And I am happy to report that this dinner is sold out,” White House Correspondents’ Association President Jeff Mason, a Reuters reporter, proclaimed from the ballroom dais at the Washington Hilton.

The room was packed with journalists. Absent were the Hollywood stars and Cabinet officials that usually lend grandeur to the event.

A common theme in the speeches was the nobility of exercising the press’ First Amendment rights to hold the president accountable and how that mission had become more urgent than ever.

In an interview aired Sunday, President Trump bemoaned that, despite accomplishments ranging from job growth in the U.S. to a renewed emphasis on American leadership abroad, he is the target of daily negative news stories that misrepresent what he has done.

“One of the things that I’ve learned is how dishonest the media is, really. I’ve done things that are, I think, very good. I’ve set great foundations with foreign leaders,” Mr. Trump said in an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

Mr. Trump has had a combative relationship with the press since he announced his presidential run. During the campaign, he regularly denounced the news media as the “most dishonest people you’ll ever meet.”

He cited as dishonest the media’s recent coverage of his effort to reopen the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. The president said he felt his administration’s effort to renegotiate the trade deal was misrepresented in much of the media as a retreat from campaign promises to withdraw from NAFTA.

Mr. Trump pledged last year that he would either renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw the U.S. from the 24-year-old trade deal.

The interview was taped Saturday night as Mr. Trump marked his 100th day in office with a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he chose to surround himself with thousands of supporters rather than the journalists at the dinner in Washington.

He was the first president to skip the dinner since 1981, when Ronald Reagan stayed home because he was recovering from being shot in an assassination attempt.

At the rally Mr. Trump spent more than 10 minutes of a 50-minute speech taunting the news media.

He proudly noted his absence from the “boring” White House Correspondents’ Association dinner.

“I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from the Washington swamp, spending my evening with all of you, and with a much, much larger crowd and much better people,” he said.

“Media outlets like CNN and MSNBC are fake news, and they’re sitting, and they’re wishing, they’re watching, they’re watching, and they would love to be with us tonight. But they’re trapped at the dinner, which will be very, very boring,” Mr. Trump said to cheers.

When Mr. Trump asked the audience to rate the media’s 100-day performance, the crowd erupted with boos.

“If the media’s job is to be honest and tell the truth, then I think we would all agree that the media deserves a very, very big, fat failing grade,” he said.

At the dinner, Mr. Mason defended the news media against Mr. Trump’s frequent attacks.

“It is our job to report on facts and to hold leaders accountable. That is who we are. We are not fake news. We are not failing news organization, and we are not the enemy of the American people,” he said.

About half of the crowd stood to applaud.

The entertainment headliner, Hasan Minhaj of “The Daily Show” on Comedy Central, delivered a series of jokes at Mr. Trump’s expense. The traditional roasting was more awkward due to the president’s absence.

“We’ve got to address the elephant that’s not in the room. The leader of our country is not here. And that’s because he lives in Moscow. It’s a very long flight,” he said. “As for the other guy, I think he’s in Pennsylvania because he can’t take a joke.”

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame delivered keynote speeches about the indispensable role of journalists.

“We’re reporters — not judges, not legislators. What government or citizens or judges do with the information we’ve developed is not part of our process, or our objective,” said Mr. Bernstein. “Our job is to put the best obtainable version of the truth out there, period. Especially now.”

Mr. Woodward directed a message to Mr. Trump: “Mr. President, the media is not fake news.”

He also had a warning for fellow journalists.

“We also need to face the reality that polling numbers show that most Americans disapprove of and distrust the media. This is no time for self-satisfaction or smugness,” said Mr. Woodward. “But as [the late Washington Post executive editor] Ben Bradlee said in 1997, 20 years ago, ‘the more aggressive our search for truth, the more some people are offended by the press.’ So be it.”

He continued to quote Mr. Bradlee: “I take great strength from that now, knowing that, in my experience, the truth does emerge. It takes forever sometimes, but it does emerge, and … any relaxation by the press will be extremely costly to democracy.”

3968,3968,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jul/5/dhs-expands-power-initiate-deportations/,Right,"The Trump administration has expanded the government’s deportation powers, issuing guidelines urging officers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — the legal immigration agency — to begin the removal process for people who use fraudulent documents or who illegally took government benefits.

USCIS officers have always had powers to begin deportation proceedings, but in the past had usually referred cases to other parts of Homeland Security for decisions on deportation.

Now, though, the agency is flexing those powers, with guidance memos telling officers to look for instances where they can begin the deportation process for people they deem illegal immigrants.

The memos, dated June 28, tell agency employees to be on the lookout for people who apply for naturalization or other legal immigration benefit but who have criminal records, used bogus documents, lied about their applications or had abused public benefit programs.

In the past those might have been enough to reject the application, but USCIS would either drop the issue at that point or refer the case to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for possible deportation. Under the new guidelines USCIS employees are now urged to begin the deportation process themselves.

That involves issuing a Notice to Appear, or NTA, which signals the beginning of the deportation process. Someone who receives an NTA then must go before an immigration judge, has the chance to appeal, and only then is deported.

“For too long, USCIS officers uncovering instances of fraudulent or criminal activity have been limited in their ability to help ensure U.S. immigration laws are faithfully executed,” USCIS Director L. Francis Cissna said in announcing the changes.

“This updated policy equips USCIS officers with clear guidance they need and deserve to support the enforcement priorities established by the president, keep our communities safe, and protect the integrity of our immigration system from those seeking to exploit it.”

The new guidance reclaims USCIS’s role as a gatekeeper and expands the number of government employees on the lookout for deportable migrants.

“When fraud, misrepresentation, or evidence of abuse of public benefit programs is part of the record and the alien is removable, USCIS will issue an NTA upon denial of the petition or application, or other appropriate negative eligibility determination,” the guidance says.

USCIS says the move is about efficiency. In the past, it had to wait on ICE to make decisions and ICE would have to track someone down to issue them an NTA. Now, USCIS will be able to do that immediately.

One effect could be to discourage people with bogus claims from coming forward to apply, since they now run a greater risk of ending up in deportation proceedings.

People applying under the Obama-era DACA program are exempted from the new guidance, meaning illegal immigrant “Dreamers” won’t generally have to worry about being put in deportation if their claim is rejected.

The prohibition on sharing their information with ICE is also still in place, according to a second memo released Thursday.

3995,3995,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jul/25/rod-rosenstein-impeachment-articles-introduced-gop/,Right,"Conservative House lawmakers introduced articles of impeachment against Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Wednesday, saying he’s led the Justice Department in “hiding” information from Congress on investigations into Russian election meddling and Hillary Clinton’s secret emails.

The Justice Department vigorously pushed back against claims of lack of transparency, saying it’s provided a historic amount of documents to Congress.

The impeachment resolution, aimed at the man who supervises special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, marks a major escalation in the months-long battle over the documents, which Republicans say are long-overdue.

“For nine months we’ve warned them consequences were coming, and for nine months we’ve heard the same excuses backed up by the same unacceptable conduct,” Rep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican and House Freedom Caucus chairman, said in a statement.

“Time is up and the consequences are here,” he said. “It’s time to find a new Deputy Attorney General who is serious about accountability and transparency.”

Mr. Meadows and his 10 co-sponsors accuse Mr. Rosenstein of “hiding information from Congress, withholding relevant documents, or even outright ignoring Congressional subpoenas.”

SEE ALSO: Steve Scalise pledges to vote for impeaching Rod Rosenstein

Justice Department officials had no immediate comment on the impeachment articles, but a leading congressional Democrat quickly denounced them as interference on behalf of President Trump.

“These articles of impeachment against Rod Rosenstein were filed in bad faith and show extraordinary lengths to which House Republicans will go to protect Trump,” Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, wrote on Twitter.

“History will record these Members as willing accomplices in the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation,” he concluded.

The impeachment articles won’t necessarily be voted on immediately, but the supports could use procedural moves on the House floor to force a vote late this week or when the House returns in September from its August recess, which starts Thursday.

Top Justice officials, along with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, met about two hours earlier Wednesday with key House Republicans to discuss the pace at which documents have been released.

The lawmakers at the closed-door meeting were Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Virginia Republican and Judiciary chairman; Rep. Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican and Oversight chairman; Mr. Meadows; and Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican and a Freedom Caucus leader.

After the meeting but before announcing the impeachment effort against Mr. Rosenstein, Mr. Meadows said he remained concerned about the lack of candor from the FBI and Justice.

“Still today, nine months into it, and we don’t know how many documents are out that are responsive to the subpoena, we don’t know how many have been delivered that are responsive out of that universe and how many remain to be delivered,” he said.

Mr. Meadows added that there are also grave concerns over the need to learn more about the time sequence behind when Justice and FBI began to verity the dossier’s authenticity.

Mr. Gowdy though told reporters after the meeting that he was pleased with the Justice Department’s efforts.

Before the meeting, Justice Department officials defended their handling of Congress’s requests related to Russia-Trump-Clinton matters, which cover more than 880,000 documents.

The documents underlying the FISA warrants, and other materials under investigation, are considered some of Washington’s most secret papers and require the personnel reviewing them to have security clearances, in addition to a secure facility to display the information.

DOJ officials said they had establish dedicated rooms at their Washington headquarters for specific lawmakers investigating the issues.

Regarding the FISA warrant documents, they added that roughly 30 lawmakers from the House and Senate have viewed the materials. Of those, 14 were from either the Senate Judiciary or Intelligence committees.

They also noted that Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and the intelligence committee chairman who subpoenaed the documents last year, has not seen the materials himself, instead relying on fellow intelligence committee members, Mr. Gowdy, or his committee staff, to review the documents on his behalf.

A committee source later dismissed that point as just another bid to discredit Mr. Nunes’ efforts at forcing transparency on the Justice Department.

The spotlight on Justice and FBI transparency brightened considerably last weekend when officials released more than 400 pages of a largely unredacted application the FBI used to obtain a secret foreign-surveillance warrant on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page during the 2016 presidential campaign.

That release came after mounting pressure from Mr. Nunes in addition to Freedom of Information Act lawsuits from the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch.

According to Mr. Nunes, the material shows that senior Justice officials under the Obama administration obtained warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for permission to spy on Mr. Page based on bogus intelligence from an anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, and the opposition research firm Fusion GPS.

In February, Mr. Nunes released a controversial memo on what he called FISA abuses. In it he argued that because the dossier, which contains unproven and salacious claims about Mr. Trump and his Kremlin ties, was in part funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign, it politically tainted the FISA warrant on Mr. Page and amounts to an abuse of power.

Mr. Trump has made that argument for more than a year, in addition to denying any collusion between his campaign and the Kremlin. The president has also lashed out at the dossier’s connections to the FBI and DOJ as evidence that an “American deep state” — consisting of establishment Washington figures and agencies — is engaged in a “witch hunt” to undermine his presidency.

Many Democrats, the Justice Department and FBI officials, however, have defended the surveillance practices and called Mr. Nunes’ memo misleading.

Mr. Meadows also raised concerns Wednesday about FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was leading the Russia investigation at the time of the FISA applications.

Mr. Strzok later became known for his dislike of Mr. Trump in text messages to his extramarital lover, texted her before the first application that “We’ll stop it,” referring to the Trump campaign.

Earlier this month, Mr. Strzok confirmed during congressional testimony that the bureau received documents from DOJ official Bruce Ohr during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Ohr’s wife worked at Fusion GPS, the firm connected to the anti-Trump dossier.

During the hearing, Mr. Jordan pressed Mr. Strzok on how the FBI obtained the dossier used to obtain the FISA warrant for Mr. Page.

Mr. Strzok said he would “love” to explain it but an FBI attorney had forbidden him from doing so.

On Wednesday, Mr. Meadows said that during their meeting, an FBI attorney indicated Mr. Strzok could have answered those questions.

“I think it will be very probable that Peter Strzok will be called back and complete some of the questions that, specifically Jim Jordan asked,” Mr. Meadows said. “They agreed that some 90 percent of those unanswered questions Jim Jordan asked should have been answered.”

The task force is an extension of President Trump’s October directive requiring government agencies to protect religious liberty even when it conflicts with government regulation. That same month, Justice formed its own guidelines, pushing for a broad interpretation of religious freedom protections, including supporting employers making hiring decisions based on their faith or objecting to providing health insurance for birth control.

Mr. Sessions offered few specifics on how the task force will operate or implement the October memorandum. He said it will facilitate coordination across government agencies to ensure religious liberties are protected; reach out to religious groups for feedback; and develop new polices and strategies to safeguard religious freedom.

The task force will also consider new lawsuits to pursue, but Mr. Sessions did not identify any potential new litigation.

Led by Mr. Sessions, the task force will be co-chaired by Associate Attorney General Jesse Panuccio and Beth Williams, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Policy. Members from other Justice Department divisions, including Civil Rights and the Office of Legal Counsel will participate.

Mr. Sessions said the task force was necessary because the U.S. has become “less hospitable” to religious people.

“A dangerous movement, undetected by many, but real, is not challenging and eroding a great tradition of religious freedom,” he said. “There can be no doubt it’s no little matter. It must be confronted intellectually and politically, and defeated.”

During his remarks, Mr. Sessions said “nuns were being forced to buy contraceptives,” a reference to an Obama administration policy requiring that women whose insurance was provided by religious organizations had to have access to free birth control. Religious organizations, including a group of Catholic nuns, had sued the government alleging it infringed upon their religious beliefs.

“Americans from a wide variety of backgrounds are concerned about what this changing cultural climate means for the future of religious liberty in our country,” Mr. Sessions said. “President Trump heard their concern. I believe this unease among the American people is one reason he was elected.”

Mr. Sessions also praised Jack Phillips, the Colorado baker who recently won a Supreme Court decision upholding his right not to make cake for a same-sex wedding. Mr. Phillips participated in a panel discussion on religious liberty after Mr. Sessions’ remarks.

Trump administration critics have long claimed the Justice Department is promoting religious freedom at the expense of gay rights.

Lucas Acosta, LGBTQ media director for the Democratic National Committee issued a statement calling the task force “just the latest assault in this administration’s continued campaign against LGBTQ people and our civil rights. This action is further proof that Republicans continue to push forward an agenda completely out of step with the American people and its values.”

Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said that “though freedom of religion is a core American value, religious exemptions from adhering to nondiscrimination protections are not.”

But Catholic and other church leaders praised the task force’s formation.

Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of Louisville, who spoke at Monday’s announcement, emphasized the need for a partnership between religious organizations and government agencies.

“You know, there are some who claim that faith-based organizations must give up our convictions when we partner with the government to provide much needed social services, but our country is much richer when we have public-private partnerships that work well,” he said.

The conservative Family Research Council also offered its support of the task force.

“The formation of this task force puts bureaucrats on notice: you will respect the freedom of every American not only to believe but to live according to those beliefs,” said Tony Perkins, FRC president, in a statement.

4011,4011,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/1/what-jim-acosta-and-cnn-dont-understand-about-angr/,Right,"OPINION:

CNN’s Jim Acosta posted a video to his Twitter account showing the vitriolic hostile greeting he received at President Trump’s rally in Tamp Tuesday evening.

Accompanying the video was Acosta’s personal concern that the anger he witnessed could result in “somebody getting hurt.”

Just a sample of the sad scene we faced at the Trump rally in Tampa. I’m very worried that the hostility whipped up by Trump and some in conservative media will result in somebody getting hurt. We should not treat our fellow Americans this way. The press is not the enemy. pic.twitter.com/IhSRw5Ui3R — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) August 1, 2018

“Just a sample of the sad scene we faced at the Trump rally in Tampa,” The Tweet read. “I’m very worried that the hostility whipped up by Trump and some in conservative media will result in somebody getting hurt. We should not treat our fellow Americans this way. The press is not the enemy. “

What Mr. Acosta doesn’t understand is that the anger and hostility and loathing he sees on the faces of Trump supporters in his video is a reflection of the same hostility they see on the faces of anchors, reporters, and analysts on his network.

Night after night for years… decades, CNN has talked down to, belittled and ignored a wide swath of American voters. The condescending contempt reached a boiling point in the 2016 election when voters defied their betters and voted for the man CNN proclaimed to be unworthy of the American presidency.

On a nightly basis throughout the election, the network pummeled the small handful of pro-Trump pundits they featured.

Show after show featured Jeffrey Lord, Kayleigh McInerney, or Scottie Nell Hughes on a political panel usually facing off against upwards to seven debaters. The panel would be comprised of pro-Hillary Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans shouting-down the lone pro-Trump pundit.

With grace and patience Lord, Mcinerney, and Hughes gritted their teeth and endured personal insults, patronizing ridicule, and vile epithets. All the while, viewers saw these pundits as vessels representing their interests and their views.

It was not a fair fight and CNN, represented by their hosts and anchors, seemed to love it.

When voters finally had their voices heard at the ballot box, what was CNN’s response? Were they chagrined and humbled? Did they concede that maybe they got it wrong and maybe there was some disconnect between their worldview and that of the viewers they were trying to reach?

Hardly. CNN has redoubled their efforts in attacking Trump, his surrogates and, by extension, the voters who support him.

When Jim Acosta looks out at the anger in the crowd at a Trump rally, he sees the faces of frustration and exasperation in his audience that has left his network. He sees the forgotten viewers who he never has the benefit of connecting with when he looks into the robotic lens of a television camera equipped with a prompter feeding him his lines.

The anger has not been “whipped up by Trump” it has festered and grown over decades and was finally whipped up by Anderson and Wolf and Jake and Jim, himself. The team at CNN always gets the last word (not to mention the first word) and they always get to set the agenda.

The people staring back at Acosta with contempt have no voice on their network. Their voices are not just silenced, they are propped up as strawmen and summarily burned to a char by the same people who insulted them and ignored them all through the election.

The one opportunity they get to be seen and heard on CNN is when they shout at Acosta and his colleagues perched on an elevated platform at a Trump rally. Like groundlings yelling at the upper-class in a raucous production at the Globe theatre, Trump supporters finally have their chance to let the media finally hear their frustration with their product.

And, true to form, rather than employing a little introspection, Acosta lashes out. Rather than saying to himself “why do they loathe me so much?” Acosta warns that “somebody” will soon get hurt and, oh, by the way, it will be all Trump’s fault.

Well Jim, “somebody’s” already been hurt in violent political attacks in America. His name is Rep. Steve Scalise. He’s a Republican politician. He and his GOP colleagues were gunned down last year while practicing for a baseball game. They were stalked and hunted down by a leftist nut who targeted them because they were Republicans.

In retrospect, one could argue this maniac’s violent hatred was “whipped up” by media outlets comparing Republicans to Nazis. But that would be morally problematic.

To make that argument in advance of an anticipated act of violence is reprehensible and disgusting. Acosta is saying that not only are these stupid rubes gullible enough to vote for and support Trump, they’re also one speech away from violently attacking an innocent journalist at the president’s command.

At some point, CNN needs to examine how they approach each day’s news cycle and how they communicate with the American people. They should start by addressing their on-air talent and how they project themselves to their audience and their former audience.

I suggest they begin this process alphabetically."
4016,4016,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jul/31/paul-manafort-trial-set-start-tuesday-he-facing-18/,Right,"The first trial to emerge from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe is set to start Tuesday when former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort appears before a federal judge in Alexandria, Virginia.

Mr. Manafort is facing 18 criminal counts, including bank and tax fraud, which could net him 30 years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

The charges stem from Mr. Manafort’s lobbying in the Ukraine on behalf of politicians with ties to Russia. Prosecutors have alleged he was paid more than $60 million for his work, which includes support of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yankovich.

Government attorneys say Mr. Manafort engaged in a scheme to hide his income from the IRS and other authorities in the United States. Instead of paying taxes on the income, they say he used it to support a lavish lifestyle that included three homes, a $21,000 watch, a $105,000 car and New York Yankees season tickets.

Roughly 500 pieces of evidence and up to 35 witnesses are expected to be presented by prosecutors. One of those witnesses is Mr. Manafort’s former business associate Rick Gates. He was charged along with Mr. Manafort, but pleaded guilty and has cooperated with Mr. Mueller’s team.

Mr. Manafort’s work as a Ukrainian political operative occurred nearly a decade before he took over the Trump campaign in mid-2016. He organized the Republican convention in July 2016, but quit President Trump’s team one month later.

Prosecutors have said they will not present evidence of Russian collusion during Mr. Manafort’s trial, but have claimed they have the authority to prosecute him under a May 2017 order by Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein.

Mr. Manafort’s attorneys have attacked that order, claiming that Mr. Mueller exceeded his authority. District Judge T.S. Ellis III, who is overseeing the Virginia trial, denied their motion, holding that Mr. Mueller’s mandate authorizes him to pursue charges against in the case.

The Virginia trial is the first of two that Mr. Manafort will face this year. He has a September trial scheduled in Washington, D.C., on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent and making false statements to investigators.

4019,4019,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jul/31/senate-democrats-blame-trump-newly-available-3d-gu/,Right,"Senate Democrats on Tuesday said President Trump will have “blood” on his hands and be “totally responsible” for 3D-printed guns that end up on the streets if his administration doesn’t immediately move to block a Texas company from posting blueprints for the firearms online.

“The ball’s in his court — he has a chance to prevent this from happening,” said Sen. Ed Markey, Massachusetts Democrat. “Donald Trump will be totally responsible for every downloadable, plastic AR-15 that will be roaming the streets of our country if he does not act today.”

Mr. Markey and other congressional Democrats are pushing legislation that aims to block Defense Distributed, the company, from posting downloadable blueprints online ahead of what had been an Aug. 1 target date.

The issue has sparked a wave of legal action after the State Department and the company agreed to a settlement last month allowing Defense Distributed to post the files once again after a years-long legal battle that spanned both the Obama and Trump administrations.

The company and its founder, Cody Wilson, say their right to move forward with the plans to post the files online falls under constitutionally-protected free speech.

“These guns are a menace. The failure to ban them will mean blood on the hands of officials who have that responsibility. I call on the Trump administration now to do the right thing,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Democrat.

Mr. Trump said in a Tuesday tweet that he’s looking into the issue and that he’s spoken to the National Rifle Association about it.

“He can blame it on anyone if he wants to save face, but it’s his doing. It’s his responsibility, and the blood’s going to be on his hands. It’s that simple and stark,” Mr. Blumenthal said.

The senators and other Democrats in Congress are now pushing legislation that aims to block the company from posting the prints — which it started doing last week — and looks to ban “untraceable” guns that don’t have serial numbers or metal parts that can be crafted using 3D printers.

“It will take time to pass legislation, and in the meantime, there will be a new wave of gun violence in America that is directly the fault of the president, Donald Trump, his administration, and our Republican colleagues,” Mr. Blumenthal said.

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer predicted that nothing would come of Mr. Trump’s tweet, calling it “a dollar short and a day late.”

“[As] sure as we’re here today, nothing is going to happen from this administration,” he said. “[We’re] going to have to pass legislation [because] they are just enslaved by the NRA. When the NRA says jump, they say, how high?”

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said last month’s decision “is a death warrant for countless innocent men, women and children.”

“This settlement makes clear that the GOP is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the NRA,” she said.

4055,4055,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/7/us-staying-out-saudi-canada-spat/,Right,"The State Department sought for a second day to avoid inflaming a spiraling diplomatic row between Saudi Arabia and Canada Tuesday, calling on both sides to sort out their differences over a delicate human rights dispute.

While department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said U.S. officials have raised human rights concerns with the Saudis in the past, she stressed that Riyadh and Ottawa “need to diplomatically resolve this together.”

“We can’t do it for them,” she said.

Saudi Arabia moved Sunday to expel the Canadian ambassador from Riyadh and declared a freeze on all new trade deals between the two countries, following Canada’s demand that the Saudis free women’s rights activists and others arrested in the Kingdom.

Critics of the Saudis claim Riyadh is trying to flex its muscles internationally and has overreacted to a comment Friday by Canada’s leading foreign affairs agency, Global Affairs Canada. The agency tweeted that it was “gravely concerned” about certain detentions in the Kingdom, specifically that of Samar Badawi, the sister of a blogger jailed by Saudi authorities.

“We urge the Saudi authorities to immediately release them and all other peaceful human rights activists,” the tweet said, according to CBC/Radio Canada.

The Canadians have since refused to back down, even as the Saudis claim to they will follow through on threats of harsh trade punishments for Ottawa.

According to Reuters, Saudi-Canadian trade consists largely of Saudi exports of petrochemicals, plastics and other products. The news agency has noted that in 2014, the Canadian unit of U.S. weapons maker General Dynamics Corp won a contract worth up to $13 billion to build light-armored vehicles for Saudi Arabia, in what Ottawa said was the largest advanced manufacturing export win in Canadian history.

Ms. Nauert told reporters at the State Department Tuesday that Washington is well aware of human rights concerns regarding Saudi Arabia, but she avoided taking a hard position on the Canada-Saudi spat.

“We have a regular dialogue with the government of Saudi Arabia on human rights and also other issues,” she said, adding later that “we would encourage the government of Saudi Arabia overall to address and respect due process and also publicize information on some of its legal cases.

“This particular case regarding Canada, we have raised that with the government of Saudi Arabia,” Ms. Nauert added, asserting that the United States “has respect for international recognized freedoms and also individual liberty.”

“That certainly has not changed and that’s basically where we stand today,” she said. “But we would encourage both governments to work out their issues together.”

4060,4060,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/9/pence-pentagon-promise-space-force-2020/,Right,"The U.S. “Space Force” will become a reality by 2020, Vice President Mike Pence and Defense Secretary James N. Mattis promised Thursday, laying out an ambitious timeline to set up the first new branch of the armed forces in nearly 75 years and making the case that Americans must prepare for space threats from Russia, China, North Korea and other hostile actors.

Speaking Thursday morning at the Pentagon, Mr. Pence said the Trump administration sees space as the next frontier in war and is ready to take dramatic action to prepare for conflicts.

Still, the proposal faces an uncertain fate in Congress, particularly if Democrats capture either the House or Senate in November elections.

“Now the time has come to write the next great chapter in the history of our armed forces, to prepare for the next battlefield. … The time has come to establish the United States Space Force,” the vice president said. “What was once peaceful and uncontested is now crowded and adversarial. Today, other nations are seeking to disrupt our space-based systems and challenge American supremacy in space as never before. … The United States will not shrink from this challenge.”

Many retired military officials and some currently in the Defense Department privately express reservations about the Space Force as a wholly separate branch of the military.

Over the past several weeks, there was widespread speculation that the Pentagon would pursue half-measures — such as establishing a unified space command — but avoid creating an entirely new service.

DOCUMENT: Space Force report

Mr. Pence’s comments Thursday, along with a detailed Pentagon report explaining how the Space Force will be handled, put an end to that speculation and demonstrate that military leaders — at least publicly — are now in step with the White House on space policy.

“Like the other military branches, the Space Force will organize, train, and equip forces to protect national security interests in the physical domain of space. The Space Force will accelerate and unify the Department’s space efforts and enable the delivery of next-generation space capabilities faster than potential adversaries can evolve,” the Pentagon says in its report. “The Space Force will grow the world’s most capable national security space workforce.”

Mr. Trump weighed in immediately after the vice president’s remarks.

“Space Force all the way!” the president tweeted.

Neither Mr. Pence nor Mr. Mattis offered any details on what it would cost to stand up the Space Force, but the administration reportedly will seek about $8 billion in funding. A formal proposal to establish the Space Force will be included in next year’s National Defense Authorization Act, and that bill will include all funding details.

Mr. Pence said the administration already is working with Congress on the issue.

SEE ALSO: Donald Trump’s ‘Space Force’ meets resistance in Pentagon, insiders say

“We’re building bipartisan support for our plan,” he said. “Next February in the president’s budget we will call on the Congress to marshal the resources we need to stand up the Space Force.”

Rep. Mike Rogers, Alabama Republican and one of Congress’ most outspoken Space Force proponents, said it’s past time for the U.S. to move forward.

“We in the House have been warning for years about the threats to our space assets and the unacceptably slow pace to develop more capable space systems,” he tweeted.

Critics raised concern that the force will simply lead to more bureaucracy inside the Pentagon.

“It is a waste of money,” said Stephen Ellis, executive vice president of the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. “A completely separate branch of the military won’t necessarily help the U.S. lead in space. It will, however, create a lot of waste and duplication.”

Mr. Pence and Mr. Mattis said the force won’t be rolled out until 2020, but the Defense Department is taking preparatory steps immediately.

First, the Pentagon said it will stand up a unified “Space Command” that will oversee all space operations in each branch of the military, similar in structure to U.S. Central Command, U.S. Africa Command and other combatant commands responsible for specific areas.

Second, the Defense Department will set up a “Space Operations Force” comprising “space war fighters.”

“The Space Operations Force will provide the human capital needed to develop, field, and integrate space capabilities into multi-domain war fighting,” the Pentagon says in its report.

The Pentagon also will set up a space development agency that will serve as the central hub for acquisition of materials needed to stand up the force.

The Defense Department also will appoint an assistant secretary of defense for space who will report directly to Mr. Mattis.

In the clip that aired on the “Today Show,” the president asked Ms. Manigault Newman why there were news reports of her leaving the White House. She said the call came the day after she was fired by Chief of Staff John F. Kelly.

“General Kelly came to me and said that you guys want me to leave,” she said.

“No..I, I — Nobody even told me about it” Mr. Trump said.

“Wow,” Ms. Manigault Newman said.

“You know they run a big operation but I didn’t know it. I didn’t know that. Godda—m it,” Mr. Trump said, “I don’t love you leaving at all.”

NBC News did not know what was said before or after that short exchange.

On Sunday, Ms. Manigault Newman provided audio of Mr. Kelly firing her in the White House’s Situation Room to NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Excerpts of the tape were played on air.

During her exclusive interview on the “Today Show,” Ms. Manigault Newman questioned who holds power in the White House.

“Is General Kelly running this country, or is the president running this country?” she said, “Who is running this country when Donald Trump says, ‘they are running a big operation,’ who is the ‘they.’ “

The former “Celebrity Apprentice” star said Mr. Trump “absolutely” lies all the time, and she isn’t sure if he lied during his call with her. Ms. Manigault Newman stood by the statement she made on “Meet the Press” that she believed the president did instruct Mr. Kelly to fire her.

She claimed that the White House destroyed some of her personal belongings that they still had possession of. Ms. Manigault Newman also described being in the Situation Room as “false imprisonment,” because she claimed the staff held her there for hours without counsel or her husband.

Ms. Manigault Newman also said there are more tapes to prove Mr. Trump used the N-word about African-American producers during his time on “The Celebrity Apprentice.” She also said there are three sources in her book that corroborate her accusation.

“There’s multiple tapes, let’s be clear about that,” she said.

Her book claims the president uses racial slurs, even toward senior White House aide Kellyane Conway’s husband. George Conway refuted her claims.

Ms. Manigault Newman stood by her decision to make the secret recordings.

“Had I not recorded this, everyone would say she has a credibility issue,” she said. “The first thing they do when someone leaves this White House, Savannah [Guthrie], is say, ‘They don’t have credibility. They were just a coffee person. They didn’t have access. They never talked to the president. They weren’t in the room.’”

She refused to answer how she was able to record both the president or Mr. Kelly, saying, “I’ll leave that to your imagination.”

Some security experts are concerned the recordings could have compromised national security.

Ms. Manigault Newman explained that as a whistleblower, she is not worried about any legal ramifications.

Deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley pushed back on Ms. Manigault Newman’s claims and the new audio on Monday during an interview on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.” He could not go into specifics about why she was fired or how she was able to get a recording device in the room.

“What I can tell you is the thought of doing something like that to a fellow employee, not to mention the leader of the free world, is completely disgraceful,” he said.

Mr. Gidley denounced Ms. Manigault Newman by saying she was releasing the audio and accusing the president in her book just for money.

“Apparently telling the truth wasn’t paying her bills, so she decided to switch her story to try and make a quick buck and that I just can’t abide by,” Mr. Gidley said.

The deputy press secretary also refuted her claims that Mr. Kelly holds the real power in the White House.

“That is absolutely ludicrous and ridiculous,” Mr. Gidley said, “The president runs this country. He makes the decisions. He makes the policy.”

The president himself called his former aide a “lowlife” on Sunday when asked about her by pool reporters.

The released recordings come as Ms. Manigult Newman promotes her new book, “Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House.” The book comes out Tuesday.

4086,4086,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/14/donald-wuerl-vatican-covered-catholic-church-pries/,Right,"A landmark grand jury report says hundreds of priests preyed on boys and girls in six Pennsylvania dioceses, where at least 1,000 were sexually assaulted over decades as top church officials, including Cardinal Donald W. Wuerl, archbishop of Washington, and the Vatican systematically worked to cover it up.

At almost 900 pages, the exhaustive report details methods by leaders of the dioceses to insulate accused members of the church from outside prosecution and judgment — employing the same strategies uncovered by The Boston Globe’s 2002 report on the systematic cover-up of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.

The investigating team received files on at least 100 other priests but didn’t include them in the report for lack of sufficient evidence. The actual number of child victims is believed to be in the thousands, the jurors wrote, but there is no information because they either didn’t come forward or the dioceses didn’t create written records for all times they heard of the abuse.

The six dioceses — Allentown, Erie, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Scranton — serve nearly 1.6 million Catholics in Pennsylvania.

In 1993, Cardinal Wuerl, then bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, coined the term “circle of secrecy” to describe the methods in place to protect accused members of the church, according to the report.

The cardinal denies he came up with that term, according to the spokesman for the Washington Archdiocese.

This included downplaying accusations of rape and molestation with euphemisms like “horseplay” and “wrestling,” transferring accused priests around the country or placing them on “health leave” while keeping them on the church payroll — at times to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars. In some instances, accused sexual abusers were promoted.

Other methods included covering costs of victims related to medical and psychological care and settlements to victims with the signing of a confidentiality agreement.

Cardinal Wuerl on Tuesday defended his role in the church at the time.

“While I understand this report may be critical of some of my actions, I believe the report confirms that I acted with diligence, with concern for the victims and to prevent future acts of abuse,” the archbishop said in a statement before the grand jury was released. “I sincerely hope that a just assessment of my actions, past and present, and my continuing commitment to the protection of children will dispel any notions otherwise made by this report.”

The report’s effect on the Pennsylvania dioceses, as well as the Vatican, could be seismic and costly. The Archdiocese of Boston in 2002 paid $10 million to victims of a priest who had abused more than 130 children during his tenure and in 2003 paid $85 million to victims and their parents who had filed lawsuits over the abuse. The scandal also resulted in the resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law.

On Tuesday, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro detailed graphic stories of victims of sexual abuse that occurred over decades, some stretching back as far as the early 1950s and continuing into the late 2000s.

The report took two years to compile based on victim testimony and a half-million internal documents subpoenaed from the church.

“These documents, from the diocese’s own ‘secret archives,’ formed the backbone of this investigation,” said Mr. Shapiro, adding that internal communications from the church corroborated victim testimonies and illustrated the extent of the cover-up, which reached the Vatican.

Church officials referred to the written reports of abuse as “secret archives,” said Mr. Shapiro, indicating their complacency in the cover-up.

“In each diocese, the bishops had the key to the ‘secret archives,’ which contained both allegations and admissions of the abuse and cover-up,” he said.

More than a dozen victims and family members of victims joined the attorney general Tuesday for a press conference in Harrisburg, crying and leaning on one another for comfort as details of sexual assaults by priests on children were made public.

This included a disturbing report of four “predator priests” in the Pittsburgh diocese who “groomed and violently assaulted young boys,” Mr. Shapiro said. One boy was forced to stand naked on a bed in the rectory, posing as Christ on the cross while these priests took photos of him. The pictures were added to a collection of child pornography and shared on church grounds.

These same predators gifted their favored victims with gold crosses to wear as necklaces, marking which boys had been groomed for abuse, the report said.

“Predators in every diocese weaponized the Catholic faith and used it as a tool of their abuse,” Mr. Shapiro said.

The grand jury recommended that criminal and civil statutes of limitations on sexual abuse in Pennsylvania be reformed to prosecute the detailed allegations of sexual abuse stemming from decades past. They wrote that the systematic cover-up allowed for the statute of limitations to expire before victims and law enforcement could hold perpetrators accountable.

However, at least two instances uncovered by the jury’s investigation led to charges against priests.

Last month, Catholic priest John Sweeney of Greensburg pleaded guilty to sexually abusing a 10-year-old boy in the early 1990s. Sweeney served as a priest for 16 years and in various parishes, according to the attorney general’s office.

In Erie, the Rev. David Poulson awaits trial on charges of sexually abusing two boys over many years. State prosecutors also say Poulson’s superior, Bishop Donald Trautman, knew about and covered up the abuse.

Cardinal Wuerl, as Pittsburgh’s bishop, had served the longest term as head of the diocese and personally dealt with at least 25 of the 99 accused priests.

He assumed leadership in Pittsburgh in 1988 and a year later drafted a letter to the Vatican raising concerns about a number of high-profile sexual abuse allegations against priests and what role the church should play in assuming responsibility and dealing with the accused.

He called for transparency among Catholic leaders, for them to tell one another that if a transferred priest had been accused of sexual assault, that they had a responsibility to their parishioners, who “would be gravely unsettled and scandalized” that a “priest pedophile has been assigned in their midst,” the report cited the cardinal as writing.

Despite this early attempt at a culture shift, Cardinal Wuerl presided over the reassignment of accused pedophiles to other churches and schools, positions where they were expected to interact with children. At times, he did discourage reassignments and encouraged resignations, but he approved the church’s stipends for the men and in some cases health insurance.

He was promoted to cardinal in 2006 and took over leadership of the Archdiocese of Washington.

Over the past two weeks, the cardinal has been dealing with the fallout of his predecessor, Theodore E. McCarrick, who was stripped of his title by the pope at the end of July after allegations of sexual abuse stemming from decades earlier.

“I think everyone recognizes that words, good intentions, and new policies, while important, are not enough,” Cardinal Wuerl wrote in a post on the website of the Archdiocese of Washington. “We must not only denounce abuse and take steps to stop the abusers. We must remove even the appearance of cover-ups as we investigate and address allegations.”

4089,4089,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/14/midwest-democrats-look-tuesdays-races-upend-gop-ga/,Right,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Democrats are fighting to beat back Republican gains across the Midwest as the 2018 primary season roars through Wisconsin and Minnesota, two states where President Donald Trump’s appeal among working-class voters threaten to upend decadeslong political trends this fall and beyond.

Tuesday’s primary contests for governor, the U.S. Senate and the House will test the strength of Trump’s fiery coalition against the energy of the Democratic resistance. At the same time, accusations of domestic violence involving the Democratic National Committee’s second-in-command could undermine the blue wave in Minnesota, a state still healing from scandal.

In all, four states will host primary elections Tuesday as the 2018 primary season nears its final chapter. All but 10 states will have picked their candidates for November’s general election by the time all votes are counted in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Vermont and Connecticut. While the full political battlefield isn’t quite set, the stakes are clear: Democrats are working to topple Republican control of Congress and governors’ offices across the nation.

Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee, who leads the Democratic Governors Association, predicted that Tuesday would offer fresh evidence of a blue wave that would sweep Democrats into power this November.

“Trump has managed to alienate every form of human life on the planet,” Inslee told The Associated Press when asked about his party’s appeal among white working-class voters. “They’re tired of this chaos.”

Democrats appear particularly motivated in Wisconsin, where eight candidates have lined up for the chance to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker, a two-term incumbent who has warned his party about the prospect of a blue wave.

Walker’s strong anti-union policies made him a Democratic villain long before Trump’s rise. State schools chief Tony Evers, who has clashed with Walker at times, enters the primary as the best-known of the eight Democratic candidates.

Once a target of Trump criticism, Walker gained the president’s endorsement in a tweet Monday night, Trump calling him “a tremendous Governor who has done incredible things for that Great State” on the eve of the primary. But Trump’s persistent attacks on Wisconsin-based motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson put Republican candidates on their heels in recent days, Walker among them.

Trump tweeted Sunday that it was “great” that many Harley owners planned to boycott the Milwaukee company if manufacturing moves overseas, continuing a monthslong tariff dispute with the beloved American motorcycle manufacturer.

Walker avoided addressing the boycott call directly in a written response. His Democratic opponents embraced the fight.

“By attacking Wisconsin workers to cover for failed economic policy, President Trump took a page right out of Scott Walker’s playbook,” said Mahlon Mitchell, one of the candidates and the head of the state firefighters union.

Trump also stars, informally at least, in Wisconsin’s Senate primaries as Republicans try to deny Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin a second term.

The GOP primary features fervent Trump supporters: former Marine Kevin Nicholson, running as an outsider, and longtime state lawmaker Leah Vukmir, who is backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan. While neither candidate was an early Trump supporter, Vukmir has struggled to explain footage recently unearthed from 2016 in which she calls Trump “offensive to everyone.”

Tuesday’s primaries serve as a test of Democratic enthusiasm in the upper Midwest, a region that has long been associated with liberal politics but has been trending red. Trump won Wisconsin by less than 1 percentage point in 2016, becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to carry the state since 1984.

It’s much the same in Minnesota, where Trump lost by less than 3 percentage points in a state that hadn’t backed a Republican presidential contender since 1972.

Minnesota voters will pick candidates in competitive races for governor, the Senate and the House. But a down-ballot race for state attorney general may overshadow them all.

Rep. Keith Ellison, the Democratic National Committee’s deputy chairman, was expected to capture his party’s nomination in the race to become the state’s top law enforcement official. That was before Ellison’s candidacy was rocked by allegations of domestic violence over the weekend amid a broader national outcry against sexual misconduct by powerful men in business, entertainment and politics.

Ellison has denied an ex-girlfriend’s allegations that he dragged her off a bed while screaming obscenities during a 2016 relationship she said was plagued by “narcissistic abuse.”

Allegations of misconduct are still fresh in Minnesota, where Democratic Sen. Al Franken resigned in December after multiple allegations of unwanted sexual touching. His replacement, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith, is on Tuesday’s ballot as she seeks her first full term. She’s facing Democrat Richard Painter, a former George W. Bush ethics lawyer.

Former two-term Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty may be the biggest name on Minnesota’s ballot, however.

He’s the leading Republican candidate in the high-profile race to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton. Having lost his own short-lived bid for president in 2012, Pawlenty spent much of the last six years serving as a top corporate lobbyist.

Like Republican candidates elsewhere, Pawlenty has struggled to live down his blistering critique of Trump in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election. At the time, he called Trump “unhinged and unfit for the presidency.” Pawlenty has since said he voted for Trump and supports his agenda.

The Democratic field for governor features U.S. Rep. Tim Walz, state Rep. Erin Murphy and Attorney General Lori Swanson.

Not to be forgotten: Deep-blue Vermont and Connecticut hold primary contests as well.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has not ruled out a second presidential run in 2020, is seeking his third term in the Senate. The 76-year-old democratic socialist is running for the Democratic nomination, but he is expected to turn it down and run as an independent.

In Connecticut, five Republicans have lined up to replace the unpopular outgoing governor, Democrat Dan Malloy. The Democratic field features former gubernatorial candidate Ned Lamont and Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim, who served several years in prison for political corruption.

Peoples reported from Washington. Associated Press writer Kyle Potter in St. Paul, Minnesota, contributed to this report."
4103,4103,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/17/jack-phillips-in-colorado-who-prevailed-in-the-sup/,Right,"OPINION:

Liberals and gay activists remain obsessed with forcing Christians to bake their cakes. And the answer, in the name of individual, religious and even gay civil rights, must still be no.

If you doubt the intensity of the left’s fixation on punishing people of faith, I submit to you the Colorado’s so-called Civil Rights Commission. Despite Masterpiece Cakeshop winning a 7-2 U.S. Supreme Court victory condemning the state for punishing Jack Phillips for his religious beliefs, they’re going after him again. This time, the set-up involves a request for a variety of cakes that would violate his religious belief, including a cake celebrating a gender transition.

Mr. Phillips, a baker who is Christian, found himself in the public eye six years ago when he refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding. He has always served all customers, including gays and lesbians, but as an artist his faith requires him to not participate directly — like the specific creation of a cake — in efforts that violate his faith.

Ultimately, Mr. Phillips was found to have violated the state’s anti-discrimination law, and his fight ended up at the Supreme Court. which found the actual violator of civil rights to be the state’s commission. Reuters reported in June when the decision was issued:

“The justices, in a 7-2 decision, said the Colorado Civil Rights Commission showed an impermissible hostility toward religion when it found that baker Jack Phillips violated the state’s anti-discrimination law by rebuffing gay couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig in 2012. The state law bars businesses from refusing service based on race, sex, marital status or sexual orientation. The court concluded that the commission violated Phillips’ religious rights under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment.”

That’s pretty serious stuff, and would make anyone take notice that a mistake had been made. But the haters and bullies in Colorado apparently don’t care. On the day the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Masterpiece case, Mr. Phillips received a call from attorney Autumn Scardina making a specific request for a cake celebrating a gender transition. Mr. Phillips declined, citing his faith.

The Daily Caller reported several other requests were made of him in the months that followed, “[T]he bakery received requests for cakes featuring marijuana use, sexually explicit messages, and Satanic symbols. One solicitation submitted by email asked the cake shop to create a three-tiered white cake depicting Satan licking a [sex toy]. Phillips believes Scardina made all these requests.”

The high court made it clear that the government of Colorado was targeting Mr. Phillips because of his faith, and that it must stop.

“The commission issued an order requiring Phillips to cease and desist discriminating against same-sex couples, and the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed. But the commission violated Phillips’ rights, [Supreme Court Justice Anthony] Kennedy said, because its ‘treatment of his case has some elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs that motivated his objection.’ Kennedy cited the comments of one commissioner, who said religion has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history, including slavery and the Holocaust…,” the American Bar Association Journal reported about the decision.

The Journal continued, “Kennedy said the statement disparages religion ‘by describing it as despicable, and also by characterizing it as merely rhetorical — something insubstantial and even insincere.’ “

A few weeks after that decision, the Colorado commission notified Mr. Phillips that they were, again, launching new proceedings against him because of the “transition celebration” cake refusal.

The good news is that the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) is suing the commission on behalf of Mr. Phillips. The ADF told the Daily Caller, “The state of Colorado is ignoring the message of the U.S. Supreme Court by continuing to single out Jack for punishment and to exhibit hostility toward his religious beliefs … the government is intent on destroying him — something the Supreme Court has already told it not to do.”

As a gay woman who has been involved in efforts to ensure the equal treatment of gays and lesbians, I remain appalled at how the liberal gay activist agenda has become exactly the same thing the original gay civil rights movement fought against. The gay rights movement originally was an effort for us to be left alone and to not be punished for who we are. We simply wanted to be able to live our lives without fear of arrest, or our businesses raided or destroyed, because of who we were.

Fast forward from 1969 to the 21st century. It is now gays and lesbians targeting other people for punishment and destruction, simply because of who they are. For most of our history, gays worked to “pass” as heterosexual so as to not be harassed, punished or fired from our jobs.

Now, it’s Christians being hounded by a liberal elite in power in government and society who are demanding, ironically, that Christians should be harassed, punished, fired or lose their businesses because they’re different and don’t conform. This much we know: Supporting the spark of freedom that fueled every civil rights movement requires supporting Christians who are targeted for their faith, and absolutely the ADF in their defense of Jack Phillips.

According to local media reports and videos, the 1913 “Silent Sam” statue to honor soldiers who were killed in the Civil War was torn down and then had dirt poured on it.

BREAKING NEWS: Silent Sam is down! Protesters have toppled the controversial statue on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. #WRAL pic.twitter.com/JLOAERUI5P — WRAL NEWS in NC (@WRAL) August 21, 2018

“I feel liberated — like I’m a part of something big. It’s literally my fourth day here,” freshman Natalia Walker told the Daily Tar Heel. “This is the biggest thing I’ve ever been a part of in my life, just activist-wise. All of these people coming together for this one sole purpose and actually get it done was the best part.”

At least one person was arrested at the demonstration, which took place the day before classes start, according to reporters for WRAL, the Raleigh NBC affiliate.

The arrest happened after a brief altercation with police when protesters were told to remove bandanas from their faces — ironically, an ordinance designed as an anti-KKK measure.

The crowd was chanting “Maya, Maya” as Maya Little, who had been arrested in April for smearing the statue with ink, spoke to them.

“It’s time to tear down Silent Sam,” she exhorted.

After the statue was torn down, police set up a boundary around the empty pedestal, as the crowd vowed to do the same thing at the site of the protests that killed Heather Heyer and two police officers: “Next up, Charlottesville.”

In a statement on Monday night, the university called the actions of the protesters “dangerous.”

“Tonight’s actions were dangerous, and we are very fortunate that no one was injured. We are investigating the vandalism and assessing the full extent of the damage,” the statement said.

The university did not immediately say whether it would restore the statue, though.

Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat who has called for removing the statue, also was not amused.

“The Governor understands that many people are frustrated by the pace of change and he shares their frustration, but violent destruction of public property has no place in our communities,” he wrote on Twitter.

4121,4121,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/23/jeff-sessions-fires-back-donald-trump-accuses-pres/,Right,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired back at President Trump Thursday, insisting he will not let politics dictate Department of Justice investigations.

“While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,” Mr. Sessions said in a statement. “I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action. However, no nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States.”

The statement marks one of the few times Mr. Sessions has acknowledged the president’s attacks. Mr. Sessions is a frequent target of derision for Mr. Trump, who has savaged his attorney general for recusing himself from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation and failure to investigate whether Hillary Clinton got favorable treatment from the Justice Department.

During a Thursday morning interview on “Fox & Friends,” Mr. Trump renewed his criticism of Mr. Sessions, accusing him of allowing the Justice Department to undermine his administration.

“I put in an attorney general that never took control of the Justice Department, Jeff Sessions,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s sort of an incredible thing.”

Mr. Trump pointed to the several examples of misapplied justice, including the case of Imran Awan, the former IT administrator for Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who received no jail time from a judge this week for bank fraud after federal prosecutors didn’t pursue more serious charges of running a spy ring inside Congress and stealing congressional computer equipment.

“He had more information on the corruption of the Democrats than anybody,” Mr. Trump said. “They gave him nothing. He’s a Democrat, he got nothing. The reason he got nothing is because the ‘Dems’ are very strong in the Justice Department.”

In his statement, Mr. Sessions insisted he has been in control of the Justice Department.

“I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the President’s agenda—one that protects the safety and security and rights of the American people, reduces violent crime, enforces our immigration laws, promotes economic growth, and advances religious liberty,” he said.

The president also raised the issue of fired FBI agent Peter Strzok and his paramour, FBI attorney Lisa Page, who exchanged anti-Trump text messages during the campaign. Mr. Strzok went on to work on special counsel Robert Mueller’s team.

“It’s really subversion,” the president said of the pair. “And our Justice Department doesn’t do anything about it. People say ‘you appointed Jeff Sessions. I said I did.”

Asked if he might fire Mr. Sessions after the midterm elections, Mr. Trump didn’t answer directly.

“There’s such corruption,” he said. “It’s from before I got here. It’s the Obama administration. They surveilled my campaign.”

When interviewer Ainsley Earhardt noted that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein signed the final request for a special court to approve a surveillance warrant, Mr. Trump replied, “It bothers me, it’s always bothered me.”

“I wanted to stay uninvolved,” he said. “But when everybody sees what’s going on in the Justice Department, it’s a very very sad day.”

Reviving his continual complaint that Mr. Sessions recused himself from the investigation into possible Russian collusion, Mr. Trump said the attorney general “should have told me.”

“He took the job, and then he said I’m going to recuse myself. I said what kind of a man is this?” Mr. Trump said. “He was on the campaign. The only reason I gave him the job [was] because I felt loyalty — an original supporter. He knows there was no collusion.”

A new profile piece by New York Magazine shadowed one of Time magazine’s “100 Most Influential” people for months to see what makes him tick and where he’s going. The answer: work on a candidate’s 2020 presidential campaign and then his own run for Congress.

“The reason Republicans are successful right now is because they’re empowering young people,” the March for Our Lives told writer Lisa Miller for an interview published Sunday. “Older Democrats just won’t move the f— off the plate and let us take control. Nancy Pelosi is old.”

The 18-year-old noted that U.S. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan was 45-year-old upon taking up the leadership role.

“Hogg is working on a seven-year plan. … He and his friends in the March for Our Lives organization plan to spend the next several months meeting more activists and canvasing in advance of the midterm elections,” Ms. Miller wrote. “And if he could design his future without any obstacles, he would go to college in the fall of 2019, ‘read a sh—load of books” then take some time off in 2020 to work on a presidential campaign.

“(Certain candidates have already approached him, he told me.),” she continued. “Then, after college, he would prepare for his congressional run. ‘I think I’ve come to that conclusion,’ he says. ‘I want to be at least part of the change in Congress.’ “

Mr. Hogg added that the rise of Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York will eventually culminate in her successful run for the White House.

Aside from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, however, he isn’t thrilled with the current state of the Democratic Party.

“[Sen. Bernie Sanders is] a great guy, terrible on guns,” he said. “[Former President Obama] increased drone warfare and killed a lot of civilians. … Honestly, they all kind of suck.”

4167,4167,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/sep/2/brett-kavanaugh-has-democrats-in-nuclear-option-re/,Right,"With attempts to attack Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh’s record failing, Democrats over the weekend mounted a last-ditch bid to derail his confirmation to the Supreme Court by claiming that the vetting process is so bad that it demands a do-over.

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, even accused former President George W. Bush of complicity, saying he used his powers to block access to tens of thousands of pages of records from Judge Kavanaugh’s time in the Bush White House.

Republicans brushed aside the complaints and prepared to welcome Judge Kavanaugh to Capitol Hill on Tuesday for his appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where the fate of his nomination will be decided.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, said as long as Judge Kavanaugh doesn’t bungle the hearings, he will be confirmed with some Democrats joining Republicans.

“If he does well at the hearing, he will get — my belief — 55 [votes]. Or higher if he does well, and I’m sure he will do well,” Mr. Graham said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Democrats seemed to realize they are fighting a losing battle after attacks on the judge’s personal finances and his activities while in the Bush White House fell short.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota Democrat, expressed remorse that her party eviscerated the power of the filibuster five years ago, leaving them no path to stop Judge Kavanaugh, barring Republican defections.

Ms. Klobuchar, who voted with fellow Democrats in 2013 to trigger the “nuclear option” and curtail the filibuster, said she would support reverting to the 60-vote rule should her party regain the Senate.

“I don’t think we should have made that change when we look back at it. But it happened because we were so frustrated because President Obama wasn’t able to get his nominees, but I think we would have been in a better place now,” she said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

She was one of several Democrats who lodged complaints over the weekend that Mr. Bush and President Trump were keeping damning documents from Judge Kavanaugh’s past secret.

Nearly 450,000 pages of records have been turned over so far to the Judiciary Committee — equivalent to the total for the past five high court nominees combined — yet Democrats say Mr. Bush and Mr. Trump have deemed more than 100,000 pages “committee confidential.”

“What are they trying so desperately to hide?” Mr. Schumer said.

Republicans said Democrats are reaching for objections.

No land mines have been found in the hundreds of thousands of pages already available to the public, and Republicans said they have made the confidential documents available to all senators.

Sen. Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican and Judiciary Committee chairman, said he would work with any senator who requests that some of those confidential documents be cleared for the public.

Ms. Klobuchar was the only senator to make such a request, he said — and those documents were released Friday. They showed a fascinating conversation in March 2002 between Judge Kavanaugh, at the time a White House lawyer, and colleagues about the constitutionality of campaign finance laws as Congress was debating a bill pushed by Sens. John McCain and Russell D. Feingold.

The judge was deeply skeptical of Congress’ ability to impose restrictions, calling limits on outside groups “blatantly unconstitutional” — a position the Supreme Court eventually took as well when it struck down the restrictions.

He also said that limits on contributions to candidates “have some constitutional problems.”

That stance is likely to anger Senate Democrats who want more campaign finance restrictions, arguing that rich donors have gained too much influence in politics through their ability to fund outside groups that run ads influencing elections.

In the emails, Judge Kavanaugh is debating Helgard C. Walker, another lawyer in the White House, with Noel Francisco also included in the conversation. Mr. Francisco is currently the solicitor general for the Justice Department, and Ms. Walker is a lawyer in private practice.

Ms. Walker and Judge Kavanaugh appeared to think restrictions ran afoul of the Constitution, though they got into an intense email discussion over the role outside groups play in campaigns.

Judge Kavanaugh said issue ads from organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce or the Sierra Club can overwhelm the candidates, and the candidates are at a disadvantage if they have to abide by limits while the groups don’t.

“I agree that the issue ad restrictions are blatantly unconstitutional — although I think the policy goal of allowing the candidates to debate each other without background noise that overwhelms the candidates/campaigns themselves is quite laudable (albeit unconstitutional),” he wrote.

Ms. Walker said Judge Kavanaugh was demeaning outside groups by calling their voices “background noise.”

Judge Kavanaugh said he wasn’t trying to insult those voices but did fear that they could be too loud for the campaigns to break through.

“I do not like a political campaign that is Sierra Club against Chamber of Commerce with the candidates reduced to bit roles because of contribution limits,” he said.

The McCain-Feingold legislation, which Mr. Bush eventually signed into law, imposed strict limits on how political parties could raise and spend money, and tried to limit the ability of outside groups to weigh in with ads during the days ahead of the elections.

The Supreme Court upheld most of the law in a 2003 case, but seven years later, in the Citizens United case, it ruled that the restrictions on outside groups were unconstitutional — just as Judge Kavanaugh predicted.

That left a situation where parties are still heavily restricted, but conservative and liberal groups are not — and they have become an overwhelming force in campaigns, also as Judge Kavanaugh predicted.

“I think we did a fantastic job in Puerto Rico,” Mr. Trump told reports at the White House. “We’ve put a lot of money and a lot of effort into Puerto Rico.”

He said the federal government spent “billions and billions of dollars” in response to the hurricane.

Puerto Rico authorities had kept the death toll at 64 until they commissioned a study by George Washington University that put the storm-related deaths at nearly 3,000.

The study, which examined an unusually long six-month time period for storm-related deaths, placed Hurricane Maria among the most deadly in U.S. history.

“We are still helping Puerto Rico,” the president said. “The governor is an excellent guy and he is very happy with the job we have done.”

Mr. Trump said the natural disaster in Puerto Rico was “a tough one.”

He noted that the island already suffered from a failing power grid before the hurricane hit.

Mr. Trump also said the logistics of the relief effort was complicated by the island location.

Mr. Papadopoulos said that at a roundtable of campaign officials in 2016, he told the table he had a connection who could establish a summit between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin.

President Trump, then a candidate, nodded at him and didn’t seem committed, but Mr. Sessions seemed “quite enthusiastic” about the prospect of a Trump-Putin summit, Mr. Papadopoulos said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”

Mr. Sessions has testified that he pushed back on the idea.

“All I can say is this was a meeting from about two years ago — my recollection differs from Jeff Sessions’,” Mr. Papadopoulos said.

On Friday, Mr. Papadopoulos was sentenced to two weeks in prison for lying to investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 election.

He pleaded guilty in October 2017 to lying to federal investigators about his contacts with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who supposedly told him in 2016 that Russia had damaging information on Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent.

Mr. Papadopoulos said Sunday he had no recollection of sending an email about the possible dirt to John Mashburn, a Trump campaign and White House official who has reportedly testified to congressional investigators he thought he got such an alert about possible Clinton dirt from Mr. Papadopoulos.

“If I did send an email, and especially if others were copied on it, I’m sure that evidence would have [been] introduced by now,” Mr. Papadopoulos said. “If that email was sent, even if I deleted it, if that’s what people believe I did, there would be a copy somewhere else.”

He said he has no idea if special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation will reveal that there was actual collusion between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.

“All I can say is that my testimony might have helped move something towards that, but I have no idea,” he said.

Mr. Trump himself has repeatedly said there was “no collusion.”

4190,4190,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/sep/10/tax-reform-20-revealed-house-republicans-move-perm/,Right,"House Republicans announced legislation Monday to permanently lock in last year’s tax cuts, looking to remind voters of the surging economy — and the Republicans’ role in getting it there — in the weeks before the November elections.

The three bills have been dubbed Tax Reform 2.0. They would make good on President Trump‘s repeated calls on Congress to go beyond the $1.5 trillion package he signed last year and give Americans more breaks.

The legislation would make permanent last year’s tax breaks for individuals, preventing them from facing a tax increase in eight years, while boosting incentives for retirement savings and giving more lenient tax treatment to startups and small businesses.

“Under our new system, we’re seeing incredible job growth, bigger paychecks and a tax code that works on behalf of families and American businesses. Now it’s the time to ensure we never let our tax code become so outdated again,” said Rep. Kevin Brady, Texas Republican and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which announced the bills.

Republican leaders say they want to hold a vote in the House by the end of September, giving their members a chance to crow about last year’s tax cuts and to force Democrats to explain their opposition amid a surging economy.

The bills are likely to end up as more of a political statement than a policy accomplishment because it’s doubtful they would survive a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.

The latest package is not protected by a budget, which would have circumvented the filibuster.

The cuts would add at least $650 billion to the deficit over the next decade, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.

Like with last year’s bill, the center said, most of the savings would benefit wealthier Americans.

Democrats are eager to engage on that message.

“The first Republican tax law hasn’t helped workers get ahead. Wages aren’t keeping up with inflation, costs for health insurance and prescription drugs are rising, and companies are laying people off and shipping jobs overseas,” said Rep. Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on Ways and Means. “This new tax legislation is more of the same: It disproportionately benefits the wealthiest Americans while growing the nation’s debt even more.”

The tax reform is the biggest legislative accomplishment of a Congress that has been controlled by Republicans since Mr. Trump took office. Republicans are counting on the tax cuts to persuade voters to keep them in charge.

Americans are increasingly pleased with the economy’s performance. A Quinnipiac University poll released Monday found that 70 percent of respondents said the U.S. economy is “excellent” or “good,” matching the poll’s record high.

“The Economy is soooo good, perhaps the best in our country’s history,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter, adding that Democrats were “flailing” for a response.

The latest round of numbers included 4.2 percent quarterly growth in the gross domestic product, a continued low unemployment rate and even a significant boost in average wages.

But the president isn’t enjoying the fruit of those numbers. His approval rating stood at just 38 percent in the Quinnipiac poll, dragged down by what voters saw as personal failings of lack of honesty and leadership.

“The economy booms, but President Donald Trump‘s numbers are a bust. An anemic 38 percent approval rating is compounded by lows on honesty, strength and intelligence,” said Tim Malloy, the poll’s assistant director.

Adding to Mr. Trump‘s woes last week was former President Barack Obama, who said he deserved the lion’s share of credit for the soaring economy.

“Let’s just remember when this recovery started,” the former president said in a speech marking his return to the campaign trail. “I’m glad it’s continued, but when you hear about this economic miracle that’s been going on, when the job numbers come out, monthly job numbers, and suddenly Republicans are saying it’s a miracle, I have to kind of remind them, actually, those job numbers are the same as they were in 2015 and 2016.”

Mr. Obama did oversee similar job numbers, with average monthly growth of 226,000 in 2015 and 195,000 in 2016.

Mr. Trump presided over average monthly job growth of 182,000 last year. So far this year, it has been 207,000.

But the White House said Mr. Trump has to be given credit for a broader set of data.

Small-business optimism, business confidence, real sales, real private nonresidential fixed investment and core capital goods orders and shipments have surged since Mr. Trump took office, said Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.

“If anyone were to assert that the capital spending boom that we’re seeing right now was a continuation of the trend that President Trump inherited, then, well, they wouldn’t get a high grade in graduate school for that assertion,” Mr. Hassett said.

Although he said Mr. Obama is often unfairly blamed for the Great Recession that he inherited, Mr. Hassett said there were “a whole bunch of policies that I think were very negative for growth.”

Mr. Hassett did have to correct Mr. Trump‘s math in a tweet Monday that said growth in gross domestic product, at 4.2 percent, was higher than the unemployment number, at 3.9 percent, “for the first time in over 100 years!”

The statistic is wrong. It was the first time in about a decade that GDP surpassed the unemployment rate.

Mr. Hassett said he didn’t know how the president got the wrong number.

Mr. Trump has been a major cheerleader for congressional Republicans’ plans for Tax Reform 2.0.

The crux of the effort is making permanent changes for individuals: lower income tax rates, a higher standard deduction and a bigger child tax credit.

That would fix the problem Republicans created when they used a gimmick to fit into the $1.5 trillion budget space allotted for the 2017 tax cuts. Republicans made the corporate tax cuts permanent but imposed a sunset on the individual tax cuts, leaving Americans poised to face massive hikes in 2026.

But it also would send deficits soaring.

“The reason that these provisions were not permanent in the first place was that we could not afford it. What has changed?” said Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which tracks budget news. “Tax cuts simply don’t pay for themselves. America’s future economy depends on a strong fiscal foundation, and more debt is the last thing we need.”

On Wednesday, the Senate passed a $850 billion spending package. A majority of the money — $647 billion — went to the Pentagon, which would include funds for a pay raise for troops.

Three other federal departments were funded by the bill. The Department of Health and Human Services received $90 billion of funding, the Education Department was given approximately $71 billion, and the Department of Labor got around $12 billion.

Congress funded Mr. Trump’s border wall and security measures with their July bill, including $5 billion in funding from the House.

At the beginning of September, Mr. Trump once again floated threats of shutting down the government if Democrats worked to prevent Congress from spending more on border security.

4261,4261,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/sep/24/rod-rosenstein-has-resigned-deputy-attorney-genera/,Right,"Rod Rosenstein remains the No. 2 man at the Justice Department, but now faces a major meeting later this week with President Trump to hash out his future.

News reports that Mr. Rosenstein had resigned or was fired Monday turned out not to be true.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Mr. Trump does want to have a face-to-face meeting with his deputy attorney general to talk about allegations Mr. Rosenstein talked about secretly taping the president, and suggested invoking the 25th Amendment to oust the president from office.

Mr. Rosenstein on Monday did have a previously scheduled meeting with White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly. As Mr. Rosenstein departed a White House meeting, Mr. Kelly took the unusual step of giving the smiling Mr. Rosenstein an enthusiastic goodbye handshake on the driveway in full view of television cameras, as if to convey that their discussion was amicable.

In New York for a meeting at the United Nations, Mr. Trump confirmed that he spoke with Mr. Rosenstein on Monday and he still has his job at the Justice Department. When asked if he was firing Mr. Rosenstein, the president responded, “no,” adding that the pair will have a meeting on Thursday.

“We’ll be meeting at the White House and we will be determining what’s going on,” Mr. Trump said. “We want to have transparency. We want to have openness and I look forward to meeting with Rod at that time.”

Mr. Rosenstein has denied suggesting removing the president, though a department official told The New York Times he did — sarcastically — mention taping Mr. Trump.

The explanations and denials have done little to stop calls from conservatives for Mr. Rosenstein to step down or be fired if he’s been undermining the president.

“If Rosenstein is involved, he should be fired,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican. “There’s a bureaucratic coup at the Department of Justice and FBI, and somebody needs to look at it.”

Democrats warned against any moves to oust the deputy attorney general, who is overseeing special counsel’s Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

“Under no circumstances should Rod Rosenstein resign,” tweeted Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee. “This would place the Mueller investigation in even greater jeopardy. Rosenstein should continue to do his job, protect the independence of the DOJ, and if the president intends to obstruct justice, force Trump to fire him.”

Other Democrats said it doesn’t matter whether Mr. Rosenstein is fired or resigns — either would be a hindrance to the Mueller probe.

Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said his panel must be ready to hold a hearing to get evidence from Mr. Rosenstein.

“Mr. Rosenstein’s removal would plunge our nation into uncharted territory and pose a serious and profound threat to the continued work of the special counsel, and I would expect the American people to be outraged if President Trump’s extended campaign to interfere with this investigation results in Mr. Rosenstein’s ouster,” he said.

Conservative lawmakers said The New York Times report underscores the need for Mr. Trump to declassify Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act records related to former campaign official Carter Page. Mr. Trump was set to release the documents despite Justice Department concerns they will have a negative impact on the Mueller probe. He backed off releasing everything last week.

“The latest reports on Rod Rosenstein underscore the desperate need for transparency at the DOJ,” tweeted Rep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican. “Release the documents. Declassify everything. Stop the games and show Americans the truth about this Russia investigation.”

Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation into Russian meddling, leaving Mr. Rosenstein in charge of the investigation.

Should Mr. Rosenstein go, the next in line would be the No. 3 spot at the Justice Department, but it’s been vacant since Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand resigned earlier this year.

Under the Justice Department’s succession plan, Solicitor General Noel Francisco would be next in line.

But some analysts say he might not be the best choice. Mr. Francisco has said little about the special counsel investigation, but has suggested federal political corruption investigations have overreached.

He also accused former FBI Director James B. Comey of using “kid gloves” in the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state.

4263,4263,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/sep/21/rosenstein-may-have-secretly-taped-trump-report/,Right,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last year talked about secretly recording President Trump and discussed having Cabinet members invoke the 25th Amendment to remove him from office, The New York Times reported Friday.

The Times article said Mr. Rosenstein pushed for these practices in spring 2017, just after Mr. Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey. Mr. Rosenstein reportedly became concerned because the president had allegedly leaked classified information to Russians, asked Mr. Comey for a loyalty pledge and demanded the Justice Department end an investigation into a senior aide, the New York Times reported.

In addition, Mr. Rosenstein was surprised to learn Mr. Trump used a memo he had written criticizing Mr. Comey’s handling of the Clinton investigation as justification to fire the ex-FBI director. That made Mr. Rosenstein angry, because he was widely criticized for the memo and felt it harmed his reputation, according to the report.

The Times cited several sources saying Mr. Rosenstein made remarks about secretly recording Mr. Trump and invoking the 25th Amendment. Those sources were briefed on events themselves or told about memos written by top FBI officials, including former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, documenting Mr. Rosenstein’s words and actions.

The 25th Amendment can be invoked by Cabinet members to remove the president if he is deemed unfit for office.

Mr. Rosenstein denied the report.

“The New York Times’s story is inaccurate and factually incorrect,” he said in a statement. “I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda. But let me be clear about this: Based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.”

Later Friday night, Mr. Rosenstein issued a more forceful denial.

“I never pursued or authorized recording the President and any suggestion that I have ever advocated for the removal of the President is absolutely false,” the statement said.

A Justice Department spokeswoman provided a statement from an unnamed person who was present when Mr. Rosenstein suggested wearing a wire for a meeting with the president. The person said Mr. Rosenstein made the remark, but did so sarcastically.

It is not clear how determined Mr. Rosenstein, who was just two weeks into his job when he allegedly made the suggestions, was to invoke the 25th Amendment. The Times reported Mr. Rosenstein told Mr. McCabe he could persuade Attorney General Jeff Sessions and John F. Kelly, now the White House chief of staff, to invoke the 25th Amendment.

In a statement, Mr. McCabe’s attorney, Michael Bromwich, said all of his client’s memos have been turned over to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is probing whether Trump associates conspired with Russia to meddle in the 2016 election.

“A set of those memos remained at the FBI at the time of his departure in late 2018,” the statement said. “He has no knowledge of how any member of the media obtained those memos.”

Mr. McCabe’s memos suggested that Mr. Rosenstein regretted the firing of Mr. Comey, the Times reported. In a May 12 memo, Mr. McCabe described Mr. Rosenstein as “upset and emotional,” saying he wished Mr. Comey were still at the FBI, the article said.

The Times also reported Mr. Rosenstein was frustrated that the president wasn’t taking candidate interviews for Mr. Comey seriously and viewed the hiring process as typical of the broader dysfunction at the White House.

Mr. Rosenstein’s alleged discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment follows the publication of an anonymous opinion piece in the Times this month claiming Cabinet officials had discussed using it to remove the president.

Some on the left worry that Mr. Trump will use the story to justify firing Mr. Rosenstein, who has been a frequent target of the president. Mr. Rosenstein, who oversees the Mueller investigation, has long been rumored to be on the chopping block.

Mr. Sessions has recused himself from the Russia probe, so if Mr. Rosenstein goes, Mr. Mueller would be reporting to Solicitor General Noel Francisco. That could create conflict-of-interest concerns since Mr. Francisco has criticized the government for overreach in political corruption cases.

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said firing Mr. Rosenstein would be viewed as an attempt by the president to undermine the Mueller probe.

“This story must not be used as a pretext for the corrupt purpose of firing Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein in order to install an official who will allow the president to interference with the special counsel’s investigation,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement Friday. “Generals Kelly, Mattis and numerous other White House and Cabinet officials have been reported to say things critical of the president without being fired.”

4276,4276,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/sep/25/trump-calls-world-isolate-iran-attacks-globalism/,Right,"President Trump called on world leaders Tuesday to isolate and sanction Iran until the Islamic Republic stops spreading terrorism and working to build a nuclear arsenal.

“We cannot allow the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet’s most dangerous weapons,” Mr. Trump told the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York. “We ask all nations to isolate Iran’s regime as long as its aggression continues.”

The president, who said he won’t meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, withdrew the U.S. from the Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran in May, saying the agreement rewarded Tehran for its bad behavior by lifting economic sanctions.

“Iran’s leaders sow chaos, death and destruction,” Mr. Trump said. “Iran’s leaders plunder the nation’s resources to enrich themselves and to spread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond.The dictatorship used the funds to build nuclear-capable missiles … [and to] finance havoc and slaughter in Syria and Yemen.”

In his second dress to the world body, Mr. Trump struck a more somber tone than last year, when he had warned the U.S. would “destroy” North Korea if it persisted in threatening America.

He said his approach to foreign affairs “has always yielded incredible change.”

“With support from many countries here today, we have engaged with North Korea to replace the specter of conflict with a bold and new push for peace,” the president said, adding that sanctions on Pyongyang remain in place.

But Mr. Trump went after a series of world bodies, including the World Trade Organization, the oil-producing OPEC coalition, and the International Criminal Court, which he said has “no legitimacy.”

“We will never surrender America’s sovereignty to an unaccountable, unelected global bureaucracy,” Mr. Trump said. “We reject the ideology of globalism.”

The president also criticized the U.N. global compact on migration, an effort to resettle more refugees that was embraced by former President Barack Obama. The Trump administration notified the U.N. late last year that the U.S. would not continue with Mr. Obama’s commitment to the initiative.

“The U.S. will not participate in the new global compact on migration,” Mr. Trump said. “Migration should not be governed by an international body unaccountable to our own citizens.”

Human Rights First said Mr. Trump’s rejection of the migration initiative was “yet another indication that this administration will not lead internationally when it comes to solving hard, transnational problems.”

“Even in praising those states, like Jordan, that are bearing the brunt of the global flow of refugees, Trump managed to hide behind the work of others to mask administration policies that are harming the most vulnerable,” said Rob Berschinski, the group’s vice president for policy.

Referring to his tariff war with China, Mr. Trump said the U.S. has lost 3 million manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO.

“We have racked up $13 trillion in trade deficits over last two decades,” he said. “Those days are over. America will never apologize for protecting its citizens. China’s market distortions and the way they deal cannot be tolerated. America will always act in our national interest.”

He said OPEC “is ripping off the rest of the world” with high oil prices.

“We defend these nations for nothing and then they take advantage of us with high oil prices,” Mr. Trump said. “I don’t like it. Nobody should like it. We are not going to put up with it, these horrible prices, much longer.”

The world body greeted Mr. Trump with audible grumbling and some laughter when he began the speech with a victory lap of his domestic economic achievements.

“In less than two years, my administration has accomplished almost more than any administration in the history of our country,” Mr. Trump said. Then he paused as murmurs of apparent disapproval were heard in the massive hall.

“So true,” Mr. Trump ad-libbed. “Didn’t expect that reaction, but that’s OK.”

4282,4282,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/sep/28/dem-senators-flee-committee-protest-kavanaugh-vote/,Right,"Some Democratic senators stormed out of the Judiciary Committee Friday morning after losing their latest bid to derail Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court, protesting what they called a “ram job” ahead of a vote later in the day.

Republicans appear to have the votes to push Judge Kavanaugh through the committee on a party-line vote, and they are moving to speed him to the Senate floor, saying Thursday’s testimony by Christine Blasey Ford alleging a sexual assault 36 years ago was compelling, but ultimately unsubstantiated.

Democrats had demanded that before any committee action senators should hear from a man Ms. Blasey Ford says was in the room for the assault. They tried to force the panel to subpoena that man, Mark Judge.

The committee rejected that on an 11-10 vote, then voted to set a time-certain later in the day for a final vote on the nomination.

At that point a number of the more junior Democratic senators conducted a walkout.

Ms. Blasey Ford told the committee a day before that she remembers Judge Kavanaugh and Mr. Judge pulling her into a room, turning up music and Judge Kavanaugh groping her and trying to strip off her clothes as he stifled her cries for help.

Judge Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegation, saying he doesn’t question that Ms. Blasey Ford suffered an assault but insisting he had nothing to do with it.

All of those Ms. Blasey Ford can remember from the party have denied any memory of an assault, or even of such a party.

Mr. Judge has submitted two declarations, including one Thursday after Ms. Blasey Ford’s testimony, elaborating on his denial.

“I do not recall the events described by Dr. Ford in her testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee today. I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes,” he said.

As their colleagues debated inside the committee room, the Democrats who walked out held an impromptu press conference to complain about the GOP’s handling of the nomination.

“It’s been pushing and pushing and ramming this thing through because they have the power instead of the integrity to say let the American people know what’s about to happen,” said Sen. Kamala Harris, California Democrat.

Ms. Harris, thought to be eyeing a 2020 presidential run, also quickly began to campaign on her walkout, sending out a campaign email touting her move.

“Republicans are rushing Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation with a sham hearing this morning, less than 24 hours after Dr. Ford had the courage to tell her story in front of the entire country. This is a disgrace,” she wrote. “So, instead of sitting through this farce … I walked out.”

4346,4346,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/30/clint-eastwood-adds-hollywood-glitter-to-gop-gathe/,Right,"The worst-kept secret of the Republican National Convention was revealed Thursday evening, when Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood took the stage to lend his magnetism and distinctively gravelly voice on behalf of GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

The 82-year-old actor and two-time Oscar-winning director, who in early August endorsed Mr. Romney, joked with the crowd and mostly ignored his hard-edged persona while warning about the country’s path under another four years of President Obama.

“When someone doesn’t do the job, you’ve got to let him go,” he said to big cheers. “Just remember that.”

He joked about being a Mr. Romney supporter while plying his trade in an industry dominated by Democrats.

“I know what you are thinking. You are thinking, what’s movie tradesman doing out here? You know they are all left-wingers out there, left of (Vladimir) Lenin,” he said.

Mr. Eastwood borrowed a page from an old comedy routine by speaking to an imaginary Mr. Obama sitting in an empty chair next to the podium, asking the faux president; “How do you handle promises that you have made when you were running for election? … what do you say to people?”

The empty chair routine has received mixed reviews from viewers responding on Twitter and other social media tools. But Mr. Eastwood received warm and robust response from the convention hall.

Mr. Eastwood praised Mr. Romney’s entrepreneurial experience, saying, “I think it’s maybe time for a businessman … a stellar businessman.”

Pundits had speculated all week about who would fill the to-be-announced speaking slot that RNC organizers reserved ahead of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Mr. Romney, to round out the convention.

Republicans tried to keep the speaker’s identity under wraps, but Fox News and CNN cited anonymous GOP sources earlier in the day who said it would be Mr. Eastwood.

A self-described libertarian, Mr. Eastwood endorsed 2008 Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain. He expressed support for Mr. Obama after he won the presidency four year ago, but later appeared disillusioned with the Democrat, calling him a “greenhorn.”

Mr. Eastwood appeared in a Chrysler car commercial for a Super Bowl TV ad this year, leading some to think it was an endorsement of Mr. Obama’s bailout of the domestic auto industry.

The Hollywood icon also served as mayor of Carmel, Calif., a wealthy coastal city of 3,700, from 1986 to 1988.

Two unnamed officials told Bloomberg that Mr. Mueller is close to finishing up his conclusions regarding the issues of potential collusion between Russians and the Trump campaign and possible obstruction of justice committed by the president.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has been pressuring the special counsel to wrap up the investigation that has gone on for more than a year, the sources said. However, it is ultimately up to Mr. Rosenstein to choose what is reported to Congress and the public.

Bloomberg reported that Mr. Mueller’s findings won’t be concluded until after the midterms, which could be a critical time for shaking up the Justice Department.

Speculation suggests that President Trump is looking to fire and replace current Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia probe. A new head of the DOJ could alter who Mr. Mueller reports to.

The president denies all allegations.

Mr. Trump has been a harsh critic of the Muller probe, referring to it as a “witch hunt” and “bogus” many times. However, he said in an interview with “60 Minutes” that he has “no intention” of shutting down the investigation.

4388,4388,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/16/ted-cruz-beto-orourke-texas-senate-debate-undersco/,Right,"In their second debate of a surprisingly close race, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and challenger Beto O’Rourke showed flashes of rancor but largely stressed a message tailored to their bases.

The debate offered a contrast to complaints that American campaigns spend too little time on the issues, as both men refrained from personal attacks, while delving into considerable detail about what they hope to accomplish and their distaste for the other’s positions.

Although the debate was supposed to feature more questions on foreign affairs than their first debate last month, with the exception of one question about trade and tariffs, the evening dealt only with domestic matters. The candidates sparred on taxes, U.S. policy on climate change, immigration, judicial philosophy and health care.

Mr. Cruz, the Republican incumbent in the conservative state, told Texans there isn’t a midterm election in the country that offers voters a starker choice in November.

“I want to cut your taxes; Congressman O’Rourke wants to raise your taxes,” Mr. Cruz said in his closing remarks. “I want to keep this economic boom we’re experiencing going. Do we continue on the path we’re on or do we turn back?”

Mr. O’Rourke worked to portray himself as a moderate Democrat who wants universal health care, but is willing and able to work with anyone in Congress regardless of party affiliation.

SEE ALSO: AP FACT CHECK: Ted Cruz, Beto O’Rourke claims cite taxes, immigration

“All you heard from Sen. Cruz is what we should be afraid of,” Mr. O’Rourke said when rebutting the charge that socialized medicine would prove ruinously expensive. “I want people to have more health care.”

When the two first debated, Mr. O’Rourke was well within striking distance of Mr. Cruz, and in fact one poll had given him a 1-point lead. Since then, however, the polls have trended in Mr. Cruz’s favor and he currently holds a 7-point advantage in the RealClearPolitics average of major polls.

Nevertheless, Mr. O’Rourke is still much closer than any other Democrat in a statewide race in the GOP-dominated Lone Star State, and the race has drawn intense national interest as Democrats hope to retake Congress.

While Mr. O’Rourke remained calm and was never rattled, he struck at Mr. Cruz much more forcefully than he had in the first debate.

“You’re all talk and no action,” he said on more than one occasion.

Mr. Cruz repeatedly noted Mr. O’Rourke is on record as favoring the impeachment of President Trump, a position Mr. O’Rourke has carefully avoided saying in either debate.

“He wants two years of a partisan circus in a witch-hunt after the president,” Mr. Cruz said.

“It’s really interesting to hear you talk about ‘a partisan circus’ after your six years in Washington,” Mr. O’Rourke responded, drawing the biggest laugh of the night from the San Antonio audience.

In the first 15 minutes of the hour-long debate, Mr. Cruz twice tied Mr. O’Rourke to positions he holds along with Hillary Clinton — judges and gun rights.

“Sen. Cruz is not going to be honest with you,” Mr. O’Rourke shot back, leading Mr. Cruz to note the more fiery tone his opponent was adopting.

Mr. O’Rourke took heat for voting against a relief bill for Texans dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey last year, but he said he did not regret it, arguing he hoped for a better deal and said the bill didn’t offer the same help other communities had gotten after natural disasters.

Mr. Cruz, meanwhile, was sharply questioned about whether it was hypocritical for him to call the deficit “immoral,” while also voting for tax breaks in 2017. In response, Mr. Cruz noted that government revenues have actually risen since that bill was passed and he blamed the deficit on “out of control spending.”

As anticipated, the stormy confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh at the beginning of October came up more than once. Mr. Cruz said he was proud of the work he had done to get Mr. Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court and told voters that this too presented a sharp contrast, as Mr. O’Rourke would have voted against Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Neil Gorsuch, who won confirmation last year.

Mr. O’Rourke did not dispute he opposed those two justice appointments, but said Mr. Cruz has also made some troubling decisions in backing judges Mr. O’Rourke called profoundly unworthy for seats on lower courts.

While the O’Rourke campaign may have entered the debate with a worse polling position than it had in September, it also arrived in San Antonio right after a record-breaking fundraising quarter that saw him pull in $38.1 million.

The money is a testament to his broad appeal and the fact he wishes to represent all Texans, Mr. O’Rourke said, whereas Mr. Cruz is beholden to PACs and special interest money.

In rebuttal, Mr. Cruz noted much of Mr. O’Rourke’s millions have come from donors outside the state attracted to a brand of liberalism more at home in left-wing coastal pockets than Texas.

“When he has to choose between left-wing national activists and the people of Texas, he goes with the left-wing national activists every time,” Mr. Cruz said. “His are great votes if you are raising money in San Francisco.

4389,4389,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/1/obama-embarking-march-party-convention/,Right,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — President Barack Obama is embarking on a four-day march through battleground states and the storm-battered Gulf Coast in the lead-up to his party’s convention as he seeks to blunt any momentum picked up by Republican rival Mitt Romney.

As his party’s faithful began streaming to Charlotte, N.C. for next week’s convention, Obama was returning to Iowa on Saturday. For his part, Romney looked to capitalize on a newly energized Republican Party fresh from its convention in Tampa, Fla., with a rally in Cincinnati before joining running mate Paul Ryan later in the day in Jacksonville, Fla.

Both campaigns were crisscrossing the country as the race entered September, each day adding to the sense of urgency in a presidential contest that has remained tight since Romney sewed up the nomination in April. Both campaigns recognize that undecided elements of the electorate, including those in about eight key states, will begin to fully assess their options through the conventions and the upcoming debates in the weeks ahead.

“Hold us accountable. Listen to what we have to say,” Romney said in a post-convention rally in Lakeland, Fla., on Friday. “I plan on winning in Florida. We love this country and we’re taking it back.”

Obama’s run-up to the convention will take him through the battleground states of Iowa, Colorado, Ohio and Virginia, four states that he carried in 2008 but remain at the top of Romney’s wish list. He was spending Saturday in suburban Des Moines and Sioux City, Iowa, before heading to Colorado for a Sunday event with college students at the University of Colorado in Boulder.

The Democratic Party’s convention, which starts Tuesday in Charlotte, N.C., will focus more on where voters want their lives to be in the next four years. Obama inherited an economy grappling with a sweeping recession and the pace of the sluggish recovery has become one of Obama’s greatest impediments to re-election.

The coming days, capped by Obama’s speech on Thursday night, will crystalize his re-election pitch: an economy built on ending tax cuts for the rich and putting more effort into education, energy, tax reform and debt reduction. He will call Romney a peddler of failed trickle-down ideas that will hurt the middle class and the needy.

Previewing the convention, Obama campaign aide Stephanie Cutter said the Charlotte gathering wouldn’t be about rallying the base or leveling “petty attacks” but would instead focus on “what we need to do with the country to move us forward, not back.”

“We don’t need to reintroduce the president or reinvent him, as in the case with Mitt Romney,” she said. “Instead, our convention will tell the story of the last four years, how the president made some tough choices to help a country and the economy recover.”

Both sides hope to convey the aura of leadership.

Romney made a quick detour to rain-soaked Louisiana on Friday while Obama joined soldiers at Fort Bliss, Texas, to remind the nation that he ended the war in Iraq. Obama was scheduled to travel to Louisiana on Monday to inspect flood damage in a storm that marked the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina’s devastation.

Romney was capping his convention week in Ohio and Florida, the two most prominent states that remain up for grabs. The former Massachusetts governor’s team said the Tampa, Fla., convention helped him present a clear contrast with Obama and showcase him as a viable alternative to the president on handling the economy.

“What Americans have seen over the last few days is a party and a Republican ticket absolutely committed to addressing the job crisis,” said Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom. “You won’t hear it from the Democrats in Charlotte next week. People have seen a diverse group of individuals who believe very deeply in the American free enterprise system. It’s very different than the negative characterization the Democrats are trying to paint of this convention.”

Television ratings for the final night of the Republican convention were down compared with four years ago. The Nielsen Co. said an estimated 30.3 million viewers watched Thursday night’s coverage over 11 networks compared with more than 40 million over seven networks when John McCain delivered his acceptance speech in 2008.

4399,4399,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/22/cory-booker-bill-to-create-taxpayer-funded-savings/,Right,"Sen. Cory Booker announced a new bill Monday that would establish a taxpayer-funded savings account for every American at birth.

“Today, nearly one in three American families have zero to negative wealth, and it’s hard to get ahead if you begin life behind the starting line,” said Mr. Booker, New Jersey Democrat.

The “American Opportunity Account Act” would essentially create a trust fund for every U.S. citizen born in the U.S. After age 18, the money can be accessed but only used for certain “human and financial capital investments” like buying a house or paying for higher education.

At birth, every child will be given $1,000 deposit into their new “Opportunity” account managed by the Treasury Department. Funds will accrue about 3 percent interest.

Every year, the account will receive an additional deposit, though the amount will vary depending on family income. For example, a child whose family brings in $25,100 or less will get around $2,000 each year.

As the plan targets income inequality, the more money a family makes, the less money is deposited into the account. A family of four that makes over $81,000 would only receive $250 in supplemental payments.

The senator plans on paying for these savings account by increasing taxes, specifically estate and inheritance taxes.

Mr. Booker will formally introduce the bill after the November midterms.

Local leaders say hundreds of people who were part of the migrant caravan have given up their journey and are returning to their homes in Honduras and Guatemala. But perhaps 2,000 others entered Mexico illegally and vowed to cross that country, with the U.S. their goal.

Saying they weren’t content to wait for authorities to process and admit them in smaller groups, they overcame Mexican police who had been deployed to try to prevent the mass entry.

Local news reports said once the migrants broke into Mexico, authorities there did not try to stop them. They left the migrants to prepare for the long journey across the country and to the U.S., where they plan to test the administration’s resolve.

President Trump on Sunday called the caravan a “disgrace” and blamed Democrats, federal courts and the migrants themselves.

“Full efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our [southern] border,” he tweeted. “People have to apply for asylum in Mexico first, and if they fail to do that, the U.S. will turn them away. The courts are asking the U.S. to do things that are not doable!”

Earlier in the weekend, Mr. Trump told reporters that he would send the military — and not just the National Guard — to the border if need be.

That plan would create a number of legal entanglements, though the president’s suggestion of a military option served to underscore his frustration with the situation and the lack of tools the U.S. has to counter determined migrants willing to make the trip and prepared to demand asylum, whether deserving or not.

Mexican authorities have taken a firmer stand against this caravan than the one that traversed the country in the spring — partly at the urging of Mr. Trump, who threatened to cancel the trade deal he is planning with Mexico unless officials block entry.

The Mexican government said the migrants would have to apply for entry, and only those with passports would be granted travel permission. Others who had a case for asylum would be allowed to make it.

Those restrictions were too onerous for many migrants, for whom Mexico is a hurdle to be surmounted as they reach for their real goal of taking jobs in the U.S. or reuniting with family already in the country — usually illegally.

The caravan began in San Pedro Sula, a Honduran city known as one of the most violent places in the world. It grew steadily as it made its way through Honduras and Guatemala to as many as 5,000 people by some estimates.

Caravan members say they are fleeing gang violence at home and looking for jobs in the U.S. — neither of which has traditionally been enough reason to win asylum on its own.

But thanks to court rulings and generous U.S. laws, it’s easy to make an unworthy claim, and migrants making those claims are usually released into the interior of the U.S., where they disappear into the shadows with an estimated 11 million other illegal immigrants.

Mr. Trump has been complaining about that situation for months. His administration has suggested several changes, including holding illegal immigrants until they can be deported and allowing bogus asylum claims to be denied at a quicker pace.

Those proposals have not gotten traction among congressional Democrats, who view those changes as anti-immigrant.

Migration is just as controversial in Mexico, where President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he will ask Mr. Trump to pony up more money to try to build Central American society and create jobs in Mexico, hoping to stem the flow of people to the U.S.

He said the migrants’ rights must be protected as they break into Mexico and head north.

Amnesty International also called on Latin American governments to let people enter and apply for protections.

“The Mexican government should put the human rights of the caravan members at the heart of the response and not let the U.S. Trump administration’s pressure prevent it from fulfilling its international obligations,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, the organization’s director for the region.

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen warned Sunday that the illegal immigrant caravan could be exploited by the cartels that control most of the illegal flow of people through Latin America.

The ease of entering the U.S. is a selling point for the cartels, which control the drug and human smuggling routes and require payment of a “mafia fee” just to cross the U.S.-Mexico boundary line.

Court records show that fee typically runs from $1,000 to $2,000. That doesn’t include thousands of dollars in other fees that cover foot guides, drivers, stash houses and the rest of the illegal journey.

“While we closely monitor the caravan crisis, we must remain mindful of the transnational criminal organizations and other criminals that prey on the vulnerabilities of those undertaking the irregular migration journey,” Ms. Nielsen said in a statement Sunday.

She repeated U.S. backing for the governments that have tried to stem the flow.

“We fully support the efforts of Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, as they seek to address this critical situation and ensure a safer and more secure region,” the secretary said.

4410,4410,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/23/donald-trump-says-hes-nationalist-american-prosper/,Right,"President Trump said Tuesday he’s a proud “nationalist” for American superiority and rejected a reporter’s suggestion that the word is a sneaky signal to white supremacists.

“I’m somebody that loves our country, when I say I’m a nationalist,” Mr. Trump said at his desk in the Oval Office. “I’m proud of our country.”

The president first embraced the term at a huge campaign rally Monday night in Houston, where the crowd roared its approval.

After the rally, CNN host Don Lemon commented on the president’s use of the term: “It is a favorite of the ‘alt-right’ and is loaded with nativist and racial undertones.”

When Mr. Trump met with reporters at the White House on Tuesday, CNN reporter Jim Acosta confronted the president about his use of the word.

“There is a concern that you are sending coded language, or a dog whistle to some Americans out there, that what you really mean is you’re a white nationalist,” Mr. Acosta said.

“I’ve never even heard that. I cannot imagine that,” Mr. Trump replied.

Asked by Mr. Acosta if he had never heard of white nationalists, the president corrected the reporter.

“I’ve never heard that theory about being a nationalist,” he said. “I’ve heard them all. And I am a nationalist. It’s a word that hasn’t been used too much. I think it should be brought back.

“I don’t like it when Germany’s paying 1 percent of [gross domestic product] to NATO, and we’re paying 4.3 percent. That’s not fair. I don’t like it, as an example, when we’re protecting Europe, and we’re paying for almost the entire cost of NATO. We have great respect for those countries. But on top of that, I don’t like it when they put up barriers to our farmers, where our farmers cannot sell into Europe.”

The president is hitting the European Union with tariffs on imported goods, seeking leverage to make a more favorable trade agreement for U.S. producers.

“I am very proud of our country,” Mr. Trump said. “We cannot continue to allow ourselves to be duped on military and also duped on trade. All I want for our country is to be treated well, to be treated with respect. In that sense, I am absolutely a nationalist and I’m proud of it.”

Earlier, in a White House meeting with county officials from California, Alaska and Hawaii, Mr. Trump talked about his renegotiated trade deal with Mexico and Canada to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. He again raised the concept of “nationalism” in terms of the U.S. getting a fair deal, saying of the Clinton-era NAFTA, “We still have empty factories all over the place from that devastation.”

“You’re not going to have companies leaving anymore,” he said of the new trade agreement. “They have a disincentive to leave. I don’t want them to leave.”

“Call me a nationalist if you’d like, but I don’t want companies leaving, I don’t want them firing all their people, going to another country, making a product, sending it into our country tax-free, no charge, no tariff, no nothing. And in the meantime, we end up with empty plants, unemployment all over the place. We end up with nothing. So those deals are not happening anymore.”

4417,4417,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/24/democrats-media-blame-donald-trump-pipe-bombs/,Right,"The list of people targeted with suspected pipe bombs reads like President Trump’s Twitter feed: Hillary and Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, John Brennan, Maxine Waters, George Soros, CNN, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Eric Holder and George Soros, all prominent Democratic critics of the president.

Democrats and the media swiftly blamed Mr. Trump for stirring up public anger against those top liberals, saying his constant mocking tweets and barbs at campaign rallies likely prompted an unstable person to mail the devices.

“The president, and especially the White House press secretary, should understand their words matter. Thus far, they have shown no comprehension of that,” CNN President Jeff Zucker said.

Others pointed out that neither party has a monopoly on civility and that leftists have been routinely confronting Republican officials in public with hostility and threats.

“We’ve seen calls for incivility from both sides of the political spectrum,” former FBI and CIA official Jeff Beatty said on CNN. “If people are keeping score at home, so far the only people who have had blood spilled are the Republicans.”

He was referring to members of the House Republicans’ baseball team, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who was shot during practice in June 2017.

SEE ALSO: Trump calls on voters to ‘settle our disagreements … peacefully at the ballot box’

“I have experienced firsthand the effects of political violence and am committed to using my voice to speak out against it wherever I can,” said Mr. Scalise, who almost died from his wounds.

Referring to the pipe bombs, Mr. Scalise tweeted, “These attempted attacks that have been made are beyond criminal, they are acts of pure terror. Violence and terror have no place in our politics or anywhere else in our society.”

At the White House, Mr. Trump called for civility and said federal authorities had started a major investigation.

“In these times, we have to unify,” Mr. Trump said. “We have to come together and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.”

Team Clinton wasn’t buying it. Former Hillary Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines tweeted at the president, “This is on you.”

“With every fiber of your rotten being you’ve incited & condoned hate,” Mr. Reines posted. “Never in 643 days have you discouraged people from unleashing the violence inside them. Your very existence requires anger & fear. You need it like normal people need oxygen.”

Mrs. Clinton said the president and Republicans don’t deserve civility from Democrats.

“You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about,” Mrs. Clinton said two weeks ago. “That’s why I believe, if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that’s when civility can start again. But until then, the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength.”

Ms. Waters, California Democrat, called on Americans to “absolutely harass” Trump administration officials in public last summer in the wake of a furor over the separation of illegal migrant families at the Mexican border.

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday that they “listened with great interest” as Mr. Trump called for unity and condemned the bombings — but they added that those words aren’t good enough.

“President Trump’s words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence,” the two Democratic leaders said in a joint statement.

“Time and time again, the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and his actions: expressing support for the congressman who body-slammed a reporter, the neo-Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville, his supporters at rallies who get violent with protesters, dictators around the world who murder their own citizens, and referring to the free press as the enemy of the people,” they said.

CNN host Chris Cuomo, brother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, said even after CNN’s offices were evacuated because of the mailed bombs, “There’s still somebody walking by saying, ‘Cuomo, communist,’ ‘CNN communist’ — where do you think he got that? Where do you think that language came from?

“Nobody ever said that to me pre-Trump,” Mr. Cuomo said. “The ugliness and the invective that comes out of the White House, and specifically from the president, matters. I’m not saying it’s directly responsible for what happened today. It doesn’t need to be. There are other reasons, there are other pressures that could have led somebody to want to do something like this. But it matters. When [the president] had a rally [Monday night] calling out these same kinds of people who were targeted and the media, you can’t think it has no effect.”

Mr. Beatty, who investigated the anthrax attacks on Congress and the media in 2001, cautioned that the pipe bomb investigation was just getting started. He said investigators will examine the bomber’s motive and why none of the devices exploded, among other questions.

“Why didn’t they go off, and who benefits from this?” he asked.

Radio host Rush Limbaugh and other conservatives suggested that Democrats could be behind the mailings, hoping that Mr. Trump and other Republicans will get blamed. Mr. Limbaugh said Democrats had begun “to see their mob tactics backfired; early voting has Republicans voting in greater numbers.”

“What can Democrat operatives do?” he said on his show Wednesday. “Send out bombs to show Republicans have mobsters on the right side as well? Surely that will convince people. I wouldn’t put it past the crazy nuts on the left.”

Carolyn Lukensmeyer, executive director of the National Institute for Civil Discourse, said the attempted bombings “are a clear sign that our civil discourse is so off track that it is becoming a national security threat.”

“There could be no stronger evidence that our words matter and have consequences,” she said. “When we demonize our political opponents and portray them as dangers to our country, we’re inevitably inviting these dangerous overreactions. It’s imperative that everyone take immediate steps to de-escalate our discourse before someone gets hurt.”

The blame was heaped on Mr. Trump as he was grappling with the political and diplomatic fallout from the slaying of a Saudi Arabian journalist at the hands of Saudi operatives in Istanbul. Some of Mr. Trump’s critics contend that his anti-media rhetoric emboldened the Saudi royal family to have the dissident journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, killed. The president rejects that accusation.

A House Democratic leader, Rep. David N. Cicilline of Rhode Island, noted that Mr. Trump last week “applauded a Republican congressman for physically attacking a reporter who was doing his job.”

The president said he has the support of both parties in condemning political violence.

“This egregious conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans,” Mr. Trump said. “And I just want to thank everybody for their understanding. We’re extremely angry, upset, unhappy about what we witnessed this morning, and we will get to the bottom of it.”

4419,4419,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/25/pentagon-deploy-more-troops-us-mexico-border/,Right,"The Trump administration will send about 800 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border ahead of the illegal immigrant caravan, a defense official confirmed Thursday, following through on President Trump’s pledge.

Most of the troops will be active-duty Army soldiers who specialize in support operations such as logistics and engineering. Medical staff also will be part of the deployment, with an Air Force contingent assisting in aerial evacuations.

They will join more than 2,000 National Guard troops already in the region, deployed in April as a previous caravan was testing the border.

It was not clear Thursday what operational gains will come from adding active-duty troops to the mix, but it makes good on a declaration Mr. Trump made over the past week that he wanted to mobilize the regular military, not just the Guard.

“You’re going to see a very secure border. You just watch,” Mr. Trump told supporters at a political rally in Wisconsin Wednesday night. “The military is ready. They’re all set.”

Turning to Pentagon brass to solve problems has been a theme for Mr. Trump during his time in office.

The Guard troops he asked for earlier this year are helping with surveillance to detect illegal crossings and with clerical and mechanical work, with a goal of freeing border agents and officers to get into the field.

Guard troops are not involved in patrolling or arresting illegal immigrants or smugglers.

From the description officials have given of the latest deployment, it does not appear that will change.

That makes it unlikely the infusion of personnel will deter the migrant caravan streaming north through Mexico.

While public estimates say the caravan has at least 5,000 people, Mexican officials put it closer to 3,630, most of them from Honduras.

They left their home country two weeks ago and made it to Guatemala. Some broke into Mexico, while others are still in Guatemala trying to figure out their path forward.

Guatemalan officials rescued seven unaccompanied children who were being smuggled inside the migrant caravan, Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, reported Thursday.

The group said the smugglers have been arrested and the children have been taken into custody by authorities and are being given welfare checks.

“This caravan deal presents an opportunity for incredible criminal activity,” said Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch’s director of investigations, who returned from Central America, where he spent time tracking the caravan.

He said he saw among the caravan men with Gothic-script “MS” tattoos, which would likely make them members of the violent MS-13 gang that Mr. Trump has said infiltrated the caravan.

He also saw what Border Patrol agents refer to as “special interest aliens” — those from countries outside the usual set of nations that send economic migrants.

Mr. Trump has said Middle Easterners in the caravan could be trouble.

If the caravan follows the lead of previous migrants from Central America, many will make asylum claims in the U.S. If they pass their initial screening, they will be admitted and likely released into the community to await a full hearing. Most will then disappear into the shadows, not bothering to follow through on their cases, authorities said during the April caravan.

The latest announcement of a troop deployment angered liberal activists, who called it a “desperate political stunt.”

“All Americans should be concerned about Trump’s increasingly frantic attempts to stir up animosity and incite violence against people of color, the media and his political opponents,” said Heidi Hess, co-director of CREDO Action.

Republicans, though, said the president was right to stiffen America’s response to the caravan.

“President Trump’s use of military force to protect America’s southern border is mandated by the commander in chief’s oath of office and constitutional duties,” said Rep. Mo Brooks, Alabama Republican.

In a series of tweets Tuesday afternoon, the rap star who proudly wore a MAGA cap and stole the show from President Trump at the White House said he wanted nothing to do with the campaign to convince blacks to exit the Democratic Party and was disassociating himself from politics.

He specifically criticized Candace Owens, the black conservative pushing the “Blexit” campaign who touted Mr. West’s involvement in designing clothing for it at the weekend.

“I introduced Candace to the person who made the logo and they didn’t want their name on it so she used mine. I never wanted any association with Blexit. I have nothing to do with it,” he said.

“My eyes are now wide open and now realize I’ve been used to spread messages I don’t believe in. I am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative !!!” the rap star said.

He prepared the way for his distancing himself from Ms. Owens, though, by outlining a political platform and writing that “I would like to thank my family, loved ones, and community for supporting my ACTUAL beliefs and my vision for a better world.”

That platform didn’t, on the surface, seem all that MAGA-compliant.

“I support creating jobs and opportunities for people who need them the most, I support prison reform, I support common-sense gun laws that will make our world safer,” he wrote in one tweet.

Mr. West continued: “I support those who risk their lives to serve and protect us and I support holding people who misuse their power accountable. I believe in love and compassion for people seeking asylum and parents who are fighting to protect their children from violence and war.”

The justices, without comment, refused to hear the case.

State Republicans had asked the high court to overturn a map approved by the state Supreme Court, which had tossed out a 2011 congressional map written by the state legislature under GOP. That map had been very favorable to Republicans, splitting GOP-leaning voters among many districts while packing Democrats into relatively fewer seats to maximize the amount of seats Republicans won.

Despite registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans by more than 800,000 voters, Republicans consistently won 13 of the 18 congressional districts under that map.

The state Supreme Court ruled that map was an illegal gerrymander and, after the legislature and governor deadlocked and a replacement, the courts wrote their own map they said was fair.

4481,4481,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jan/9/gavin-newsom-donald-trump-feud-threatens-fema-cali/,Right,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom kicked off his first two days in office by calling the White House incompetent, decrying the proposed border wall with Mexico, vowing “sanctuary to all who seek it,” and then asking President Trump to double spending on wildfire prevention.

That series of events may or may not have spurred Mr. Trump’s threat Wednesday to cut off FEMA funding for California wildfire relief, but it did set the tone for what could be a rocky relationship.

“I think at this point most Americans understand how the president operates, and it’s entirely conceivable he’s having a knee-jerk reaction to what our new governor said,” said longtime California Democratic strategist Darry Sragow.

“He has a habit of sticking his finger in the eye of Californians, and he just did it again,” said Mr. Sragow, who runs the California Target Book.

Mr. Trump sparked alarm among Californians by tweeting that he had ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency to withhold emergency-relief funding presumably related to the state’s disastrous November wildfires, led by the Camp Fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise.

“Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!” he tweeted.

California House Republicans responded by agreeing that forest management was a problem in the regulatory-heavy Golden State but also promised to deliver on disaster relief for wildfire-ravaged communities.

“Although I share the president’s great frustration with California’s choking regulations from the stranglehold environmental groups have on the state, as well as the inaction on federal lands up until this administration, the immediate problem for fire victims is the first need,” said Rep. Doug LaMalfa, the California Republican who represents Paradise.

“[T]hreats to FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) funding are not helpful and will not solve the longer-term forest management regulatory problems,” he said.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he would offer an amendment to this week’s Democratic spending bills “to increase money for forest management that will help prevent and reduce the devastation from wildfires that we saw a couple of months ago.”

“The president’s message shows clear frustration about an important issue that has not been resolved — how we deal with addressing wildfires in California going forward so that more lives aren’t at risk,” said Mr. McCarthy, who represents a Central Valley district.

CAL FIRE Local 2881 president-elect Tim Edwards said, “Now is the time for us to work collaboratively for solutions, not make unfair, dangerous assessments.”

Whether Mr. Trump can legally withdraw FEMA funding was unclear. He has already declared a national emergency over the Camp Fire, which triggered a federal relief response, although he could refuse future requests by the governor for disaster declarations.

FEMA responded to requests for clarification with the statement, “Due to the federal funding hiatus, we are not able to respond to general press queries,” adding that its service to protect human life and property were not affected by the shutdown.

Democrats blasted the president’s tweet.

“Disasters and recovery are no time for politics,” Mr. Newsom told the president.

“I’m already taking action to modernize and manage our forests and emergency responses,” Mr. Newsom tweeted. “The people of CA — folks in Paradise — should not be victims to partisan bickering.”

He pointed out that he and the Democratic governors of Oregon and Washington sent a letter Tuesday asking Mr. Trump to increase twofold spending on forest management and wildfire prevention in their states’ federal forests, saying those budgets have recently remained flat.

About one-third of California is forested, and about 60 percent of those woodlands fall under federal jurisdiction, prompting debates over whether federal or state management policies — or both — are to blame for the disastrous wildfires.

At a press conference in Placer County, Mr. Newsom described the letter as a request that the president work with the governors. “Rather than talking past each other, talking down to each other, maybe we can start partnering and doing the work that needs to be done to address our forest health and management.”

Mr. Newsom’s tone was considerably less genial during his inaugural address Monday, when he positioned California as a foil for the Trump administration, blasting its “corruption and incompetence” and bemoaning “a wall that should never be built.”

He also drew headlines for proposing to increase health-care coverage for illegal immigrants by increasing the cut-off age from 19 to 26.

Mr. Newsom’s predecessor was no Trump fan, but former Gov. Jerry Brown praised the president for his disaster response, saying “he’s got our back,” even though the two disagreed on whether overgrown, ill-managed forests or climate change are more to blame for driving the blazes.

Mr. Sragow chalked up the contrast to the different personalities and management styles of the two Democratic governors, saying Mr. Newsom “has been willing to be more visible and more outspoken.”

“I think they’re different people. In general, Jerry Brown has been more likely to hold his fire, and I think that’s a function of his personality and experience in office,” Mr. Sragow said. “And Gov. Newsom may feel emboldened because of the November election.”

California Republicans were hit hard in November, losing seven of their 14 House seats, and Mr. Trump’s threat could make their political prospects even worse.

Of course, the reverse also applies. Mr. Trump may feel like he has little to lose in taking on Mr. Newsom, given the GOP’s bleak prospects in California.

“It would be perfectly reasonable for our new governor to feel he’s on very solid ground with his voters in being more open in opposing the president,” Mr. Sragow said.

With no negotiations set for resolving the 20-day-old partial government shutdown, Mr. Trump traveled to a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas, to meet with agents and highlight the immigration and trafficking crisis. He said the collapse of talks with Democratic leaders a day earlier has nearly persuaded him of the need to declare an emergency.

“I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency,” the president said. “If this doesn’t work out, probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely. I’m prepared for anything.”

At the Capitol, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters that the president “is going to get this done one way or the other.”

“There’s no wall, there’s no deal,” the vice president said.

An attempt by a small group of GOP senators to strike an agreement trading wall funding for full legalization of “Dreamers” here under the Obama-era DACA program fell apart Thursday afternoon.

Democrats continued to push for an immediate reopening of the federal government, saying they won’t negotiate until nine shuttered departments are back in business.

House Democrats passed two bills Thursday to reopen some of those departments, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked them in his chamber, saying Mr. Trump would have vetoed them anyway.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Mr. Trump of creating a “distraction” from his “other problems” — an apparent reference to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

“I don’t even know if the president wants the wall. He wants a debate on the wall,” she said.

For his part, Mr. Trump flew about 1,700 miles Thursday to the Mexican border to show that he wants a wall.

Following up on his address to the nation about a border crisis, the president met with Border Patrol agents and other law-enforcement officials in Texas.

During a roundtable discussion, Mr. Trump noted that Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick had suggested providing the state with “a relatively small amount of money, and they’ll build a wall themselves.”

“I thought that was not the worst idea I’ve ever heard,” he told Mr. Patrick. “Although I still think I can do it cheaper than you. I do like the idea. We’re going to look at a couple of ways of doing it, where you guys get [the wall] up. I like that idea. We’ll take a look.”

The president also heard from relatives of two law-enforcement officers killed by illegal immigrants — police Cpl. Ronil Singh of Newman, California, and Border Patrol Agent Javier Vega Jr. of Texas.

Marie Vega recounted how her son was shot and killed during a robbery while on a family fishing outing in 2014.

“A parent should not have to bury their child,” she told the president. “We need the wall. We need tougher judges.”

Reggie Singh spoke of his brother’s 5-month-old son having to grow up without a father after the corporal was shot and killed on the day after Christmas, allegedly by an illegal immigrant he pulled over in a traffic stop.

“What my family is going through right now, I do not want any other law-enforcement family to go through,” Mr. Singh told the president.

Others joining the president were Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, Texas Republicans; Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen; Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan; and the head of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Lt. Gen. Todd T. Semonite.

The Army Corps would likely be in charge of wall building should Mr. Trump claim emergency powers, and the White House directed them to examine supplemental funding to see what money could be used if Mr. Trump declares a national emergency.

And the president pushed back on critics who say he’d be circumventing Congress, saying Capitol Hill approved the National Emergencies Act that would be the basis for his claims.

He said declaring an emergency would be “the easy route for me,” and said he hasn’t done it because he would still like to get a deal with Congress.

The president blamed Democrats for the partial government shutdown, rebutting their criticism that he has “manufactured” a crisis on the border to fulfill his 2016 campaign pledge to build a wall. Mr. Trump reiterated that their opposition is geared toward his re-election bid in 2020.

“The Democrats don’t care about crime. They’ve been taken over by a group of young people who, frankly, in some cases, I’ve been watching, I actually think they’re crazy. They have been taken over by a group of people that don’t care about gangs, they don’t care about human trafficking and drugs, they don’t care about anything. I tell you what, they have gone crazy,” he said.

The White House says it’s made two different offers to Democrats, one in the early days of the shutdown and another after last weekend’s work at Camp David.

Mr. Pence said the first was rejected, and there’s been no movement on the second.

That latest deal calls for combining $5.7 billion in border wall money with more immigration detention beds and more Border Patrol agents, reviving a program to allow children to apply for asylum from Central America, and spending more money on medical care for migrants in U.S. custody and for screening traffic coming through official border crossings.

Those last three are Democratic wish-list items.

“It’s hard for the American people to accept a party that won’t even negotiate an agreement over border security is committed to border security,” Mr. Pence said.

Democrats say they’re willing to talk, but won’t actually negotiate as long as part of the government is shut down.

Mrs. Pelosi also said Wednesday’s White House meeting, where she refused any talk of wall money and Mr. Trump walked out, was staged.

“I think it was a set-up so he could walk out,” Mrs. Pelosi told reporters.

Opponents say Mr. Trump’s possible declaration of a national emergency would be met with an immediate court challenge to block his authority to build a wall unilaterally. He said the White House counsel’s office has advised him that such a move is “100 percent” legal.

4506,4506,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jan/13/trump-rules-letting-employers-opt-out-birth-contro/,Right,"A federal judge on Sunday partially blocked President Trump’s push to let a wide range of employers ignore an Obamacare-related rule requiring them to insure birth control in their health plans.

The preliminary injunction from U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam applies to 13 states, plus D.C.

Judge Gilliam, presiding in California, noted strong arguments on both sides of the debate over former President Barack Obama’s mandate, which devout business owners and religiously affiliated nonprofit employers have blasted as a violation of their faith or moral beliefs.

However, the judge was sympathetic to women who work for objecting employees and might lose access to affordable contraceptives.

The blue-state plaintiffs “face potentially dire public health and fiscal consequences from the implementation of the final rules,” the judge wrote.

Judge Gilliam, an appointee of President Barack Obama, enjoined the new rules in Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington state and the nation’s capital.

Federal courts blocked Mr. Trump’s attempts to get around the mandate earlier this year, saying they were hastily written, so the administration finalized new rules in November.

The rules, set to take effect Monday, allow closely held businesses and faith-based charities and universities employers to refuse to insure forms of birth control they find objectionable by claiming “sincerely held religious beliefs” or a moral objection.

Objectors would not be required to fill out on opt-form — a requirement that Mr. Obama imposed, leading to dragged-out litigation that reached a deadlocked Supreme Court.

Today the court battles are coming from the other side, with civil-liberties groups saying Mr. Trump has made it too easy for employers to deny coverage.

The Health and Human Services Department disagrees, saying it expects no more than 200 employers to come forward a claim the latest version of the exemption, which only requires firms to notify their workers if their health policy suddenly drops contraceptive coverage.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is leading the court challenge, says the damage will be far more extensive.

“It’s 2019, yet the Trump Administration is still trying to roll back women’s rights,” he tweeted. “Our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law!”

“It hurts me to say it but mainstream media has truly lost its credibility,” said the president. “This is a very bad thing for our country.”

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s office rebuked the BuzzFeed report Friday that it had evidence Mr. Trump directed his former personal attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress, a serious crime and potentially impeachable offense.

The pushback from Mr. Mueller’s Russia probe came after breathless coverage of the BuzzFeed story by major newspapers and TV news.

“It was a disgrace to our country. It was a disgrace to journalism,” said Mr. Trump. “I think the coverage in the mainstream media was disgraceful.”

Mr. Trump made the remarks to reporters as he left the White House for Dover Air Force Base for the return of four Americans killed in Syria.

Cohen confirmed the revelations on Twitter Thursday morning and implicated the president.

As for the @WSJ article on poll rigging, what I did was at the direction of and for the sole benefit of @realDonaldTrump @POTUS. I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn’t deserve it. — Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) January 17, 2019

John Gauger, owner of RedFinch Solutions LLC, told the Wall Street Journal that in 2015 he went to Trump Tower to collect the $50,000 that Cohen promised to pay him for trying to tip the polls in Mr. Trump’s favor. However, he received a blue Walmart bag with about $12,000 to $13,000 in cash and a boxing glove.

Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, denied to the Wall Street Journal that he paid in cash and said the money was given by check.

SEE ALSO: Michael Cohen blames Donald Trump for alleged poll-rigging in 2016

According to the report, Mr. Gauger was asked in 2014 to manipulate the results of a CNBC poll for the top U.S. business leaders, but he was unsuccessful in getting Mr. Trump into the top 100. The next year, he was asked to influence a Drudge Report ranking potential Republican primary picks, where Mr. Trump came in fifth.

Mr. Gauger told the newspaper that he performed other services for Cohen, unrelated to the president, and said Cohen paid for some.

One project was to create the “@WomenForCohen” account, which still exists on Twitter. Its bio describes Cohen as “strong, pit bull, sex symbol, no nonsense, business oriented, and ready to make a difference!”

In 2017, Cohen requested a $50,000 reimbursement for “tech services” from the Trump Tower Organization, federal prosecutors noted in a charging document they filed in August 2018.

Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, bank fraud and lying to Congress. None of the charges are connected to his dealings with RedFinch.

The Trump Organization did not give a comment to the Wall Street Journal, but Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, told the newspaper that Cohen is a thief.

“If one thing has been established, it’s that Michael Cohen is completely untrustworthy,” the former New York City mayor said.

4519,4519,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/6/hurt-six-things-clinton-did-undermine-obama-dnc/,Right,"OPINION:

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Bill Clinton’s typically epic speech last night certainly was the most detailed, calculated and complete attack on the Republican agenda that we have heard during the entire campaign. It also was the most unreserved and embracing defense of President Obama.

Simply put, no one in the Democratic Party but Bill Clinton is capable of doing what Mr. Clinton did last night. He is without rival the most masterful politician in decades.

But Good Bubba never comes to dinner without Bad Bubba. As hosannas rise from all quarters this morning hailing his gargantuan speech, it is worth noting where he was naughty, where he simply could not contain himself, where he simply could not resist making it a little bit all about him and even twisting the knife a little bit in Mr. Obama.

Here are six ways Mr. Clinton made his big Obama nomination speech all about himself.

1) Throughout the address, he made subtle and not-so-subtle references to the successes of his own term as president. Though he did not mention this explicitly, those successes came from deep compromises he made with Republicans — something that is absent from Mr. Obama’s tenure.

At one point, he said even he — the great Bill Clinton himself — could not have dug the country out of the financial mess Mr. Obama found when he took office.

2) When he dug back through the record of Democratic and Republican presidents going back 52 years to see which side had created more jobs, he said his party created 42 million, compared to just 24 million under GOP presidents. If you are sitting at home without a job, that just pisses you off, and a pissed-off voter is almost certainly not going to be an Obama voter on Election Day.

3) He asked folks if they watched the Republican convention in Tampa.

“I did,” he said. It was a setup for him to excoriate Republican arguments. But it also was a reminder that the White House admitted Mr. Obama did not watch even the GOP speeches. Mr. Obama has become such a hardened and bitter, nasty Beltway partisan that he no longer even listens to the other side.

But not Bubba. He watched and listened. And he even enjoyed it!

4) Mr. Clinton even went so far as to call Republicans “honorable people” who he expects will keep all the commitments they made. What a sad reminder of what a low and caustic figure Mr. Obama has become, a man whose campaign has called Mitt Romney a liar and a felon and refuses to back off claims that he was somehow responsible for a woman dying of cancer.

5) Perhaps the most shocking barb of the night came as Mr. Clinton was lauding Republicans and their convention.

“They looked good, they sounded good,” he said. “They convinced me that they all love their families and their children and were grateful they’d been born in America.”

Really? Giving a speech nominating Mr. Obama to a second term, and Mr. Clinton raises the birther card? At the very least, the line highlights persistent questions about Mr. Obama’s patriotism and whether the first lady really is proud of her country yet.

6) Even as he touted Mr. Obama as a unifying figure in the Democratic party, Mr. Clinton could not help himself but to remind everyone of the long deep scars that remain.

“President Obama appointed several members of his Cabinet even though they supported Hillary in the primary,” he said. “Heck, he even appointed Hillary!”

When Mr. Clinton finally concluded his long speech and the crowd roared to its feet, he waved and thanked and basked in the cheers. Then, the moment scripted to be the most thrilling yet: Out walked Mr. Obama to join Bubba onstage.

But next to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Obama looked small and frail and rigid even though Mr. Clinton is so much older. The poor optics were so sad that even Mr. Clinton noticed and tried balancing it out by bowing deeply to Mr. Obama.

Even then, Mr. Obama still looked as if he should be carrying Mr. Clinton’s bags for him.

4531,4531,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jan/22/supreme-court-allows-trump-administration-transgen/,Right,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed the Trump administration to begin enforcing its policy limiting transgender people’s ability to serve in the military while the broader legal battle plays out in lower courts.

The 5-4 decision allows the Pentagon to bar new recruits who have undergone gender transitions and to limit troops already serving from going through transitions.

Pentagon officials insisted that their policy is not a ban but that the rules are needed to prevent disruptions in training and unit cohesion. The Trump administration will make the same arguments as the case is fought.

“The Department of Defense has the authority to create and implement personnel policies it has determined are necessary to best defend our nation,” said Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department.

LGBT advocates called the ruling a devastating blow to transgender people who may be forced to leave the military and could face stigmatization.

“For more than 30 months, transgender troops have been serving our country openly with valor and distinction, but now the rug has been ripped out from under them, once again,” said Peter Renn, counsel for the LGBT advocacy groups Lambda Legal. “We will redouble our efforts to send this discriminatory ban to the trash heap of history where it belongs.”

The justices divided along ideological lines, with the five Republican-appointed members ruling that the Trump policy could take effect and the four Democratic appointees saying they would have kept the injunction in place to block the Trump policy.

Neither side explained its decision, but the arguments have been playing out in courtrooms across the country, with judges in California, Maryland, Washington state and the District of Columbia issuing injunctions blocking President Trump and his team.

The legal blockade began to crumble this month when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit lifted one of those injunctions. That panel of judges said that while it was too early to say whether the Trump policy was legal, it was based on the findings of military officials and medical professionals and deserved deference while the case proceeded.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals maintained the injunctions in the California and Washington state cases. It was those that the Supreme Court overturned Tuesday.

LGBT advocates said they expect the Maryland judge’s injunction to also fall in light of the justices’ action.

For decades, transgender people or those with gender dysphoria generally were excluded from signing up for the military. Those already serving who sought gender transition were prohibited from continuing their service.

Ashton Carter, a defense secretary in the Obama administration, changed the policy in 2016. He announced that the military would be open to transgender recruits and would allow transitions by those already in the military.

The policy hadn’t taken effect when Mr. Trump began his presidency, and he announced on Twitter that he was reversing it.

Then-Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis followed up with a policy severely limiting transgender people’s service.

Recruits would be allowed to join if they were deemed “clinically stable” in their preferred sex for 18 months and did not suffer from marked stress or impairment tied to their selected gender during certain scenarios tied to military service.

Mr. Mattis said the panel of experts who he had review the situation concluded that there were “substantial risks associated with allowing the accession and retention of individuals with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria and require, or have already undertaken, a course of treatment to change their gender.”

He said exempting those people from mental health and physical standards could undermine readiness and disrupt unit cohesion.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called the high court’s move “deeply disappointing.”

“This decision creates unnecessary confusion for transgender individuals serving in the military,” she said.

Aaron Belkin, director at the liberal research group Palm Center, said the military should defy the high court’s ruling.

“The Defense Department should not reinstate the transgender ban because it would undermine readiness, cause significant disruptions and uncertainty, deprive the military of much-needed talent, and wreak havoc with the lives and careers of the 14,700 transgender troops bravely protecting our nation’s security,” he said.

Jessica Maxwell, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon, said the Department of Defense treats transgender people with respect and dignity.

“DOD’s proposed policy is based on professional military judgment and will ensure that the U.S. Armed Forces remain the most lethal and combat effective fighting force in the world,” Ms. Maxwell said.

Social conservative groups applauded the high court’s decision, saying the military shouldn’t be “used as a taxpayer-financed biology experiment” by LGBT activists.

“We are extremely gratified with this victory and will continue to fight to prevent the mission of our military — to defend the United States — from being hijacked by LGBT groups to advance their dangerous gender ideology agenda,” Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, said in an email to supporters.

4536,4536,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jan/24/senate-rejects-trump-immigration-shutdown-bill/,Right,"The Senate on Thursday rejected President Trump’s immigration compromise to grant temporary legal status to 1 million migrants and allocate money for his border wall, then rejected Democrats’ alternative to reopen the government without any new border money.

The dueling votes left the month-old shutdown stalemate no closer to a conclusion, though they did give a sense for which side has the upper hand.

Neither proposal achieved the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster, but the Democratic plan did better, getting 52 to the Trump plan’s 50 votes.

At least a half-dozen senators, mostly on the Republican side, voted for both plans, desperate for any solution to the shutdown. Meanwhile a couple of Republicans voted against both options.

Senate Majority Whip John Thune said the GOP defections weren’t all that surprising, and that everyone just wants to see the shutdown end in some way.

“I actually think these votes put the pressure on both sides to meet,” said Mr. Thune, South Dakota Republican. “I think you’re going to see our leaders sit down in an earnest way.”

Democrats framed the votes as a test of support for Mr. Trump, and on that count, it’s clear he has more work to do.

“We all know it was the president who threw us into this turmoil,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer.

Republican leaders had said Mr. Trump’s plan was a reasonable offer and even if Democrats didn’t agree with all the details, overcoming the filibuster would have been a sign they were willing to negotiate.

They said another punt on spending for two weeks made no sense.

“My view is we should fix the problem now through the end of the fiscal year and not go through this exercise again,” said Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican. “It would take about 30 minutes for fair-minded people of goodwill to work this out.”

Senators said the next steps are now unclear.



“I don’t know what’s going to happen next - nobody knows,” said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, Alabama Republican.

Republicans also said Mr. Trump’s plan was the only one he’s willing to sign, since the White House has threatened to veto bills that don’t include border wall money.

Democrats, though, said the Senate should test the president’s resolve and send him legislation to reopen the government.

They have said border security negotiations can come later — though they’ve sent mixed signals about whether they would be willing to negotiate over his $5.7 billion wall-building plan.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called walls immoral and ruled out any discussions, but other top Democrats have at least seemed open to talks. Still, Democrats are mostly united in saying they want the government to reopen before they’ll engage in talks.

“We’re more than willing to have a conversation and develop a compromise as it relates to border security and negotiations,” said Sen. Brian Schatz, Hawaii Democrat. “But our bright line is that all of those discussions have to happen after the government is open.”

The GOP plan, in addition to border wall construction, would have created a three-year protection for 700,000 illegal immigrant “Dreamers” covered under the Obama-era DACA program, and another 300,000 immigrants in the country on humanitarian Temporary Protected Status.

It also includes $12.7 billion in supplemental disaster relief funding for states that have been affected by recent hurricane and wildfires.

But Democrats said the protections for Dreamers and TPS holders wasn’t generous enough — they want full citizenship rights — and said another part of the plan would prevent some illegal immigrants from claiming asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Mr. Schumer called the Trump plan “laughable” as a compromise offer.

“Throughout this debacle, I have not heard one good reason why 800,000 federal employees must be held hostage for us to discuss border security,” said Mr. Schumer, New York Democrat.

The billboards say prisoners are being compensated for their jailhouse jobs and “eating roast beef and Cornish hens” while federal prison guards are going unpaid.

Back in D.C., meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi heaped pressure on Mr. Trump and Republicans by touring a temporary kitchen set up by chef Jose Andres to feed federal workers who are struggling during the shutdown.

With the TV cameras rolling, she stopped to chat with a pair of volunteers doling out fresh fruit to furloughed employees.

The moves are part of a growing effort to make the personal pain of the month-old shutdown apparent, both to politicians and to voters who may feel immune to the lapse in funding.

“We believe this is a national food emergency, and we will be there for the national federal workers,” Mr. Andres said in a Twitter video, adding: “This is our action to make sure no one will be hungry, Mr. Trump. What are you doing about it?”

Tuesday marked the deadline for the second payroll processing period of the shutdown, meaning that with no solution workers will miss a second paycheck.

In Kentucky, sponsors of the 15 billboards say federal prison guards can’t even afford the commute to work without their paychecks.

“Who is Mitch McConnell actually working for? Is he working for the president of the United States or the law enforcement and citizens of Kentucky?” said Eric Young, president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals.

Democrats’ PR push appears to be working, as polls show more people blaming Mr. Trump and the GOP for the impasse, which focuses on White House demands for border wall funding.

“Democratic leaders are emphasizing the personal impact on people of normal means and saying Trump is a rich businessman who doesn’t care about average folks,” said Darrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. “Trump’s strategy is to blame Democrats, but he hasn’t been very empathetic about the plight of workers.”

Some companies are revving up their PR machines to ease the effects of the shutdown, without choosing sides.

Delta Air Lines donated $83,500 to reopen the Martin Luther King Jr. National Park in Atlanta from its namesake’s holiday weekend through Feb. 3, when visitors will flock to the city for the Super Bowl.

Other household names have no qualms about casting blame.

Pop star Lady Gaga stopped midway through a song over the weekend to call out Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in Las Vegas.

“There are people who live paycheck to paycheck and need their money,” she said to cheers, according to videos posted online.

Mr. Trump, a master showman, has made his own pitch by touring the southern border and touting his wall building plans to the American Farm Bureau Federation, who showered him with applause last week.

On Tuesday, he pledged on Twitter not to “cave” and accused Democrats of playing political games. He has recalled workers, piecemeal, to lessen the public-facing pain of the shutdown.

Labor unions have questioned the legality of those moves.

Mr. McConnell, who has staunchly defended Mr. Trump throughout the shutdown, said Tuesday that he has scheduled a Thursday vote on the president’s new immigration plan, which is combined with bills to reopen the shuttered parts of government.

It combines three years of temporary legal status for 1 million immigrants, including “Dreamers,” in exchange for border wall funds.

Mr. McConnell said Democrats who rejected the idea were catering to far-left interests who demanded ideological purity over compromise.

“To refuse even to talk until the government reopens does no favors to the sidelined federal workers and contractors,” he said.

Mr. Young, however, said Mr. McConnell should bring up bills to reopen the government without dealing with the border fight.

He said the prison guard council has worked on criminal justice changes pushed by Mr. Trump and other bipartisan measures, so the billboards that pressure Mr. McConnell shouldn’t be viewed as a partisan slam.

“It’s a simple message,” Mr. Young said. “It’s not anything that denigrates him.”

“At the end of the day, the president is going to secure the border one way or another,” Mr. Mulvaney said on “Fox News Sunday.”

“We have been hoping for months to do it through legislation with Democrats because that’s the right way for the government to function, but at the end of the day the president’s commitment is to defend the nation, and he’ll do it either with or without Congress,” he said.

The president said that if Congress doesn’t come up with a “fair” deal on homeland security funding in the next three weeks, he could invoke emergency powers to get his desired U.S.-Mexico border wall built, or try to orchestrate another partial shutdown.

Mr. Mulvaney said that “no one” wants a government shutdown.

“It’s not a desired end,” he said.

SEE ALSO: Nancy Pelosi empowered by Donald Trump government shutdown showdown

The president on Friday signed legislation to re-open the federal government through Feb. 15, after the House and Senate swiftly passed the stopgap funding measure earlier in the day.

That brought to a close the longest shutdown of the federal government in U.S. history. The partial shutdown spanned more than a month.

Mr. Trump signed the bill even though it doesn’t include new money for construction on his desired U.S.-Mexico border wall, which the White House repeatedly insisted be part of the deal.

That’s a win for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders, who said over the last month that they would not support additional funding for the wall and that they would not negotiate border security while the government remained closed.

“I think ultimately he’ll be judged by what happens at the end of this process, not by what happened this week,” Mr. Mulvaney said of the president.

Mr. Trump said over the weekend that 21 days “goes very quickly.”

“Negotiations with Democrats will start immediately,” he said on Twitter. “Will not be easy to make a deal, both parties very dug in. The case for National Security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the Border & through dialogue. We will build the Wall!”"

In an interview with NBC’s “Today,” Mr. Sandmann asserted that both he and Nathan Phillips, the Native American elder, were well within their First Amendment rights during the confrontation on Friday.

Videos emerging from the incident show that another protest group, the Black Hebrew Israelites, began taunting the Covington Catholic students. Mr. Phillips and his group began to talk between the two groups and make their way through the crowd of boys, stopping in front of Mr. Sandmann.

Mr. Sandmann said the students got permission from chaperones to shout school chants to drown out the insults. The student said that he felt threatened, despite being in a much larger group because the protesters were adults and he “wasn’t sure what was going to happen.”

“In hindsight, I wish we had just found another spot to wait for our buses, but at the time, being positive seemed better than letting them slander us with all of these things,” Mr. Sandmann said.

In other interviews, Mr. Phillips explained that he went toward the boys in order to defuse what he saw as a tense situation between the Black Hebrew Israelites and the students.

The student also said that his group should have walked away once the Native American activists came to them, but he didn’t “want to be disrespectful to Mr. Phillips” if he was trying to have a conversation.

Mr. Sandmann, who in the videos can be seen staring back at Mr. Phillips with what some have described as a smirk, said he wasn’t intending to be disrespectful. In his view, he was trying to show that he wouldn’t be moved to “any further reaction of aggression.”

“As far as standing there, I had every right to do so,” he said. “I can’t say that I’m sorry for listening to him and standing there.”

Mr. Phillips, who has done several interviews after the incident went viral, disputes Mr. Sandmann’s version of events. He contends that Mr. Sandmann locked eyes with him and approached him.

“I have read the statement from Nick Sandmann, the student who stared at me for a long time. He did not apologize, and I believe there are intentional falsehoods in his testimony,” Mr. Phillips said.

Covington Catholic High, an all-boys school, closed on Tuesday for safety reasons and reopened on Wednesday, although parents do not have to send their sons to school for the time being.

4561,4561,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/feb/1/us-withdraws-inf-treaty-russia/,Right,"President Trump announced Friday that he is pulling the U.S. out of its Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, saying Moscow has been cheating for years on the 1987 pact.

“The United States has fully adhered to the INF Treaty for more than 30 years, but we will not remain constrained by its terms while Russia misrepresents its actions,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “We cannot be the only country in the world unilaterally bound by this treaty, or any other.”

He said the withdrawal will be completed in six months unless Russia comes back into compliance by destroying all of its violating missiles, launchers and associated equipment.

NATO said it “fully supports” Mr. Trump’s move. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia “is in material breach” of the INF Treaty and must use the next six months to return to full, verifiable compliance “or bear sole responsibility for its demise.”

Mr. Trump said the U.S. stands ready “to engage with Russia on arms control negotiations that meet these criteria, and, importantly, once that is done, develop, perhaps for the first time ever, an outstanding relationship on economic, trade, political, and military levels.”

“This would be a fantastic thing for Russia and the United States, and would also be great for the world,” he said.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the withdrawal was justified because “Russia has jeopardized the United States’ security interests” by deploying a particular missile system in Europe.

The treaty, which had prohibited the U.S. and Russia from building or deploying land-based missiles and launch systems with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles, was designed to block the spread of so-called “tactical nukes” around the globe, particularly in Europe, partly out of fear the less powerful bombs were more likely to be used in an actual shooting war.

U.S. officials since 2014 have accused Moscow of breaching the INF, specifically through the deployment of a cruise missile known as the Novator 9M729.

“We can no longer be restricted by the treaty while Russia shamelessly violates it,” Mr. Pompeo told reporters at the State Department Friday morning.

“Russia’s violations put millions of Europeans and Americans at greater risk,” he said. “It is our duty to respond appropriately.”

“Countries must be held accountable when they break the rules,” Mr. Pompeo added.

Russia has acknowledged the 9M729 system’s existence but has claimed it does not violate the treaty.

The six-month period before the U.S. fully pulls out of the treaty is “Russia’s final chance” to restore the commitment, according to a senior administration official.

“Russia continues to deny its violation,” the official said Friday, and “is the one that has created a threat that exists that we successfully ended about 30 years ago.”

“We cannot be the only country bound by a treaty,” the official told reporters. “What purpose does it serve for the U.S. to be unilaterally bound to the treaty?”

The six-month waiting period is standard for most international treaties. It is intended to give other parties a final opportunity to restore its commitment.

“For [Russian President Vladimir] Putin this is very much about his neighbors, China being one of them,” the senior administration official said. “For the United States, this is strictly about the threat this poses to arms control.”

China and Iran are not bound by the INF treaty. Each country has thousands of the missiles in dispute and banned by the existing treaty.

Analysts say China, particularly, has developed large numbers of missiles that would violate the treaty, including the so-called DF-26 missile, informally dubbed the “Guam Killer.”

Republican Sen. James Risch of Idaho, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he supports the move.

“I know that we have the unanimity of our allies in this decision, and we will continue to consult with them over the next six months as we approach the withdrawal date,” Mr. Risch said.

He said the treaty has become outdated and hasn’t stopped Russia from cheating.

“For the past several years, the Russian government has systematically violated the INF Treaty and deployed systems that undermine the stability that the treaty helped create,” he said. “Russian actions represent a material breach of the treaty, and it is abundantly clear: The United States is the only country limited by the INF Treaty.”

He said Moscow has had “endless opportunities to change their bad behavior” but has failed to do so.

“The time has come to set the treaty aside and develop alternative avenues toward the security the treaty once provided,” Mr. Risch said.

Some experts have argued that Russia developed the land-based missile because Moscow cannot compete with comparable U.S. sea- and air-based systems, which were not restricted by the treaty.

The decision was not a surprise to the Kremlin, which has claimed the Trump administration has long been determined to undermine the deal. Foreign Minister Dmitry Ryabkov, Russia’s top negotiator on the pact, denied again Friday that Russia had violated the terms of the INF and said Moscow was still willing to abide by its terms despite the U.S. withdrawal.

“We believe that the treaty is needed. It serves the interests of our security and European security,” Mr. Ryabkov said in an interview broadcast Friday, the Agence France-Presse news service reported. “It would be extremely irresponsible to undermine it with unilateral steps.”

He also accused the Trump administration of using the rejection of the treaty as a way to bleed Russia financially.

“They are probably beginning [an arms] race to exhaust us economically,” Mr. Ryabkov said.

Washington and Moscow also are discussing a possible extension of the START nuclear treaty for five more years. That agreement, which took effect in 2011, seeks to limit the size of the U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals.

Some experts believe that Mr. Trump’s announcement about the INF Treaty means that the START pact could be ended as well.

A senior administration official said the U.S. has “not made any decisions about its extension.”

“We’re in the middle of an interagency process to evaluate our options,” the official said of START. “We are presently dealing with the Russians on this. We are working through some implementation challenges with them.”

4582,4582,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/feb/1/virginia-democrats-turn-northam-demand-resignation/,Right,"The Democratic Caucuses in Virginia’s state House and Senate both called Friday for Gov. Ralph Northam to resign, saying members have lost confidence in him to lead the state after a photo emerged of him and a friend with one in blackface and the other in a KKK outfit.

The Democrats said they had “trouble reconciling” the photo with their own experiences with the Democratic governor. But they said voters need to be able to trust their elected officials, and that’s no longer possible.

“We regret to say that we are no longer confident in the Governor’s representation of Virginians. Though it brings us no joy to do so, we must call for Governor Northam’s resignation,” the House caucus said in a statement.

Senate Democrats also said they were shocked.

“The Ralph Northam we know is a pediatric neurologist, a dedicated public servant and a committed husband and father. Nevertheless, it is with heavy hearts that we have respectfully asked him to step down,” the Senate caucus said on Twitter.

While leaders across the Democratic Party nationally have made similar calls, the House Democratic Caucus’s decision to turn on the governor is particularly devastating because it was his massive election victory in 2017 and his electoral coattails that helped many of them get elected.

All 140 seats in the House and Senate are up for election this November, and Democrats had been hoping to win their first majorities in the chambers in two decades.

Earlier in the day, after the 1984 yearbook photo surfaced, Mr. Northam released both a written statement and a video Friday apologizing for the photo and vowing to work to regain voters’ trust — but signaling no intention to step down.
