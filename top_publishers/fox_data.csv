0,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/charlie-kirk-starbucks-engages-in-intolerable-discrimination-against-police,2,"On Feb. 1, 1960, four black college students sat down at a Woolworth’s lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C., and politely ordered coffee. White waitresses ignored them because the store had a policy of not serving African-Americans.

The incident sparked massive protests across the nation involving sit-ins by black people at Woolworth lunch counters, leading the chain to finally desegregate that July and boosting the civil rights movement.

This week, on the Fourth of July, the Officers Association in Tempe, Ariz., says six police officers were drinking coffee at a Starbucks coffee shop before the start of their shift when they were asked to move out of the line of sight of a customer or leave the store. A barista told them a customer “did not feel safe” because of their presence. The officers -- including some who have defended our country in the military -- left.

STARBUCKS SHOP BOOTS POLICE OFFICERS BECAUSE CUSTOMER ‘DID NOT FEEL SAFE’ AROUND THEM: REPORTS

It’s obvious that the discrimination against black people who were trying to order coffee all those years ago was wrong, shameful and inexcusable. It should be just as obvious that the same is true for the discrimination against the police officers at the Starbucks in Arizona this week.

In late May, Starbucks closed 8,000 stores across the U.S. for several hours of anti-bias training after two black men in one of the chain’s coffee shops in Philadelphia were arrested for trespassing while they waited for a friend to join them. Starbucks and police later apologized and the charges were dropped, prompting Starbucks to hold the anti-bias training to avoid future such incidents.

Are we now going to see a similar store closure for anti-bias training regarding police who want to order overpriced coffee at Starbucks? Don’t hold your breath.

The Tempe Officer’s Association took to Twitter to share the incident with the world and expressed displeasure with what had happened. Their tweet was illustrated with an altered Starbucks logo that said “DUMP STARBUCKS.”

Starbucks has issued a statement saying it has “deep respect for the Tempe Police Department” and apologizing “for any misunderstanding or inappropriate behavior that may have taken place.”

The person who complained to the barista about the police officers in the Starbucks store would no doubt welcome their presence if attacked by violent criminals.

Unfortunately, incidents of people openly expressing animosity toward police across our country have been increasing since 2014, when Michael Brown, who was black, was shot and killed by Officer Darren Wilson of the Ferguson, Mo., police department.

The shooting sparked days of protests, but a U.S. Justice Department investigation concluded that Wilson shot Brown in self-defense when Brown attacked him. Wilson was not charged with any crime.

Nevertheless, President Barack Obama used the incident for his own political purposes to stir up racial tension and animosity against the police.

Donald Trump ran for the presidency as a supporter of law enforcement. Both before and since his election, President Trump has repeatedly stood at podiums across the country and has been outspoken in his praise for the people who put on a uniform every day to protect American citizens from threats found not across oceans, but across the street and even in coffee shops.

Quite ironically, the support President Trump has shown is one of the driving reasons that police are now facing such open hostility across the country. I have written many times over the past couple of years about the broken logic string inside of the American liberal mind.

This particular wrongheaded thread runs something like this: Trump is evil and wants to harm minorities; Trump supports the police; therefore, the police are evil and want to harm minorities.

No one can claim all police are perfect, or that no police officer has ever acted improperly or even criminally. Every allegation of police misconduct should be thoroughly investigated and police officers who break the law should be prosecuted to the full extent the law allows.

But it’s important to remember that every profession is marred by a small number of people who abuse their positions and engage in wrongdoing – for example, members of the clergy or other professionals who engage in sexual misconduct, business people who steal money from their employers or customers, or pharmacists who become illegal drug dealers.

The truth is that the vast majority of police officers willingly risk their lives to protect the rest of us from criminals who would commit all sorts of crimes and do us grave harm if no police were around.

Who in their right mind would want to live in a city without a police force, where criminals were free to rob, rape, murder and do anything else they wanted?

The person who complained to the barista about the police officers in the Starbucks store would no doubt welcome their presence if attacked by violent criminals. And just by being in the Starbucks, the officers would almost certainly have scared off any criminals who entered and kept them from attacking anyone.

The bottom line is that the prejudice that says all members of a group should be the targets of our hatred and be discriminated against is wrong and frankly, un-America – whether we’re talking about people from a particular racial, ethnic, religious or professional group.

Starbucks needs to make sure all of its employees understand this, or else fire them for engaging in intolerable discrimination.

The meeting, which took place in the East Room of the White House, included discussion about accusations that companies including Facebook, Google and Twitter have treated conservatives unfairly. The president also complimented the conservatives in attendance for what they've post online, saying, ""Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable.""

The White House said about 200 conservative digital and social media professionals from Capitol Hill, federal agencies and external coalition groups were invited, along with members of Congress and officials from the Trump administration.

MAJORITY OF CONSERVATIVES DON’T TRUST FACEBOOK TO TREAT EVERYONE EQUALLY, STUDY SAYS

The president said during his remarks that he was directing his administration to explore ways to protect free speech, saying big tech companies have been so powerful that it must be used fairly.

Trump said he's used Twitter because it's allowed him to avoid the filter of the news media, but the president acknowledged his frequent misspellings in tweets.

""I’m actually a good speller, but everyone says the fingers aren’t as good as the brain,"" he said.

The White House did not release a full list of attendees. However, multiple conservative activists, including well-known firebrands famous for sparring with liberals, posted their invitations online.

""I’m looking forward to attending today’s summit at the @WhiteHouse on the heels of our Google expose showing an executive discussing training algorithms to affect the outcome of elections,"" tweeted James O’Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, known for its sting videos of liberal targets.

Conservative talk show host Bill Mitchell tweeted he was attending the event, as did Jim Hoft, the founder of the website Gateway Pundit, and an anonymous Twitter user named ""CarpeDonktum,"" who has made pro-Trump memes and had more than 100,000 followers. Charlie Kirk and Benny Johnson of the pro-Trump millennial organization Turning Point USA also attended.

""Honored to be going to the Social Media Summit today at the White House @realDonaldTrump has brilliantly used social media to create the most powerful American political movement in the last 100 yrs,"" Kirk tweeted ahead of the meeting. ""We must hold these tech companies accountable for their silencing of our views!""

Ahead of the summit, controversy broke out over one invitee – a cartoonist named Ben Garrison, whom the Anti-Defamation League once accused of anti-Semitism over a drawing targeting a former White House official.

In a statement posted online, Garrison acknowledged he had been disinvited by the White House after critics resurfaced the allegation, saying he was disappointed be excluded from the summit while denying that he's promoted anti-Semitism.

The White House also invited other online aficionados from conservative think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation. That organization sent Robert Bluey, Bridgett Wagner, Maria Sousa and Jessica Anderson to the summit.

""While there was discussion about breaking up Big Tech and penalties for perceived censorship or bias, it is clear the free market is working as more conservatives voice their concerns,"" Anderson, a vice president at Heritage Action for America, said in a statement.

Shortly before the summit took place, Twitter experienced an outage, which prevented some users from being able to use the service. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, around the same time, announced plans for the company to experiment with a new feature allowing people to hide replies to their tweets.

""Testing something new. More control, and transparency, over conversations sparked from your tweets,"" Dorsey said. ""There’s going to be a lot for us to learn from here.""

2,https://www.foxnews.com/us/why-those-ice-raids-are-being-announced-in-advance,2,"Starting Sunday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is expected to resume its previously announced plan to apprehend thousands of illegal immigrants across the country.

The reinvigorated effort comes just weeks after President Trump tweeted that ICE was preparing to kick off days of raids in at least 10 major cities. The operation was halted, however, the day before it was set to start, to give Congress time to arrive at a legislative solution on immigration. Trump said his administration would relaunch the raids after a two-week window – after the Independence Day observance – and that time now seems to have arrived.

So why are the raids being publicized days in advance?

“It’s unprecedented. But there is a political purpose behind it,” Thomas Kilbride, a retired Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agent and ICE policy adviser, told Fox News. He said the president has tried to get Democrats to come to the table because asylum laws need to change, and this is a way to bargain.

WAR CRIMINALS AMONG US: INSIDE THE QUIET EFFORT TO PROSECUTE AND DEPORT VIOLATORS DISGUISED AS REFUGEES

ICE agents are expected to target a minimum of 2,000 immigrants who have already been listed for deportation, but Kilbride said there will be “collateral” fallout.

What does that mean, though? While there are roughly a million people in the United States with removal orders, according to officials, those with criminal histories are the ones being sought. If other illegals are located along with a person of interest, they, too, will be arrested as part of that fallout.

But whether any political ambitions connected to the operation will prove successful remains to be seen.

“At a minimum, the asylum laws need to change, for people to have to remain outside the country when applying for asylum or applying at a foreign embassy,” Kilbride said. “What we are seeing at the border now is unprecedented.”

Other experts have underscored that Trump’s announcements are something of a gesture – and not something that the administration was under any legal obligation to do.

“The main point here is that the Trump administration is trying to circumvent some of the blowback from the other side of the aisle. It sends the message that these people have been notified to self-deport and if they fail to do that, this might happen,” said Steve Bucci, homeland security expert at the Heritage Foundation. “It is saying that we aren’t monsters, what we are doing is in accordance with the law and in a reasonable fashion.

""Past administrations didn’t announce raids because they didn’t have to, they just did them.”

Yet the heads-up also means that many may have left the addresses known to DHS in the weeks since the raids were first trumpeted, further hindering their effectiveness.

“Some may go into hiding or to a church providing a sanctuary,” Bucci continued.

Erin Corcoran, an immigration expert and executive director of Notre Dame's Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, affirmed that in the past, raids were not announced beforehand by immigration enforcement, just as they are not announced when law enforcement is involved; when the information is exposed, it can more often than not prove detrimental to an operation.

“Sometimes there have been leaks by individuals, but it has never been a policy choice to pre-emptively announce raids. It compromises the effectiveness of the raids. Those being targeted may relocate or refuse to answer the door when immigration officials knock because they are anticipating the raids,” she said. “Raids have been conducted by other administrations, oftentimes targeting certain types of immigration violations, including those with criminal convictions. However, there has not been an immigration raid by previous administrations targeting families or children.

""It is unclear why this administration is preemptively announcing these raids. I also think there is some disagreement within the administration officials about these raids.""

VENEZUELA’S WAR ON CHILDREN AT 'BREAKING POINT' OVER LACK OF MEDICAL CARE

The public announcement of the forthcoming raids has inspired a number of hashtag campaigns, from #protecteachother to #knowyourights, aimed at giving undocumented migrants information about civil liberties that include the rights to silence and an attorney.

Acting Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli said this week that the raids were “absolutely going to happen,” though he did not give an exact date for when “operational elements will roll out.”

Matthew Bourke, a spokesperson for ICE, told reporters Wednesday that his agency ""prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present aliens who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security” but he also declined to comment on specific details, citing “law enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security"" of ICE personnel.

In fact, some officials have expressed concern that declaring the missions publicly is a serious concern where officer safety is involved.

At the same time, however, some lawmakers and legal experts speculate that the leak of information from within could also be designed to have the raids halted once again.

Immigration lawyer Saman Nasseri, who's based in San Diego, contended that releasing information about the raids in advance is problematic not only for security reasons, but because of how often people move on, complicating the tracking of targets. He anticipates that the “operation will most likely be delayed again.”

The notion of immigration reform is set to be at the forefront of Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign and has long been a staple of his presidential agenda. While the migrant flow has shown signs of slowing over the past month, the Trump team has long grappled with the issue of large numbers of immigrants – mostly from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador – crossing the southern border with Mexico. More than 330,000 families have entered the U.S. illegally since the beginning of October, government records show.

DHS did not respond to a request for further comment."
3,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jim-hanson-reported-5b-facebook-settlement-is-well-deserved-punishment-for-abuses-of-user-privacy,2,"According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the Federal Trade Commission has approved a settlement under which Facebook will pay a record $5 billion fine for violating an FTC order regarding its privacy practices.

The settlement, which still needs Justice Department approval, shows that Facebook is finally getting a well-deserved punishment for abusing the privacy of those who use the service.

The Journal reported that the FTC hit Facebook with the $5 billion fine for violating a 2011 agreement that required the social media giant to notify users when Facebook was going to allow third parties to snoop through their personal information. The fine is a recognition that Facebook has not learned its lesson.

FTC APPROVES $5B FACEBOOK SETTLEMENT OVER DATA PRIVACY PROBE: REPORT

This behavior is especially bad and goes beyond Facebook’s normal exploitation of information about all the facets of your life, which you share on Facebook and which the company profits from.

At President Trump’s social media summit at the White House Thursday, which I attended, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., reminded us how the big tech companies work: “You’re not buying a product, you are the product,” he said.

The FTC began investigating Facebook after the social media company admitted that the British data firm Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed personal information of as many as 87 million Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica then used the information to build targeting databases and profit from them.

The cavalier treatment of user information by Facebook and other social media companies was a major concern at President Trump’s social media summit.

In one example of this anti-free speech hysteria that sounds like a joke – but is true – Simmons University in Boston warned that telling another student “God bless you” after a sneeze can be a a microaggression, and so can wishing someone “Merry Christmas.”

Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., announced upcoming hearings and a Big Tech Task Force run by the Senate Judiciary Committee that will focus on privacy issues, data security, antitrust concerns, competition and censorship.

Blackburn joined the president in response to my question asking if he would use federal agencies to investigate abuses by the tech firms. The president said that was one of the things his administration is pursuing.

The leaders of the small group of technology companies that now control the majority of information and advertising in our country – and have an incredible view into our private lives – could not have expected to wield this much power.

Keep in mind that Google was not launched until 1998, Facebook did not begin operations until 2004, and Twitter didn’t begin until 2006.

These companies started as small ventures, leaving their founders unprepared for their rapid growth and financial success. They are now outmatched by the capabilities of their technology. But that is no excuse for their repeated and systematic use of this power for malign purposes.

Now we must find a way to rein in the social media giants that does not offend our free market capitalist system. That does not mean we can’t use government intervention, but it does mean that turning to government should be a last resort.

What is called for now are investigations by Congress and the requisite federal agencies into the practices of the tech companies that violate either existing laws and regulations or that simply do not conform to what Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, called “the spirit of the First Amendment” when he spoke at the social media summit.

These private firms are not bound by the First Amendment of our Constitution, which prohibits government restrictions on our freedom of speech.

But Crenshaw talked about the idea that all Americans should respect the spirit of free speech and work to ensure that they do not censor people without a very good reason.

Right now, the social media companies are rapidly moving in the direction of limiting many types of speech that simply offend some people. This is exactly the opposite of what the First Amendment does when it protects offensive speech. Inoffensive speech hardly needs protection.

The tech firms say they control and limit free speech to “protect the health of public conversation.” But how can you ever manage to account for all the potential ways that free speech will offend others – especially in light of the ongoing indoctrination on college campuses teaching Grievance Mongering 101?

It seems that virtually any comment can now be labeled a microaggression, a triggering event or hate speech by the snowflake generation.

In one example of this anti-free speech hysteria that sounds like a joke – but is true – Simmons University in Boston warned that telling another student “God bless you” after a sneeze can be a a microaggression, and so can wishing someone “Merry Christmas.” The university also warns of six other “anti-oppression” categories: “anti-racism,” “anti-transmisia,” “anti-ableism,” “anti-Islamomisia,” “anti-sanism” and “anti-queermisia.”

When social media companies adopt this kind of hypersensitivity – based on the left-wing sensibilities of Silicon Valley – conservatives tend to suffer by having their views labeled as unacceptable.

This type of viewpoint discrimination infects the pathways of our public discourse right now.

Facebook apparently paid the price this time, but there will be other incidents of misconduct. The tech firms either fail to grasp that their days of blithely mining their customers’ private lives for gold in the form of personal information are over. And their free run deciding what content and ideas are worthy and which will be suppressed has ended.

Unfortunately, the tech giants have not adapted to this new paradigm, and that means even more pressure must be applied.

Ideally, a consortium of citizens, academics, think tanks, advocacy organizations and government should play a major role in protecting free speech.

Hopefully, an investigation will goad the social media companies into action. But if not, government action will be required.

Our ability to freely exchange ideas is the most precious commodity we have and we must fight with all available resources to regain control of our information space.

4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/trump-executive-order-kidney-disease-care,2,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday paving the way for an overhaul of the way kidney disease, which affects 30 million Americans, is treated in the U.S.

The president's move would lead to sweeping changes in treatment as well as prevention, including improving access to dialysis treatment in the home and enabling people with failing kidneys to have opportunities sooner to get a transplant.

""This is a first, second and third step, it’s more than just a first step,” said Trump just before signing the executive order. “We’re going to come up with solutions over a period of five years and 10 years, that I think most people won’t believe.”

Some of the initiatives will require new government regulations.

And because a severe organ shortage complicates the call for more transplants, the administration also aims to ease financial hardships for living donors, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement.

STEVIE WONDER SAYS HE'LL UNDERGO KIDNEY TRANSPLANT LATER THIS YEAR

Another key change: steps to help the groups that collect deceased donations do a better job. Officials cited a study that suggests long term it may be possible to find 17,000 more kidneys and 11,000 other organs from deceased donors for transplant every year.

Federal health officials have made clear for months that they intend to shake up a system that today favors expensive, time-consuming dialysis in large centers over easier-to-tolerate at-home care or transplants that help patients live longer.

“For 50 years, we have had basically a stagnant system of how we treat people with chronic kidney disease,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II said in a briefing held Wednesday morning.

“Right now every financial incentive is toward dialysis and not toward transplantation and long-term survivorship,” Azar, whose father experienced traditional and at-home dialysis before getting a living donor transplant, told a Senate hearing in March. “And you get what you pay for.”

About 30 million American adults have chronic kidney disease, costing Medicare a staggering $113 billion.

Careful treatment — including control of diabetes and high blood pressure, the two main culprits — can help prevent further kidney deterioration. But more than 700,000 people have end-stage renal disease, meaning their kidneys have failed, and require either a transplant or dialysis to survive. Only about a third received specialized kidney care before they got so sick.

More than 94,000 of the 113,000 people on the national organ waiting list need a kidney. Last year, there were 21,167 kidney transplants. A fraction — 6,442 — were from living donors, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which oversees the nation’s transplant system.

“The longer you’re on dialysis, the outcomes are worse,” said Dr. Amit Tevar, a transplant surgeon at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, who praised the Trump administration initiatives being announced Wednesday.

Too often, transplant centers don’t see a kidney patient until they’ve been on dialysis for years, he said. And while any transplant is preferable, one from a living donor is best because those organs “work better, longer and faster,” Tevar said.

Among the initiatives that take effect first:

—Medicare payment changes that would provide a financial incentive for doctors and clinics to help kidney patients stave off end-stage disease by about six months.

—A bonus to kidney specialists who help prepare patients for early transplant, with steps that can begin even before they need dialysis.

—Additional Medicare changes so that dialysis providers can earn as much by helping patients get dialysis at home as in the large centers that predominate today. Patients typically must spend hours three or four times a week hooked to machines that filter waste out of their blood.

Home options include portable blood-cleansing machines, or what’s called peritoneal dialysis that works through an abdominal tube, usually while patients are sleeping.

Today, about 14% of patients in kidney failure get at-home dialysis or an early transplant. By 2025, the goal is to have 80% of people with newly diagnosed kidney failure getting one of those options, officials said.

These changes are being implemented through Medicare’s innovation center, created under the Obama-era Affordable Care Act and empowered to seek savings and improved quality. The Trump administration is relying on the innovation center even as it argues in federal court that the law that created it is unconstitutional and should be struck down entirely.

Other initiatives will require new regulations, expected to be proposed later this year. Among them:

—Allowing reimbursement of lost wages and other expenses for living donors, who can give one of their kidneys or a piece of their liver. The transplant recipient’s insurance pays the donor’s medical bills. But they are out of work for weeks recuperating and one study found more than a third of living kidney donors reported lost wages, a median of $2,712, in the year following donation. Details about who pays — and who qualifies — still have to be worked out.

—Clearer ways to measure how well the nation’s 58 organ procurement organizations collect donations from deceased donors. Some do a better job than others, but today’s performance standards are self-reported, varying around the country and making it hard for government regulators or the OPOs themselves to take steps to improve.

“Some OPOs are very aggressive and move forward with getting organs allocated and donors consented, and there are those that are a little more lackadaisical about it,” said Pittsburgh’s Tevar. Unlike the medical advances in transplantation, “we haven’t really made big dents and progress and moves in increasing cadaveric organs or increasing live donor options.”

5,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-fires-back-at-squad-challenges-house-to-rebuke-them-for-filthy-and-hate-laced-remarks,2,"President Trump fired back Tuesday at the four freshman congresswomen who denounced his administration and renewed calls for his impeachment at a rare joint press conference, claiming Democrats have given them a ""free pass"" for their ""vile"" language and challenging colleagues to rebuke them.

House Democrats, in fact, are planning to formally rebuke Trump for weekend tweets urging those same lawmakers to ""go back"" to where they came from -- though all but one of them was born in America. But the president, while refusing to back down from his statements, has sought to chastise Democrats for rallying to the side of those lawmakers.

AOC 'SQUAD' REFERS TO TRUMP AS 'OCCUPANT' OF WHITE HOUSE, CONDEMNS 'RACIST' REMARKS, AS TRUMP FIRES BACK

“The Democratic Congresswomen have been spewing some of the most vile, hateful, and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the House or Senate, & yet they get a free pass and a big embrace from the Democrat Party,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “Horrible anti-Israel, anti-USA, pro-terrorist & public shouting of the F…word, among many other terrible things, and the petrified Dems run for the hills.”

He added: “Why isn’t the House voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said? Because they are the Radical Left, and the Democrats are afraid to take them on. Sad!”

The lawmakers he's referring to are Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley.

All four congresswomen held a press conference on Monday to address the president's prior statements against them. Omar described Trump's rhetoric as ""garbage,"" accused him of carrying out ""the agenda of white nationalists,"" and said his remarks were a ""blatantly racist attack on four duly elected members of the United States House of Representatives, all of whom are women of color.""

Tlaib said Trump was running a ""lawless"" administration and joined her colleagues in calling for his impeachment.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who until recently was engaged in a public war of words with the “Squad” freshmen, has in the wake of the controversy called for a resolution to condemn Trump’s comments, which she labeled as “xenophobic.” This is expected to be considered Tuesday.

Omar previously has been criticized by prominent members of both parties for making remarks widely deemed anti-Semitic. The House failed to pass a resolution condemning her directly, instead altering the message to condemn hate in general, including from the right.

During Monday's press conference, Omar defended herself, saying, ""Every single statement that we make is from a place of extreme love for every single person in this country.""

Trump's reference Tuesday to profane language was likely related to Tlaib's famous vow to ""impeach the motherf-----.""

TRUMP BROADSIDES UNITE WARRING DEMS – BUT FOR HOW LONG?

Trump’s accusation that the Democratic establishment is reluctant to take any action against the four congresswomen follows several days of ugly comments between party members. After Pelosi dismissed them as just being “four people” who “didn’t have any following” in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez accused the speaker of targeting women of color.

The internal feuding only paused when Trump posted his tweets about those lawmakers Sunday morning -- saying the ""Democrat Congresswomen"" should go back and fix the ""corrupt"" and ""crime infested places"" they came from and then ""come back and show us how it's done.""

6,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/billionaire-ross-perot-who-ran-twice-for-president-dead-at-89,2,"Self-made billionaire Ross Perot, who ran for president in 1992 and 1996, has died at age 89 after a five-month battle with leukemia, the Dallas Morning News reported.

Perot, who won19 percent of the vote as a third-party candidate in 1992, died early Tuesday at his home in Dallas surrounded by his family, family spokesman James Fuller said. The native-born Texan, who made his billions by founding Electronic Data Systems Corp., was seen by admirers as a patriot who served his country well before his two failed bids for the White House. In 1979, he financed a private commando raid to free two EDS employees being held in a prison in Iran. He was also a tireless advocate for Vietnam veterans.

In 1992, Perot spent more than $60 million of his own money to run against incumbent President George H.W. Bush and challenger Bill Clinton, promising to bring his business acumen to the nation's finances. Some Republicans blamed him for Bush's loss, noting he pulled the largest percentage of votes for a third-party candidate since former President Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 bid.

Perot's second campaign four years later fizzled, as he gathered just 8 percent of the vote, and the Reform Party that he founded and hoped to build into a national political force began to fall apart.

However, Perot's ideas on trade and deficit reduction remained part of the political landscape. He blamed both major parties for running up a huge federal budget deficit and letting American jobs to be sent to other countries. The movement of U.S. jobs to Mexico, he said, created a ""giant sucking sound.""

Perot continued to speak out about federal spending for many years. In 2008, he launched a website to highlight the nation's debt with a ticker that tracked the rising total, a blog and a chart presentation.

Henry Ross Perot was born in Texarkana on June 27, 1930. His father was a cotton broker; his mother a secretary. Perot said his family survived the Depression relatively well through hard work and by managing their money carefully.

Young Perot's first job was delivering papers in a poor, mostly black part of town from his pony, Miss Bee. Perot said when the newspaper tried to cut his commission, he complained to the publisher — and won. He said he learned to take problems straight to the top.

From Texarkana, Perot went to the U.S. Naval Academy even though he had never been on a ship or seen the ocean. After the Navy, Perot joined International Business Machines in 1955 and quickly became a top salesman. In his last year at IBM, he filled his sales quota for the year in January.

In 1962, with $1,000 from his wife, Margot, Perot founded Electronic Data Systems. Hardware accounted for about 80% of the computer business, Perot said, and IBM wasn't interested in the other 20%, including services.

Ross Perot is shown in this Oct. 30, 1968, file photo, as Electronic Data Systems Corp. chairman. In 1984 Perot, founder of EDS, sold his company to GM for $2.5 billion. (Photo: Associated Press)

Many of the early hires at EDS were former military men, and they had to abide by Perot's strict dress code — white shirts, ties, no beards or mustaches — and long work days. Many had crew cuts, like Perot.

The company's big break came in the mid-1960s when the federal government created Medicare and Medicaid, the health programs for seniors, the disabled and the poor. States needed help in running the programs, and EDS won contracts — starting in Texas — to handle the millions of claims.

EDS first sold stock to the public in 1968, and overnight, Perot was worth $350 million. His fortune doubled and tripled as the stock price rose steadily.

In 1984, he sold control of the company to General Motors Corp. for $2.5 billion and received $700 million in a buyout. In 2008, EDS was sold to Hewlett-Packard Co.

Perot went on to establish another computer-services company, Perot Systems Corp. He retired as CEO in 2000 and was succeeded by his son, Ross Perot Jr. In 2009, Dell Inc. bought Perot Systems.

In September 2011, Forbes magazine estimated Perot's wealth at $3.5 billion and ranked him No. 91 on its list of richest Americans.

The presidential candidate -- an independent U.S. senator from Vermont who is seeking the Democratic Party's 2020 nomination -- has been advocating for a $15-an-hour national minimum wage but his staffers have complained they make less than that because they work so many hours, according to The Post.

“Given our campaign’s commitment to fighting for a living wage of at least $15.00 an hour we believe it is only fair that the campaign would carry through this commitment to its own field team,” a letter to campaign manager Faiz Shakir read.

“Many field staffers are barely managing to survive financially,” the letter says, “which is severely impacting our team’s productivity and morale” It also says some staffers have already left the campaign for that reason.

Sanders also expressed frustration that his staffers had aired their salary complaints to the media, according to The Register. “It is really not what labor negotiations are about, and it's improper,” he said."
8,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-to-propose-rule-that-would-cut-3-1-million-people-from-food-stamp-program-report,2,"The Trump administration is set to propose a rule Tuesday that would cut about 3.1 million Americans from the food-stamp program in an effort to save taxpayers about $2.5 billion a year, reports said.

The U.S. has seen low levels of unemployment, which is seen as a major factor in low levels of participation in the program. President Trump tweeted earlier this month that food stamp use is at a 10-year low. Politifact verified the claim.

Reuters, citing the U.S. Department of Agriculture, reported that residents in 43 states who receive help from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, automatically enroll in the food-stamp program, known as the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP.

The USDA intends to review these TANF cases to see if participants qualify for the program.

“This proposal will save money and preserve the integrity of the program,” Sonny Perdue, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, said in a conference call. “SNAP should be a temporary safety net.”

SNAP, which was formerly known as the Food Stamps Program, is a federal program that provides grocery assistance for people out of work or with low incomes living in the U.S. To qualify for the program, individuals must make 130 percent or less of the federal poverty level based on the household size.

The move was criticized by Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., who told The Washington Post that the move is another attempt by the Trump administration to “circumvent Congress and make harmful changes to nutrition assistance that have been repeatedly rejected on a bipartisan basis.”

That should be Democrats' mindset heading into Robert Mueller’s appearance this week before two House committees. The greater the anticipation of the testimony, the more the letdown is apt to be.

That is because the special counsel simply is not going to give them what they crave.

DEMOCRAT SAYS HE IS 'CONVINCED' TRUMP WILL BE IMPEACHED, DESPITE FAILED HOUSE VOTES

Democrats want Mueller to say he would have charged President Trump with obstruction of justice were it not for Justice Department guidance instructing that a sitting president may not be indicted. Mueller cannot say that without contradicting his report and his statements at a late May press conference.

He is not going to do that.

Mueller abdicated on the obstruction question. Mind you, at the time he took over the Russia-gate investigation on May 17, 2017, there were already strong indications that there was no cyber-espionage conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 election. In essence, what he assumed was more an obstruction than a collusion investigation. Indeed, just days earlier, according to former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, the FBI had opened an obstruction investigation against the president based on the May 9 firing of the Bureau’s then-director, James Comey.

I never believed a special counsel was legally or factually warranted. But if we assume for argument’s sake that a special counsel was necessary, then the single central issue he was needed to resolve was: Is there a prosecutable obstruction case against the president?

Yet, after putting the country through a nearly two-year probe, Mueller declined to answer that question. The Democrats’ devout wishes notwithstanding, he cannot answer it now because of how he avoided answering it four months ago when he submitted his report.

To be sure, Mueller’s tortuous explanation is as risible as it is tough to follow.

Justice Department protocols instruct that prosecutors must not comment publicly on the evidence against uncharged persons; the government is not supposed to speak unless and until it formally charges a person with a crime, at which point the accused is entitled to all of the Constitution’s protections — assistance of counsel, discovery, the right to confront witnesses, the right to mount a defense, and so on.

I never believed a special counsel was legally or factually warranted. But if we assume for argument’s sake that a special counsel was necessary, then the single central issue he was needed to resolve was: Is there a prosecutable obstruction case against the president? Yet, after putting the country through a nearly two-year probe, Mueller declined to answer that question.

In light of those protocols, the special counsel claimed that the DOJ guidance against indicting a sitting president could be terribly unfair to President Trump. (Yes, Mueller would have us believe he was looking out for the president!) After all, if Mueller were to recommend charges, the DOJ guidance would mean there could be no formal charge; therefore, the president would in effect stand accused of a crime, yet be denied all the Constitution’s protections. Mueller says he solved this imaginary dilemma by resolving not to confront the question of whether the president should be charged.

Now, there are more holes in the special counsel’s story than in a block of Swiss cheese.

1. Despite the fact that there are no formal charges and thus the president is bereft of the due process rights, Mueller issued a 400-plus page report outlining mounds of evidence, which he demanded be made public. It’s a bit cheeky of him to claim he was worried about prejudicing the president, no?

2. The DOJ guidance should have played no part in Mueller’s decision on whether to recommend obstruction charges. Federal regulations call for the special counsel to file a confidential report to his superior, the attorney general, explaining his reasoning for rendering a decision either to charge or to decline to charge.

That is a question about the sufficiency of the evidence. If Mueller had decided there was enough evidence to charge the president, it would then be up to the attorney general to determine (a) whether to accept the recommendation and (b) whether to invoke the DOJ guidance to postpone an indictment until after the president is out of office. If Mueller had decided to recommend charges, he would not have been prejudicing the president unfairly because the report to the AG is supposed to be confidential. If the AG later decided to accept or reject Mueller’s recommendation, to invoke the DOJ guidance, and/or to make the report public, that would not be Mueller’s concern. Like Bill Belichick says: Do your job. Mueller’s only job was to make a confidential recommendation: to charge or not to charge. He didn’t do it.

Mueller’s failure to make a recommendation on obstruction, as explained in the report and in his press conference, is incoherent. On the other hand, if one believes, as I do, that Mueller’s objective was to get his report to Congress, Mueller’s abdication makes perfect sense.

3. The guidance does not say a president may never be indicted; it says the president may not be indicted while he is in office. Consequently, regardless of the timing of any potential indictment, the prosecutor still has to decide whether there is enough evidence to charge. There is no excuse for a prosecutor to investigate for two years then not make the decision.

4. If Mueller’s position was that the DOJ guidance meant he could not make the charging decision, then why did he accept the assignment?

5. If Mueller’s position was that the DOJ guidance meant he could not make the charging decision, then why did he make the charging decision on the collusion question, finding no conspiracy?

6. If Mueller’s position was that the DOJ guidance meant he could not make the charging decision, why did he tell Attorney General Barr (in their first meeting, weeks before Mueller submitted the report) that his decision not to make a recommendation on obstruction was not driven by the DOJ guidance?

Mueller’s failure to make a recommendation on obstruction, as explained in the report and in his press conference, is incoherent. On the other hand, if one believes, as I do, that Mueller’s objective was to get his report to Congress, Mueller’s abdication makes perfect sense.

The special counsel and the attorney general clearly do not agree on the principles of obstruction law as applied to the president. If Mueller had recommended charges, there would have been a brawl at the Justice Department over what those principles are, and how they applied to President Trump’s conduct. The release of the report would have been delayed, and the Justice Department would have rejected and discredited Mueller’s legal theory.

By deciding not to recommend charges, Mueller got his report released swiftly and intact — the Justice Department having decided it was not worth debating obstruction law if Mueller was not advocating an indictment. And by being cagey about the role the Justice Department guidance played in his decision-making, Mueller fueled the Democrats’ claim that the president would have been indicted were it not for the guidance. Of course, Mueller didn’t say that, but what he said was close enough to boost the political narrative.

The problem for Democrats is that they have now had their political narrative but it has largely fallen flat. Americans were told for two years that Trump had conspired with Russia. Once Mueller conceded that there was no such conspiracy, the public had decidedly less interest in the obstruction aspect of the investigation.

As a practical matter, the obstruction angle cannot be revived unless Mueller proclaims that, after carefully weighing the evidence, he decided there was a prosecutable obstruction case against President Trump but he was prohibited by the Justice Department guidance from indicting it. Mueller, however, has already asserted — in the report and in his press conference — that this is not what happened.

Moreover, he has emphatically stated that the report is his testimony, and he is neither going to contradict it nor revisit its reasoning. As the special counsel put it at his press conference, ""That is the office’s final position, and we will not comment on any other conclusions or hypotheticals about the president.""

Democrats are stuck with that answer. The record could get worse for them if Mueller’s testimony goes poorly. It is not going to get better.

11,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mueller-in-capitol-hill-testimony-says-no-trump-russia-conspiracy-no-trump-exoneration-on-obstruction,2,"Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller faced a barrage of criticism Wednesday from House Republicans for his handling of the collusion and obstruction investigations into President Trump, as his fiery congressional hearing gave the probe's detractors a rare chance to confront him.

At the same time, the highly anticipated testimony offered little in the way of new revelations. Far from an operatic rendition of the Mueller report that Democrats hoped would paint a clear picture of pernicious misconduct by the president, the testimony resembled more a spoken-word album -- halting, at times awkward, with scant dramatic flair.

The result of hours of grueling hearings before two House committees -- like the report itself -- was ambiguous. Mueller at times appeared flustered, often asking lawmakers to repeat questions, while referring back to the report or stating topics were outside his purview whenever questioners sought to drag him outside the bounds of his written findings.

MUELLER FLUSTERED, ASKS LAWMAKERS TO REPEAT QUESTIONS

Mueller notably declared Wednesday that, despite Trump's assertions to the contrary, the report does not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. Defending his probe, Mueller told House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., “It is not a witch hunt.""

And in a moment that could keep Democrats digging, Mueller replied, ""yes,"" when Colorado GOP Rep. Ken Buck on the Judiciary Committee asked if the president could be charged with a crime after he left office. Pressed if the president could be charged with obstruction after he left office, Mueller again replied: “Yes.""

Still, Mueller stood by his findings that there was no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians during the 2016 election. Schiff, in the second hearing of the day, charged that Mueller’s report found that the Trump campaign “welcomed” Russia’s interference in the election. Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., followed by quipping, ""Welcome everyone to the last gasp of the Russian collusion conspiracy theory.""

Much of the hearing, though, provided a forum for Republicans to fume at Mueller over the way he conducted the other part of his probe, on the obstruction component.

Republicans argued prosecutors should only bring charges in such a case -- and would have no business saying whether someone is innocent, in questioning the section of his report stating that while the probe did not establish Trump committed a crime, it also did not exonerate him.

REPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE

“Can you give an example other than Donald Trump where the Justice Department determined an investigated person was not exonerated because their innocence was not conclusively determined?” Texas Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe asked Mueller.

“I cannot, but this is a unique situation,"" Mueller replied.

Ratcliffe shot back: “The special counsel’s job didn’t say you were to determine Trump’s innocence or to exonerate him.” He added: “Respectfully, it was not the special counsel’s job to conclusively determine Trump’s innocence.”

Another member of the House Judiciary Committee, Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, told Mueller he “perpetuated injustice” for spending two years investigating the president. ""What he's doing is not obstructing justice; he is pursuing justice,"" he said.

Ohio Rep. Steve Chabot called the report a “one-sided attack” on the president, as he demanded answers about the origins of the Russia probe, claiming anti-Trump bias at the time among top officials of the Justice Department.

Democrats -- amid a push from liberals to impeach Trump – have argued the report proves the president worked to hinder the probe. Under questioning House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., Mueller flatly replied “no” when asked if his report totally exonerates the president, as Trump has argued.

MUELLER SAYS HE IS 'NOT FAMILIAR' WITH FUSION GPS, THE FIRM BEHIND THE STEELE DOSSIER

""The president was not exculpated,"" Mueller said, also adding that Trump refused to sit for an interview with his investigators.

Mueller's investigation looked into Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey, his ousting of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and anti-Mueller comments allegedly made by Trump to then-White House counsel Don McGahn.

“Although Department policy barred you from indicting the president for this conduct, you made clear that he is not exonerated,” Nadler told Mueller. “Any other person who acted this way would have been charged with a crime. And in this nation, not even the president is above the law.”

In an attempt to prove obstruction, Florida Democratic Rep. Val Demings asked Mueller about the president's responses to questions from his team, asking, “Isn’t it fair to say the president’s written answers were not only inadequate and incomplete because he didn’t answer many of your questions, but where he did, his answers showed that he wasn’t always being truthful?”

Mueller replied: “I would say generally.”

Republicans pushed back on the obstruction accusation, repeatedly arguing Trump was not guilty of the underlying offense of coordination with Russia during the 2016 election. House Judiciary Committee ranking member Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., asked Mueller if his probe was “curtailed or stopped or hindered” at any point. Mueller replied, “no.”

Mueller said at the outset of the hearing he wouldn’t discuss the origins of the FBI's investigation into the president, saying he won’t be “able to answer questions about certain areas that I know are of public interest.” Pressed by Republicans about the anti-Trump dossier paid for by Democrats, authored by ex-British spy Christopher Steele and commissioned by firm Fusion GPS, Mueller repeatedly refused to discuss the issue, saying, “This is outside my purview.”

The dossier of claims about Trump's relationship with Russia was provided to the Justice Department at the early stages of the investigation. Republicans have demanded answers about the origins of the Russia probe, claiming anti-Trump bias at the time among top officials of the Justice Department.

He also repeatedly declined to answer questions about Joseph Mifsud, the mysterious Maltese professor believed to have played a key role in igniting the Russia probe. Investigators say he was the one who told then-Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos in April 2016 that the Russians had “dirt” that could damage Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Mueller's report said Mifsud told the FBI inaccurate information. “I can’t get into it,” Mueller said.

Mueller acknowledged, under questioning from Republicans, being friends with former FBI director James Comey. He also addressed anti-Trump texts sent by then-FBI agent Peter Strzok, saying he moved to ""swiftly"" reassign Strzok from the probe when he learned of them. He fired back at a Republican lawmaker who questioned the Democratic ties to some on his team, saying, ""I've been in this business for almost 25 years, and in those 25 years, I have not had occasion once to ask somebody about their political affiliation. It is not done.""

Mueller affirmed his finding of no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians during the 2016 election

“The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” Mueller said. “We did not address ‘collusion,’ which is not a legal term. Rather, we focused on whether the evidence was sufficient to charge any member of the campaign with taking part in a criminal conspiracy. It was not.”

“We found insufficient evidence of the president’s culpability,” Mueller added.

Mueller started his day with testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, before heading for more questioning in front of the House Intelligence Committee, where Democrats had high hopes for the hearings. On Capitol Hill, the hearing on Wednesday drew a large crowd of spectators, including anti-Trump activists.

“I wanted to watch history unfold,” said Alethea Shapiro of New York. “Hopefully nailing the coffin nailing Trump’s coffin shut finally once and for all. Collusion, obstruction, crimes.""

But in between hearings, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted: ""The last three hours have been an epic embarrassment for the Democrats. Expect more of the same in the second half.""

The president has repeatedly decried Mueller’s probe as a “witch hunt,” emphatically denying he or his campaign colluded with Russia to undermine Democrat Hillary Clinton’s chances in the 2016 race, or that he worked to obstruct the investigation. In the hours before the hearing, the president fired off a spate of tweets accusing Mueller of being conflicted and protesting his request for Aaron Zebley, his top aide on the probe, to join him at the witness table Wednesday.

“So Robert Mueller has now asked for his long time Never Trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers,” Trump tweeted. “What’s this all about? His lawyer represented the “basement server guy” who got off free in the Crooked Hillary case. This should NOT be allowed. Rigged Witch Hunt!”

Nunes, at the beginning of the Intelligence Committee hearing, also protested Zebley’s appearance, saying Republican members wouldn’t ask him questions. Schiff countered that it was fine for Zebley to appear, saying Trump – the ""angry man down the street"" – must not have wanted him there.

Earlier this week, the Justice Department sent Mueller a letter telling him to keep his upcoming testimony to House lawmakers ""within the boundaries"" of the public version of his report. The letter provoked criticism from Democrats ahead of Wednesday’s hearing, with Nadler calling it “incredibly arrogant.” But Attorney General Bill Barr told Fox News on Tuesday that it was former Mueller’s team who asked for guidance ahead of the hearing.

Mueller submitted his report to the Justice Department in March; a redacted version was later released to the public in April.

Mueller has only spoken in public once about his investigation: in May, Mueller made clear his disinterest in testifying before lawmakers, saying, “Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report.""

Mueller’s investigation, which was initially ordered to look into the 2016 election in May of 2017, took place over nearly two years. It expanded to probe financial crimes of Trump associates before the election, conversations Trump’s national security adviser had with the Russians during the transition and whether Trump obstructed justice with his comments and actions related to the probe.

Mueller, the former director of the FBI under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, was appointed special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May of 2017. Mueller’s team indicted, convicted, or won guilty pleas from 34 people and three companies as part of an investigation that has also probed issues unrelated to the 2016 campaign.

Trump told reporters he believes “this will really help” with the situation at the border.

“This is a very big day,” he said.

The agreement would require migrants, including Salvadorans and Hondurans, who cross into Guatemala on their way to the U.S. to apply for protections in Guatemala instead of at the U.S. border. It could potentially ease the crush of migrants overwhelming the U.S. immigration system and hand Trump a concession he could herald as a win as he struggles to live up to his campaign promises on immigration.

The announcement comes after a court in California blocked Trump's most restrictive asylum effort to date, one that would effectively end protections at the southern border.

The two countries had been negotiating such an agreement for months, and Trump threatened Wednesday to place tariffs or other consequences on Guatemala if it didn't reach a deal.

It's not clear how the agreement will take effect. Guatemala's Constitutional Court has granted three injunctions preventing its government from entering into a deal without approval of the country's congress.

OVD-Info said 779 people were detained. Moscow police earlier said 295 people had been taken in, but did not immediately give a final figure.

The protest was organized by opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, 43, who was arrested Wednesday and sentenced to 30 days in jail. Other opposition politicians were detained on Saturday, including Ilya Yashin, Dmitry Gudkov and Ivan Zhdanov.

Yashin's Facebook page said that 10 masked officers took him from his apartment in Moscow the night before the demonstration. After being arrested, Navalny said on Instagram, ""I have been detained and am now at a police station wearing shorts like a stupid man,""

The opposition politician names were reportedly not included on the ballot because they had not received enough signatures to qualify, according to election officials. Supporters of the opposition party say the government is forcing them out, so they won't be able to participate in the elections.

Helmeted police barged into Navalny's video studio as it was conducting a YouTube broadcast of the protest and arrested program leader Vladimir Milonov.

Gilroy Chief of Police Scot Smithee told reporters Monday afternoon the attack at the Gilroy Garlic Festival resulted in the deaths of a male in his 20s, a 13-year-old female and a 6-year-old.

“Despite the fact that they were outgunned with their handguns against a rifle, those three officers were able to fatally wound that suspect,” Smithee said, describing how officers among those already at the event to provide security engaged the gunman less than a minute after the first shots rang out.

“It could have gotten so much worse, so fast,” he added.

WITNESSES RECALL CHAOTIC SCENE AS SHOTS RANG OUT

Police believe Legan legally purchased the rifle in Nevada on July 9 before returning to California with it at some point. A motive for the shooting has yet to be determined.

“Mass gun violence is an epidemic in the United States yet one can never imagine such a thing would happen here in our beautiful community,” Gilroy Mayor Roland Volasco said.

Volasco also hailed police for their quick response, saying the officers “undoubtedly saved many lives by putting their own lives in danger.

“It takes remarkable bravery to run to a shooting when the natural reaction for all of us is to run away,” he added.

Smithee said the gunman gained access to the festival by cutting through a fence near a creek area. He said some witnesses reported a second suspect, but police could not immediately confirm those reports and it was unclear if that person also had a weapon or may have been providing some support to the shooter.

The band TinMan was just starting an encore at the festival when shots rang out.

Singer Jack van Breen said he saw a man wearing a green shirt and grayish handkerchief around his neck fire into the food area with what looked like an assault rifle. Van Breen and other members of the band then dove under the stage.

During the chaos, Van Breen says he heard someone shout: ""Why are you doing this? ""and the reply was: ""because I'm really angry. ""

""We are praying for those who are recovering right now in the hospital, some very, very serious injuries. We thank the brave members of law enforcement -- they never let us down -- who swiftly killed the shooter.""

""He had his whole life to live,"" Alberto Romero, the boy's father, told NBC Bay Area.

Ryan Wallace, a witness, told the channel that he watched the gunman -- who was almost dressed like a police officer -- raise his gun up and started to “spray rounds.” The gunman walked through the crowd, he said.

“He wanted to get stuff done,” he said. “It was horrifying.”

Personal videos posted to Twitter appeared to show large crowds evacuating the festival. Many witnesses said the shots sounded like fireworks and there initially was confusion over the source of the noise.

WINNER: Elizabeth Warren

Who had a memorable message? I always look for a message that is going to stick. After the cameras go off and we are left to think about the candidates, who created a lasting impression? Sadly, no one from last night will have a message that will stick. We might get some great “yada yada yada” gifs and memes from Marianne Williamson, but those aren’t going to move the needle and change the game. The Democrats better hope they do better tonight.

WINNER: No one

Who framed their policy in a way that stands out? In 2015 and 2016 Donald Trump was a master at this. He didn’t talk about strengthening immigration, he talked about building walls. Like it or not, voters remembered his policies and what he stood for. Who is going to be able to do that this time? Bernie Sanders has done it before and he did it again. Medicare for all. Climate change as a result of corporate greed. Immigration around racism and xenophobia. Sanders policies are framed in the language that gets repeated by other candidates. For this reason, Bernie won the night.

WINNER: Bernie Sanders

Who surprised us? Going into the debates we expect a lot from certain candidates. Last night, Bernie Sanders was the one to watch. We had high expectations and he did exactly what we expected him to do. He out-Bernied Bernie. But who surprised us? I would argue the surprise of the night was Elizabeth Warren. While her loyalists already knew what the rest of us just got to see, she was likable, prepared, and ready to fight.

WINNER: Elizabeth Warren

What didn’t they say? Sometimes it’s as interesting to focus on what wasn’t said as what was. What wasn’t talked about: impeachment. Unlike other debates, this wasn’t a fight against Trump. This was a fight against each other. This was a fight over who the Democratic party is going to be. This was a battle of moderates versus progressives. And in this battle, the progressives won. The moderates didn’t have a single message or position that will stand out.

WINNER: The progressives

We have a long way to go until the Democratic Party chooses its nominee but each debate matters. Each candidate’s performance will determine if we see them again.

With so much riding on it, it’s surprising that there were so many forgettable candidates. The one stand-out performance came from Elizabeth Warren and I predict that she is the only candidate who will move in the polls."
17,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/castro-getting-called-out-from-both-sides-after-outing-trump-donors,2,"Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro is facing a mounting backlash -- and not just from Republicans -- for posting the names and employers of dozens of Trump campaign donors in the San Antonio area, even as the Texas congressman defends his actions.

Prominent figures from outlets including MSNBC and The New York Times have called out Castro for the potentially dangerous post.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN BLASTS DEM REP FOR TRYING TO NAME AND SHAME DONORS: 'DELETE & APOLOGIZE'

“This is dangerous, by any campaign,” Times reporter Maggie Haberman tweeted in response to a post from the Washington Examiner’s David Drucker. Haberman specifically said she did not want to retweet the image herself “because I don’t want to put these people’s names in my feed.”

Journalist Yashar Ali called it “awful,” and said, “The campaign of a member of congress targeting individual donors, and their businesses, to another campaign (and not famous billionaires) is a terrible and dangerous precedent to set.”

The Texas congressman's original tweet included a list of San Antonio residents who had donated large amounts to the Trump campaign, along with the names of their employers. It is unclear who actually compiled the list.

“Sad to see so many San Antonians as 2019 maximum donors to Donald Trump,"" Castro tweeted, along with the Twitter handles of several owners of local businesses who apparently donated to Trump. “Their contributions are fueling a campaign of hate that labels Hispanic immigrants as ‘invaders.’”

MSNBC’s Willie Geist pointed out the risk during a Wednesday morning interview with Castro, who is the campaign chairman for his brother, 2020 presidential hopeful Julian Castro.

“What do you say to those people this morning who said I made a campaign donation and now I’m going to be harassed, I’m going to have people protesting outside my business or perhaps even my home … what do you want from them?” Geist asked.

Castro said his intention was not to put anyone in danger, claiming, “I don’t want anybody harassed.”

“But they will be because you put their names in public,” Geist said.

Castro again said, “That was not my intention,” and Geist again insisted, “But that’s what will happen.”

JOAQUIN CASTRO DOUBLES DOWN ON OUTING TRUMP DONORS: 'NO ONE WAS TARGETED OR HARASSED'

When Geist pointed out that “there are 11 retirees and one homemaker,” who are on the list, Castro simply said, “I didn’t make the graphic.”

Several prominent Republicans also slammed Castro for the post, including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who is from Castro’s home state. Cruz said that what Castro did is “wrong” and that “elected representatives should not be vilifying & doxxing their own constituents.”

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called it “shameful and dangerous,” and implied that Castro was motivated by his brother Julian's presidential campaign.

“Targeting and harassing Americans because of their political beliefs is shameful and dangerous,” McCarthy said. “What happened to 'when they go low, we go high?' Or does that no longer matter when your brother is polling at 1%? Americans deserve better.”

“How low have Dems sunk?” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh tweeted. “This is Joaquin Castro, Congressman & chair of his brother’s campaign. Naming private citizens & their employers, targeting them for their political views and exercising 1st Amendment rights.”

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, who was the victim of a politically motivated shooting in 2017, also flagged the tweet.

“People should not be personally targeted for their political views. Period,"" Scalise tweeted Tuesday. ""This isn’t a game. It’s dangerous, and lives are at stake. I know this firsthand."""

Chinese authorities likened the protest to ""terrorism.""

A crowd of thousands ""seriously disrupted"" operations at the airport, officials said in a statement. Only flights that were already boarding or had been cleared for landing were allowed to use the airport's runways. All other flights were canceled.

US, CHINA SPAR OVER HONG KONG AFTER 'THUGGISH REGIME' REMARKS AS ACTIVISTS LAUNCH LATEST AIRPORT PROTEST

For more than two months, Hong Kong has experienced mass protests urging democratic reforms and an investigation into police conduct.

The city's government, which is supposed to be separate from communist China's influence, introduced an extradition bill that critics say would threaten the liberties awarded to the city and would allow people to be extradited to face the law in mainland China.

The bill was temporarily suspended following protests. The demonstrations, however, morphed from an uproar over the specific extradition proposal into a more general demand for greater freedoms and a check on the perceived use of excessive force by the authorities.

China on Monday used the strongest language yet to vilify the participants, with the Cabinet's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office in Beijing saying the protests are ""beginning to show the sprouts of terrorism"" and constitute an ""existential threat"" to the population of Hong Kong.

""One must take resolute action toward this violent criminality, showing no leniency or mercy,"" said a statement from spokesperson Yang Guang. ""Hong Kong has reached an inflection point where all those who are concerned about Hong Kong's future must say 'no,' to lawbreakers and 'no' to those engaged in violence.""

HONG KONG FACES WORST CRISIS IN 20 YEARS, SENIOR CHINESE OFFICIAL SAYS

Earlier Monday, Hong Kong police showed off water cannons that could be deployed in the case of future demonstrations, a development which Amnesty International has warned could lead to serious injuries if the canons are misused within the densely-populated city's confined spaces.

Hong Kong is a former British colony that's been part of China since 1997, but which benefits from autonomy, crediting a ""one country, two systems"" approach. The structure allows the city certain democratic rights that are not afforded to people on the mainland — but, in recent years, some people have accused the Communist Party-ruled central government of slowly stripping their freedoms.

Ma Ngok, a political scientist at Chinese University of Hong Kong, told the South China Morning Post heavy-handed tactics from police have alienated people.

“They have lost confidence in the police enforcing the law fairly and would question the legitimacy of all their actions,” he said. “They no longer think it’s reasonable to blindly obey the law when there is no punishment for the officers’ wrongdoings.”

19,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/donald-trump-bill-clinton-jeffrey-epstein-suicide-theory,2,"President Trump added fuel to the conspiracy theories surrounding multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein's apparent suicide on Saturday when he retweeted a post that implied former President Bill Clinton was linked to Epstein's death.

The tweet came from self-described comedian Terrence K. Williams who echoed many on social media in suggesting a connection between the Clintons and Epstein, who previously was an acquaintance of the former president.

""Died of SUICIDE on 24/7 SUICIDE WATCH ? Yeah right! How does that happen,"" the tweet read, alongside a photo of Epstein and one of the Clintons. ""#JefferyEpstein had information on Bill Clinton & now he’s dead I see #TrumpBodyCount trending but we know who did this! RT if you’re not Surprised.""

JEFFREY EPSTEIN DEAD FROM APPARENT SUICIDE IN MANHATTAN JAIL CELL; FBI INVESTIGATING

Trump's tweet came shortly after Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., pushed back on the ""immediate rush to spread conspiracy theories about someone"" in another political party.

Williams' video argued that ""for some odd reason, people with information on the Clintons end up dead and they usually die from suicide."" ""C'mon now,"" he continued incredulously on the video.

The Associated Press reported that Epstein had been placed on suicide watch after an incident last month in which Epstein was found with bruising on his neck, though it has never been made clear whether those injuries were the result of a suicide attempt or an assault by a fellow inmate. However, a Bureau of Prisons spokesman told the New York Post Saturday that Epstein was not on suicide watch at the time of his death and AP reported he had been taken off suicide watch at the end of last month.

The well-connected financier was indicted last month on federal sex trafficking charges and faced up to 45 years in prison.

On Saturday, Trump's Justice Department announced it would pursue an investigation into Epstein's death. “I was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody.

""In addition to the FBI’s investigation, I have consulted with the Inspector General who is opening an investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein’s death."""
20,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/israel-may-bar-omar-tlaib-from-entering-country-for-support-of-bds-movement,2,"Israeli officials have decided to block U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from entering the country as part of a planned visit, a reversal that comes amid pressure from President Trump and concerns about their support for boycotts of Israel.

The move prompted a massive outcry from Democratic lawmakers in Washington, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling it a ""sign of weakness"" and Omar accusing Israel of implementing ""Trump’s Muslim ban.""

HOUSE OVERWHELMINGLY OKS RESOLUTION OPPOSING ISRAEL BOYCOTT IN RARE BIPARTISAN VOTE

""It is an affront that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, under pressure from President Trump, would deny entry to representatives of the U.S. government,"" Omar said in a statement.

But the Israeli government staunchly defended the decision -- suggesting the lawmakers had ulterior motives with the planned trip.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, explaining the decision at length on his office's Twitter account, said that Tlaib and Omar's itinerary ""revealed that they planned a visit whose sole objective is to strengthen the boycott against us and deny Israel's legitimacy.""

Netanyahu said their travel plans referred to a trip to ""Palestine,"" not Israel, and the congresswomen were not interested in meeting with Israeli officials. He went on to note that the Palestinian organization that planned the visit, MIFTAH, supports the boycott movement, and that people associated with the group have supported terror against Israel in the past.

He said Israel welcomes critics with the exception of those who support boycotts of the Jewish State.

The decision itself was made by Interior Minister Arye Deri and announced earlier Thursday by deputy foreign minister Tzipi Hotovely, despite prior assurances that the congresswomen would be allowed in.

""Israel has decided — we won’t enable the members of Congress to enter the country,” Hotovely told public broadcaster Kan. ""We won’t allow those who deny our right to exist in this world to enter Israel. In principle, this is a very justified decision.""

Omar and Tlaib were among 17 members of Congress who voted against a resolution condemning the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement in July. This was after Omar introduced a resolution of her own that encouraged the use of boycotts as a political tool, and told Al-Monitor that ""it is an opportunity for us to explain why it is we support a nonviolent movement, which is the BDS movement.""

Netanyahu confirmed that Deri would consider permitting Tlaib to visit her Palestinian family members if she filed a humanitarian request and promised not to promote boycotts of Israel while she visits.

Trump cheered the decision, tweeting: ""Representatives Omar and Tlaib are the face of the Democrat Party, and they HATE Israel!"" This, after he publicly pressured Israel to stand firm in blocking Omar and Tlaib amid earlier reports that the government was considering doing so.

""It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep. Omar and Rep.Tlaib to visit,"" Trump tweeted Thursday morning. ""They hate Israel & all Jewish people, & there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds. Minnesota and Michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office. They are a disgrace!""

But while the U.S. ambassador to Israel put out a statement of support for the decision, Democratic lawmakers and even Israel's Washington allies were critical.

Notably, pro-Israel lobby AIPAC tweeted that while they disagree with Omar and Tlaib's positions, ""We also believe every member of Congress should be able to visit and experience our democratic ally Israel firsthand.""

Democrats expressed strong opposition to keeping Omar and Tlaib out.

""Banning Congresswomen Omar and Tlaib from entering Israel and Palestine is a sign of enormous disrespect to these elected leaders, to the United States Congress, and to the principles of democracy,"" presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a tweet. ""The Israeli government should reverse this decision and allow them in.""

Another presidential candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., weighed in before the decision was formally announced.

""Israel doesn't advance its case as a tolerant democracy or unwavering US ally by barring elected members of Congress from visiting because of their political views,"" Warren tweeted, saying it would be ""shameful"" and ""unprecedented.""

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., blasted the decision as well.

""I strongly condemn this decision by the Israeli government, which undermines the ability for our two allied countries to have the frank, open and, at times, difficult discussions that we must have in order to ensure Israel remains a secure and democratic nation,"" Nadler said.

MIFTAH issued a statement saying that Israel's decision was ""an affront to the American people and their representatives"" and ""an assault on the Palestinian people's right to reach out to decision-makers and other actors from around the world.""

Israeli media reported earlier on discussions of barring the freshman congresswomen due to their support for the anti-Israel BDS movement. Israeli law says those supporting boycotts of the country may be denied entry.

Waivers can be granted for diplomatic figures, however, Haaretz reported. And in July, Israel’s U.S. ambassador said the country would not bar U.S. lawmakers out of “respect” for Congress and Israel’s longtime “alliance” with the U.S. Trump expressed frustration about the decision last week, The Washington Post reported.

Netanyahu, though, also faced pressure from Democratic leaders and some U.S.-based Israel advocacy groups that were advising against barring the congresswomen, the Post reported.

The Jerusalem Post reported Thursday that Netanyahu met Wednesday with Deri, Foreign Minister Israel Katz, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, National Security Council leader Meir Ben-Shabbat, and Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit to discuss the matter.

On Thursday, before the formal denial, Israeli Channel 13’s Barak Ravid reported that, according to officials, Netanyahu had been considering allowing Tlaib and Omar to enter Israel, but only to travel within the territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority.

Tlaib and Omar had been scheduled to arrive in Israel on Friday. Ravid reported for Axios that Israel was worried that the congresswomen would visit the Temple Mount – the holiest site for Jews and third holiest for Muslims – along with Palestinian Authority officials.

Philadelphia’s KYW-TV reporter Alexandria Hoff described on Twitter Wednesday night how a crowd of people bordering the blocked off active shooter scene allegedly harassed officers.

""I mentioned this at 10 and since I was harassed during that live shot, I’ll mention it here, too,"" Hoff said on Twitter. ""A major moment of disappointment this evening was watching a crowd of people taunt police officers, laughing and yelling at them in the midst of the gunfire.""

“I should add -- 98% of people here on scene were respectful and concerned. That moment was just such a startling thing to see in the middle of something so chaotic,” she added in a separate tweet.

In another video posted by Breaking911, one woman can be seen shoving an officer from behind as he passes through the crowd. Others in the crowd yell and throw objects at police as they enter the blocked off area amid the active standoff scene.

Several officers with the Narcotics Strike Force were serving a warrant at the multifamily home -- in connection with what may have been a drug-related offense -- when things ""went awry almost immediately,"" and the shooter opened fire, Police Commissioner Richard Ross Jr. said.

The dramatic shootout in Philadelphia stretched on for more than eight hours as six officers were shot. Two officers were trapped on the second floor of the building as the gunman shot through the first-floor ceiling and outside at responding law enforcement.

After withstanding more than five hours of gunfire, SWAT officers managed to get the two officers and three hostages out of the residence safely.

""Given the continuing movement and the number of people involved, I am grateful that this was a largely peaceful event,"" Mayor Ted Wheeler told reporters. ""Police did an exemplary job of de-escalating the situation, keeping the extremists on both sides separate for the most part, and of limiting interactions between individuals.""

TRUMP THREATENS TO DESIGNATE ANTIFA A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AHEAD OF EXPECTED PORTLAND CLASHES

At least 13 people were arrested. Police Chief Danielle Outlaw said at a press conference that possible charges against those arrested include disorderly conduct, interfering with police, resisting arrest, possession of a weapon in a park and unlawful use of a weapon.

Earlier in the day, police tweeted images of weapons it had seized from multiple groups, including bear spray, shields and metal and wooden poles.

""At this time, we know of six force-events involving officers,"" Outlaw said. ""There was one instance where an officer deployed pepper balls. The other instances involved take-downs or control against resistance.""

Six people suffered minor injuries and one of them was taken to a local hospital. Another individual was treated for a medical condition unrelated to the demonstrations, police spokeswoman Lt. Tina Jones said.

Flag-waving members of the Proud Boys and Three Percenters militia group began gathering late in the morning, some wearing body armor and helmets. Meanwhile, black-clad, helmet and mask-wearing Antifa members were also among the several hundred people on the streets. The groups gathered on both sides of the Willamette River, which runs through the city.

Authorities used sound trucks and loudspeakers to remind demonstrators of both sides to stay out of the streets or they would be arrested. They also set up concrete barriers and closed streets and bridges in an effort to contain and separate the rival groups.

Roughly 700 law enforcement officials from local, state and federal agencies, including the FBI, were in the city for the right-wing rally, which was expected to draw people from across the country. Portland Police said all of the city's 1,000 officers would be on duty for the gathering that was hyped on social media and elsewhere for weeks.

Not all who gathered Saturday were with right-wing groups or Antifa. Also on hand were people dressed in colorful outfits and those who attended a nearby prayer service, holding signs that had slogans such as ""No Trump, No NRA.""

Police formed a physical barricade beneath the Morrison Bridge in Tom McCall Waterfront Park to separate the rival groups from sparring. The Proud Boys and their supporters were on the south side of the divide while the counter-protesters remained on the north side, according to reports by The Oregonian.

TRUMP THREATENS TO DESIGNATE ANTIFA A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AHEAD OF EXPECTED PORTLAND CLASHES

FOX 12 Oregon and The Oregonian newspaper reported that some of the demonstrators began to leave in the early afternoon, with authorities briefly re-opening the Hawthorne Bridge to allow them to pass. Police used officers on bikes and in riot gear to prevent members of Antifa from following them. The Oregonian reported that a group of left-wing demonstrators attacked a bus carrying a group of Proud Boys out of downtown Portland, breaking some windows.

""The Proud Boys contacted us or contacted the units on the ground saying that they wanted to leave and so we facilitated for them to leave the area,"" Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Brandon White told the newspaper. ""It wasn’t planned. It wasn’t orchestrated. We had a request that they would like to leave the area and so we facilitated.""

But hundreds of people remained downtown and on nearby streets, and there were skirmishes throughout the day. At around 4:15 p.m., police declared a gathering of mostly left-wing protesters near Pioneer Courthouse Square a ""civil disturbance"" and told people to leave.

Later in the afternoon, The Oregonian also reported that a group of left-wing counter-demonstrators had surrounded two people wearing American flag-themed clothing and were ""taunting, threatening, and chasing them.""

Among those attending the demonstration was Patriot Prayer's Joey Gibson, who organized similar rallies in 2017 and 2018 that erupted in clashes. Gibson surrendered Friday on an arrest warrant for felony rioting but was released on bail hours later.

""I’m just here for the ride,"" Gibson told The Oregonian.

Organizer Joe Biggs told the paper that the demonstrators ""wanted national attention and we got it.""

""Go look at President Trump’s Twitter,” Biggs said. “He talked about Portland, said he’s watching Antifa. That’s all we wanted ... Mission success.""

President Trump tweeted Saturday morning that he is considering designating Antifa a domestic terror group.

""Major consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an ‘ORGANIZATION OF TERROR,’” Trump said. “Portland is being watched very closely. Hopefully the Mayor will be able to properly do his job!”

Late Saturday, the Proud Boys issued a statement vowing to return to Portland every month until Wheeler “takes charge and removes the scourge of violent domestic terrorists from his city,” referring to Antifa.

Wheeler responded Saturday night by imploring Biggs to think about the millions of dollars in taxpayer money used to police and provide security for demonstrations. The mayor also said that Biggs' rhetoric was stoking an ""environment of fear nationally.""

""We do not want him here in my city. Period,"" Wheeler said.

Wheeler's message was similar to his warning to protesters on both sides prior to the demonstrations.

""We don't want your hatred, we don't want your violence, but if you come here, we're going to be prepared,"" he said in an interview on Fox News' ""Outnumbered Overtime"" on Friday.

""Again, when it comes to enforcement of our community standards, we support people's rights to demonstrate, but we don't care about who you are or your politics are,"" he said. ""If you engage in violence in this city, you will be held accountable.""

23,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-cancels-visit-denmark-pm-greenland,2,"President Trump on Tuesday abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, saying there was no point to the trip after Frederiksen called the idea that the U.S. might buy Greenland from Denmark ""absurd"" -- and insisted there would be no Copen-haggling about it.

Trump had been expected to visit Denmark on Sept. 2-3 as part of his trip to Europe, but until his tweets Tuesday, there were no solid indications the visit to Denmark was centered on buying Greenland.

""Denmark is a very special country with incredible people, but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen’s comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time,"" Trump wrote.

""The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct,"" he added. ""I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!""

The White House later clarified that the entire trip to Denmark had been scrapped, including a planned meeting with the Queen of Denmark.

Commentators immediately reacted with surprise, saying they were under the impression the visit to Denmark would involve other topics of conversation.

""Breaking my vacation Twitter hiatus to say that I am amazed the purpose of the Denmark trip was actually to purchase Greenland,"" wrote Washington Post reporter Seung Min Kim.

""Art of the arctic deal?"" joked another Washington Post reporter, Josh Dawsey.

Even the U.S. ambassador to Denmark was caught flat-footed. Just hours before Trump's pullout, Ambassador Carla Sands tweeted, ""Denmark is ready for the POTUS @realDonaldTrump visit! Partner, ally, friend.""

The Wall Street Journal first reported last week Trump was interested in buying Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory under Danish control with a population of approximately 56,000.

According to the paper, Trump asked his advisers about acquiring the island during “meetings, dinners and passing conversations” because of Greenland's “abundant resources and geopolitical importance.”

The U.S. made a somewhat similar effort to buy Greenland in 1947, albeit without the razzle-dazzle of social media.

The idea led some left-wing commentators to mock the White House, but most found humor in the moment -- and, in something of a fourth-wall-breaking moment, Trump himself appeared to join in on Monday, tweeting a meme originally credited to Ricochet editor-in-chief Jon Gabriel.

The meme depicted a lavish Trump skyscraper looming over a mostly empty village in Greenland.

The president captioned the image, ""I promise not to do this to Greenland!""

But, Greenland is not on the market in any event, Frederiksen said.

""Greenland is not Danish. Greenland is Greenlandic. I persistently hope that this is not something that is seriously meant,"" Frederiksen told reporters Sunday during a trip to meet Kim Kielsen, the premier of Greenland

Speaking to reporters in New Jersey this past Sunday, Trump compared the proposal to ""a large real estate deal.""

""A lot of things can be done. It’s hurting Denmark very badly because they're losing almost $700 million a year carrying it,"" he said. ""So, they carry it at great loss, and strategically for the United States, it would be nice. And, we're a big ally of Denmark and we help Denmark, and we protect Denmark.""

Walsh blasted the president for his social media habits and general behavior.

NEWEST ANTI-TRUMP REPUBLICAN JOE WALSH TRIES TO SHED HISTORY OF INCENDIARY REMARKS

""I'm running because he's unfit; somebody needs to step up and there needs to be an alternative,"" Walsh said. ""The country is sick of this guy's tantrum -- he's a child.""

At the same time, Walsh recognized that he himself is guilty of the same behavior as the president, and even played a part in the division in Washington that led to Trump's election.

""I helped create Trump,"" the Tea Party favorite told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in an interview that aired Sunday morning. ""I feel responsible for that.""

Walsh claimed that Trump was ""tweeting us into a recession"" and warned that ""he'll tweet us into war.""

Stephanopoulos called out Walsh for making outlandish statements of his own, including calling former President Barack Obama a Muslim and an enemy. Walsh said Trump ""made me reflect on some of the things I've said in the past,"" acknowledging that at times he ""went beyond the policies and idea"" and ""said some ugly things about President Obama that I regret.""

When asked if he truly believes what he said about Obama, Walsh responded, ""God no, and I have apologized for that.""

During the same interview, however, Walsh made a series of personal attacks against President Trump.

""He's nuts, he's erratic, he's cruel, he stokes bigotry,"" Walsh said. He accused Trump of not caring about America, saying, ""the only thing he cares about is Trump.""

Walsh also cited Trump's 2016 campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border and to have Mexico pay for it, which has not happened.

""He’s incompetent. He has no freakin’ clue what he’s doing,"" Walsh said.

The Trump campaign had far fewer words in response to Walsh's announcement.

Walsh, who served one term in Congress, acknowledged that he has very little chance of defeating the president in the primaries, but said he wants to promote a different direction for the Republican Party.

26,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/china-announces-it-seeks-end-to-trade-war-as-markets-tank-and-currency-hits-11-year-flatline,2,"China signaled Monday it is now seeking a ""calm"" end to its ongoing trade war with the U.S. and President Trump voiced optimism about a deal, as Asian markets crumbled and China's currency plummeted to an 11-year low following the latest tariffs on $550 billion in Chinese goods announced last Friday by the Trump administration.

""I think we're going to have a deal,"" Trump told reporters.

Trump said Monday that officials from China called U.S. officials and expressed interest to ""get back to the table,” The Wall Street Journal reported. He called the discussions a “very positive development.”

“They want to make a deal. That’s a great thing,” he said.

News of the possible opening in negotiations came shortly after Trump threatened to declare a national emergency that would result in American businesses freezing their relationships with China. Trump's tariff barrage on Friday was a response to China imposing its own retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion in U.S. goods.

At the Group of Seven summit in France on Sunday, White House officials rejected suggestions the president was wavering and insisted that his only regret was not implementing even more tariffs on China. Trump wrote on Twitter that world leaders at the G-7 were ""laughing"" at all the inaccurate media coverage of the gathering.

In response, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He told a state-controlled newspaper on Monday that ""China is willing to resolve its trade dispute with the United States through calm negotiations and resolutely opposes the escalation of the conflict,"" Reuters first reported, citing a transcript of his remarks provided by the Chinese government. Liu is China's top trade negotiator.

Speaking at a technology conference in China, Liu added: “We believe that the escalation of the trade war is not beneficial for China, the United States, nor to the interests of the people of the world.""

“We welcome enterprises from all over the world, including the United States, to invest and operate in China,” Liu said. “We will continue to create a good investment environment, protect intellectual property rights, promote the development of smart intelligent industries with our market open, resolutely oppose technological blockades and protectionism, and strive to protect the completeness of the supply chain.”

Asian shares tumbled early Monday, with Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 started plummeting as soon as trading began and stood at 20,234.87 in the morning session, down 2.3 percent. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 1.5 percent to 6,427.20. South Korea's Kospi lost 1.7 percent to 1,916.14. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.3 percent to 25,309.37, while the Shanghai Composite was down 1.2 percent at 2,862.87.

The yuan also slipped to 7.1487 to the dollar, weeks after the Treasury Department formally designated China a currency manipulator. The Treasury Department said it will work with the International Monetary Fund to try to rectify the “unfair competitive advantage created by China’s latest actions.”

""The gloves are coming off on both sides and as such yuan depreciation is an obvious cushion against US tariffs,"" Mitul Kotecha, an economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, told Bloomberg News.

There are several reasons why China's central bank would want to allow the yuan to drop, including to help struggling local exporters who want their products to be less expensive for international purchasers. People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang, however, has insisted China does not ""engage in competitive devaluation.""

On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters that if ""China would agree to a fair and balanced relationship, we would sign that deal in a second.""

Stephen Innes, managing partner at Valour Markets in Singapore, compared the difficulty of assessing the volatile market situation to reading tea leaves.

""Nobody understands where the president is coming from,"" he said, adding that the best thing Trump can do for market stability is to ""keep quiet.""

""The problem that we're faced right now is that we are making a lot of assumptions ahead of the economic realities.""

The market is now dominated by fears of a portending U.S. recession, although the American economy is actually holding up, and much of the U.S. economy is made up of consumption, Innes said. If interest rates come down, he added, consumer spending is likely to go up, working as a buffer for the economy.

""What the market's really waiting for is for them to drop interest rates,"" Innes said. ""Right now, we are still sitting on that uncertainty.""

Meanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Sunday that Democrats should not criticize Trump for taking on China over trade as they have complained for years about Beijing’s policies but done nothing. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, for example, has urged Trump to fight China aggressively.

“Every Democrat and every Republican of note has said China cheats,” Graham said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.” “The Democrats for years have been claiming that China should be stood up to, now Trump is and we’ve just got to accept the pain that comes with standing up to China.”

U.S. markets have also taken something of a beating. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 600 points Friday after the latest escalation in the trade war between the U.S. and China rattled investors. The broad sell-off sent the S&P 500 to its fourth straight weekly loss.

The tumbling began after Trump responded angrily on Twitter following China's announcement of new tariffs on $75 billion in U.S. goods. In one of his tweets he ""hereby ordered"" U.S. companies with operations in China to consider moving them to other countries — including the U.S.

PUZDER: HERE'S HOW TRUMP'S FULL-COURT PRESS ON CHINA IS WORKING

Trump also said he'd respond directly to the tariffs — and after the market closed he delivered, announcing that the U.S. would increase existing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods to 30 percent from 25 percent, and that new tariffs on another $300 billion of imports would be 15 percent instead of 10 percent.

""Starting on October 1st, the 250 BILLION DOLLARS of goods and products from China, currently being taxed at 25 percent, will be taxed at 30 percent,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Additionally, the remaining 300 BILLION DOLLARS of goods and products from China, that was being taxed from September 1st at 10 percent, will now be taxed at 15 percent. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"".

Zhu Huani of Mizuho Bank in Singapore said what he called Trump's ""tariff tantrum"" was setting off ""the sense that tariffs could continue to rise,"" with the ""the unpredictability of timing and extent of these trade actions risk accentuating the paralysis of business decisions and big-ticket business spending.""

""No matter which way you cut the cake, it is nearly impossible to construct a bullish, or even neutral scenario for equity markets today,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda.

Trump also said Friday morning that he was ""ordering"" UPS, Federal Express and Amazon to block any deliveries from China of the powerful opioid drug fentanyl. The stocks of all three companies fell as traders tried to assess the possible implications.

The president has also raged against Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell for his continued refusal to cut interest rates, at one point saying: ""My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powel (sic) or [China's] Chairman Xi [Jinping]?""

That outburst came after Powell, speaking to central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., gave vague assurances that the Fed ""will act as appropriate"" to sustain the nation's economic expansion. While the phrasing was widely seen as meaning interest rate cuts, he offered no hint of whether or how many reductions might be coming the rest of the year.

Some analysts, however, are confident the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates this year.

A quarter-point rate cut reduction in September is considered all but certain.

27,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-doral-g-7,2,"Next year’s G-7 meeting is set to be held in Doral, Florida, a senior administration official told Fox News, after President Trump made a strong pitch over the weekend to world leaders to have the summit at his resort outside of Miami.

Trump himself also strongly suggested Monday that next year’s meeting will be held at his Trump National Doral Golf Club, as he hyped the property’s close proximity to Miami’s airport and the facilities available for the staff of world leaders and the press.

“With Doral, we have a series of magnificent buildings, we call them bungalows,” Trump said during a press conference in France. “We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants, it’s, like, such a natural.”

He added: “Each country can have their own villa.”

WHITE HOUSE: TRUMP'S 'SECOND THOUGHTS' ON CHINA TRADE WAR 'GREATLY MISINTERPRETED'

Trump has apparently been pushing for months to have his Doral resort host the 2020 G-7 meeting, but his advisers have cautioned against it amid concerns about the ethics of the president personally profiting off an official government event.

“My people looked at 12 sites,” Trump said. “They went to places all over the country and came back and said ‘this is the place.'""

Since assuming office, the president has faced repeated pushback from a number of his aides regarding his official visits to properties he owns in New Jersey and Florida. They are worried about the appearance that Trump is using taxpayer dollars to turn a profit at his own resorts.

Trump, who has not divested from his properties, spends many weekends at his resorts in either Florida or New Jersey and has regularly dined at his organization’s restaurant in Washington D.C. A Washington Post analysis found that the president’s trips to his properties have brought his businesses at least $1.6 million in revenue since he took office – mostly from federal officials and GOP campaigns who follow Trump.

While the Constitution prohibits presidents from taking “emoluments,” or payments, from foreign states, Trump says that clause refers to a ban on outright bribes, not business transactions, and that he will continue to do business with foreign governments at his hotels.

Trump said on Monday that he would not be making any money off the next G-7 meeting, adding that he has lost “billions” of dollars since becoming president from lost financial opportunities.

“I used to make money off giving speeches. Now, I make speeches all the time and you know how much I make? Zero,” Trump said.

The president added: “From my standpoint, I’m not going to make any money…I don’t want to make any money.”"
28,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-inspector-general-says-comey-violated-policies-with-memos-documenting-private-conversations-with-trump,2,"A scathing inspector general report released Thursday said that fired FBI Director James Comey violated bureau policies by drafting, leaking and retaining memos documenting private discussions with President Trump.

The Justice Department's official watchdog concluded that the memos Comey kept were, in fact, ""official FBI records,"" and said Comey set a ""dangerous example"" with his actions.

READ THE IG REPORT ON COMEY

""By not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his FBI employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees—and the many thousands more former FBI employees—who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information,"" the report stated.

While the findings of the probe were forwarded to the DOJ, the department has declined prosecution, as Fox News reported earlier this month. But for Comey, who has cultivated the image of a by-the-book and irreproachable leader since his termination in 2017, the review shined a harsh light on his decisionmaking in the final, beleaguered weeks of his tenure at the head of the nation's top law enforcement agency.

The 83-page document outlined a series of violations, including that he broke FBI policies and the bureau's employment agreement ""by providing one of the unclassified memos that contained official FBI information, including sensitive investigative information, to his friend with instructions for the friend to share the contents of the memo with a reporter.""

Further, the IG determined that Comey kept copies of four memos (out of the total seven he drafted) in a personal safe at home after his removal as director -- and in doing so ""violated FBI policies and his FBI Employment Agreement by failing to notify the FBI that he had retained them."" The IG said Comey again violated the rules ""by providing copies ... of the four memos he had kept in his home to his three private attorneys without FBI authorization,"" and by failing to alert the FBI once he learned one of the memos contained sections later deemed classified at the confidential level.

Comey's GOP critics slammed the former FBI boss in the wake of the report. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, called his actions ""disgraceful.""

The report repeatedly and pointedly alleged that Comey wrongly violated policies for personal reasons -- in this case, in order to spur a special counsel probe.

""[E]ven when these employees believe that their most strongly-held personal convictions might be served by an unauthorized disclosure, the FBI depends on them not to disclose sensitive information. Former Director Comey failed to live up to this responsibility,"" the report said.

For his part, Comey zeroed in on a section that said he didn't leak classified material directly to the media -- and urged his critics to tell him ""sorry we lied about you.""

The inspector general's separate, broader review of potential intelligence community surveillance abuses remains ongoing. Earlier this month, it emerged that IG Michael Horowitz had referred Comey's case to the DOJ for a possible criminal prosecution, but that lawyers opted against bringing charges -- with one source telling Fox News it ""wasn't a close call.""

Comey admitted to Congress during testimony in June 2017 that, after he was fired, he purposefully leaked several memos through an intermediary to ensure that a special counsel would be appointed. Comey specifically leaked his memos to a friend, Columbia Law School Professor Daniel Richman, who now serves as Comey's legal counsel. Richman ultimately leaked the contents of the memo to The New York Times.

The media firestorm that followed the leak proved a watershed moment that led to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's appointment.

""Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a Special Counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure,"" the inspector general report stated. ""What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.""

The inspector general report revealed that former FBI agent Peter Strzok spoke to Richman after Comey admitted sharing his memos. Strzok, according to the report, urged Richman to ""please preserve"" anything Comey had given him. Richman told the inspector general that after his initial conversation with Strzok, he had multiple conversations with members of the FBI about the ""mechanics"" and ""logistical complexities"" of retrieving Comey's memos from his computer.

By June 13, 2017, FBI agents went to Richman's home in New York to remove his desktop computer and returned it only after they took steps ""to permanently remove"" the memos from it. According to the report, the FBI agents also assisted Richman in deleting the text message with photographs of Comey's memo--specifically ""memo 4""--from his cell phone.

Public outrage centered on the news that Comey wrote in one of his memos that Trump had told him, ""I hope you can let this go,"" amid reports that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had lied to the FBI and senior White House officials about his contacts with Russia's government.

'Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees.' — IG report, on Comey's actions

Flynn later pleaded guilty to one count of lying to FBI agents in the White House.

Although Comey said he wrote the memos so that they would not contain classified information, two of his memos--memos ""1"" and ""3""--contained information later classified at the ""SECRET"" level. Memos ""2"" and ""7"" contained small amounts of information classified at the ""CONFIDENTIAL"" level. The FBI designated memos ""4, 5, and 6"" remained unclassified--""For Official Use Only.""

Comey, whom Trump fired in May 2017, denied that sharing the memos with his legal team constituted a leak of classified information. Instead, he compared the process to keeping “a diary.”

“I didn’t consider it part of an FBI file,” Comey told Fox News' Bret Baier last year, referring to the memos. “It was my personal aide-memoire…I always thought of it as mine.""

According to the report, Comey reviewed his memos on the back porch of his home on June 7, 2017, after the FBI provided them to him. His first reaction was that some of the classification markings seemed ""reasonable"" and some seemed ""overly conservative."" Comey took issue with the classification markings on ""memo 2,"" noting that he ""did not see how release of that [information] damages the security of the United States.""

Despite Comey's comments last year claiming that he considered his memos ""personal,"" the inspector general's report stated that: ""As Comey well knew, classified information is never considered personal property; rather, it is the property of the U.S. government.""

Comey's memos included a slew of other secretive information, including the ""code name and true identity"" of a confidential source, according to a court-ordered filing by the Justice Department earlier this year.

Comey meticulously outlined ""foreign intelligence information obtained from and through"" the key human source, ""information about whether the FBI initiated coverage through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) on a particular individual,"" relevant ""sources and methods"" used in the FBI's investigation, as well as ""information concerning the President's foreign policy decisionmaking,"" according to the DOJ.

All of that information is ""currently and properly classified,"" the DOJ said.

Horowitz first publicly confirmed last year that his office was investigating Comey for his handling of classified information related to the memos."
29,https://www.foxnews.com/health/juul-ceo-vaping-illness,2,"The CEO of the popular e-cigarette company Juul called the nearly 200 cases of vaping-related illnesses “worrisome” — but said his popular products will stay on the market ""until we see some facts.”

Speaking to ""CBS This Morning,"" Kevin Burns addressed the series of vaping-related lung illnesses reported in at least 22 states that have resulted in dozens of hospitalizations and at least one death.

The cases are “worrisome for the category,” Burns told the outlet. “Worrisome for us if we contributed to it.”

E-CIGARETTES DAMAGE BLOOD VESSELS EVEN IF DEVICES DON’T CONTAIN NICOTINE, STUDY FINDS

Though state and federal health agencies — namely the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — are investigating the cases, it’s not yet clear what may be behind the illness or if they are related to Juul devices, specifically.

""We'd like to get all the specifics that we can. We want to make sure we have access to the information, so if there's any issue that was driven, associated with us, that we can get to the root cause and understand that,” Burns said, noting Juul is in “close contact” with the CDC as it investigates the mysterious illnesses.

When asked by “CBS This Morning” co-host Tony Dokupil why Juul isn’t planning to “take a timeout” from distributing its products as the investigation continues, Burns noted some of those sickened across the states also reported vaping THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that produces the “high” sensation, prior to their hospitalization.

""Most of them that have any specifics have said they're related to THC,"" Burns said. ""We don't have the details on all those reports.”

That said, “If there was any indication that there was an adverse health condition related to our product, I think we'd take very swift action associated with it,” he added.

Burns noted he plans to keep Juul products on the market “until we see some facts.”

Burns joined Juul in 2017, about two years after the company was launched. Juul’s products, which make up about 40 percent of the e-cigarette industry, were created to help adults quit smoking.

DOZENS OF MIDWEST TEENS WHO REPORTED VAPING HOSPITALIZED WITH 'SEVERE LUNG INJURY,' BREATHING PROBLEMS

In July, Burns apologized to parents whose children are addicted to the Juuls.

“First of all, I’d tell them that I’m sorry that their child’s using the product,” Burns told CNBC for the documentary, “Vaporized: America’s E-cigarette Addiction.”

“It’s not intended for them. I hope there was nothing that we did that made it appealing to them,” Burns added. “As a parent of a 16-year-old, I’m sorry for them, and I have empathy for them, in terms of what the challenges they’re going through.”

Juul has been slammed in recent months due to the product’s popularity among teens.

In June, San Francisco took a step to curb teen vaping addiction by banning the sales of e-cigarettes. Critics said Juul contributed to the vaping epidemic by promoting its products through advertising campaigns showing young models.

The negative health effects associated with cigarettes and cigars have long been documented, leading to a decline in both among teens in the U.S. in recent years.

In 2018, for example, the CDC reported roughly 1 in 50 – about 1.8 percent – middle school students said they smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days, down from 4.3 percent in 2011 and a drastic decrease from 36.4 percent in 1997, when rates “peaked after increasing throughout the first half of the 1990s,” according to the American Lung Association.

But the same is not true for e-cigarette use. In 2018, nearly 1 of every 20 middle school students (4.9 percent) reported using electronic cigarettes in the past 30 days. That's an increase from less than 1 percent in 2011.

Last year, the Surgeon General of the United States, Jerome Adams, declared vaping among American teens an “epidemic.""

VIRGINIA SEES 3 VAPING-RELATED ILLNESS CASES, HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY

""This is an unprecedented challenge,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in response at the time.

Though e-cigarettes are often touted as a ""safer"" alternative to cigarettes, a recent study found that may not be true.

The study, led by University of Pennsylvania researchers, claimed there are damaging effects on a user’s blood vessels after just one use.

Thirty-seven percent of those questioned in a Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday said the economy’s getting worse, with 31 percent saying conditions are getting better.

That’s a switch from Quinnipiac’s June poll, when by a 39-23 percent margin, those questioned said the economy was improving.

WARREN OUTPACES SANDERS IN TWO NEW NATIONAL 2020 POLLS, BIDEN REMAINS CLEAR FRONT-RUNNER

As the Republican president runs for re-election in 2020, he constantly touts the robust health of America’s economy. Last week Trump told reporters “we're in such a strong economic position. We're, right now, the No. 1 country anywhere in the world by far as an economy.”

Sixty-one percent of those polled described the current state of the economy as good or excellent. But that's down from 70 percent in June.

And the survey suggests that by a slight 41-37 percent edge, the voters feel Trump’s policies are hurting the economy.

“Roughly 4 in 10 voters blame the President's policies, saying they are hurting the economy, the highest level since Trump took office,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow highlighted.

NEW POLL SUGGESTS AMERICANS CONCERNED ABOUT LEGITIMACY OF 2020 ELECTION

While the president’s overall approval rating has long been underwater in most polls, his numbers on the job he’s doing handling the economy have always been respectable. But the new Quinnipiac poll puts Trump’s approval on the economy at 46 percent, with his disapproval at 49 percent.

The poll comes amid recent concerns over an escalating trade war with China, a slowing global economy, and worries about a possible impending recession in the U.S. Trump has rejected those warnings as overblown and cheered on by his critics.

""As trade tensions with China dominate the headlines, confidence in the economy is slipping,"" Snow emphasized.

The same poll, meanwhile, showed Trump losing to all top Democratic presidential candidates in a hypothetical general election. The poll showed 54 percent supporting former Vice President Joe Biden and just 38 percent backing Trump in such a matchup. The survey showed Sens. Bernie Sanders of Virginia, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California all beating Trump by double digits, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading by nine points.

A dip in public confidence in the economy could be an electoral disaster for Trump – who’s been banking on a surging jobs market and strong economic growth to win the support of crucial independent and moderate voters in next year’s general election.

Responding to recession fears, the president and his top advisers have accused Democrats of trying to cause a recession to weaken his political standing. And he’s also pointed fingers at the Federal Reserve for failing to drop U.S. interest rates.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted Aug. 21-26, with 1,422 registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

The changes will reduce Walmart’s market share of ammunition from around 20 percent to a range of about 6-9 percent, according to the memo. Of its nearly 5,000 U.S. stores, about half sell firearms.

The announcement comes just days after a mass shooting killed seven people in Odessa, Texas. Two other major shootings occurred last month in Dayton, Ohio, and in El Paso, Texas, where a gunman killed 22 people inside a Walmart.

In response to the shootings, Walmart also asked that customers no longer openly carry firearms into its stores or Sam’s Clubs in states where ""open carry"" was permitted unless law enforcement authorized it. However, McMillon noted that the store wouldn’t change its policy and approach regarding concealed-carry permits.

“We encourage our nation’s leaders to move forward and strengthen background checks and to remove weapons from those who have been determined to pose an imminent danger,” the statement said.

Walmart reminded customers that it has changed its policy regarding firearms sales in the past, including stopping the sale of military-style rifles such as the AR-15, raising the age limit to purchase firearms or ammunition to 21, and requiring a “green light” on background checks.

McMillon apologized to well-intentioned customers who may be inconvenienced by the new policies but said he hoped they understood the reasoning behind the decisions.

“All countries have violent and hateful people, but only in America do we give them ready access to assault weapons and large-capacity magazines thanks, in large part, to the National Rifle Association’s influence,” the resolution says.

The document resolves to assess the relationships that those who do business with the city have with the group and says “the City and County of San Francisco should take every reasonable step to limit those entities who do business with the City and County of San Francisco from doing business with this domestic terrorist organization.”

The resolution cites the July mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival, in which three people were killed. KTVU reports that the resolution’s author wrote the text after that shooting.

The NRA responded by calling the resolution a stunt that was distracting from the city’s myriad of social problems.

The measure comes as Democrats across the country are ramping up calls to crack down on gun ownership, in response to deadly mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and western Texas. Some presidential candidates have proposed mandatory buyback programs, notably Beto O'Rourke who bluntly told reporters that would be the plan.

""Unbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday,"" Trump tweeted. ""They were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people.

But the Taliban, at their strongest since their defeat in 2001 after a U.S.-led invasion, want all of the approximately 20,000 U.S. and NATO troops out of Afghanistan as soon as possible.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has been shut out of the U.S.-Taliban negotiations, and during Khalilzad's visit to Kabul this week Ghani was shown the agreement but not allowed to keep it. The Taliban have rejected negotiations with the Afghan government, seeing it as a puppet of the U.S., though it has expressed willingness to meet with Afghan officials in their personal capacity.

Ghani's government has echoed concerns by former U.S. officials that a full U.S. troop withdrawal that moves too quickly and without requiring the Taliban to meet certain conditions, such as reducing violence, could lead to ""total civil war"" such as the one that engulfed the country in the 1990s after a rapid Soviet pullout and before the Taliban swept into power.

""Peace with a group that is still killing innocent people is meaningless,” said Ghani, while presidential adviser Waheed Omer added: ""Afghans have been bitten by this snake before.""

The Taliban say that their surge in deadly attacks — including on the capitals of northern Kunduz and Baghlan provinces last weekend — is necessary to give them a stronger negotiating position in talks with the U.S., a stance that has appalled Afghans and others as scores of civilians are killed.

Thursday's explosion followed an attack late Monday that killed 16 people and over 100, mostly all civilians. Hours after the second explosion, the Taliban set off a car bomb outside an Afghan military base, killing four civilians.

The U.S. had hoped a deal with the Taliban would bring the militant group to the table for intra-Afghan talks to begin ahead of Afghanistan's presidential election on Sept. 28 — a vote that Ghani insisted must be held on time and not be swept aside by any kind of interim government. The U.S. is also seeking Taliban guarantees that they will not allow Afghanistan to become a haven from which extremist groups such as Al Qaeda and the local affiliate of the Islamic State group (ISIS) can launch global attacks.

34,https://www.foxnews.com/health/trump-teen-vaping-ban-proposal,2,"In an effort to curb teen vaping, President Trump on Wednesday said his administration is looking to ban all non-tobacco flavored e-cigarette products.

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters at the White House that officials with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will create guidelines on the ban, a process that could take months.

“The Trump administration is making it clear that we intend to clear the market of flavored e-cigarettes to reverse the deeply concerning epidemic of youth e-cigarette use that is impacting children, families, schools and communities,” Azar said in a statement. “We will not stand idly by as these products become an on-ramp to combustible cigarettes or nicotine addiction for a generation of youth.”

E-CIGARETTES DAMAGE BLOOD VESSELS EVEN IF DEVICES DON’T CONTAIN NICOTINE, STUDY FINDS

In March, the FDA issued a proposal to restrict the sale of flavored e-cigarettes. The restrictions, which have not been finalized, would affect sweet and fruity flavors, but not mint and menthol, which are also said to attract teens.

The proposed ban comes as cases of vaping-related lung illnesses have surged in recent weeks. Health officials recently said there are now more than 450 possible cases across 33 states. At least six people have died; the most recent death was reported in Kansas.

No single device, ingredient or additive has been identified at this time, though New York health officials are probing vitamin E acetate as a potential cause of some of the illnesses.

Michigan became the first state to ban flavored e-cigarettes earlier this month, while San Francisco in June took a step to curb teen vaping addiction by banning the sales of the devices.

Preceding the Trump administration's announcement, first lady Melania Trump joined a chorus of officials voicing concern over the rampant use of e-cigarette products among the nation’s youth when she posted a tweet on Monday calling for more prevention and protection against nicotine addiction.

“I am deeply concerned about the growing epidemic of e-cigarette use in our children,” she wrote. “We need to do all we can to protect the public from tobacco-related disease and death, and prevent e-cigarettes from becoming an on-ramp to nicotine addiction for a generation of youth.”

VITAMIN E ACETATE IN MARIJUANA VAPING DEVICES POSSIBLY LINKED TO DEADLY LUNG ILLNESSES, OFFICIALS SAY

The tweet ended with a mention of the Department of Health and Human Services, and quickly gained thousands of likes and retweets. Her call for action comes just days after health officials urged people to stop vaping until they can figure out why hundreds have been diagnosed with serious lung illnesses.

E-cigarettes do have the potential to help adult and non-pregnant women quit smoking, but they are not safe for youth, young adults, pregnant women or adults who do not currently use tobacco products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The agency notes that scientists still have a lot to learn about whether e-cigarettes are effective for quitting smoking, and that additional research is needed to understand long-term health effects.

A recent study led by University of Pennsylvania researchers, for instance, found there are damaging effects on an e-cigarette user’s blood vessels after just one use.

35,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-judiciary-democrats-trump-impeachment,2,"House Judiciary Democrats on Thursday took a big step in their Trump impeachment push as they set the ground rules for a formal committee inquiry -- but Republicans laughed it off as a “giant Instagram filter” to hide how divided Democrats truly are on the question.

The committee voted 24-17 to define the rules for future committee impeachment hearings. The committee is not writing articles of impeachment, and nothing is going to the floor of the House right now, but the session still holds political consequences for both sides of the aisle.

IMPEACHMENT FEVER RISES AS DEMS FACE SUMMER-RECESS PRESSURE TO GO AFTER TRUMP

""The resolution before us represents the necessary next step in our investigation of corruption, obstruction, and abuse of power,” committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said in his opening statement.

The vote allows members to show the impeachment-eager base they are moving forward. But the push has also rattled some Democrats from more moderate districts.

“It’s sucking the air out of all of the good stuff we’re doing,” Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Fla., who flipped her seat from Republican control last year, said Wednesday.

But Nadler has sought to clear the air on what his committee is actually doing, amid widespread confusion. Nadler said Thursday the panel is “engaged in an investigation as to whether to launch an impeachment investigation into President Trump.""

Nadler had previously said House Democrats are pursuing an impeachment inquiry, a remark subsequently contradicted by Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. Hoyer later released a statement saying he had misunderstood the question and that he supports Nadler.

In his opening statement Thursday, Nadler said: ""Some call this process an impeachment inquiry, some call it an impeachment investigation. There is no legal difference between these terms, and I no longer care to argue about the nomenclature.""

Nadler says the resolution at issue allows him to determine if various hearings are part of any impeachment probe, allows counsel to question witnesses at those hearings, gives the committee access to documents in executive sessions, and gives the president due process. He said that formalizing the inquest “enables us to move more effectively and quickly.”

Broadly speaking, it represents another step by Democrats toward impeachment proceedings in the wake of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. While Mueller’s team drew a blank on evidence that Trump’s campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia in 2016 -- the initial basis for the probe -- Democrats then turned to other issues including Trump's finances and alleged obstruction of justice.

But Republicans brushed off the meeting Thursday, arguing that Democrats are all bark but no bite on the subject of impeachment, making a fuss about “a simple procedure issue.” Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., compared the Democrats’ move Thursday to a “giant Instagram filter to make you appear that something’s happening that’s not.”

“The difference between formal impeachment proceedings and what we’re doing today is a world apart no matter what the chairman just said,” he said.

TRUMP PROBES ROCKET TO FRONT OF DEM AGENDA, AS PRESIDENT DISMISSES NEW ETHICS COMPLAINT

Later on, he got his social media brands mixed up, and when corrected, yelled: “Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter it doesn’t matter, we’re not in an impeachment inquiry!”

Collins claimed that the rules could have been handled “five minutes” before an actual hearing, and said it showed how out of step House Democrats are with their colleagues, and the public.

“All along they thought people were coming along with them and that the public was happy with this and other members of their own party were happy with this but somewhere down the yellow brick road they looked around and said ‘there’s not all of us here, people aren’t following anymore,’” he said.

Collins was referring to an increasingly vocal group of Democrats unhappy at the impeachment focus -- fearing it is a politically futile move and is distracting from kitchen-table issues of greater concern to voters.

But in other parts of the country, Democratic activists and left-wing lawmakers are fired up at the idea of ousting the president. Skeptical lawmakers in places like New Jersey, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania were peppered with questions during the August recess by angry Democrats demanding they back impeachment.

“You are going to give Donald Trump another four years by doing that. You are helping him. You are helping him get another four years,” Rep. Steven Lynch, D-Mass., told a furious crowd last month, according to Politico.

But Democrats are moving toward that position, even if they are not united -- at least 135 House members now support an inquiry, including 17 members of the Judiciary Committee.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has long expressed her skepticism about impeachment, urging Democrats to zero in on issues such as climate change, health care and the economy instead. Last month she was heckled by unhappy protesters at a dinner in San Francisco.

But asked by Fox News on Monday if she supported Nadler, Pelosi said: “Yes, I do.”

“I think you should characterize it for what it is, it’s a continuation of what we have been doing,” she said. “You know we all work together on these things.”

36,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nyt-kavanaugh-bombshell-goes-bust-after-2020-dems-use-it-to-call-for-impeachment,2,"The New York Times suddenly made a major revision to a supposed bombshell piece late Sunday concerning a resurfaced allegation of sexual assault by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh — hours after virtually all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates had cited the original article as a reason to impeach Kavanaugh.

The update included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim, Harmon Joyce, said she did not recall the purported sexual assault in question at all. The Times also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode.

The only firsthand account concerning the supposed attack in the original piece, which was published on Saturday, came from a Clinton-connected lawyer who claimed to have witnessed it. (The lawyer, Max Stier, did not actually provide his account directly; the Times acknowledged that ""two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier"" had relayed his supposed version of events.)

The Times' revision says: ""Editors' Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.""

Even after the revision, the Times' story still does not mention a separate revelation in the book that Leland Keyser, the friend of Christine Blasey Ford who was allegedly at the party where Kavanaugh supposedly assaulted her, had specifically rejected Ford's claims. Previously, through her attorney, Keyser had said only that she was ""unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question.”

“I don’t have any confidence in the story,” Keyser told the reporters, according to the book. ""Those facts together I don't recollect, and it just didn't make any sense.""

The Times' update came only after The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway, who reviewed an advance copy of the book, first flagged the article's omission on Twitter — prompting other commentators to press the issue.

The Times did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News seeking comment.

The paper's editors' note, meanwhile, did little to stem a torrent of criticism late Sunday.

""Should I be surprised at this point that the NYT would make such an unforgivable oversight?"" — Mark Hemingway

""Should I be surprised at this point that the NYT would make such an unforgivable oversight?"" asked RealClearInvestigations' Mark Hemingway.

Wrote the Washington Examiner's Jerry Dunleavy: ""Crazy how the 'one element' that wasn’t included in the original article was the part where the alleged victim’s friends said she doesn’t remember it happening.""

""It’s important to point out that this correction almost certainly would have never occurred if conservative media folks like @MZHemingway and others hadn’t obtained the copy of the actual book itself the same day the excerpt/article was released,"" author James Hasson said.

Throughout the day on Sunday, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker and Julian Castro, among others, declared that Kavanaugh ""must be impeached,"" citing the allegation.

The revitalized, longshot push to get Kavanaugh removed from the high court came as Democrats' apparent effort to impeach President Trump has largely stalled. Trump, for his part, suggested Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation.

The Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Clinton-linked nonprofit CEO Max Stier, ""saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.""

The Times did not mention Stier's work as a Clinton defense attorney, or Stier's legal battles with Kavanaugh during the Whitewater investigation, and simply called him a ""respected thought leader.""

According to the Times, Stier ""notified senators and the FBI about this account"" last year during the Kavanaugh hearings, ""but the FBI did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly.""

However, the Times' article also conspicuously did not mention that Pogrebin and Kelly's book found that the female student in question had denied any knowledge of the alleged episode.

""The book notes, quietly, that the woman Max Stier named as having been supposedly victimized by Kavanaugh and friends denies any memory of the alleged event,"" observed Mollie Hemingway. ""Seems, I don’t know, significant.""

'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL 'ASTERISK' ON KAVANAUGH, LAWYER ADMITS

The book reads: ""[Tracy] Harmon, whose surname is now Harmon Joyce, has also refused to discuss the incident, though several of her friends said she does not recall it.""

""Omitting these facts from the @nytimes story is one of worst cases of journalistic malpractice that I can recall,"" wrote the National Review's Washington correspondent, John McCormack, on Twitter.

McCormack wrote separately: ""If Kavanaugh’s 'friends pushed his penis,' then isn’t it an allegation of wrongdoing against Kavanaugh’s 'friends,' not Kavanaugh himself? Surely even a modern liberal Yalie who’s been to one of those weird non-sexual 'naked parties' would recognize both the female student and Kavanaugh are both alleged victims in this alleged incident, barring an additional allegation that a college-aged Kavanaugh asked his 'friends' to 'push his penis.'""

NEW YORK TIMES DELETES TWEET CALLING UNPROVOKED PENIS THRUSTING 'HARMLESS FUN'

The Times went on to note in the article that it had ""corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier,"" but the article apparently meant only that the Times had corroborated that Stier made his claim to the FBI. No first-hand corroboration of the alleged episode was apparently obtained.

Nevertheless, Democrats announced a new effort to topple Kavanaugh. Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono -- who infamously said last year that Kavanaugh did not deserve a fair hearing because he might be pro-life -- said the Senate Judiciary Committee should begin an impeachment inquiry to determine whether Kavanaugh lied to Congress.

Impeaching Kavanaugh would require a majority vote in the Democratic-controlled House, and a highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-majority Senate would then be needed to remove him from the bench. No Supreme Court justice or president has ever been convicted by the Senate, although eight lower-level federal judges have been.

The long odds didn't stop 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls from joining in on the effort.

""I sat through those hearings,"" Harris wrote on Twitter. ""Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached.""

During the hearings, Harris strongly implied that she knew Kavanaugh had improperly discussed Special Counsel Robert Mueller's then-ongoing probe with a Trump-connected lawyer.

Harris provided no evidence for the bombshell insinuation, which went viral on social media and sent the hearing room into stunned silence, even as she directly accused Kavanaugh of lying under oath.

Castro and Warren echoed that sentiment and said Kavanaugh had committed perjury.

""It’s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath,"" Castro wrote. ""He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.""

Warren wrote: ""Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.""

O'Rourke claimed to ""know"" that Kavanaugh had lied under oath, and falsely said that the new accuser was not known to Senate Democrats or the FBI last year.

""Yesterday, we learned of another accusation against Brett Kavanaugh—one we didn't find out about before he was confirmed because the Senate forced the F.B.I. to rush its investigation to save his nomination,"" O'Rourke said. ""We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached.""

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., tweeted in part, ""This new allegation and additional corroborating evidence adds to a long list of reasons why Brett Kavanaugh should not be a Supreme Court justice. I stand with survivors and countless other Americans in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin.""

Amy Klobuchar stopped short of calling for impeachment, and instead posted a picture of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford with the words, ""Let us never forget what courage looks like.""

DEM SENATOR CITES KAVANAUGH'S ALLEGED PRO-LIFE LEANINGS AS REASON TO DENY HIM A FAIR HEARING

Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, said he backed getting rid of Kavanaugh by any legal means available: ""The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable.""

As the calls mounted, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., shot back Sunday afternoon on Twitter -- and made clear that Kavanaugh wasn't going anywhere.

""The far left’s willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year’s confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate,"" McConnell wrote.

He added: ""Fortunately a majority of Senators and the American people rallied behind timeless principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence. I look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh.""

The Times' piece also stated that well before Kavanaugh became a federal judge, ""at least seven people"" had heard about how he allegedly exposed himself to Deborah Ramirez at a party.

Ramirez had called classmates at Yale seeking corroboration for her story, and even told some of her classmates that she could not remember the culprit in the alleged episode -- before changing her mind and publicly blaming Kavanaugh ""after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney,"" the New Yorker reported last year in a widely derided piece.

The Senate Judiciary Committee, then led by Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote in an executive summary of its investigation that it contacted Ramirez’s counsel ""seven times seeking evidence to support claims made in the New Yorker,"" but that ""Ms. Ramirez produced nothing in response and refused a Committee request for an interview.""

Late Sunday, Grassley's office called out the Times for omitting key details in the story published this weekend.

""@NYTimes did not contact Sen. Grassley’s office for this story. If they had, we would've reminded them of a few key public facts they omitted,"" Grassley's team wrote. ""Despite 7 attempts by staff, Ms. Ramirez' lawyers declined to provide documentary evidence referenced in the article/witness accounts to support the claims. They also declined invitations for Ms. Ramirez to speak with committee investigators or to provide a written statement.""

Additionally, the FBI separately reached out to nearly a dozen individuals to corroborate the allegations by Ford and Ramirez, and ultimately spoke to ten individuals and two eyewitnesses, but apparently found no corroboration.

The agency's investigation began after then-Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., called for a one-week delay in Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings so an independent agency could look into the claims against him. Flake said the FBI's probe needed to be limited in length to avoid derailing the proceedings with endless claims and probes going back to Kavanaugh's high school years.

Kavanaugh, predicted by Democrats during his confirmation process to be a hardline conservative, often sided with liberal justices during the Supreme Court's last term.

The president, meanwhile, accused the media of trying to influence Kavanaugh. He also went on to say that Kavanaugh should go on the offensive and take on the media for false statements.

""Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can’t let that happen!"" he tweeted.

Grassley sent several criminal referrals to the Justice Department related to alleged lies submitted to Senate investigators during Kavanaugh's confirmation process -- which could be what the president meant when he wrote Sunday that the DOJ ""should come to [Kavanuagh's] rescue.""

One of those referrals was for now-disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti and one of his clients, Julie Swetnick, regarding a potential ""conspiracy"" to provide false statements to Congress and obstruct its investigation. Swetnick's credibility took a hit as she changed her story about Kavanaugh's purported gang-rape trains, and her ex-boyfriend went public to say she was known for ""exaggerating everything.""

Swetnick and Ramirez were just two of several women who had accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct during his confirmation process. Christine Blasey Ford notably testified that Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her at a party when they were teens, and dubiously asserted that the memory was ""indelible"" in her ""hippocampus"" -- although no witnesses could corroborate her ever-changing story -- even her close lifelong friend, Leland Keyser, who Ford said had attended the party.

Keyser, according to the Times reporters' new book, did not believe Ford's story -- and refused to change her mind, despite pressure from progressive activists and Ford's friends.

""It just didn't make any sense,"" Keyser said, referring to Ford's explanation of how she was assaulted at a party that Keyser attended, but could not recall how she got home.

Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, was quoted in a new book as saying that Ford was motivated to come forward in part by a desire to tag Kavanaugh's reputation with an ""asterisk"" before he could start ruling on abortion-related cases.

""In the aftermath of these hearings, I believe that Christine’s testimony brought about more good than the harm misogynist Republicans caused by allowing Kavanaugh on the court,"" Katz said. ""He will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important.

""It is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine.""

The Federalist reported last week that Ford's father privately supported Kavanaugh's confirmation, and approached Ed Kavanaugh on a golf course to make his support clear.

Some claims that surfaced during Kavanaugh's confirmation fell apart within days. For example, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., received a call from an anonymous constituent who claimed that in 1985, two ""heavily inebriated men"" referred to as ""Brett and Mark"" had sexually assaulted a friend of hers on a boat.

The Twitter account belonging to the accuser apparently advocated for a military coup against the Trump administration. The constituent recanted the sexual assault claim on the social media site days later.

37,https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-uncovers-1-billion-in-transfers-from-offshore-accounts-to-purdue-pharmas-sackler-family,2,"The Sackler family, which owns Purdue Pharma, used Swiss and other hidden bank accounts to transfer around $1 billion from the company to themselves, the New York attorney general’s office claimed Friday.

The family stands to lose billions after a litany of lawsuits claiming that their company marketed the painkiller OxyContin as nonaddictive despite knowing otherwise.

The transfers support allegations by New York and other states that the Sacklers have worked to shield their wealth in the face of mounting legal threats.

Those transfers include $20 million from a Purdue parent company to former board member Mortimer D.A. Sackler, who then redirected the money to shell companies that own homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons, prosecutors said. Another $64 million came to Sackler from a previously unknown family trust, by way of a Swiss account.

The New York attorney general's office has already rejected a tentative settlement with the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma, arguing it does not do enough to make amends for the company’s and the Sackler’s supposed roles in kick-starting the prescription opioid crisis that has killed 400,000 Americans over the past two decades, according to the CDC.

GAMER SENTENCED TO 15 MONTHS IN FEDERAL PRISON IN DEADLY 'SWATTING' CASE

""While the Sacklers continue to lowball victims and skirt a responsible settlement, we refuse to allow the family to misuse the courts in an effort to shield their financial misconduct. The limited number of documents provided to us so far underscore the necessity for compliance with every subpoena,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James in a statement.

As part of the settlement, Purdue is likely to file for bankruptcy protection. But New York and other states have promised they will continue to pursue the Sacklers, alleging that family members drained more than $4 billion from the company over the past dozen years. The Sacklers have used a complex chain of companies and trusts to control their holdings, some located in offshore tax havens.

The Sacklers had an estimated net worth of $13 billion as of 2016, making them America's 19th-richest family, according to Forbes magazine.

This does not include the amount many believe is hidden away.

In its filing Friday, New York told a state judge that the only way it can determine the full extent of those transfers is if all those it has subpoenaed are forced to provide documents detailing their interactions with the Sackler family. James has issued subpoenas to 33 financial institutions and investment advisers with ties to the Sacklers.

Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., one of the four freshman congresswomen known collectively as the “Squad,” is planning Tuesday to introduce a resolution seeking an impeachment inquiry into Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, despite reluctance from top Democrats to pursue one and concerns about the basis for the latest accusations.

The resolution follows a New York Times report that included a new allegation of sexual misconduct from when Kavanaugh was in college -- although an editors' note later revealed that the alleged victim did not recall it taking place. In a statement, Pressley only focused on the women who came forward during Kavanaugh’s confirmation process.

“I believe Christine Blasey Ford. I believe Deborah Ramirez,” Pressley said in a statement shared by Boston.com reporter Nik DeCosta-Klipa, which Pressley retweeted from her official Twitter account. “It is our responsibility to collectively affirm the dignity and humanity of survivors.”

Pressley also used her personal Twitter account to retweet a post that included images of what appears to be text from the resolution. It calls for “Inquiring whether the House of Representatives should impeach Brett Michael Kavanaugh, Associate Justice for the Supreme Court of the United States of America,” and for the House Judiciary Committee to conduct depositions and take affidavits, serving subpoenas if necessary.

Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who heads the House Judiciary Committee, has not necessarily come out against impeaching Kavanaugh. But he made clear it was not a top priority for his committee.

Top-ranking Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., outright rejected the calls.

If that’s how we are identified in Congress, as the impeachment Congress, we run the risk that people will feel we’re ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families.”

GOP lawmakers, meanwhile, quickly rallied around Kavanaugh Monday and vowed to fight any impeachment effort.

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, the current Judiciary Committee chairman who mounted one of the most passionate defenses of Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing, called the attacks “beyond the pale.”

“My heart goes out to Justice Kavanaugh’s family for being forced to endure this ridiculous treatment once again,” he tweeted.

The original Times piece, adapted from a forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Clinton-connected nonprofit CEO Max Stier, “saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.”

By late Sunday, the paper had revised its story to include the fact that several friends of the alleged victim said she told them she did not recall the reported sexual assault in question.

Several Democratic presidential candidates, however, said that Kavanaugh should be impeached and did not back down after the editors' note and revision to the story. Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro all called for impeachment after the initial Times report.

Harris continued to push for an investigation on Monday, even circulating an impeachment petition on her Twitter account.

""To stop the far-left, you must vote in tomorrow's special election,"" Trump told attendees, before slamming Democratic candidate Dan McCready as a dangerous proponent of ""sanctuary cities"" and rolling back gun rights.

""Just recently, Mecklenburg County set free an illegal alien charged with first-degree rape and crimes against a child,"" Trump said, his voice rising. ""Support for sanctuary cities is disloyalty to American cities -- and McCready wants sanctuary cities, with all of their protections for people who are serious criminals. Tomorrow is your chance to send a clear message to the America-hating left.""

A sustained chant of ""build that wall"" broke out. ""We don't want dangerous criminal aliens roaming free in North Carolina,"" Trump responded. ""Our Republican candidate, Dan Bishop, will fight with everything he has.""

As Bishop took the podium to speak briefly during the rally, an attendee required medical attention, leading Trump to step in and halt the event for several minutes. ""Doing better?"" Trump asked. ""Good. I guess Dan's speech wasn't so good. Thank you, doctor. Thank you, law enforcement.""

Bishop then urged attendees to pray for the individual, ""because that's what we do. We pray.""

Trump separately criticized Democratic presidential candidates for saying at a recent primary debate that they would give away taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal immigrants. The Democratic field is so radical, Trump suggested, that Americans essentially have ""no choice"" but to vote to re-elect him.

The president also addressed the nation's progress in reducing opioid deaths, as well as his positive economic numbers, noting that ""more than 7 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps"" and ""nearly 600,000 Americans entered the labor force last month alone.""

""The unemployment rate for African-Americans just reached another brand-new all-time low in the history of our country,"" Trump said to applause. ""And by the way, African American-youth unemployment has also reached the lowest level ever recorded in history.""

After chants of ""four more years!"" died down, Trump added: ""The labor force participation rate for women is at the highest level now in 15 years, and soon will be 35 years, and soon, I promise, will probably end up being better than ever.""

Trump also touted the nearly 200 federal judges he has successfully appointed -- including Associate Justice on the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, whom Trump said was ""put through hell.""

""Tomorrow is your chance to send a clear message to the America-hating left."" — President Trump

The president enjoys wide popularity within the Republican Party, but a GOP defeat in the red-leaning state on Tuesday could suggest trouble for his reelection campaign. State officials ordered the special election earlier this year, and invalidated a win by GOP candidate Mark Harris in the 2018 midterms, after uncovering alleged ballot fraud efforts.

Before leaving Washington, Trump dismissed questions of whether a poor result for the Republican candidate would serve as a warning sign for 2020.

""No, I don't see it as a bellwether,"" Trump said.

Some analysts have said the fraud scandal could undercut Bishop, and undermine any attempts to draw larger lessons from the race in the state's 9th Congressional District.

However, the special election could offer clues about the mindset of Republicans in the suburbs, whose flight from the party fueled the GOP's 2018 House election losses.

The House district flows eastward from the prosperous Charlotte suburbs into rural areas hugging the South Carolina border. State officials invalidated last November's election following allegations of voter fraud by a GOP operative.

NORTH CAROLINA POLITICAL OPERATIVE FACES MORE CHARGES IN BALLOT FRAUD CASE

The district has been held by the GOP since 1963. In 2016, Trump won the district by 11 percentage points. Should Bishop defeat Democrat Dan McCready, it could give Trump room to assert that he pulled Bishop over the top. If McCready prevails or Bishop wins by a whisker, it will suggest GOP erosion and raise questions about Trump's and his party's viability for 2020.

""This will tell us if Trump can carry candidates through suburban districts or not,"" said Sarah Chamberlain, president of the Republican Main Street Partnership, which represents moderate Republicans. If not, she said, the GOP must ""work harder to address the concerns of suburban individuals, mainly women.""

Trump also praised North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who is up for re-election in 2020, and Rep. Greg Murphy, who is also up for special election on Tuesday in a solidly Republican district.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, a rival-turned-ally to the president, was also in attendance. Trump led ovations Graham as well as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Reps. David Roser, Jim Jordan, Devin Nunes, and Mark Meadows, lieutenant governor Dan Forest, and others.

Fox News personalities Diamond and Silk also received special mention as ""incredible"" individuals.

The rally was held just over 100 miles from the site of a Trump rally in July where ""send her back"" chants aimed at a Somali-born American congresswoman rattled the Republican Party. Trump later condemned the chant, which has not been repeated at subsequent Trump events.

Marshville residents Philip and Diane Ezzell, both 70, were near the front of the line Monday waiting to enter the Trump rally. Both attributed their support for Bishop to his backing by Trump.

""We like his values, and he supports Trump,"" Diane Ezzell said. ""And we don't want no socialist clowns.""

That was a reference to a TV spot by Bishop superimposing the faces of McCready and other prominent Democrats on swaying clown figures.

Cynthia Brown, of Fayetteville, 50, is also attending the rally. Brown, who is black, said supporting Trump has been ""a pretty lonely experience"" for her. She added, ""But that's OK. I'm not a follower.""

While the stakes for the House are high, Trump's trademark rallies inevitably become more about him than the local candidate, as he uses the stage to settle political scores, sharpen attacks and take on perceived foes. After a light rally schedule of late, the president will have plenty of new material to work with.

Chief among them are the White House's worries about the impact an economic downturn could have on a president who has made a strong economy his central argument for a second term. Trump advisers worry that moderate Republican and independent voters who have been willing to give him a pass on some of his incendiary policies and rhetoric would blame him — and, in particular, his trade war with China — for slowing down the economy.

WATCH: BISHOP TALKS TO FOX NEWS ABOUT THE UPCOMING ELECTION

In the hours before Monday's rally, Trump flew to coastal North Carolina to inspect the damage left by Hurricane Dorian, but bad weather forced officials to scrap those plans. Instead, he received a briefing on Air Force One where Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper told him that three deaths are connected to the storm and that some 3,500 people are without power.

At the rally, Trump praised nongovernmental organizations and agencies that have worked to help storm recovery efforts, in North Carolina and elsewhere.

McCready has not had any public events in the district with Democratic presidential hopefuls, though any such appearances by candidates jostling to appeal to liberal voters might not have helped him in the moderate area.

But former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., two rival candidates, have emailed fundraising solicitations on his behalf. Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence will also campaign in the district on Monday for the Republican.

Democrats captured 39 GOP-held House districts in the 2018 midterm elections, more than enough to give them majority control of the chamber.

Much of that turnover occurred in suburbs, largely in Democratic strongholds like California and New Jersey but also in red-leaning communities near places like Dallas, Oklahoma City and Atlanta. GOP alarm bells have been ringing about the suburbs ever since.

""I am wary of being definitive about this because the recent pictures that came out, I had not remembered,"" he said during a news conference in Winnipeg. ""And, the question is, how can you not remember that? The fact is, I didn't understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day.""

The Liberal Party leader and son of former Canada Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau also blamed his ""place of privilege"" for his actions.

""I've always acknowledged that I come from a place of privilege but now I need to acknowledge that that comes with a massive blindspot,"" he said.

During his apology, he said he has since known dressing up in blackface was ""always unacceptable.""

""I should have understood that then, and I never should have done it,"" he said.

Earlier Thursday, Trudeau, 47, faced embarrassment after a new picture and video surfaced showing him wearing blackface, the third such incident to emerge in the past 24 hours.

A video obtained by Global News showed Trudeau covered in dark makeup with his hands in the air laughing, sticking out his tongue and making faces. His arms and legs were covered in black makeup as well. The video was shot in the 1990s but it's unclear where it took place.

News of the footage came a day after Globe and Mail's Robert Fife tweeted a picture of Trudeau wearing an afro wig and singing the Jamaican song ""Day-O,"" during a talent show in the early 1990s at Jean Brebeuf High School.

It's unclear what, if any, political consequences Trudeau may face as he seeks another term. Pre-picture polls in Canada have shown him facing a serious challenge from Conservative leader Andrew Scheer.

Following Trudeau's first apology, Scheer told reporters, ""Wearing blackface is an act of open mockery and racism. It was just as racist in 2001 as it is in 2019.""

Many Liberals, some of them minorities, rallied around Trudeau on Thursday, reflecting the reservoir of goodwill over his past support of diversity.

Canadian Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan, a Liberal who is Sikh, said that what Trudeau did was wrong but that the prime minister had a record of standing up for minorities. Trudeau named Sajjan Canada’s first Sikh defense chief in 2015.

Half of Trudeau’s Cabinet is made up of women, four are Sikh and his immigration minister is a Somali-born refugee.

Greg Fergus, a Liberal member of Parliament who is black, said there was a lot of confusion and hurt in the black community but noted that the prime minister apologized.

Fergus pointed out that Trudeau had put Viola Desmond, a black woman who refused to leave the whites-only section of a Canadian movie theater in the 1940s, on Canada’s $10 bill.

""I think the real measure of the man, and I think the thing we need to be talking about, is all the amazing things we have done for diversity,"" Fergus said.

Mitzie Hunter, a Liberal who's running to lead the party in Ontario provincial politics and is black, tweeted: ""I know it is not representative of the man he is. This is a teachable moment for all of us. I accept his apology and I hope Canadians do too.""

Still, other liberals weren't ready to forgive and forget.

""I am deeply troubled by what this means to Canada. Young kids are not just going to see just one or two but multiple images of the prime minister mocking their lived reality,"" said Leftist New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh, who is Sikh. ""This is so hurtful to so many Canadians.""

Trudeau was just the latest politician to come under fire for posing in racially offensive photos.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has apparently reached a boiling point over moderate House Democrats’ caution regarding the prospect of impeaching President Trump.

The go-slow approach is personified by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, with whom Ocasio-Cortez has had an often contentious relationship since the freshman lawmaker arrived in Washington just eight months ago.

The New York Democrat told her more than 5 million Twitter followers late Saturday that the Democrats’ “refusal” to seek the removal of the president was a “bigger national scandal” than what she alleged was the president’s “lawbreaking behavior.”

JUSTIN HASKINS: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ PROVES AGAIN SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT

Calls for impeachment have grown louder from some Democrats in the wake of last week’s news that a purported “whistleblower” had expressed concern about a phone call said to have taken place between President Trump and the leader of Ukraine, in which Trump allegedly sought information about 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, whose son Hunter Biden had business dealings in Ukraine.

Soon after Ocasio-Cortez posted her Saturday comment, she received a response from James Fallows, the noted author, journalist and former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, who asserted that Ocasio-Cortez was overstating the case in criticizing members of her own party for exercising restraint regarding impeachment.

LEADING HOUSE DEM TELLS PARTY NOT TO BE 'HASTY' IN PURSUING WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGATIONS

“IMO, this is ‘false equivalence’ of its own sort,” Fallows wrote. “What Trump is doing remains objectively the biggest threat, scandal, and problem.

“Second-ranking: the silent acquiescence of the GOP Senate.

“Then: it’s time for the House to act.”

Ocasio Cortez doubled down in her response to Fallows.

“It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law,” she wrote. “It’s another to let him.

“The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It’s threatened when we do nothing about it.

“The GOP’s silence & refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is.”

Ocasio-Cortez’s online outburst followed remarks earlier in the day by fellow progressive and 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who took a veiled shot at Pelosi, the standard-bearer among Democrats of a “wait and see” approach regarding potential action against the president.

""Donald Trump did everything he could to obstruct justice,” Warren said at an event in Iowa. “I read all 448 pages [of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russia investigation] and when I got to the end, I called for the impeachment of Donald Trump.

“Congress failed to act,” Warren added, “and now Donald Trump has shown that he believes he is above the law. He has solicited another foreign government to attack our election system.”

Just over a week ago, Pelosi had lashed out at reporters when they repeatedly asked her about impeachment at a news conference.

“Impeachment is a very divisive measure,” a clearly frustrated Pelosi said, “but if we have to go there, we have to go there and we can't go there unless we have the facts. And we’ll follow the facts and follow the obstruction the president is making ... and make a decision when we’re ready.

“That’s the only question, that’s all I’m going to say about this subject, and there's nothing different from one day to the next,” she added.

The struggles experienced by the 79-year-old Pelosi, a three-decade member of Congress from California, have included frequent clashes with Ocasio-Cortez, 29, and other progressive – and aggressive – young lawmakers who were swept into office during last year’s midterm elections. The progressives’ push for far-left policies, including Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal, as well as their vocal opposition to President Trump, have been at odds with the moderates’ typically lower-key approach to getting things done.

Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to reach a truce of sorts after a closed-door meeting in July, in which both sought to ease infighting that some Democrats viewed as counterproductive. The meeting was soon followed by the departure of Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti.

But with Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter posts that began late Saturday, it appears the truce with Pelosi – at least regarding impeachment – may be over.

42,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-ukraine-aid-was-stalled-over-corruption-concerns-decries-impeachment-frenzy,2,"The Trump administration pushed back Tuesday in the wake of multiple reports that the White House froze millions in aid to Ukraine shortly before President Trump pressured the country's leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

The reports coincided with a renewed round of calls, including from more centrist Democrats, for a formal impeachment inquiry. Those calls came a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she is opening the door to that route if the administration continues to withhold a whistleblower complaint apparently related to Trump's Ukraine discussions.

FLURRY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID

Multiple administration sources confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget indeed told the State Department and Department of Defense in July that it was putting a hold on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine.

But administration sources told Fox News that the reason for the freeze on Ukrainian aid was tied to concerns about corruption. Sources said that Trump wanted to be confident that the incoming administration of Volodymyr Zelensky was going to take steps to end corruption before releasing the funding.

The aid to Ukraine also, according to sources, came up in the context of other countries and questions about whether they were paying their share.

Trump, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly later Tuesday, insisted he only sought to hold up the Ukraine aid because he “wanted other countries to pay.”

“There was no quid pro quo,” he said. “There was no pressure applied, nothing.”

The White House’s decision to release the funding ultimately was made in mid-August, after Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, called the president and said that Ukraine desperately needed the aid, according to administration sources.

The White House, at the time, was also up against an appropriation “impoundment” deadline, which meant the money would either have to be spent, or impounded. The White House would have been forced to go to court to justify the impoundment, which sources said it did not want to do.

The White House, though, has denied the allegations that the freezing of the Ukrainian aid was tied to allegations that the president asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.

“The media pushed the Russia lie for almost three years with no evidence, and now they are doing it all over again,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News. “These allegations are completely false, but because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they’ll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this President.”

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations Monday, Trump also denied linking the aid money to Ukraine’s investigative actions.

“No, I didn’t—I didn’t do it,” Trump said, also calling the Biden’s actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” and adding: “It’s very important to talk about corruption…Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

But Democrats are concerned the president may have essentially withheld money to Ukraine as leverage to seek an investigation concerning the Bidens -- which is now prompting renewed impeachment calls.

The furor began after a whistleblower complaint was reported last week that involved allegations that Trump made an unspecified “promise” to Zelensky. A person familiar with the situation told Fox News that the whistleblower in question did not have “firsthand knowledge” of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, but Democrats want to see the complaint.

SOURCE TO FOX NEWS: WHISTLEBLOWER HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUMP CALL

Joe Biden has acknowledged that during the Obama administration, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings where Hunter Biden was on the board. Trump and his allies have openly voiced concerns about the now-Democratic presidential candidate's role.

Nevertheless, Democrats have used the reports and new allegations against the president to press forward—even as it risks backfiring by exposing potential wrongdoing by Biden.

Late Monday night, a slew of key swing-district Democrats publicly offered their support for opening a formal impeachment inquiry. Seven centrist Democratic freshmen lawmakers who served in the military and national security announced in an op-ed in The Washington Post that if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for political benefit, it’s impeachable. The lawmakers included Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia.

The Democrats wrote in The Washington Post they ""do not arrive at this conclusion lightly.""

“These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent,"" the lawmakers said. “These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.”

Also, later Monday night, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell endorsed an impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry would not be an impeachment vote, but rather an investigative process that could lead to actual impeachment.

There are now 154 House Democrats who have signaled strong support for possible impeachment proceedings. (235 Democrats and 198 Republicans are in the House, with one independent -- and a majority would be required to successfully impeach the president.

43,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ukraine-call-transcript-shows-trump-sought-biden-probe-but-made-no-mention-of-us-aid,2,"The White House on Wednesday released a transcript of President Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing he sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country — but the document does not show Trump explicitly leveraging military aid as part of a quid pro quo, as Democrats have suggested in pressing forward with impeachment.

The document, declassified by Trump a day earlier, indicates that the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25 from 9:03 a.m. to 9:33 a.m. A notation on the memo says it does not represent a ""verbatim transcript"" but is based on ""notes and recollections"" of those listening and memorializing the call. It is still presented in transcript form.

The memo begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, before Trump eventually broaches the subject former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

READ THE UKRAINE CALL MEMO

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said in the phone call. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.

Trump, in the run-up to the transcript's release, was accused by Democrats of essentially pressuring a foreign power to investigate a political opponent, as Biden is now a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

On Monday, it was reported that Trump had even ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before the phone call with Zelensky, a detail that fueled impeachment calls and led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday. But the call transcript does not show Trump explicitly mentioning the aid as a bargaining chip or otherwise — though Zelensky did appear to reference military aid early in the call, when he thanked Trump for ""great support in the area of defense.""

Trump also noted early on that the U.S. has been ""very very good to Ukraine"" as he suggested the relationship is not always ""reciprocal.""

The transcript shows Zelensky eventually suggesting to Trump the Biden matter would be looked into by a new prosecutor. “He or she will look into the situation specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue, the issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and we will work on the investigation of the case.”

Trump told Zelensky he wanted his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr to get involved.

“I will have Mr. Giuliani give you call and I’m also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I’m sure you will figure it out,” he said.

A Department of Justice spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said in a statement that the attorney general was first notified of the president’s conversation with Zelensky several weeks after the call took place, “when the Department of Justice learned of a potential referral.”

“The president has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,” Kupec said. “The president has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine — on this or any other matter. The attorney general has not communicated with Ukraine — on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything related to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.”

Before the transcript was released, Democrats accused Trump of improperly using his office to pressure another country to investigate one of his chief Democratic rivals. Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said during an appearance on Fox News: ""There's no quid pro quo and there's no pressure.""

Trump has denied wrongdoing and has repeatedly referred to the impeachment push as a partisan “witch hunt.”

“Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call - got them by surprise!” the president tweeted Wednesday.

The Trump-Zelensky conversation led to a whistleblower complaint against the president, provoking the avalanche of impeachment calls from Democrats.

But the Justice Department – in a new letter from the Office of Legal Counsel obtained by Fox News – is pushing back on the claim that the whistleblower brought out something of “urgent concern” that would have to be turned over to Congress.

“For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the complaint submitted to the [intelligence community inspector general] does not involve an 'urgent concern'…” It adds: “As a result, the statute does not require that the [Director of National Intelligence] transmit the complaint to the intelligence committees.”

The DOJ opinion also said the intelligence community inspector general found “some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,” but still said the allegations “appeared credible.” Fox News previously reported that, according to a source, the individual also did not have “firsthand knowledge” of the phone call.

Sources, meanwhile, said the original allegations spoke to a possible campaign finance violation, but the DOJ concluded that Trump’s request for an investigation did not qualify as a “thing of value” for his campaign – and therefore did not constitute a criminal violation.

On Tuesday night, Pelosi – who had resisted calls from the liberal base to pursue articles of impeachment – announced a formal impeachment inquiry against the president. Even without a ""quid pro quo"" illustrated in the transcript, Democrats are likely to move full speed ahead on impeachment. Wednesday’s transcript release is the first time lawmakers have seen exactly what was said in the conversation.

Democrats, though, have said they won’t be satisfied with just seeing the transcript and have said they want access to the full whistleblower report. That complaint may soon be turned over, however, as the administration weighs how to handle the document.

The transcript also shows Trump asking for a “favor” in the form of Ukraine providing information about the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.

“I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it,” Trump said.

During the call, Trump also blasted what he referred to as Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s “very poor performance” before Congress in July about the Trump-Russia investigation. Trump added, “a lot of it started with Ukraine” and asked for help in gathering information about the probe's origins. “Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible,” Trump said.

Later on Wednesday, Trump is slated to meet with Zelensky, in what will be a high-stakes moment amid the impeachment push, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The meeting was previously scheduled, unrelated to the whistleblower allegation, though the two leaders are expected to receive questions from reporters on the matter.

Trump then is expected to hold a press conference in New York in the late afternoon, where the impeachment drive is sure to be front and center.

A senior Trump administration official told Fox News that the White House has been working as quickly as it can to release to Congress the whistleblower complaint involving Trump’s conversations with the Ukrainian president, as long as it’s legally possible.

The White House has maintained that they have nothing to hide and that there has been no wrongdoing. Their general position has been that it will make everything possible available to Congress or the public regarding Trump’s call and the complaint to the intelligence community’s inspector general.

“The president must be held accountable,” Pelosi said Tuesday, citing his alleged “betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.”

44,https://www.foxnews.com/media/des-moines-register-carson-king-aaron-calvin,2,"Iowa's largest newspaper is in the middle of a firestorm after publishing a report that dug up old, offensive tweets from a local man who raised over $1 million he then donated to charity.

A piece published by the Des Moines Register profiled a 24-year-old Iowan native, Carson King, who became a TV sensation last weekend after he held up a sign at a football game asking people to donate money to him. He requested that they donate the funds through Venmo so he could buy his ""supply"" of Busch Light.

King went on to raise more than $1 million and donated the money to the University of Iowa's Stead Children's Hospital. Busch Light and Venmo pledged to match King's fundraising efforts.

The newspaper report, however, included a ""routine background check"" of King's social media history. Register reporter Aaron Calvin came across two racist jokes that dated back to 2012 when King was a 16-year-old high school student, ""one comparing black mothers to gorillas and another making light of black people killed in the Holocaust.""

King was asked about the tweets and immediately expressed remorse.

""That’s not something that I’m proud of at all,"" King told the Register on Tuesday.

He appeared on local TV stations to apologize and said, ""I am embarrassed and stunned to reflect on what I thought was funny when I was 16 years old.""

NYT REPORTERS BEHIND KAVANAUGH STORY SUGGEST KEY INFORMATION WAS REMOVED BY EDITORS

In light of the tweets, Busch Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, announced that it was severing ties with King but promised to honor its pledge.

After the piece was published Tuesday evening, critics slammed the Register for digging up the tweets.

The Register's Executive Editor Carol Hunter issued a statement responding to the backlash and shed some light on the internal discussion about whether to include details about King's social media posts.

""Should that material be included in the profile at all? The jokes were highly inappropriate and were public posts. Shouldn't that be acknowledged to all the people who had donated money to King's cause or were planning to do so?"" Hunter wrote.

Hunter went on to defend the paper's decision to include such information, noting that it was toward the bottom of the profile and not placed prominently at the top.

""The news conference was covered by local television stations, which first reported on the racist posts and King's remorse. After those stories aired, Busch Light's parent company announced it would honor its pledge to the children's hospital but would sever future ties with King,"" Hunter continued. ""That happened before the Register published its profile of King, which was still in the editing process.""

WHO-TV's Keith Murphy reported late Tuesday night that King found out at 2:16 p.m. local time that Busch Light was severing ties with him and that the press conference he held wasn't until 7 p.m., which appears to differ from Hunter's claim that local television stations were the ""first"" to report about the tweets.

This also suggests that the tweets were brought to the beer company's attention before King made public statements about them. And fingers were being pointed at the Register by critics.

ANOTHER NYT STAFFER APOLOGIZES AFTER RACIST, HOMOPHOBIC TWEETS RESURFACE

After the piece stirred up controversy on social media, critics then performed a ""routine background check"" on reporter Aaron Calvin's social media footprint and found several insensitive tweets of his own.

In now-deleted tweets from 2010-2013, Calvin repeatedly used the N-word, and wrote posts attacking law enforcement like ""f--- all cops,"" and in reaction to the legalization of gay marriage said he's ""totally going to marry a horse.""

Before locking his Twitter account, Calvin issued an apology for his own tweets.

""Hey just wanted to say that I have deleted previous tweets that have been inappropriate or insensitive. I apologize for not holding myself to the same standards as the Register holds others,"" Calvin wrote.

The Register later tweeted that it was ""aware of reports of inappropriate social media posts"" by Calvin and an ""investigation has begun.""

The CDC’s findings indicated that out of 514 patients with suspected vaping-related illnesses, 77 had self-reported that they had been using products containing THC, or using both nicotine- and THC-containing products.

THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive compound in marijuana, responsible for users' ""high"" sensation.

CALIFORNIA VAPING DEATHS, ILLNESSES PROMPT STERN WARNING FROM OFFICIALS

“CDC has made it a priority to find out what is causing this outbreak of lung injuries and deaths and we’re making progress,” CDC Director Robert R. Redfield said in a news release. “We continue to work 24/7 with state partners and FDA to protect our nation from this serious health threat.”

Of those who self-reported, 77 percent claimed to have used THC- or THC- and nicotine-containing products, while only 36 percent reported using THC-containing products only. Sixteen percent, however, said they had used only nicotine-containing products.

The CDC added that the exact cause of the current outbreak of vaping-related illnesses remains unknown, and that its investigation continues. Complicating matters is the wide variety of substances and vaping products the patients have reported using, as well as their location.

“CDC has made it a priority to find out what is causing this outbreak of lung injuries and deaths and we’re making progress."" — CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, M.D.

A report concerning 86 cases, and filed by the state health departments of Wisconsin and Illinois on Friday, had found that 57 of those patients used THC vaping cartridges produced by a brand called Dank Vapes. The report also stated that because THC products are illegal for nonmedical use in these states (and others), and the majority of these products are obtained through friends, dealers or illegal means, it's possible some patients didn't disclose what products they'd used.

Amid the CDC’s ongoing investigation, the agency is urging for the public to refrain from using vaping products, and “particularly those containing THC.”

The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), along with state and local health agencies, are still investigating the cause of the 805 vaping-related lung illness cases reported across 46 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As of Sept. 27, 12 vaping-linked deaths have been reported across 10 states.

Health departments in some states – namely New York and Utah – are also eyeing vitamin E acetate as a potential cause of illness in some residents there. Laboratory testing confirmed the substance, also known as vitamin E oil, was present in ""nearly all of the cannabis-containing samples"" obtained from some sickened patients in New York. Meanwhile, Utah health officials said 90 percent of the samples tested by a state laboratory contained the agent.

46,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-giuliani-tv-news-possible-corruption,2,"Joe Biden's presidential campaign requested in a letter on Sunday that major news networks not invite President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani anymore, after Giuliani spent the morning on a series of talk shows aggressively highlighting what he called Biden's apparently corrupt dealings in Ukraine and China.

The Biden campaign wrote to NBC News, CBS News, Fox News and CNN to voice ""grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump,"" according to The Daily Beast, which first reported the existence of the letter.

The memo, drafted by Biden aides Kate Bedingfield and Anita Dunn, continued: ""While you often fact check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough. By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.""

GIULIANI WASN'T WORKING ALONE IN BIDEN UKRAINE PROBE

Should a network choose to book Giuliani, the Biden campaign called for ""an equivalent amount of time"" to be provided ""to a surrogate for the Biden campaign."" The letter noted Giuliani was not a public official, but Trump's lawyer and personal advisor.

Responding to the request, Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted: ""Can we request the removal of Democrats on TV that push hoaxes? Wait, but then who would do the interviews?""

Hours earlier, Giuliani made the rounds on several Sunday shows, including ""Fox News Sunday,"" to argue that evidence of Biden's possible corruption has been hiding in plain sight for months.

Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire that prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where son Hunter Biden had a highly lucrative role on the board paying him tens of thousands of dollars per month, despite limited relevant expertise. The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired.

""Well, son of a b---h, he got fired,"" Biden joked at a panel two years after leaving office.

Shokin himself had been widely accused of corruption, while critics charged that Hunter Biden essentially might have been selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. Giuliani, on Sunday, suggested Shokin was the target of an international smear campaign to discredit his work.

REPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER’S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE

In a combative interview on ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday, Giuliani presented what he said was an affidavit signed by Shokin that confirmed Hunter Biden was being investigated when Shokin was fired.

""The Washington press will not accept the fact that Joe Biden might have done something like this."" — Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani

""I have an affidavit here that's been online for six months that nobody bothered to read from the gentleman who was fired, Viktor Shokin, the so-called corrupt prosecutor,"" Giuliani said. ""The Biden people say that he wasn't investigating Hunter Biden at the time. He says under oath that he was."" The Shokin affidavit purportedly said the U.S. had pressured him into resigning because he was unwilling to drop the case.

Later, Giuliani added: ""I have another affidavit, this time from another Ukrainian prosecutor who says that the day after Biden strong-armed the president to remove Shokin, they show up in the prosecutor’s office -- lawyers for Hunter Biden show up in the prosecutor’s office and they give an apology for dissemination of false information.""

After anchor George Stephanopoulos expressed skepticism, Giuliani fired back: ""How about if I -- how about if I tell you over the next week four more of these will come out from four other prosecutors? ... No, no, no, George, they won’t be [investigated], because they’ve been online for six months, and the Washington press will not accept the fact that Joe Biden might have done something like this.""

When Stephanopoulos called it ""not true"" that Hunter Biden had taken more than $1 billion from China while the U.S. was negotiating with the country, Giuliani again said the former Clinton administration official was being too dismissive.

""There's evidence that they got $1 billion directly from China, specific date, 12 days after they returned from a trip to China,"" Giuliani asserted. ""There's evidence that another $500 million went in, and there are three partners.""

Giuliani went on: ""Can I -- can I make a contrast? Can I just make a slight contrast with the so-called whistleblower? The whistleblower says I don’t have any direct knowledge, I just heard things. Up until two weeks before he did that, that wouldn't even [have] been a complaint, would have been dismissed.""

That was a reference to an explosive report in The Federalist showing that the intelligence community recently changed its form for reporting improper conduct. Earlier this year, the intelligence community's form for whistleblowers explicitly stated that complaints based on secondhand information were not actionable.

SCHIFF: AGREEMENT REACHED FOR WHISTLEBLOWER TO TESTIFY

But, that admonition was removed sometime afterward -- around the time that an unnamed whistleblower filed a complaint, based on secondhand information, alleging misconduct in the White House. Although there has been no strict legal requirement for whistleblower complaints to contain only firsthand information, the previous intelligence community form made it clear that such secondhand complaints would not be investigated as a matter of procedure.

Twitter user Stephen McIntyre originally spotted the change in the whistleblower form.

Trump and top Republicans called for answers over the weekend as to when and why the form was changed -- and whether the change was made specifically to allow the whistleblower's complaint to proceed.

Before Giuliani's interview, former Trump Homeland Security Advisor Thomas Bossert criticized Trump's communications with Ukraine, but said he did not see any evidence of an impeachable offense. Giuliani said Bossert was wrong to imply that Giuliani had ever alleged Ukraine directly participated in the hacking of Democrats' servers in 2016.

Speaking separately to Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Giuliani brought up the affidavits and called the situation Clintonesque.

“The pattern is a pattern of pay for play. It includes something very similar to what happened to the Clinton Foundation,"" Giuliani said, ""which goes to the very core of, what did Obama know and when did he know it?""

Giuliani referred to a December 2015 New York Times article about Hunter Biden, Burisma and a Ukrainian oligarch, and how the younger Biden's involvement with the Ukrainian company could undermine then-Vice President Biden's anti-corruption message.

""The question is,"" Giuliani asked, ""when Biden and Obama saw that article, about how the son was pulling down money from the most crooked oligarch in Russia, did Obama call Biden in and say 'Joe, how could you be doing this?'""

Giuliani was not the only attorney trying to get damaging information on Joe Biden from Ukrainian officials, and President Trump’s decision to withhold aid from Ukraine this summer was made in spite of several federal agencies supporting the aid, Fox News’ Chris Wallace reported on ""Fox News Sunday.""

In addition to Giuliani, Washington, D.C., lawyers Joe DiGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, worked alongside the former New York City mayor. According to a top U.S. official, the three attorneys were working ""off the books"" -- not within the Trump administration -- and only the president knows the details of their work.

In a tweet Sunday, Toensing called the report ""false"" and embarrassing."" Wallace, in a statement, responded, ""We stand by our reporting.""

WATCH: GIULIANI COMPARES BIDEN UKRAINE DEALINGS TO ALLEGED CLINTON FOUNDATION 'PAY-FOR-PLAY'

For his part, Giuliani insisted he ""didn't work with anybody to get dirt on Joe Biden,"" again saying that the information ""was handed to me by the Ukrainians.""

Giuliani stated that so far House Democrats have not subpoenaed him to testify about his work with Ukraine, but if they did he would have to run it by Trump first.

""I'm his attorney, there's something called attorney-client privilege,"" he said. ""That has to be considered even if they don't think he should have attorney-client privilege.""

Democrats have focused on the whistleblower's complaint, released last week, which cited information from White House officials who alleged there'd been efforts to secure Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, among other conversations. The Trump administration reportedly began placing transcripts of Trump's calls with several foreign leaders in a highly classified repository only after anonymous leakers publicly divulged the contents of Trump's private calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia in 2017.

Trump suggested during a phone call with Zelensky that Ukraine look into Biden's boast about firing Shokin, after Zelensky first mentioned Ukraine's corruption issues, and after Trump separately requested as a ""favor"" that Ukraine help investigate foreign interference in the 2016 elections, including the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server involving CrowdStrike.

The call came not long after Trump had frozen millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine. However, the U.S. later released the aid to Ukraine, and the Ukrainians were unaware the money was frozen in the first place until more than a month after Trump's call with Zelensky, The New York Times reported.

Zelensky has said he felt no pressure from Trump during the phone call to do anything.

The whistleblower complaint contained several apparent factual inaccuracies, prompting some Republicans to call for an inquiry into the whistleblowers' sources -- and why they didn't make the complaint themselves.

47,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/impeachment-push-moderate-democrats-retaking-senate,2,"Some red-state Senate Democrats are fretting that the ongoing House impeachment inquiry could expand uncontrollably and become a “kitchen sink” of complaints about President Trump, Fox News has learned.

West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Montana Sen. Jon Tester specifically expressed concerns about a broadening impeachment push severely damaging Democrats' chances to win back a Senate majority next year, sources told Fox News.

The senators have told Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., that leadership cannot allow liberal Democrats to push for the inquiry to include allegations about Trump illegally using his office to enrich himself or relitigate findings from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian election meddling in 2016.

BIDEN CAMPAIGN SEEKS TO BAN GIULIANI FROM TELEVISION, AFTER HE OUTLINES ALLEGED CORRUPTION, CITES AFFIDAVITS

Instead, Manchin and Tester said, the inquiry should stay very narrowly focused on Ukraine. Last month, a whistleblower complaint was released alleging Trump, holding back on Ukraine military aid, pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to look into former Vice President Joe Biden's push to oust a top prosecutor there. This, while his son Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

Trump and the White House have denied doing anything wrong in the call.

A former senior party aide told Fox News: “If Democrats lose focus on the charges of foreign corruption and election interference, so will voters. Democrats need to stay laser-focused on one issue and not allow their base to drag them in 20 different directions. They saw this playbook work in 2018 where they focused on health care. Hopefully, they will run the same play with impeachment.”

Immediately after Democrats launched their formal impeachment inquiry last month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., openly declared that Ukraine was just one of many reasons to begin proceedings against the president.

“What is going on is that the president has committed several impeachable offenses. He, himself, what he has admitted to, is already impeachable, regardless of future developments,” Ocasio-Cortez said, referencing potential Emoluments Clause violations.

She also said this past April, “I think you could reach in a bag and pull so many things out that are impeachable of this president.”

The conversations came as a new poll showed American voters evenly split -- 47 percent to 47 percent -- on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office. The findings in a Quinnipiac University national survey released Monday erased a 20-point gap against impeaching the president in the previous Quinnipiac poll seen just a week ago. In the earlier survey, voters opposed impeachment, 57 percent to 37 percent.

Polling in key swing states, however, has not been made available. The formal impeachment inquiry began last month after a flurry of swing-district Democrats in the House pushed Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to act.

Speaking to Fox News on Monday, former Attorney General Eric Holder said it was impossible to be sure what impact impeachment proceedings would have.

“I'm not sure that anyone can really gauge that,” Holder said. “I'm not sure if this is going to help Democrats or hurt Democrats, but I think it's the right thing to do.”

""I'm not sure if this is going to help Democrats or hurt Democrats."" — Former Attorney General Eric Holder

In a separate interview on Monday, Holder suggested Democrats might have a tough election year -- for a head-turning reason.

“It's going to be hard because the reality is that Republicans are going to cheat. They're going to try to keep people away from the polls, they're going to move polling places, they're going to do a whole variety of things,” Holder told “The Breakfast Club” radio show.

Meanwhile, Fox News has confirmed that State Department Inspector General Steve Linick will come to Capitol Hill to meet with House and Senate Committee aides Wednesday regarding the Ukraine matter.

Tension between Congressional Democrats and the State Department has grown in connection with the Ukraine matter; questions have arisen over permitting State Department-related witnesses to appear for transcribed interviews and provide documents for the impeachment probe.

For now, most Democrats have remained focused on the Ukraine inquiry, and on Monday they subpoenaed Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer. That was after one of Trump's staunchest defenders, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he would have “no choice” but to consider articles of impeachment if the House approved them.

STUDY SHOWS MEDIA LARGELY IGNORING ALLEGED BIDEN CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE

With Congress out of session for the Jewish holidays, Democrats moved aggressively against Giuliani, requesting that by Oct. 15 he produce “text messages, phone records and other communications” that they consider possible evidence of misdeeds in connection with the Ukraine matter. They also requested documents and depositions from three of his business associates.

Biden's presidential campaign has itself targeted Giuliani, requesting in a letter on Sunday that major news networks not invite him on air anymore, after Giuliani spent the morning on a series of talk shows aggressively highlighting what he called Biden's apparently corrupt dealings in Ukraine and China.

Republicans have continued to raise money over Democrats' impeachment efforts, as they sought to use the probe to fundraise and highlight Dems' own potential misconduct. Top Democrats seeking the White House took in a collective $56 million over the last three months, but in a sign of what they're up against, Trump and his allies raised $125 million.

Top Republicans have increasingly questioned details concerning the whistleblower complaint that has formed the basis of the impeachment inquiry. The inspector general for the intelligence community said late Monday that the whistleblower claimed to have firsthand knowledge of misconduct -- a claim that appeared to conflict with documents sent to Congress and the director of national intelligence.

""As I learn more and more each day,"" Trump tweeted late Tuesday, ""I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!""

48,https://www.foxnews.com/media/judge-napolitano-white-house-letter-impeachment-pelosi,2,"Fox News senior judicial analyst and Fox Nation host Judge Andrew Napolitano backed the legal argument behind a White House letter expected to be sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., arguing that the White House does not have to comply with the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.

TOP REPUBLICAN DISMISSES LEGITIMACY OF DEMS' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

The letter, which may be sent as early as Friday, apparently dares Pelosi to put the question of a formal impeachment inquiry before the House of Representatives for a vote.

On Sept. 24, Pelosi announced that House Democrats would undertake the probe without asking for the support of the members of the House.

PELOSI DODGES CRITICAL QUESTION ON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Wall Street Journal Editorial Page Editorial Board member Bill McGurn explored the issue on Fox Nation’s “Deep Dive,” saying, “If we're hearing how serious impeachment is -- what does it say for Mrs. Pelosi to do this in a way that's without precedent? It's just a decree on her part.""

However, Pelosi decision carries other serious implications, as explained by Judge Napolitano, host of Fox Nation’s “Liberty File with Judge Napolitano.”

The White House letter will argue that the White House is not required to comply with the Democrats' investigation because Pelosi hasn't codified the probe with a formal vote on the House floor.

The Judge’s remarks were recorded before Fox News confirmed that the White House planned to send this letter, but his legal analysis finds that the White House’s argument has merit.

He explained that Speaker Pelosi is not required to put the question of an impeachment inquiry up for a vote, but if she did, and if it was approved by a majority of House members, then her inquiry would be strengthened.

“Mrs. Pelosi is correct that the Constitution does not require a full House vote, before the House begins an impeachment inquiry, but when it does so… without the full House vote it does so based on federal law… that authority comes from statues, not the Constitution. That’s very significant. When an authority comes from a statute there are other statues that can contradict it,” the judge said.

GIULIANI: PELOSI'S IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY DESIGNED TO GET TRUMP AND PROTECT THIS 2020 DEMOCRAT

He said the White House has the legal right to fight the Democrats’ effort to compel their cooperation.

“For example, if the House Intelligence Committee calls Rudy Giuliani to testify before it, I would expect that Giuliani would assert the attorney-client privilege, which is a court rule that comes from a statue… So Giuliani would say ‘Look I don’t have to answer any questions and I don’t have to show you any documents,’ and they would be at a standstill. And if the committee went to court, I think that Giuliani’s invocation of the attorney-client privilege would prevail,” he said.

However, if Pelosi put the question of an impeachment inquiry up for a vote and a majority of House members approve it – that changes the game.

“If… the House of Representatives voted by majority vote to proceed with an impeachment inquiry that changes the rules all together. There are no privileges because the House’s right to impeach comes from the Constitution and the Constitution trumps… any statute that would interfere with it.”

STRASSEL SLAMS MAINSTREAM MEDIA'S COVERAGE OF IMPEACHMENT PUSH: AMERICANS WILL SEE 'PAST THE BALONEY'

The judge concluded, “If the House votes – by majority vote – to proceed with an impeachment inquiry, it will strip the president of almost all of his defenses and enhance its own ability to extract information from a reluctant White House.”

In the latest episode of ""Liberty File with Judge Napolitano"", the judge spoke with two Republicans mounting presidential primary challenges against President Trump in 2020.

The judge asked them what they make of Democrats' allegations that the president violated his oath of office by asking the president of Ukraine to investigate his political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld said he agrees with the president's critics. ""The conduct that the president has engaged in is precisely the sort of conduct that the Framers were worried about and why they put the impeachment and removal power in the hands of Congress. They were worried about, number one, foreign interference... In the Oval Office, the president said that he doesn’t care as much about the interference in the 2016 election, that “everybody does it.” There couldn’t be a more clear instance of inviting foreign interference. And of course, the Ukraine call goes right into the same thing.""

49,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-to-require-immigrants-to-prove-they-can-afford-health-insurance,2,"President Trump issued a proclamation Friday requiring immigrants applying for U.S. visas to prove they can afford health care.

Applicants will be denied entry into the U.S. unless they have plans to be covered by health insurance within 30 days of entering or have enough financial resources to cover the cost, according to the White House.

The measure would take effect Nov. 3 and will apply to applicants for visas from abroad. It will not be applied retroactively to those already in the U.S. It does not affect lawful permanent residents, nor does it apply to asylum seekers, refugees or children. However, it would apply to the spouses and parents of U.S. citizens.

“Hospitals and other providers often administer care to the uninsured without any hope of receiving reimbursement from them,” the White House explained. “The costs associated with this care are passed on to the American people in the form of higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher fees for medical services ... The United States has a long history of welcoming immigrants who come lawfully in search of brighter futures. We must continue that tradition while also addressing the challenges facing our healthcare system, including protecting both it and the American taxpayer from the burdens of uncompensated care.""

TOP WARREN CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL FIRED FOR 'INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR'

Hospitals have spent more than $35 billion, or an average of $7 million per hospital, on “unreimbursed services” over the last 10 years, according to the White House.

“Beyond imposing higher costs on hospitals and other healthcare infrastructure, uninsured individuals often use emergency rooms to seek remedies for a variety of non-emergency conditions, causing overcrowding and delays for those who truly need emergency services,” the White House added.

Under the proposed rule, the required insurance can be purchased individually or provided by an employer, and it can be short-term coverage or catastrophic. Medicaid doesn't count. And an immigrant will not be able to obtain a visa if using ObamaCare subsidies when buying insurance.

BERNIE SANDERS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL, DOCTORS SAY HE SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK

According to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan immigration think tank, 57 percent of U.S. immigrants had private health insurance in 2017, compared with 69 percent of U.S.-born, and 30 percent had public health insurance coverage, compared with 36 percent of native-born. The institute also said the uninsured rate for immigrants dropped from 32 percent to 20 percent between 2013 to 2017.

Earlier this year the Trump administration issued a “public charge rule,” which will go into effect Oct. 15, allowing federal officials to deny green cards to applicants deemed likely to rely on government aid. Officials described the rule as a means to protect taxpayers and promote self-sufficiency among those granted permanent residence. Factors to be considered under the “public charge rule” are age, health, financial assets and education.

The White House also directed officials to recover income-based welfare payments from sponsors and proposed a rule requiring verification of immigration status for anyone seeking access to public housing benefits.

The new restrictions came as immigration and health care are at the forefront of the 2020 presidential race. Democratic candidates have repeatedly decried Trump’s strict immigration policies and most have touted ""Medicare-for-All"" or at the very least a public option for health care. Most have even taken it a step further and supported providing health care for undocumented immigrants. Trump mocked Democrats on Twitter who supported the idea at a Democratic primary debate in June.

“All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare,” Trump tweeted. “How about taking care of American Citizens first!? That’s the end of that race!”

The Associated Press contributed to this report."
50,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/impeachment-inquiry-white-house-not-comply-pelosi,2,"The White House outlined in a defiant eight-page letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top Democrats on Tuesday why it will not participate in their “illegitimate and unconstitutional” impeachment inquiry, charging that the proceedings have run roughshod over congressional norms and the president's due-process rights.

Trump administration officials called the letter, which was written by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and obtained by Fox News, perhaps the most historic letter the White House has sent. The document tees up a head-on collision with Democrats in Congress, who have fired off a slew of subpoenas in recent days concerning the president's alleged effort to get Ukraine to investigate political foe Joe Biden during a July phone call with Ukraine's leader.

""President Trump and his administration reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process,"" the letter stated. ""Your unprecedented actions have left the president with no choice. In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.""

READ THE WHITE HOUSE LETTER

The document concluded: ""The president has a country to lead. The American people elected him to do this job, and he remains focused on fulfilling his promises to the American people.""

Responding to the letter, Pelosi accused Trump of ""trying to make lawlessness a virtue"" and added, ""The American people have already heard the President’s own words – ‘do us a favor, though.’"" (That line, from a transcript of Trump's call with Ukraine's leader, in reality referred to Trump's request for Ukraine to assist in an investigation into 2016 election interference, and did not relate to Biden.)

Pelosi continued: ""This letter is manifestly wrong, and is simply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump Administration’s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections. ... The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President’s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction. Mr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.”

Substantively, the White House first noted in its letter that there has not been a formal vote in the House to open an impeachment inquiry -- and that the news conference held by Pelosi last month was insufficient to commence the proceedings.

""In the history of our nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the president without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step,"" the letter stated.

It continued: ""Without waiting to see what was actually said on the call, a press conference was held announcing an 'impeachment inquiry' based on falsehoods and misinformation about the call.""

SCHIFF SAYS 'WE' DIDN'T TALK TO WHISTLEBLOWER -- THEN BACKTRACKS

Despite Pelosi's claim that there was no “House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry,” several previous impeachment inquiries have been launched only by a full vote of the House -- including the impeachment proceedings concerning former Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.

White House officials told Fox News the vote opening the proceedings was a small ask, considering the implications of potentially overturning a national election.

House rules do not require a vote to begin an impeachment inquiry, but it remains unclear whether the courts will agree that an impeachment inquiry has begun without such a vote. If courts do not find that a formal inquiry is in progress, they could curtail Democrats' evidence-gathering efforts.

The letter went on to note that ""information has recently come to light that the whistleblower"" who first flagged Trump's call with Ukraine's president ""had contact with [House Intelligence Committee] Chairman [Adam] Schiff's office before filing the complaint.""

And Schiff's ""initial denial of such contact caused The Washington Post to conclude that Chairman Schiff ""clearly made a statement that was false,"" the letter observed.

Multiple reports surfaced this week that the whistleblower had a prior ""professional relationship"" with one of the 2020 Democratic candidates for president. On Friday, lawyers for the whistleblower did not respond to questions from Fox News about the whistleblower's possible previous relationship with any currently prominent Democrat.

The letter added: ""In any event, the American people understand that Chairman Schiff cannot covertly assist with the submission of a complaint, mislead the public about his involvement, read a counterfeit version of the call to the American people, and then pretend to sit in judgment as a neutral 'investigator.'""

The White House was dinging Schiff for reciting a fictional version of Trump's call with Ukraine's leader during a congressional hearing. Schiff later called his statements a ""parody.""

TUCKER CARLSON AND NEIL PATEL: THE TRUTH ABOUT IMPEACHMENT

""Perhaps the best evidence that there was no wrongdoing on the call is the fact that, after the actual record of the call was released, Chairman Schiff chose to concoct a false version of the call and to read his made-up transcript to the American people at a public hearing,"" the letter stated. ""The chairman's action only further undermines the public's confidence in the fairness of any inquiry before his committee.""

Ukraine's president has said he felt Trump did nothing improper in their July call, and DOJ lawyers who reviewed the call said they found no laws had been broken. The White House released a transcript of the conversation last month, as well as the whistleblower's complaint, which seemingly relied entirely on second-hand information.

Separately, the letter asserted multiple alleged violations of the president's due-process rights. It noted that under current impeachment inquiry proceedings, Democrats were not allowing presidential or State Department counsel to be present.

Democrats' procedures did not provide for the ""disclosure of all evidence favorable to the president and all evidence bearing on the credibility of witnesses called to testify in the inquiry,"" the letter noted, nor did the procedures afford the president ""the right to see all evidence, to present evidence, to call witnesses, to have counsel present at all hearings, to cross-examine all witnesses, to make objections relating to the examination of witnesses or the admissibility of testimony and evidence, and to respond to evidence and testimony.""

Democrats also have not permitted Republicans in the minority to issue subpoenas, contradicting the ""standard, bipartisan practice in all recent resolutions authorizing presidential impeachment inquiries.""

""President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances."" — Pat Cipollone, counsel to President Trump

The letter claimed that House committees have ""resorted to threats and intimidation against potential Executive Branch witnesses,"" by raising the specter of obstruction of justice when administration employees seek to assert ""long-established Executive Branch confidentiality interests and privileges in response to a request for a deposition.""

""Current and former State Department officials are duty bound to protect the confidentiality interests of the Executive Branch, and the Office of Legal Counsel has also recognized that it is unconstitutional to exclude agency counsel from participating in congressional depositions,"" the letter stated.

EXCLUSIVE: WHISTLEBLOWER WRITES WH OFFICIAL DESCRIBED TRUMP CALL AS 'FRIGHTENING'

Additionally, the letter noted that Democrats reportedly were planning to interview the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry at an undisclosed location -- contrary, the White House said, to the constitutional notion of being able to confront one's accuser.

According to a White House official, the bottom line was: ""We are not participating in your illegitimate exercise. ... If you are legitimately conducting oversight, let us know. But all indications are this is about impeachment.""

The document came as the White House aggressively has parried Democrats' inquiry efforts. One of the administration's first moves: the State Department on Tuesday barred Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, from appearing before a House panel conducting the probe into Trump.

GOP INTRODUCES RESOLUTION TO KICK PELOSI OUT OF THE HOUSE

""I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican's rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see,"" Trump tweeted.

THE LATEST REPORTING FROM FOX NEWS IN THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AND UKRAINE CONTROVERSY

The strategy risked further provoking Democrats in the impeachment probe, setting up court challenges and the potential for lawmakers to draw up an article of impeachment accusing Trump of obstructing their investigations. Schiff said Sondland's no-show would be grounds for obstruction of justice and could give a preview of what some of the articles of impeachment against Trump would entail.

But, as lawmakers sought to amass ammunition to be used in an impeachment trial, the White House increasingly has signaled that all-out warfare was its best course of action.

""What they did to this country is unthinkable. It's lucky that I'm the president. A lot of people said very few people could handle it. I sort of thrive on it,"" Trump said Monday at the White House. ""You can't impeach a president for doing a great job. This is a scam.""

House Democrats, for their part, issued a new round of subpoenas on Monday, this time to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and acting White House budget director Russell Vought. Pelosi's office also released an open letter signed by 90 former national security officials who served in administrations from both parties, voicing support for the whistleblower who raised concerns about Trump's efforts to get Ukraine to look into Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.

""A responsible whistleblower makes all Americans safer by ensuring that serious wrongdoing can be investigated and addressed, thus advancing the cause of national security to which we have devoted our careers,"" they wrote. ""Whatever one's view of the matters discussed in the whistleblower's complaint, all Americans should be united in demanding that all branches of our government and all outlets of our media protect this whistleblower and his or her identity. Simply put, he or she has done what our law demands; now he or she deserves our protection.""

The House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees were investigating Trump's actions alleging he pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, potentially interfering in the 2020 election. The former vice president, for his part, has accused Trump of ""frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me."" And, Biden's campaign has sought to have Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, who has accused Biden of possible corruption, removed from the airwaves.

PROOF OF LINKS: PHOTO OBTAINED BY FOX NEWS SHOWS BIDEN GOLFING WITH UKRAINE EXEC

Biden has acknowledged on camera that in spring 2016, when he was vice president and spearheading the Obama administration's Ukraine policy, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire top prosecutor Viktor Shokin. At the time, Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings — where Hunter had a lucrative role on the board despite limited relevant expertise. Critics have suggested Hunter Biden's salary bought access to Biden.

The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin, who was widely accused of corruption, was not fired.

51,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-warren-poll-democrats-debate-new-hampshire,2,"A new national poll on the eve of the Democrats’ fourth-round presidential primary debate showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden locked in a close race for their party’s nomination.

Warren stood at 30 percent support in a Quinnipiac University survey Monday of Democratic voters and independents who leaned toward the party. Biden, the unrivaled front-runner until Warren’s surge in the polls the past couple of months, was at 27 percent.

Warren’s three percentage point advantage was within the survey’s margin of error.

GABBARD BACKS DOWN AFTER DEBATE BOYCOTT THREAT

The poll was the third conducted by Quinnipiac since late last month showing Warren with a slight edge over Biden.

“For Senator Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy emphasized. “Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stood at 11 percent, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent and Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 4 percent.

Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each registered at 2 percent in the poll. The other candidates in the shrinking – but still large – field of contenders stood at 1 percent or less.

Quinnipiac’s survey differed from a Fox News poll released last week that indicated Biden at 32 percent, with Warren ten points back at 22 percent and Sanders at 17 percent. No other candidate cracked double digits in the Fox News survey.

THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Twelve candidates qualified for Tuesday’s debate, which is set to be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. They are – in alphabetical order – Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Harris, Klobuchar, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and Yang.

While national primary horserace polls have grabbed plenty of attention, the battle for the nomination is a fight for the states and their delegates. And, a new poll in New Hampshire, the state holding the first presidential primary, indicated a three-way tie at the top.

Warren stood at 25 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State in a Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University survey, with Biden at 24 percent and Sanders at 22 percent. Buttigieg stood at 9 percent and Harris at 5 percent, with no one else in the field topping 2 percent.

In New Hampshire’s Republican presidential contest, President Trump remained the overwhelming favorite against three extreme long-shot primary challengers, but his support has deteriorated from 88 percent a month ago to 71 percent in the survey. One of the primary challengers, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, saw his support jump from 3 percent in early September to 14 percent in the new survey.

The deal is for a 120-hour cease-fire, during which time the Kurdish-led forces could pull back from the roughly 20-mile-wide safe zone on the Turkish-Syrian border. All Turkish military operations under the recent offensive known as Operation Peace Spring will pause during that time, and the operation itself will come to an end entirely upon the completion of the Kurdish withdrawal, under the terms of the deal.

ERDOGAN THREW TRUMP'S 'DON'T BE A FOOL' LETTER IN THE TRASH, SOURCES CLAIM

""This is a great day for civilization,"" Trump declared in a tweet following a press conference where Pence and Pompeo discussed the deal. ""I am proud of the United States for sticking by me in following a necessary, but somewhat unconventional, path. People have been trying to make this 'Deal' for many years. Millions of lives will be saved. Congratulations to ALL!""

Trump claimed that just three days ago, such an agreement ""could NEVER have been made,"" but that ""tough love"" was required to accomplish it.

In addition to agreeing to the terms of a cease-fire, both the U.S. and Turkey ""committed to defeat ISIS activities in northeast Syria,"" Pence announced during a press conference.

“Turkey and the United States agree on the priority of respecting vulnerable human life, human rights, and particularly the protection of religious and ethnic communities in the region,” the vice president added.

The commander of Kurdish-led forces in Syria later told Kurdish TV they will abide by the deal, which Pence said was reached after more than five hours of negotiations with Erdogan and Turkish officials.

""We think the agreement today first ends the violence, which is what President Trump sent us here to do,"" Pence said. ""We achieved that.""

Pence said that the U.S. did not approve of Turkey's military operation, but under the terms of the deal will lift sanctions against Turkey upon the fulfillment of the agreement from both sides.

The Turkish offensive began after Trump announced the withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria. Trump was heavily criticized for the move by lawmakers from both parties.

Last week, Trump sent a letter to Erdogan encouraging him to “work out a good deal,” threatening to “destroy” the Turkish economy if Erdogan continued his aggression against the Kurds.

“Don’t be a tough guy. Don’t be a fool!” Trump said, before stating that he would call Erdogan.

It was reported by the BBC Thursday that Erdogan “thoroughly rejected” the letter and threw it “in the bin,” but hours later Pence announced the potential cease-fire.

Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York City on Thursday night, a day after the president called Mattis “the world’s most overrated general.”

Mattis, who resigned last December after clashing with Trump on the president's Syria policy, said he was honored by the ""overrated"" remark because Trump “also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress.""

DEMS STORM OUT OF SYRIA MEETING WITH TRUMP: 'WE HAVE TO PRAY FOR HIS HEALTH'

Trump had fired back at Streep in January 2017 after she spoke out against him at the Golden Globe Awards.

The Marine Corps four-star general's name came up in a contentious White House meeting Wednesday about Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from Syria.

A Democratic source familiar with the meeting told Fox News that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., started to read the president a quote from Mattis from last Sunday: ""And, in this case, if we don't keep the pressure on, then ISIS will resurge. It's absolutely a given that they will come back,"" Mattis had said.

That's apparently when Trump cut Schumer off and called Mattis overrated.

""You know why?"" Trump said. ""He wasn’t tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.""

On Thursday night, Mattis also said that being called ""overrated"" by Trump didn’t bother him because he earned his “spurs on the battlefield” and Trump “earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor,” referring to Trump’s medical deferments from serving in the Vietnam War due to bone spurs.

“I do stand before you, as was noted here, really having achieved greatness. I mean, I'm not just an overrated general. I am the greatest, the world's most overrated,” Mattis said to laughter and applause.

54,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/report-hillary-clinton-emails-violations-faults,2,"A State Department report into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server for government business, obtained by Fox News on Friday, found dozens of individuals at fault and hundreds of security violations.

The report summarized an administrative review of the handling of classified information relating to Clinton’s private email server used during her tenure as the nation’s highest-ranking diplomat between 2009 and 2013. The report, dated Sept. 13., was delivered to the office of Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa., who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee until last year.

The report reflected only approximately 30,000 emails that the State Department was able to physically review, and found 38 individuals were responsible for 91 violations.

Another 497 violations were also found, although the report was not able to assign responsibility in those cases, in part because many of those involved had already left the department during the time it took to receive the emails and review them.

HILLARY CLINTON FLOATS CONSPIRACY THAT TULSI GABBARD IS BEING 'GROOMED' BY RUSSIANS

The report described an investigation fraught with obstacles -- including delays -- employees who left the department and more than 30,000 deleted records.

The Clinton email controversy dogged her throughout her failed 2016 presidential bid. Clinton and her aides have claimed the controversy was overblown and denied any wrongdoing, but President Trump and allies have consistently referred back to it as an example of a criminal endeavor for which no one was properly punished.

The FBI began investigating Clinton’s handling of emails in 2015 after it was revealed she had used a homebrew server for her government emails. Then-FBI Director James Comey announced in July 2016 that the agency would not recommend charges, but famously described Clinton as having been ""extremely careless"" in her conduct.

The department received the emails in December 2014, well after Clinton left the department in early 2013.

The department concluded that the use of a private email system “added an increased degree of risk of compromise, as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of [the] State Department.”

“While the use of a private email system itself did not necessarily increase the likelihood of classified information being transmitted on unclassified systems, those incidents which then resulted in the presence of classified information upon it carried an increased risk of compromise or inadvertent disclosure,” the report said.

However, while there were instances of classified information being introduced into an unclassified system, the report said that by and large the individuals interviewed “did their best” to implement security policies. There was no “persuasive evidence” of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information, according to the report.

Mitt Romney, one of President Trump’s top Republican critics, on Sunday appeared to confirm the existence of a shadow Twitter account with the handle @qaws9876 with the name Pierre Delecto.

A writer for The Atlantic, who just wrote a profile on the Utah Republican and his tense relationship with the president, asked Romney about the mystery Twitter account. He said Romney responded in the affirmative: “C’est moi,” which in French means ""It's me.""

The Twitter account does not have a profile or a banner picture, and it is locked. The account follows 702 users and has 1,173 followers. The Washington Examiner reported that Delecto does not follow Trump’s account.

Many took to social media to make fun of the name, which reminded users of the Anthony Weiner saga with Carlos Danger. Seth Abramson, a writer for Newsweek, took to Twitter to joke, “Stop me if you heard this one: Pierre Delecto, Carlos Danger and John Barron walk into a bar…”

John Barron was reportedly the name of Trump’s purported spokesman in the 1980s — actually Trump himself responding to reporters. The Washington Post, citing the book “Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Excellence,” reported that Trump’s father, Fred Trump, would also use a phony spokesman named “Mr. Green.”

Romney, R-Utah, took a series of shots at President Trump in an interview that aired Sunday, saying that some of the president’s rhetoric appealed to racism and claiming that under his leadership, the U.S. was abandoning allied Kurdish fighters in Syria.

“The places where I would be most critical of the president would be in matters that were divisive, that appeared to be appealing to racism or misogyny, and those are the kinds of things I think that have been most, most harmful long term to the foundation of America’s virtuous character,” Romney, who said he wrote in his wife, Ann, when he voted in 2016, told “Axios on HBO.”

Although Romney noted he still votes with Trump 80 percent of the time, he and the president have clashed in recent years, with Trump ridiculing Romney over his 2012 defeat against incumbent President Obama. Trump recently branded Romney a “pompous ‘a–‘ who “choked” in his own run for the White House.

Earlier this year, Romney penned an op-ed in which he attacked Trump’s conduct and said “he has not risen to the mantle of the office.”"
56,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-taylor-diplomat-who-texted-concerns-about-trumps-ukraine-moves-testifies-under-subpoena,2,"Bill Taylor, a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine who has emerged as a key figure of interest in the Trump impeachment inquiry, told Congress on Tuesday that there were ""two channels"" for Trump administration policymaking on Ukraine — ""one regular, one irregular.""

Taylor's testimony in a closed-door deposition before several House committees was described to Fox News by sources familiar with the session. The acting ambassador to Ukraine is seen as a key witness in the probe of whether President Trump was engaged in a ""quid pro quo"" by holding up aid to the country amid a push for politically related investigations, with lawmakers focusing on his past text messages discussing Trump's dealings with Ukraine.

Describing administration policy-making in Ukraine, Taylor said the ""regular"" channel would be through traditional State Department channels, according to sources. The ""irregular channel,"" he told lawmakers, was through European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland, former special envoy Kurt Volker, Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani and outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry.

EXPANSIVE DURHAM PROBE COULD GIVE TRUMP AMMO AMID IMPEACHMENT FIGHT

According to sources, the State Department tried to keep Taylor from testifying. But the Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena, making Tuesday’s appearance a “deposition.” Taylor is complying with the subpoena and answered questions from both sides.

Text messages recently turned over to Congress showed Taylor and other U.S. officials battling internally last month over Trump’s efforts to encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden’s past business practices in the country amid discussions over U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Hunter Biden is the son of Joe Biden, the former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate.

""As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,"" Taylor said in a September text exchange.

Sondland, who has also testified on Capitol Hill, responded to Taylor's text message at the time by saying, ""Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo's of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.""

Both men then agreed to cease discussing the matter over text, noting that phone calls with the appropriate officials would be preferable.

The White House fired back Tuesday over Taylor's testimony: ""President Trump has done nothing wrong — this is a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution. There was no quid pro quo,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.

As for Tuesday's testimony, Taylor was described to Fox News as a ""good"" witness for Democrats and, on balance, ""not good"" for Republicans. But Fox News is told Taylor did not deliver new evidence to strengthen Democrats' impeachment push.

The sources said Taylor had no firsthand knowledge or other direct evidence that Ukrainian officials knew that aid to the country had been suspended at the time of the July 25 call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Congressional Democrats on Tuesday said they wanted more information on the text messages.

“Well, I would want to know exactly what he was thinking when he, you know, wrote that text,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington State, told reporters, adding, “we need to understand everything that happened before he sent that text and everything that happened after.”

Republicans, meanwhile, have accused Democrats of restricting access to the transcripts from the interviews they’ve been conducting as part of the impeachment inquiry.

“Just when you thought the process couldn’t get any more unfair, we found out last night that Democrats will now not even allow Republicans to have a copy of the respective transcripts from each of the witnesses we’ve interviewed thus far,” said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, claiming that Republicans can’t make copies and can only read them while under supervision by Democratic staffers.

Taylor was tapped to run the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine after the administration abruptly ousted the ambassador. He was then drawn into a Trump administration effort to hold up U.S. military aid for Ukraine.

Taylor had been serving as executive vice president at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan think tank founded by Congress, when he was appointed to run the embassy in Kiev after Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was removed before the end of her term, following a campaign against her led by Giuliani.

He was chosen for the post because he was among a handful of former officials with experience in Ukraine who would be perceived as neutral by local officials and wouldn't raise objections at the White House, according to a colleague.

Taylor had served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009.

Trump had his now-famous phone conversation in July with Zelensky, in which he pressed him to investigate claims about Democratic rival Joe Biden, as well as issues related to election interference in 2016. Trump at the time had quietly put a hold on nearly $400 million in military aid that Ukraine was counting on in its fight against Russian-backed separatists.

Speaking at the White House, Trump said that while a ""permanent ceasefire"" will be tough to maintain in the volatile region, he hopes it will last and end the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds.

""I do believe it will be permanent,"" he said. ""This was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else...we've done something very, very special.""

'PERMANENT' TURKEY-SYRIA CEASE-FIRE POSSIBLE AS TEMPORARY PEACE AGREEMENT ENDS, PENCE SAYS

Trump delivered the statement amid bipartisan criticism over his recent decision to pull back U.S. forces from northern Syria, opening the door for Turkey to launch a military offensive. But the administration has sought to halt the fighting. The ceasefire required Kurdish forces formerly allied with the U.S. against the Islamic State group to move out of a roughly 20-mile zone on the Turkish border. With Kurdish forces out of the zone, Turkey will halt its assault, Trump said.

""We've saved the lives of many, many Kurds,"" he added.

Trump added that if Turkey breaches the cease-fire, the sanctions could be reimposed.

""The sanctions are lifted unless something happens that we're not happy with,"" he added.

Trump's statement follows an early morning tweet, where he announced a “safe zone” along the Turkey-Syria border, and voiced optimism after the initial 120-hour pause in the Turkish military operation there ended.

“Ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended. Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us,” Trump tweeted. “Captured ISIS prisoners secured.”

The U.S. withdrawal was followed immediately by Turkish aggression, and Trump faced criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike who blamed him for allowing the violence to go unchecked and leaving Kurdish allies to fend for themselves. Turkey and Russia reached an agreement Tuesday that would transform the map of northeast Syria, installing their forces along the border and filling the void left by the abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops.

Trump said Wednesday that nearly all U.S. troops will be leaving Syria but some will remain to safeguard oil fields in Syria. Russian forces have already begun joint patrols with Turkish forces along the Turkish-Syrian border.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Ankara last week to work out the initial cease-fire. Though that period has since lapsed, Pence said earlier there's an opportunity for a permanent cease-fire in the region.

James Jeffrey, a career diplomat who oversees Washington’s role in the global fight against the Islamic State, also told lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he does not believe the troop withdrawal added to Turkey’s decision to invade northern Syria. Jeffrey, however, did concede that if U.S. forces had been told to stand their ground amid a Turkish invasion, Turkey may have thought otherwise about crossing the border.

IRAQ'S MILITARY SAYS US TROOPS LEAVING SYRIA DON'T HAVE PERMISSION TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY

Under the recent 10-point deal, Russia and Turkey have given Kurdish fighters 150 hours starting at noon Wednesday — meaning, until next Tuesday at 6 p.m. — to withdraw from the border.

Russian and Syrian government forces would move into that area immediately to ensure the Kurdish fighters pull back 20 miles from the border. Then at the end of the 150 hours, Russian-Turkish patrols would begin along a six-mile-wide strip of the border.

The exception would be the region around the town of Qamishli at the far eastern end of the border, which has some of the densest Kurdish population.

Russian spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to Russian newswires, that if the Kurds do not complete their withdrawal by the Tuesday deadline, Turkey would resume their offensive.

“It’s quite obvious that if the Kurdish units don’t withdraw with their weapons then Syrian border guards and Russian military police will have to step back. And the remaining Kurdish units will be steamrolled by the Turkish army,"" Peskov said.

Al-Baghdadi, who took over as the head of ISIS after his predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi was killed in 2010, was said to have detonated a suicide vest as U.S. special forces closed in. Troops were sent to attack a compound in northern Syria where al-Baghdadi was located, according to a U.S. defense official.

No U.S. Special Operations forces were harmed or killed during the mission, and Trump claimed the operation had been in the works for several weeks.

Hannity also claimed ISIS forces took pleasure in torturing their victims and shamed The Washington Post for trying to paint al-Baghdadi as anything other than a terrorist.

60,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-introduce-resolution-formalizing-impeachment-inquiry,2,"House Democrats on Tuesday introduced a resolution to formalize their impeachment inquiry and adopt rules to govern the proceedings, following sustained complaints by congressional Republicans and the White House that the inquiry hasn't followed past precedent and violates the president's due process rights.

But, illustrating the balancing act involved as the 2020 election cycle gets started, Democrats have adamantly denied that the document is an ""impeachment resolution,"" perhaps out of concern for how that label would play in more moderate swing districts.

The resolution directs the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, Financial Services, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees to ""continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump.""

Republicans, however, have countered that there is no ""existing"" impeachment inquiry because the House has not voted to open one as it did during the Clinton and Nixon impeachments -- and Tuesday's resolution does not explicitly open the probe, either.

""The resolution put forward by Speaker Pelosi confirms that House Democrats’ impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote,"" the White House said in a statement. ""It continues this scam by allowing Chairman Schiff, who repeatedly lies to the American people, to hold a new round of hearings, still without any due process for the President.""

READ DEMS' FULL RESOLUTION FORMALIZING IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

The statement continued: ""The White House is barred from participating at all, until after Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee. Even then, the White House's rights remain undefined, unclear, and uncertain – because those rules still haven’t been written.

Doug Collins and Devin Nunes, respectively) will have the authority, with the concurrence of committee chairs in the majority, to subpoena witnesses and compel their testimony -- a major demand that the White House and top Republicans had made in recent weeks.

If the chair does not consent, the minority can appeal to the full committee. It is common in other proceedings for committee chairs to essentially have veto authority over subpoenas sought by ranking minority members.

The resolution also authorizes the Intelligence Committee to conduct an ""open hearing or hearings"" in which minority Republicans have equal time to question witnesses.

And, after that hearing is concluded, ""to allow for full evaluation of minority witness requests, the ranking minority member may submit to the chair, in writing, any requests for witness testimony relevant to the investigation described in the first section of this resolution within 72 hours after notice is given.""

Fox News is told it’s possible, based on the way the resolution is written, that the legal rights the resolution affords to the president could be curbed unless there are Judiciary Committee hearings, as opposed to Intelligence Committee hearings. That’s why the muscular role of the House Intelligence Committee is important in this resolution -- it raises the question of whether the president would be able to question witnesses outside of Judiciary Committee proceedings, and whom he would be able to question.

GOP STORMS THE SECURE SCIF ON CAPITOL HILL TO PROTEST IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

The resolution further directs the Intelligence Committee, in consultation with the other committees, to prepare a report on its findings to the Judiciary Committee, which would actually write any articles of impeachment. In response to GOP complaints about Democrats' selective leaks of opening statements and depositions, the document also authorizes the public release of testimony transcripts, with only sensitive or classified information being redacted.

And, the resolution permits Republicans to submit written demands for testimony and other evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, and raise objections.

There is no timeline given for the impeachment inquiry to conclude. The House Rules Committee, which is the gateway for most measures in the House, will meet Wednesday at 3 p.m. ET to prepare the resolution for the House floor, including by adding additional procedures. The full House will debate and vote on the measure Thursday morning, with a vote expected by midday.

Just before the resolution was filed, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told Fox News flatly on Tuesday that “this is not an impeachment resolution.”

He did not answer when asked if he was concerned about the public perception of that term.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also insisted Monday night, “It’s not an impeachment resolution.""

At the same time, there were encouraging signs for Democrats that their approach would play well among moderates and influential members of the caucus. Freshman South Carolina Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham, who unexpectedly flipped a seat from red to blue last year, told Fox News he was ""supportive"" of the new resolution.

And California Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez said the impeachment proceedings would not disrupt ongoing USMCA trade negotiations, which Gomez is handling at Pelosi's request.

Four Democratic committee chairs -- Reps. Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler, Eliot L. Engel, and Carolyn Maloney -- said in a statement Tuesday that the ""resolution provides rules for the format of open hearings in the House Intelligence Committee, including staff-led questioning of witnesses, and it authorizes the public release of deposition transcripts ... [it] establishes procedures for the transfer of evidence to the Judiciary Committee as it considers potential articles of impeachment, and it sets forth due process rights for the president and his counsel in the Judiciary Committee proceedings.""

They added: “The evidence we have already collected paints the picture of a president who abused his power by using multiple levers of government to press a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election. Following in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries, the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the president’s misconduct.”

“It’s not an impeachment resolution."" — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

In terms of upcoming impeachment-related proceedings, State Department Ukraine experts Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson are expected to appear in closed session on Wednesday.

Timothy Morrison, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Europe and Russia at the National Security Council, is expected to appear in closed session on Thursday.

Robert Blair, Assistant to the President and Senior Adviser to the Acting Chief of Staff, is expected to appear in closed session on Friday.

The Committees will ""renotice"" a future date for top Defense Department official Kathryn Wheelbarger. The committees are in ongoing discussions with other witnesses and we look forward to their testimony.

Earlier in the day on Tuesday, the top Republicans on the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry blasted the investigation as “illegitimate” and a “sham,"" signaling that the new procedures wouldn't change their minds.

House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Nunes, R-Calif., Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Michael McCaul, R-Texas, penned a letter to Rep. James McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, who announced his panel would take up an impeachment procedure resolution on Wednesday to “ensure transparency and provide a clear path forward.”

Nunes, Jordan and McCaul accused McGovern, D-Mass., of not giving enough time for Republican members to review the resolution ahead of the vote, and they continued to blast the inquiry as a whole.

“Under House rules you championed at the beginning of this Congress, major legislation is required to be posted 72 hours in advance of a vote,” they wrote. “Yet, here, on the gravest and most solemn work the House can do, you are forcing the House to consider a resolution with text that is still not available two days before the vote.”

“Without text, we know nothing about the Democrats’ intended impeachment process. Your website describes the resolution as ‘directing certain committees to continue their ongoing investigation,’” they continued. “Chairman Schiff does not need a resolution to continue leaking selective facts from his basement bunker.”

They added, “We can only assume, therefore, that this resolution is necessary to allow Democrats to subvert the ordinary legislative process.”

Still, the Democrats' resolution appeared to address the White House's complaints from earlier this month, when it vowed not to participate in the inquiry.

SCHIFF SAYS 'WE' DIDN'T TALK TO WHISTLEBLOWER -- THEN BACKTRACKS

Democrats, the White House complained, had not permitted Republicans in the minority to issue subpoenas, contradicting the ""standard, bipartisan practice in all recent resolutions authorizing presidential impeachment inquiries.""

The White House had argued: ""In the history of our nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the president without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step.""

William Latson, principal of Spanish River High School in Boca Raton, was initially reassigned when it was revealed he made the comments in April 2018. But on Wednesday, the Palm Beach County school board voted to oust him from the district.

FLASHBACK: FLORIDA PRINCIPAL REASSIGNED FOR CONTROVERSIAL HOLOCAUST DENIAL REMARKS

Latson was fired on grounds of “ethical misconduct” and “failure to carry out job responsibilities,"" The Palm Beach Post reported.

Outrage was sparked after Latson told a student's mother via email he was not allowed to say whether the Holocaust occurred because of his employment with the School District of Palm Beach County.

""I can't say the Holocaust is a factual, historical event because I am not in a position to do so as a school district employee,"" Latson wrote in an email, later published by the Post.

""Not everyone believes the Holocaust happened and you have your thoughts but we are a public school and not all of our parents have the same beliefs so they will react differently, my thoughts or beliefs have nothing to do with this because I am a public servant,"" the principal said. ""I have the role to be politically neutral but support all groups in the school.""

Latson added: ""I do allow information about the Holocaust to be presented and allow students and parents to make decisions about it accordingly."" He said he does the ""same with information about slavery.""

In another email, Latson said the school's curriculum, which reportedly includes Holocaust education in English and history classes, ""is to be introduced but not forced upon individuals as we all have the same rights but not all the same beliefs.""

Latson later apologized for his comments, explaining he regrets ""the verbiage that I used when responding to an email message from a parent, one year ago, did not accurately reflect my professional and personal commitment to educating all students about the atrocities of the Holocaust.""

The school district called Latson's comments ""offensive"" and said his views were ""not supported by either the School District Administration or the School Board.""

Latson's firing is the first in years, as many principals often resign before any type of termination proceedings take place, according to the newspaper. The principal's attorney reportedly plans to appeal the termination, which is scheduled to take effect Nov. 21. Until then, Latson is suspended without pay."
62,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-supreme-court-tax-return-case-after-second-circuit,2,"President Trump's attorney is vowing to go to the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court ruled Monday to allow New York City prosecutors to proceed with a subpoena for records including the president's tax returns.

Trump was attempting to block a subpoena which was issued to accounting firm Mazars USA by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. In a 34-page ruling handed down Monday morning, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a district court's ruling that state prosecutors can subpoena the tax returns of a sitting president.

FORMER TRUMP ORGANIZATION EXECUTIVE BELIEVES TRUMP WILL RESIGN TO AVOID IMPEACHMENT

“The decision of the 2nd Circuit will be taken to the Supreme Court,” Trump’s attorney Jay Sekulow said in a statement. “The issue raised in this case goes to the heart of our Republic. The constitutional issues are significant.”

Trump has argued that the subpoena is unenforceable because a sitting president should not be subject to a state criminal process. The 2nd Circuit disagreed.

“We hold, however, that any presidential immunity from state criminal process does not extend to investigative steps like the grand jury subpoena at issue here,” the ruling written by Chief Judge Robert Katzmann said.

The subpoena, issued Aug. 29, 2019, requested a variety of documents pertaining to Trump and his businesses, including “[t]ax returns and related schedules, in draft, as‐filed, and amended form” that Mazars possesses. Trump challenged it, arguing that he is not subject to the state criminal process while in office, and asked a federal District Court to declare the subpoena unenforceable during Trump’s presidency.

In an October ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero abstained, claiming the issue was not a matter for federal courts, but also provided an alternative holding stating that Trump’s immunity argument was unfounded and overbroad.

Marrero, who was appointed by then-President Bill Clinton, wrote that “the expansive notion of constitutional immunity invoked here to shield the president from judicial process would constitute an overreach of executive power,” and that Trump’s argument essentially claims “that a constitutional domain exists in this country in which not only the president, but, derivatively, relatives and persons and business entities associated with him in potentially unlawful private activities, are in fact above the law.”

The 2nd Circuit briefly put the subpoena on hold once Trump appealed the lower court’s decision, but now they are allowing it to be enforced.

Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance's office declined to comment.

In a statement, Mazars USA said they will comply with the court's decision.

""Mazars USA will respect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations,"" they said. ""We believe strongly in the ethical and professional rules and regulations that govern our industry, our work and our client interactions. As a matter of firm policy and professional rules we do not comment on the work we conduct for our clients.""

With Sekulow vowing to bring the case to the Supreme Court, Trump’s next move could be a request for a temporary injunction blocking the subpoena at least while the high court determines whether to take up the case.

Based on geography, an emergency filing from Trump would go to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who could either act on the matter alone or refer to the full Supreme Court for consideration.

63,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kentucky-virginia-and-mississippi-elections,2,"Republican incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin refused to concede late Tuesday in Kentucky's gubernatorial race, citing unspecified ""irregularities"" -- potentially kickstarting weeks of uncertainty as the closely-watched contest with national implications remains too close to call.

Meanwhile, Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear held a press conference Wednesday morning in Louisville, declaring victory by saying, “Last night, the election ended. It ended and it’s time to move forward with a smooth transition.”

With 100 percent of precincts reporting, Bevin was behind Beshear by 5,333 votes out of more than 1.4 million counted, 49.2 percent to 48.8 percent. Libertarian candidate John Hicks received 2 percent.

The Associated Press said it could not declare a winner, owing to the tight margin. The Democratic National Committee and Beshear's campaign, however, claimed victory.

""My expectation is that he [Bevin] will honor the election that was held tonight,"" Beshear said in a speech to supporters Tuesday. ""That he will help us make this transition. And I'll tell you what, we will be ready for that first day in office, and I look forward to it.""

And Democrat Amy McGrath, who is running in a long-shot bid to unseat GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in 2020, said simply: ""All I have to say is: Mitch, you’re next.""

Bevin, however, called it a ""close, close race"" and said he wasn't conceding ""by any stretch."" He added, ""We want the process to be followed, and there is a process."" On Monday, Trump had called on an ""angry majority"" of voters to boost the relatively unpopular Bevin in Kentucky, in a nod to Richard Nixon's ""silent majority"" and Ronald Reagan's ""moral majority.""

TRUMP CALLS ON 'ANGRY MAJORITY' TO BOOST BEVIN, IN NOD TO REAGAN'S 'MORAL MAJORITY' AND NIXON'S 'SILENT MAJORITY'

The history-making evening also saw Republicans decisively hold onto the governorship in Mississippi despite a fierce Democratic challenge, while electing Kentucky’s first black attorney general. Democrats, meanwhile, took complete control over the Virginia statehouse for the first time in 26 years.

Although Bevin has not outlined his next steps, Kentucky law provides for a variety of possible avenues. There is no mandatory recount law in Kentucky. Bevin may request counties recanvass their results, which is not a recount, but rather a check of the vote count to ensure the results were added correctly. Bevin would need to seek and win a court's approval for a recount.

Bevin could also mount a legal challenge to the election results, assuming he could identify sufficient grounds. Such a move could expose Bevin to criticism that, like defeated Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, he was refusing to accept the legitimate result of an election. (Abrams lost by 50,000 votes, a much larger margin than Bevin's current deficit.)

Regardless of the final outcome, the razor-thin margin in the race did not come as a surprise to Republicans. Although Trump carried deep-red Kentucky by 30 points in the 2016 presidential election, Bevin has long been very unpopular for a Republican in the state, owing in part to his numerous spats with striking public school teachers and his plan to address a growing pension crisis.

Bevin significantly underperformed the rest of the GOP ticket on the ballot in Kentucky on Tuesday, as Republican candidate Daniel Cameron handily won his race to become the state's next attorney general. Cameron made history as the first African-American to be elected Kentucky Attorney General and the first Republican to hold the post in more than 70 years.

In a strong indicator that Bevin is unpopular among Kentuckians, Cameron received 774,864 votes in his 15-percentage-point win -- while Bevin garnered only approximately 700,000 votes for his marquee gubernatorial bid. It is highly unusual for down-ballot races to attract more voter interest than gubernatorial contests.

Meanwhile, Republican attorney and former elections board member Michael Adams was easily elected as Kentucky’s next secretary of state, and Republican Mike Harmon was re-elected as Kentucky auditor. Additionally, Republican Ryan Quarles was re-elected as Kentucky commissioner of agriculture, and GOP incumbent Allison Ball won a second term as Kentucky’s treasurer.

Those results -- and Bevin's unique vulnerabilities -- led Republicans to dismiss claims that the gubernatorial race had any meaningful national implications.

DEMS SWEEP VIRGINIA STATE HOUSE, SENATE ELECTIONS, CAPPING STATE'S DRAMATIC LEFTWARD SHIFT

“President Trump’s rally helped five of six Kentucky Republicans win clear statewide victories, including Attorney General-elect Daniel Cameron, who will be the first black A.G. in Kentucky history and the first Republican to hold the office since 1948,"" Brad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager, said in statement to Fox News late Tuesday. ""The President just about dragged Gov. Matt Bevin across the finish line, helping him run stronger than expected in what turned into a very close race at the end. A final outcome remains to be seen.”

Commentator Philip Klein noted that Beshear's Democratic father won the governorship in Kentucky by strong margins in 2011, just a year before Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney carried the state by double-digits.

However, in what could be a worrying sign for Republicans in the long term, Bevin underperformed in Northern Kentucky, typically a GOP stronghold, and among suburban voters in several counties outside of Cincinnati.

Apparently aware of his problems with voters, Bevin had remarked in February, ""There has never been a poll ever taken since I’ve been a candidate or since I’ve been governor ... that has ever found me above water on anything or likely to win anything, ever. ... Polls, shmolls.""

""Polls, shmolls."" — Republican Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, in February

Calling health care a ""basic human right,"" Beshear supports inserting the federal Affordable Care Act's consumer protections into state law. He also vowed to rescind Bevin's efforts to require some ""able-bodied"" Medicaid recipients to get a job, go to school or volunteer to keep their benefits.

Beshear, whose father set federal health care reform into motion in Kentucky when he was governor, said at least 95,000 people would lose coverage if Bevin's work requirements became law. A federal judge blocked the work requirements, and Bevin's administration is appealing.

Also on Tuesday, Virginia Democrats took control of the state Senate and state House, as the state continues its dramatic leftward shift. The GOP had a slim majority in each chamber going into Tuesday's elections.

Democrats in Virginia now control both the executive mansion and the General Assembly for the first time in more than two decades. Outside groups and political parties in Virginia had been test-driving expensive campaigns for months to win over and motivate voters in a state that was until recently considered a presidential battleground.

Of the four states holding legislative elections this year, Virginia was the only one with control of the statehouse up for grabs. Virginia has been trending blue for years thanks to growth in more diverse, liberal suburbs and cities, and population declines in more rural, conservative areas.

Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, was not up for reelection Tuesday but had been actively campaigning for his party's candidates after bouncing back from a near politically fatal blackface scandal earlier this year.

Over in Mississippi, GOP candidate Tate Reeves soundly defeated Democratic rival Jim Hood. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Reeves was ahead 52.3 percent (442,444 votes) to 46.5 percent (393,520 votes).

Hood, the attorney general, had been seeking to become the second Democratic governor in the Deep South. Reeves, who got campaign help from both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, is currently lieutenant governor. The president visited the state on Tuesday.

Reeves will succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Phil Bryant.

""President Trump’s rally and endorsement in Mississippi undoubtedly had an impact and helped Governor-elect Tate Reeves nail down his victory,"" Parscale told Fox News. ""Governor Reeves will be a tremendous conservative leader for Mississippians in fighting for freedom and keeping taxes low. He will also be a key ally as 2020 approaches and President Trump continues building momentum for re-election.”

Democrats saw Hood as their strongest nominee in nearly a generation in a conservative state where Republicans have been governor for 24 of the past 28 years.

There were concerns in advance of the race that Mississippi's Jim Crow-era election process could have made the election difficult to decide. The state's 1890 constitution requires a statewide candidate to win a majority of both the popular vote and an electoral vote, with one electoral vote awarded to the top vote-getter in each of 122 state House districts.

If nobody had won both, the election would have been decided by the state House, now controlled by Republicans.

Headlining a fired-up rally at Rupp Arena in Lexington on Monday night, Trump jokingly acknowledged that the elections could be seen as a barometer of his popular support amid Democrats' impeachment inquiry.

If Republicans triumphed, Trump remarked, the media would cover it as a ""ho-hum"" event -- but if Democrats won, the day would be portrayed as a major loss for the White House.

""You can't let that happen to me!"" Trump said, laughing.

Top Democrats have acknowledged that Trump's influence helped the GOP sweep key House special elections in North Carolina in September.

But, Democrats' ongoing impeachment inquiry has blunted some of the president's momentum. Tuesday's races were voters' first major opportunity to cast ballots since the probe began.

Another key race is coming up: The lone Democratic governor in the Deep South, Louisiana's John Bel Edwards, is in a Nov. 16 runoff as he seeks a second term. Trump is set to headline a rally in Monroe, Louisiana, on behalf of GOP candidate Eddie Rispone on Wednesday.

The Louisiana race has become heated in recent days, with Rispone unloading on John Bel Edwards in personal terms and claiming he's soft on crime.

“Rispone is doing what he’s got to do,” Roy Fletcher, a veteran Republican consultant, told The Advocate. “He knocked the piss out of [Rep. Ralph] Abraham,"" who ran in the gubernatorial primary but didn't qualify for the runoff.

DEMS ADMIT TRUMP HELPED NORTH CAROLINA GOP CANDIDATES SWEEP SPECIAL ELECTIONS, AS RNC TOUTS DATA OPERATIONS

But the race's tough rhetoric pales in comparison to the tension that marked the Kentucky contest. Bevin drew perhaps his harshest criticism when he lashed out at teachers who used sick days to go on strike. In 2018, Bevin asserted without evidence that an unidentified child who had been left home alone somewhere in the state had been sexually assaulted on a day of mass school closings as teachers rallied.

He apologized but doubled down earlier this year by connecting a girl's shooting in Louisville with school closings caused by teacher protests.

“Bevin wants to be bailed out by President Trump, who won the state by a mile in 2016, and it seems like he is bringing up impeachment about every chance he can get,” said Fox News’ anchor and chief national correspondent Ed Henry.

ILHAN OMAR CALLS FOR 'MASS MOVEMENT' OF THE WORKING CLASS, AS CROWD CHANTS 'LOCK HIM UP'

And Beshear, the son of Kentucky's last Democratic governor, countered Bevin's campaign with a disciplined campaign style that stressed what he called ""kitchen table"" issues — education, jobs and health care. He exploited Bevin's combative style, branding the governor as a bully for a running feud with teachers who opposed his efforts to revamp the state's woefully underfunded public pension systems.

Leah Askarinam, a reporter and analyst with the nonpartisan newsletter Inside Elections, noted that even in these increasingly partisan times, voters in states like Kentucky are ""willing to cross party lines when it comes to governance of their specific states.""

""Gubernatorial candidates can campaign on issues that are state-specific like the state's budget and education funding -- and they can cross party lines without facing the same kind of political pressure as Senate candidates who have to work with a national legislature,"" Askarinam said. ""We've seen candidates like John Bel Edwards support state policies that limit abortion access, for example, which is a much more difficult stance to take as a Democrat in the Senate.""

The Kentucky election was to settle a bitter rivalry that stretched from the statehouse to courtrooms and finally to the campaign. Wielding his authority as the state's top lawyer, Beshear filed a series of lawsuits challenging Bevin's executive actions to make wholesale changes to boards and commissions and sought to block Bevin-backed pension and education initiatives. In the highest-profile case, a Beshear lawsuit led Kentucky's Supreme Court to strike down a Bevin-supported pension law on procedural grounds last year.

Bevin ramped up the rivalry by frequently attacking Beshear and his challenger's father in deeply personal terms. Beshear's father, former two-term Gov. Steve Beshear, preceded Bevin in office.

Andy Beshear took a shot at Bevin on Tuesday after Trump's visit.

""He had to have someone come to town for him, because he knew he couldn't win it on his own merits,"" Beshear said.

64,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/potus-to-pay-2-million-admits-misuse-of-trump-foundation-funds-in-settlement-with-ny-ag,2,"The New York Attorney General's office announced Thursday that a judge has ordered President Trump to pay $2 million in damages for improper use of funds at the Trump Foundation in connection with the 2016 presidential primaries and his own political purposes, as part of a lawsuit Trump and the foundation settled with state Attorney General Letitia James.

James' office had requested $2.8 million in restitution and a $5.6 million penalty, but Judge Saliann Scarpulla decided $2 million was a more reasonable restitution amount and declined to issue a penalty.

As part of the settlement, Trump admitted to misusing Trump Foundation funds and agreed to limitations placed on future charitable work. If he chooses to start a new charitable organization, he would have to report it to the state attorney general's office, according to an announcement from James' office.

TRUMP FOUNDATION AGREES TO DISSOLVE AFTER LAWSUIT ALLEGED 'ILLEGAL CONDUCT'

""The Trump Foundation has shut down, funds that were illegally misused are being restored, the president will be subject to ongoing supervision by my office, and the Trump children had to undergo compulsory training to ensure this type of illegal activity never takes place again,” Attorney General Letitia James said in statement. “The court’s decision, together with the settlements we negotiated, are a major victory in our efforts to protect charitable assets and hold accountable those who would abuse charities for personal gain.""

But Trump himself released a statement on Twitter on Thursday night saying James is “deliberately mischaracterizing this settlement for political purposes.""

The state filed the lawsuit against the Trump Foundation in June 2018, and the settlement includes four stipulation agreements, the first of which was fulfilled when the Trump Foundation agreed to shut down in Dec. 2018. The other three stipulations were added in Oct. 2019. They include distribution of the remainder of the foundation's assets to charities approved by James' office, training for the president's children Ivanka, Eric, and Donald Jr., and 19 paragraphs of Trump's admissions of illegal activity.

Those admissions include failure of the foundation's board to meet or engage in proper oversight, and details regarding coordination with Trump's 2016 campaign, including a Trump Foundation fundraiser that the campaign organized, and use of foundation funds to pay legal obligations, and for a $10,000 portrait of Trump. As part of the settlement, James' office said, Donald Trump Jr. reimbursed the foundation for the portrait.

The Attorney General's office stated that the $2 million in damages and the remaining $1.78 million that the foundation has will go to Army Emergency Relief, the Children’s Aid Society, Citymeals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha’s Table, United Negro College Fund, United Way of National Capital Area, and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

In a statement, a Trump Foundation spokesperson said the foundation was ""pleased to donate an additional $2 million"" to those organizations.

""Following the 2016 presidential election, the Trump Foundation publicly announced its intention to voluntarily dissolve and distribute all of its remaining funds to charity,"" the statement said.

It continued: ""Unfortunately, that donation was delayed due to the Attorney General’s politically motivated lawsuit. We are pleased that the Court, in rejecting the Attorney General’s frivolous request for statutory penalties, interest and other damages, recognized that every penny ever raised by the Trump Foundation has gone to help those most in need. Now that this matter is concluded, the Trump Foundation is proud to make this additional contribution.""

65,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/daca-lands-before-supreme-court-showdown-over-trump-bid-to-end-dreamer-program,2,"The long-running battle over the Trump administration’s bid to end the Obama-era program for young undocumented immigrants known as “Dreamers” will land before the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

And with a ruling expected in the midst of a presidential election year, the case puts the high court at the center of one of the most politically charged issues since the start of President Trump’s term.

TRUMP DECISION TO END DACA WAS LAWFUL, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS

For the administration and Dreamers alike, it all comes down to the Supreme Court, where Trump picks Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch now sit. Federal appeals courts across the country have rejected efforts to phase out the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, but the administration has looked to the high court for support.

""The administration has basically chalked up the fact that they are going to lose a lot of these cases in the lower courts,"" said Thomas Dupree, a former top Bush Justice Department official and now an appellate attorney.

""But they're playing the long game. I think that there are those in the White House and the Justice Department who have made a calculation saying, ‘Look we can absorb all these losses in the lower courts because we are going to win the endgame when this case gets into the Supreme Court.’”

It remains to be seen how the court will rule, however, on this complicated issue -- which concerns the limits of one president trying to rescind the policies of his predecessor.

Created under executive order, DACA gives some undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit.

""The reason the [Trump administration] gave was their belief that it was illegal to have such a program that gives protected status to a group of people who are not here legally,"" said Paul Smith, a Georgetown Law professor who has argued cases before the Supreme Court. ""They were caught between the political reality that they didn't want to dump on the Dreamers, but they still wanted to get rid of DACA as Obama's policy.""

An estimated 700,000 young adults currently in the DACA program could be affected, with a ruling for the administration potentially putting them at risk for deportation once again.

The Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the program in 2017, only for the federal courts to rule that it could not apply retroactively and that DACA should be restarted in full. The White House fought back on those decisions, saying the president has broad authority over immigration enforcement policy.

DACA proponents have argued that Trump’s planned termination violates federal law requiring adequate notice-and-comment periods before certain federal rules are changed, as well as other constitutional equal protection and due process guarantees.

The Supreme Court took the unusual step of taking up the cases before they had been fully heard at the lower court level. Those federal courts have issued nationwide injunctions, blocking the administration's plans, at least for now.

The Arguments

The Trump administration argues that the DACA program is not working and is unlawful, and that the president should have the ""absolute discretion"" to adopt a revised overall immigration strategy.

""Given the unacceptably high numbers of illegal border crossings,"" the Justice Department wrote in its appeal to the Supreme Court, ""it was critically important for DHS [Department of Homeland Security] to project a message that leaves no doubt regarding the clear, consistent, and transparent enforcement of the immigration laws against all classes and categories of aliens.""

And Attorney General Bill Barr says three separate nationwide injunctions, keeping DACA in place for now, have created chaos in the courts.

""Dreamers remain in limbo, the political process has been pre-empted, and we have had over a year of bitter political division that included a government shutdown of unprecedented length,"" he said in a recent speech. ""Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis at our southern border persists, while legislative efforts remain frozen as both sides await the courts’ word on DACA and other immigration issues.""

A dozen states led by Texas are among the parties backing the administration.

But opponents say the government has given only cursory explanations for justifying DACA's demise. By contrast, they say, the benefits for Dreamers and for the country are indisputable.

""These benefits have allowed DACA participants to achieve a 91 percent employment rate, and to increase their wages by 69 percent,"" said lawyers for the University of California, one of the key plaintiffs. ""Access to lawful work allows DACA participants to support their families, including their estimated 200,000 U.S.-citizen children, and to receive employer-sponsored health insurance.""

A host of civil rights groups filed separate briefs in support, along with several states including New York and California.

Hundreds of pro-DACA demonstrators are expected to rally Tuesday outside the Supreme Court while arguments are taking place.

The Impact

Among those anxiously awaiting the Supreme Court's decision is Daniela, a college student in Washington, D.C. She asked her last name not be used.

Daniela has been active on her campus, as president of the Dreamers Alliance, a support system for undocumented students like her, promoting immigrant rights.

She came to the U.S. with her family from El Salvador at age 3, and her dream is to become an educator.

""We matter and we're here and we're not going to stop fighting -- and not fighting in the sense that we're angry -- but fighting in the sense that we need some kind of solution.""

The group's program director says the Supreme Court may be the Dreamers' last hope.

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN END DACA PROGRAM

""For young people waiting and hearing, and constantly being on pins and needles of these court hearings is very difficult,"" said Gabriela Pacheco. ""It feels for many of them that the rug is being pulled underneath them, that they've done everything right that they're contributing, they're going to college and they're working. We all win when you have a young person maximizing their full potential.""

Early in his administration, Trump voiced some support for DACA, but only if it was tied to congressional negotiations over tightening legal immigration -- and building his border wall.

""We are going to deal with DACA with heart,"" Trump said in February 2017. ""I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don’t forget, and I have to convince them that what I’m saying is right.""

Months later, the president announced he was terminating DACA under his own executive authority, prompting the flood of lawsuits.

However, one thing the Trump administration and many DACA backers agree on is that Congress could rectify the issue, by passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would include Dreamer protections, backed by the force of law.

But now, it’s up to the courts.

In the court of popular opinion, DACA remains popular. A Fox News poll in June found 73 percent of registered voters surveyed favor allowing Dreamers to stay in the U.S., while 24 percent are opposed.

The consolidated cases are DHS v. Regents of the University of California (18-587); Trump v. NAACP (18-588); and McAlleenan v. Vidal (18-589). A ruling is expected by late June 2020."
66,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/yovanovitch-to-face-gop-grilling-as-second-day-of-public-impeachment-hearings-begin,2,"Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled this past May, became teary-eyed as she recounted her sudden firing during a closed-door deposition last month, sources told Fox News.

That may have been the easy part.

On Friday morning at 9 a.m. ET, the 60-year-old diplomat will take the stand again for Day Two of the public impeachment hearings against President Trump -- and Republicans are set to hammer her with an aggressive cross-examination related to her previous statements under oath, as well as her reported role in shielding a George Soros-linked nonprofit allegedly connected to documented Ukrainian election interference efforts.

“The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news,” was how Trump described Yovanovitch to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 phone call.

“She’s going to go through some things,” the president added ominously.

“The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news. She’s going to go through some things.” — President Trump

Shortly before Yovanovitch was set to take the stand, Fox News contributor John Solomon published an explosive March interview with Yuriy Lutsenko, a former prosecutor general in Ukraine. Lutsenko claimed that Yovanovitch had given him a “do not prosecute” list — and Solomon reported that Yovanovitch pressured Ukrainian prosecutors to back off a case involving the AntiCorruption Action Centre, funded by Soros, the liberal megadonor.

The U.S. Embassy under Yovanovitch, Solomon reported, also influenced Ukraine to drop prosecution against top law enforcement official Artem Sytnyk, who was singled out by a Ukrainian court for leaking damaging information about Paul Manafort, then Trump's campaign chairman, to help Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Ukraine courts have ruled that the Manafort financial disclosures constituted illegal election meddling.

Ukraine systematically worked behind the scenes to boost Clinton, Politico has reported. On his call with Zelensky in July, Trump specifically asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate reports that Ukraine had some involvement in 2016 election interference, before he mentioned taking a look at Joe Biden's business dealings in the country.

Though multiple reports, including one from The Associated Press, indicated Lutsenko had recanted his claims about Yovanovitch, Lutsenko said he had not -- a revelation later confirmed by The New York Times.

On Friday and beyond, House Republicans plan to sharpen their focus on allegations of Ukraine meddling in the 2016 presidential election, voicing frustration after top diplomats who testified Wednesday said they had no knowledge of the issue. A senior Republican official told Fox News on Thursday that the issue of Ukrainian election meddling would be a “theme” of questions asked by GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee moving forward.

UKRAINE MEDDLING TO BE KEY GOP FOCUS MOVING FORWARD, AFTER WITNESSES APPEARED NOT TO KNOW ABOUT IT

Making matters more complicated for Democrats, Yovanovitch's testimony was set to come just hours after a bombshell report that a top Ukrainian official said Thursday that U.S. Ambassador Gordon Sondland, a key Democrat impeachment witness, ""did not link financial military assistance to a request for Ukraine to open up an investigation into former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.""

Citing that report in a tweet late Thursday, Trump called the impeachment probe ""dead.""

Sondland has testified that Trump explicitly told him there were ""no quid pro quos of any kind"" with Ukraine, including one in which military aid would be conditioned on any politically motivated investigations. (Sondland later amended his testimony, claiming his recollection had been ""refreshed,"" to say he had come to ""understand"" from other sources that Trump wanted Ukraine to issue an ""anti-corruption statement."")

Forced out of her job in April, Yovanovitch likely can't offer much of substance on her own about the central allegations against the president. Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry contend that several months later in the year, Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, and withheld U.S. military aid as leverage.

The timeline will render Yovanovitch vulnerable to the same criticisms that Republicans had for William Taylor and George Kent, the two diplomats who testified during Day One of the impeachment proceedings: That all she can offer is unverifiable hearsay and speculation.

WATCH: JIM JORDAN UNLOADS ON 'HEARSAY' TESTIMONY DURING DAY ONE OF IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Additionally, Republican lawmakers have argued that Yovanovitch wasn't entirely truthful in her previous remarks under oath. She communicated via her personal email account with a Democratic congressional staffer concerning a ""quite delicate"" and ""time-sensitive"" matter -- just two days after the whistleblower complaint that kickstarted the impeachment inquiry was filed, and a month before the complaint became public, emails exclusively obtained by Fox News showed.

The emails appear to contradict Yovanovitch's deposition on Capitol Hill last month, in which she told U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., about an email she received Aug. 14 from the staffer, Laura Carey -- but indicated under oath that she never responded to it.

""I specifically asked her whether the Democratic staffer was responded to by Yovanovitch or the State Department,"" Zeldin told Fox News. ""It is greatly concerning that Ambassador Yovanovitch didn't answer my question as honestly as she should have, especially while under oath.""

Yovanovitch's colleagues, for their part, have said she was the target of a smear campaign by the White House, and Trump himself has called the diplomat ""bad news.""

Separately during her remarks, Yovanovitch outlined how she lost her job in Ukraine, even as she remains an employee of the State Department.

“You’re going to think that I’m incredibly naive,” Yovanovitch told impeachment investigators. “But I couldn’t imagine all the things that have happened over the last six or seven months. I just couldn’t imagine it.”

EMAILS OBTAINED BY FOX NEWS SHOW KEY DEM IMPEACHMENT WITNESS WASN'T HONEST UNDER OATH, GOP SEN SAYS

Democratic lawmakers are expected to point to the circumstances of her ouster as they try to make their case that Trump, with the help of his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, mounted an inappropriate pressure campaign to enlist Zelensky in the effort to damage Biden.

“Giuliani also conducted a smear campaign against the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said at the first public impeachment hearing earlier this week. “A senior State Department official told her that although she had done nothing wrong, President Trump had lost confidence in her.”

Trump was convinced Yovanovitch was a rogue actor who held a political bias against him, according to a rough transcript of the July 25 call between the president and Zelensky.

At the time of the call, the Trump administration had put a hold on nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and Zelensky and his team were trying to get Trump to commit to a date for a White House meeting.

The intelligence community whistleblower who spurred the House investigation cited Yovanovitch’s ouster as one in a series of events that amounted to an abuse of power by the president.

'COUP HAS STARTED,' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY SAID IN 2017, VOWING IMPEACHMENT

Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday accused the president of ""bribery"" by allegedly ""threatening to withhold military aid"" in exchange for an ""investigation into his political rival"" -- signaling that Democrats were preparing to go all-in on impeachment. The Washington Post had reported Democrats were retiring the ""quid pro quo"" language in exchange for ""bribery"" following an internal study showing the word ""bribery"" resonated more in battleground states.

Yovanovitch, a State Department employee for 33 years who also led U.S. embassies in Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, is well known in diplomatic circles for her measured demeanor and diligence in representing both Republican and Democratic administrations, according to former colleagues.

“Mr. Giuliani was almost unmissable starting in mid-March,” Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified Wednesday. “As the news campaign, or campaign of slander, against not only Ambassador Yovanovitch unfolded ... he was on TV, his Twitter feed ramped up and it was all focused on Ukraine.”

After the ambassador’s recall, Giuliani told Ukrainian journalists that Yovanovitch was pulled from Kiev because she was part of efforts against the president. The former New York City mayor also has said that he told the president there were concerns among Trump supporters that she had displayed anti-Trump bias in private conversations.

During her October testimony, Yovanovitch said she was told that the State Department had been under pressure from Trump to remove her from Ukraine since the summer of 2018.

FLASHBACK: TRUMP'S NOT ALONE: CONGRESS DIGGING INTO DNC-UKRAINE CONNECTION

In late March, the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., posted a tweet referring to her as a “joker,” and linked to an article from the conservative website Daily Wire that detailed a growing call for Yovanovitch’s ouster.

Yovanovitch raised concerns about the U.S. media reports with Sondland. In response, Sondland encouraged her to tweet her support for Trump on social media.

“He said, ‘You know, you need to go big or go home,'” she recalled. “‘You need to, you know, tweet out there that you support the president.’”

The advice allegedly floored Yovanovitch.

Now Yovanovitch, hardly a marquee name in Washington, finds herself thrust into the spotlight of just the fourth impeachment inquiry in U.S. history.

Nancy McEldowney, a former U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria who has known Yovanovitch for three decades, said the accusations levied by Trump and Giuliani don’t square with the professional envoy whose focus throughout her career has remained on “serving American national interests and supporting the people around her.”

Some GOP senators have talked about contingency plans should the House impeach the president. Specifically, Republicans have floated the idea of holding a lengthy Senate trial early next year, which would potentially jam up several Democratic presidential contenders in the middle of the primary season.

House Democrats, however, could preempt that strategy -- perhaps by approving an article of impeachment, then waiting to approve a second resolution formally notifying the Senate of the impeachment until after the primary season is over.

Fox News' Gillian Turner, Chad Pergram, Brooke Singman, and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
67,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-impeachment-hearings-trump-moderate-democrats,2,"All eyes were on moderate House Democrats in swing districts Wednesday night, after the first day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump wrapped up with no major revelations -- but also highlighted weaknesses in Democrats' key witnesses, who relied primarily on second-hand information and never once interacted with the president.

At one point in Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., even appeared to embrace hearsay testimony, claiming that ""hearsay can be much better evidence than direct"" and that ""countless people have been convicted on hearsay because the courts have routinely allowed and created, needed exceptions to hearsay."" It was unclear which of those limited exceptions would apply to Wednesday's testimony -- and whether Quigley's argument would persuade critical swing-vote Democrats.

The House is now comprised of 431 members, meaning Democrats need 217 yeas to impeach Trump. There are currently 233 Democrats, so Democrats can only lose 16 of their own and still impeach the president. 31 House Democrats represent more moderate districts that Trump carried in 2016.

Freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich. -- who flipped a GOP district in 2018 that Trump won by 7 points in 2016 -- told Fox News that she was tentatively weighing all the evidence.

""My constituents expect me to make an objective decision,"" Slotkin said as the hearings concluded, ""not one based on an hour of testimony.""

Slotkin went on to acknowledge that launching an impeachment inquiry was a ""politically tough thing to do.""

""I'm not waking up in the morning looking for some golden poll,"" Slotkin said, insisting that she would analyze all testimony carefully in the coming days.

Reports have emerged that, should Trump be impeached by a majority vote in the House, Senate Republicans might strategically hold a lengthy trial to ""scramble"" the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- including by requiring several of the contenders to remain in Washington to handle the trial. Trump is all but certain to be acquitted by the GOP-controlled Senate in the event of impeachment, given that a two-thirds vote is required in the Senate to remove the president.

As the public hearing wrapped up on Wednesday, the panel voted 13-9, along party lines, to table a Republican motion to subpoena the whistleblower -- signaling that not many minds had been swayed.

'COUP HAS STARTED,' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY SAID IN 2017, VOWING IMPEACHMENT

A GOP source close to the House Intelligence Committee told Fox News late Wednesday that Republicans have full confidence in counsel Steve Castor, and he will continue to lead the questioning in the next round of public impeachment hearings. GOP members were pleased with his questioning today, the source said.

The day provided one previously undisclosed allegation. Career diplomat William Taylor, the charge d’affaires in Kiev, offered testimony, for the first time, that the president was overheard by a member of his staff on July 26 asking EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland about “the investigations,” to which Sondland supposedly responded that “the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.” Taylor said that following Sondland’s call with Trump, the member of his staff asked what Trump thought about Ukraine.

“Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,” Taylor said, revealing new information from his prior testimony last month. “At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information. I am including it for completeness.”

But, Republicans pointed out that Taylor's testimony was unverifiable hearsay, several layers deep -- and that Sondland has previously testified that Trump explicitly told him there were ""no quid pro quo’s of any kind"" with Ukraine, including one in which military aid would be conditioned on any politically motivated investigations. (Sondland later amended his testimony, claiming his recollection had been ""refreshed,"" to say that he had come to ""understand"" from other sources that Trump wanted Ukraine to issue an ""anti-corruption statement."")

""'Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. [Tim] Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I had conveyed this message to Mr. [Andriy] Yermak on September 1, 2019, in connection with Vice President Pence’s visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President [Volodymyr] Zelensky,'"" Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan said, incredulously reading a statement from Sondland.

""We’ve got six people having four conversations in one sentence, and you just told me this is where you got your 'clear understanding,'"" Jordan continued, as Taylor appeared to laugh. ""Ambassador, you weren't on the call, were you? You've never talked to Chief of Staff [Mick] Mulvaney? You've never met the president. ... And you're their star witness?""

Even CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin noted that Democrats had a ""problem,"" in that their key witnesses Wednesday had never directly interacted with Trump. ""And, that's a problem if you're going to impeach the president,"" Toobin said.

Jordan also reminded viewers that President Obama had declined to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, even after Russia's invasion. Trump, on the other hand, eventually provided Javelin missiles. And, Ukraine's president has said he felt no pressure, improper or otherwise, from the Trump administration to engage in any investigations.

Trump, for his part, said he was too busy to watch on Wednesday and denied having such a phone call. ""First I've heard of it,"" he said when asked.

At a news conference with Turkey's leader, Trump vowed to release another transcript of an earlier call with Ukraine on Thursday. He called Democrats' efforts a hopeless ""witch hunt.""

The president pointed to Sondland's written testimony: ""The one thing I've seen that Sondland said, he did speak to me for a brief moment, he did speak to me for a brief moment -- [he testified previously that] I said, no 'quid pro quo,' under any circumstances, and that's true. In any event, it's more second-hand information. ... The only thing, and I guess Sondland has stayed with his testimony, that there was no quid-pro-quo, pure and simple.""

Media observers questioned whether the proceedings ultimately would sway any opinions, or make things any easier for moderate Democrats. ABC News' George Stephanopoulos mused on-air, ""part of me is wondering, what do facts matter anymore in these debates?""

Meanwhile, Christian Jacobs, 50, sat in a beach bar in St. Petersburg, wearing a fedora and reluctantly watching the drama on television, as The Associated Press put it.

Anthony Harris, cutting hair in Savannah, Georgia, had the hearing on in his shop, but he said, ""It's gotten to the point now where people are even tired of listening.""

Lawmakers largely signaled that the hours of partisan back-and-forth did not appear to leave a singular moment etched in the public consciousness the way the Watergate proceedings or former President Clinton's impeachment did.

""No real surprises, no bombshells,"" said committee member Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah.

Taylor and Kent had defied White House instructions not to appear. Both received subpoenas.

They were among a dozen current and former officials who already testified behind closed doors. Wednesday was the start of days of public hearings expected to stretch into next week.

All day, the diplomats testified about how an ambassador was fired, the new Ukraine government was confused and they discovered an ""irregular channel"" -- a shadow U.S. foreign policy orchestrated by the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani which raised alarms in diplomatic and national-security circles.

For their part, Republican lawmakers observed that the president -- not unelected career bureaucrats -- dictated foreign policy.

At its core, the inquiry has stemmed from Trump’s July 25 phone call when he asked Zelensky for ""a favor.""

The White House already has released a transcript of the call, in which the two discussed past U.S. ""support"" for Ukraine, as well as Ukraine's issues with corruption. On the call, Trump asked Kiev to investigate reports that Ukraine was involved in 2016 election interference.

Later on, the president also mentioned former Vice President Joe Biden's push to have Ukraine's chief prosecutor fired, and suggested the country look into the matter.

The call came a day after former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's widely derided appearance on Capitol Hill appeared to leave Democrats' hopes for impeachment dashed.

""They want to see things a little more fair, they want to see things a little more just. And how we approach that I think will be important.”

The two-term Democratic president made the remarks at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democratic donors. He was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, who lost Georgia’s gubernatorial race last year.

Obama has largely stayed on the sidelines on the 2020 Democratic primary, and has not yet backed a candidate -- even as former Vice President Joe Biden has invoked his name on numerous occasions. But Obama has made remarks indicating he is nervous about the drift to the extreme left on a number of issues by parts of the Democratic Party.

On Friday, he did not mention any candidates by name, but did cite immigration and health care reform as examples of where Democrats may be out of sync with the broader electorate.

Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who have both released plans on immigration and “Medicare-for-all” respectively in recent weeks. Warren’s government-led overhaul of the health care system would eventually abolish private insurance and cost $52 trillion, while Sanders’ immigration plan includes radical policies including welfare for illegal immigrants and a moratorium on all deportations.

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,” Obama said.

The comment about Twitter feeds echoes remarks he made last month, when the former president took a swipe at “woke” virtue signalling and cancel culture, telling a Chicago audience to “get over” their obsessions with ideological purity tests.

The guards, identified as Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, have been charged with making false records and conspiring to make false records and to defraud the United States by impairing the lawful functions of the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the New York facility where Epstein was found dead on Aug. 10, prosecutors announced.

""As alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement. ""Instead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction.""

FBI INVESTIGATING POSSIBILITY OF 'CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE' IN JEFFREY EPSTEIN DEATH, PRISONS CHIEF ADMITS

Both guards surrendered themselves to authorities Tuesday morning, prosecutors say.

An indictment filed today in Manhattan federal court alleges that Noel and Thomas ""repeatedly failed to complete mandated counts of prisoners under their watch in the MCC’s Special Housing Unit,"" according to a statement from the United States Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York.

""Instead, for substantial portions of their shifts, Noel and Thomas sat at their desk, browsed the internet, and moved around the common area of the SHU,"" the statement said. ""To conceal their failure to perform their duties, Noel and Thomas repeatedly signed false certifications attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates that they did not do.

EPSTEIN ACCUSER SAYS SHE ONCE TOOK BILL CLINTON'S SEAT ON PRIVATE JET

""As a result of those false statements,"" prosecutors say, ""the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU were being regularly monitored when, in fact, as a result of the defendants’ conduct, no correctional officer conducted any count or round of the SHU from approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at which time, Noel and Thomas discovered the body of MCC inmate Jeffrey Epstein, who had committed suicide overnight while unobserved.""

The Attorney’s Office says Noel, 31, and Thomas, 41, each have been charged with ""one count of conspiring to defraud the United States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the MCC, and to make false records, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

""Noel is also charged with five counts of making false records, and Thomas is also charged with three counts of making false records, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison,"" it added.

The arrests are the first in the investigation into Epstein’s death. New York City’s medical examiner ruled that the convicted sex offender took his own life inside his Manhattan federal prison cell on Aug. 10, but a pioneering forensic pathologist told Fox News in late October that Epstein’s body bore telltale signs of homicide.

Prosecutors wrote in the indictment that no one appeared to enter the area where Epstein was being held in the hours before he was found dead.

""As reflected on video obtained from the MCC'S internal video surveillance system, at approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9, 2019... Noel briefly walked up to, and then walked back from, the door to the tier in which Epstein was housed,"" it said. ""As confirmed by the video... this was the last time anyone, including any correctional officer, walked up to, let alone entered, the only entrance to the tier in which Epstein was housed until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10.""

71,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/horowitz-finds-evidence-fbi-employee-altered-russia-probe-document,2,"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has found evidence that an FBI lawyer manipulated a key investigative document related to the FBI's secretive surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser -- enough to change the substantive meaning of the document, according to multiple reports.

The show-stopping development comes as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News that Horowitz's comprehensive report on allegations of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant abuse against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page will be released on Dec. 9. ""That's locked,"" Graham said.

The new evidence concerning the altered document, which pertained to the FBI's FISA court warrant application to surveil Page, is expected to be outlined in Horowitz's upcoming report. CNN first reported the news, which was largely confirmed by The Washington Post.

But the Post, hours after publishing its story, conspicuously removed the portion of its reporting that the FBI employee involved worked ""beneath"" Peter Strzok, the FBI's since-fired head of counterintelligence. The Post did not offer an explanation for the change, which occurred shortly after midnight. Earlier this week, the DOJ highlighted a slew of anti-Trump text messages sent by Strzok when he was leading the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the probe into the Trump campaign.

""The person under scrutiny has not been identified but is not a high-ranking official — they worked beneath former deputy assistant director Peter Strzok, according to people familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss material that has not yet been made public,"" The Post wrote in its now-deleted paragraph.

WAYBACK MACHINE SHOWS ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE POST'S STORY, BEFORE STEALTH DELETION

The paper eventually added a correction to the bottom of its piece, reading, ""Correction: An earlier version of this story erroneously stated that the FBI employee being investigated for altering a document worked underneath former Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok. The employee was a low-level lawyer in the Office of General Counsel and did not report to the deputy assistant director.""

Nevertheless, Horowitz reportedly found that the FBI employee was involved enough in the FISA process to falsely state that he had ""documentation to back up a claim he had made in discussions with the Justice Department about the factual basis"" for the FISA warrant application, the Post reported. Then, the FBI employee allegedly ""altered an email"" to substantiate his inaccurate version of events. The employee has since been forced out of the bureau.

In its initial 2016 FISA warrant application, the FBI flatly called Page ""an agent of a foreign power.""

Sources told Fox News last month that U.S. Attorney John Durham's separate, ongoing probe into potential FBI and Justice Department misconduct in the run-up to the 2016 election through the spring of 2017 has transitioned into a full-fledged criminal investigation -- and that Horowitz's report will shed light on why Durham's probe has become a criminal inquiry.

FBI AGENTS MANIPULATED FLYNN FILE, AS CLAPPER ORDERED 'KILL SHOT,' FILING SAYS

Durham has reportedly taken up Horowitz's findings concerning the falsified FISA document, meaning the ex-FBI lawyer who made the changes is now under criminal investigation. The Post indicated, however, that the document was not central to the legality of the FISA warrant obtained against Page.

Republicans have long argued that the FBI's alleged FISA abuses, which came as the bureau aggressively pursued ultimately unsubstantiated claims of criminal links between the Trump team and Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign, were politically motivated. In recent months, a series of unearthed documents has strengthened those claims.

Just nine days before the FBI applied for its first FISA warrant to surveil Page, bureau officials were battling with a senior Justice Department official who had ""continued concerns"" about the ""possible bias"" of a source pivotal to the application, according to internal text messages previously obtained by Fox News.

The 2016 messages, sent between Lisa Page and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, also revealed that bureau brass circulated at least two anti-Trump blog articles, including a Lawfare blog post sent shortly after Election Day that called Trump possibly ""among the major threats to the security of the country.""

DOJ OUTLINES STRZOK 'SECURITY VIOLATIONS'; FINDS 'PARANOID' CASE AGENT NOTICED STRZOK WAS SITTING ON WEINER LAPTOP

Fox News is told the texts were connected to the ultimately successful Page application, which relied in part on information from British ex-spy Christopher Steele – whose anti-Trump views are now well-documented – and cited Page’s suspected Russia ties. In its warrant application, the FBI inaccurately assured the FISA court on numerous occasions that media sources independently corroborated Steele's claims, and did not clearly state that Steele worked for a firm hired by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

Much of the Steele dossier has been proved discredited or unsubstantiated, including the dossier's claims that the Trump campaign was paying hackers in the United States out of a non-existent Russian consulate in Miami, or that ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen traveled to Prague to conspire with Russians. Special Counsel Robert Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Carter Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant, or that a lurid blackmail tape involving the president existed.

Despite being accused by the FBI of being a Russian agent in the FISA application, and being secretly surveilled for more than a year, Page has not been charged with any wrongdoing. He has since sued numerous actors -- including the DNC -- for defamation related to claims that he worked with Russia.

DISPUTE ERUPTS AS BRENNAN, COMEY APPEAR TO DISPUTE WHO PUSHED THE STEELE DOSSIER

""OI [Office of Intelligence] now has a robust explanation re any possible bias of the chs [confidential human source] in the package,"" Lisa Page wrote to McCabe on Oct. 12, 2016. ""Don't know what the holdup is now, other than Stu's continued concerns.""

It's unclear whether the confidential source in question was Steele or another individual. ""Stu"" was an apparent reference to Stuart Evans, then the DOJ's National Security Division deputy assistant attorney general. In one previously unearthed and since-unredacted text message, Strzok texted Page that he was ""Currently fighting with Stu for this FISA"" in late 2016.

Page is not the only Trump official to allege misconduct by the FBI. Last month, an explosive court filing from Michael Flynn’s legal team alleged that FBI agents manipulated official records of the former national security adviser’s 2017 interview that led to him being charged with lying to investigators. Flynn's attorneys demanded the FBI search its internal ""Sentinel"" system to find more evidence of allegedly doctored files.

Newly released text messages involving text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page revealed that Page -- who was not present for the Flynn interview -- had apparently made ""edits"" to the so-called ""302"" witness report in the case, which was key to Flynn's prosecution on a false statements charge. Page told Strzok on February 10, 2017 that she “gave my edits to Bill to put on your desk.”

Horowitz told congressional lawmakers in an October letter that his investigation and ensuing report were nearing their conclusion.

The ""lengthy"" draft report ""concerns sensitive national security and law enforcement matters,"" Horowitz wrote in the letter, adding that he anticipated ""the final report will be released publicly with few redactions.""

Horowitz noted that he did not anticipate a need to prepare or issue ""separate classified and public versions of the report.""

""After we receive the final classification markings from the Department and the FBI, we will then proceed with our usual process for preparing a final report, including ensuring that appropriate reviews occur for accuracy and comment purposes,"" Horowitz wrote in the letter. ""Once begun, we do not anticipate the time for that review to be lengthy.""

Pugh, 69, is expected to self-surrender to U.S. Marshals Thursday before her first court appearance before U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow, according to a news release.

The former mayor, who resigned her post in May amid the book sale controversy, is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, seven counts of wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and two counts of tax evasion. The indictment was returned Nov. 14.

BALTIMORE MAYOR INSISTS LEADERSHIP IS NOT TO BLAME FOR HOMICIDE RATE

Prosecutors say Pugh, who became Baltimore's 50th mayor on Dec. 6, 2016, used her ""Healthy Holly"" book series in order to fund her lifestyle in addition to her political campaign and political interests. She allegedly bought a house and paid down personal debt with the profits, according to The Baltimore Sun.

The book scheme allegedly involved Pugh failing to print thousands of copies or double-selling titles in the series, the Sun reported. Prosecutors also allege Pugh listed her 2016 income as $31,000 when it actually exceeded $322,000.

In April, Pugh announced she was taking an indefinite leave of absence after she had been ""advised by her physicians that she needs to take time to recover and focus on her health."" She said she felt like she wasn't able to fulfill her obligations as mayor because of her deteriorating health brought on by a recent case of pneumonia.

Ultimately, Pugh resigned amid state and federal investigations about her book series, and apologized ""for the harm that I have caused to the image of the city of Baltimore and to the credibility of the office of the mayor.""

73,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ex-nsc-aide-fiona-hill-david-holmes,2,"Former National Security Council aide Fiona Hill clashed with Republicans during Thursday’s Trump impeachment inquiry hearings after accusing some lawmakers of embracing the “fictional narrative” that only Ukraine -- and not Russia -- interfered in the 2016 elections, igniting a fierce response.

The testy proceedings at the Capitol also included testimony from David Holmes, a U.S. State Department official in Ukraine, who described how he overheard a phone call this summer with President Trump about wanting Ukraine to conduct political investigations.

Holmes testified that he eventually understood that “demand” to be linked to delayed military aid. The White House countered, as it has in prior hearings, that the witnesses did not speak to any direct knowledge on the aid hold-up, while GOP lawmakers dismissed the alleged offense as nothing more than a “thought crime.”

FIONA HILL SAYS SHE WAS GIVEN STEELE DOSSIER JUST BEFORE IT WAS PUBLISHED

But Hill irritated Republicans from the outset Thursday by saying in her opening statement, “Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country—and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did.”

Throughout the day, Republicans repeatedly addressed her claims. The top Republican on the committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, pushed back by holding up a copy of the GOP-led Intelligence Committee’s 2018 “Report on Russian Active Measures” finding that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.

“What you just said was not true…but you felt the need to put it in your eight-page statement,” Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, told her.

New York Rep. Elise Stefanik said: “Not a single Republican member of this committee has said that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 elections.”

Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup told Hill her statement was “false,” saying she was just repeating “Mr. Schiff’s narrative,” referring to the Democratic committee chairman. “That’s where you’ve heard it. We did a whole report on it.”

The transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- a moment at the heart of the impeachment probe -- shows Trump asking for a “favor” in the form of Ukraine providing information about the hacking of the DNC server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.

Hill acknowledged in her testimony that her comments were in reference to those allegations.

“These fictions are harmful even if they are deployed for purely domestic political purposes,” Hill said, also saying ""if the president, or anyone else, impedes or subverts the national security of the United States in order to further domestic political or personal interests, that is more than worthy of your attention.""

She later, though, acknowledged that reporting from a 2017 Politico story indicated Ukrainian officials sought to ""curry favor"" with the Clinton campaign. “They bet on the wrong horse … They bet on Hillary Clinton winning the election,” she said, noting some officials disparaged Trump, but drawing a distinction between those issues and Russian meddling.

IMPEACHMENT WITNESS FIONA HILL ONCE OPPOSED SENDING LETHAL AID TO UKRAINE IN FIGHT WITH RUSSIA

Democrats have dismissed the notion that Ukraine played a role in the 2016 race. But Republicans throughout the hearing have repeatedly asked witnesses about a separate Ukraine-related allegation involving Alexandra Chalupa—a former Democratic National Committee consultant who allegedly had meetings during the 2016 campaign with officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in D.C. to discuss incriminating information about Trump campaign figures, as detailed in the Politico story.

""At the same time, certain Ukrainians did work against candidate Trump,"" Wenstrup said. ""Some with the DNC.""

Nunes -- the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee -- accused Democrats during the hearing of ""improperly redacting [Chalupa's] name from deposition transcripts and refusing to let Americans hear her testimony as a witness in these proceedings.""

The Russia probe and the 2016 election were frequently referenced by Nunes in the hearing. Hill acknowledged that she knows Christopher Steele, the author of the infamous dossier of conspiracy theories about Trump, and was shown an early copy of the document.

Referencing the Democrat-funded dossier, Nunes asked both Hill and Holmes if they think it’s appropriate for political parties to send operatives into foreign countries to dig up dirt on their opponents. Both said no.

The testimony came on the last scheduled day -- at this time -- of open impeachment hearings before the Intelligence Committee, which hosted a spree of five hearings spread across three days this week.

The inquiry, at its core, has focused on how Trump pressured Zelensky to announce investigations related to the Bidens, as well as alleged actions taken by Ukraine in the 2016 election, as military aid was withheld.

Holmes, the U.S. State Department official in Ukraine, testified about a Sept. 8 conversation where Bill Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, told him Trump's advisers wanted Zelensky to commit to going on American television to announce an investigation.

“This was a demand that President Zelensky personally commit, on a cable news channel, to a specific investigation of President Trump’s political rival,” Holmes said, adding, “I was shocked the requirement was so specific and concrete.”

The interview never happened, and the aid was eventually released, a fact that Republicans have cited to counter Democrats' allegations.

Speaking to lawmakers, Holmes said he eventually got the ""clear impression"" that the hold on aid was ""likely intended"" to prod Ukraine over the desired investigations -- related to former Vice President Joe Biden's role in the ouster of a prosecutor who had been looking into Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings where his son Hunter was on the board. Hill said Thursday: ""It was clear Burisma was code for the Bidens.""

Trump has maintained there was no ""quid pro quo,"" however, and Republicans have panned such witness assertions as speculation.

""These two witnesses, just like the rest, have no personal or direct knowledge regarding why U.S. aid was temporarily withheld,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.

But Holmes offered a first-hand account all the same of how he overheard a July 26 call between Trump and European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland where the president asked Sondland whether Zelensky was going to conduct the investigations he wanted.

Holmes said Sondland, who was in Ukraine for meetings, began the call by telling Trump that Zelensky “loves your ass.”

“I then heard President Trump ask, ‘So, he’s gonna do the investigation?’ Ambassador Sondland replied that ‘he’s gonna do it,’ adding that President Zelensky will do ‘anything you ask him to,’” Holmes said.

Holmes explained how he heard the call.

“While Ambassador Sondland’s phone was not on speakerphone, I could hear the president’s voice through the earpiece of the phone,” Holmes said. “The president’s voice was very loud and recognizable, and Ambassador Sondland held the phone away from his ear for a period of time, presumably because of the loud volume.”

Trump, in real-time, tweeted his skepticism.

""I have been watching people making phone calls my entire life. My hearing is, and has been, great,"" the president tweeted during the hearing. ""Never have I been watching a person making a call, which was not on speakerphone, and been able to hear or understand a conversation. I’ve even tried, but to no avail. Try it live!""

On Thursday, Holmes also detailed how State Department officials were frustrated with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani's involvement in Ukraine policy.

""My recollection is that Ambassador Sondland stated, 'Dammit Rudy. Every time Rudy gets involved he goes and f---s everything up.'”

Hill, too, recalled comments from former National Security Adviser John Bolton describing Giuliani as a ""hand grenade"" and the issues being pursued by Sondland and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney as a ""drug deal"" that he wouldn't be a part of.

Holmes also recalled asking Sondland during that lunch if it was true that Trump did not “give a s--t about Ukraine.”

Describing that conversation, he said, “Ambassador Sondland agreed that the president did not ‘give a s--t about Ukraine.’ I asked why not, and Ambassador Sondland stated that the president only cares about ‘big stuff.’ I noted that there was ‘big stuff’ going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia, and Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant ‘big stuff’ that benefits the president, like the ‘Biden investigation’ that Mr. Giuliani was pushing.”

Hill told House investigators she came to realize Sondland wasn't simply operating outside official diplomatic channels, as she and others suspected, but carrying out instructions from Trump.

""He was being involved in a domestic political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy,"" she testified, ""and those two things had just diverged.""

Holmes also testified that he drafted a cable from Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the importance of the security aid, as it was being held up.

Holmes said he didn’t know the reason for the delay, but “by this point, however, my clear impression was that the security assistance hold was likely intended by the president either as an expression of dissatisfaction that the Ukrainians had not yet agreed to the Burisma/Biden investigation or as an effort to increase the pressure on them to do so.”

Asked about testimony from prior witnesses, Hill took issue with how a prior witness claimed she had reservations about the judgment of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman – another NSC official who testified against Trump this week. Instead, she said she worried that he lacked the political chops to navigate the increasingly heated conflict over the White House's strategy.

""I did not feel that he had the political antennae,” she said.

Opening the hearing on Thursday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said lawmakers in the coming days will “determine what response is appropriate” after the recent testimony.

“It will be up to us to decide, whether those acts are compatible with the office of the presidency,” Schiff said.

Nunes, in his opening remarks, dismissed the accusations, saying, ""So how do we have an impeachable offense here when there’s no actual misdeed and no one even claiming to be a victim?""

Nunes said: ""The Democrats have tried to solve this dilemma with a simple slogan: 'He got caught!' President Trump, we are to believe, was just about to do something wrong, and getting caught was the only reason he backed down from whatever nefarious thought-crime the Democrats are accusing him of almost committing.""

Trump on Thursday railed against the proceedings as a ""phony impeachment hoax."" He denied putting pressure on Ukraine and tweeted, ""I never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word, Impeachment!""

74,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/buttigieg-new-hampshire-poll-lead-iowa-saint-anselm-college,2,"MANCHESTER, N.H. – Three days after a poll in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa showed Pete Buttigieg with a clear advantage over his rival Democrats for the presidential nomination, a new survey in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House also indicates the South Bend, Ind., mayor with a large lead over the other top-tier contenders.

According to a Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll released Tuesday, Buttigieg grabbed the support of 25 percent of likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of neighboring Massachusetts were tied for second – with each at 15 percent.

The survey indicated Sen. Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont – who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – at 9 percent.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota registered at 6 percent in the poll, with billionaire environmental and progressive advocate and grassroots organizer Tom Steyer at 5 percent. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each were at 3 percent and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang was at 2 percent. Everyone else tested in the survey stood at 1 percent or less.

The 37-year old Buttigieg – the youngest candidate in the large field of White House hopefuls – was once seen as the longest of long-shots for the nomination, but he surged in the spring to middle-tier status and he’s soared this autumn to reach the top-tier of contenders. He’s skyrocketed 15 percentage points since the previous Saint Anselm College poll, which was conducted in September.

Warren’s plunged 10 points since the previous poll, with Biden nose-diving 9 points.

“With less than three months before the primary, the race for New Hampshire’s Democratic delegates is still in a great deal of flux,” New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

He’s not kidding. A Quinnipiac University Poll in New Hampshire conducted earlier this month indicated Biden at 20 percent, with Warren at 16 percent, Buttigieg at 15 percent and Sanders at 14 percent. And, a University of New Hampshire-CNN poll conducted late last month showed Sanders at 21 percent, Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Levesque emphasized that in the Saint Anselm poll, “Buttigieg’s bump is driven by the favorable impression he’s made on voters, with 76 percent having a favorable impression of him versus only 11 percent unfavorable.”

Buttigieg’s net favorability of 65 percent easily bested his top rivals for the nomination.

But, the reputation of New Hampshire voters as late deciders was reflected in the survey. Thirteen percent said they remained undecided and of those who were backing a candidate, only 36 percent said they were firm in their choices. If voters do change their minds, Warren may benefit. She topped the list for second choice, at 23 percent.

The poll’s release came with two and a half months until the Iowa caucuses kick off the presidential nominating calendar, followed eight days later by the New Hampshire primary.

A Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released this past Saturday indicated Buttigieg at 25 percent among likely Iowa Democratic presidential caucus-goers, with Warren at 16 percent, and Biden and Sanders at 15 percent. A Monmouth University survey also conducted earlier this month showed Buttigieg with a single-digit advantage over his top rivals in the Hawkeye State.

The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll was conducted November 13-18, with 255 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling of error was plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.

The poll's release came days after former Gov. Deval Patrick, D-Mass., jumped into the presidential nomination race. He stood at less than 1 percent support in the New Hampshire primary.

The poll also indicated over three-quarters of those questioned said they would discourage former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg from launching a bid. Ninety-one percent said they would discourage 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton from running again. But, more than four in ten said they would encourage former first lady Michelle Obama to run."
75,https://www.foxnews.com/media/bloomberg-news-punts-on-candidate-bloomberg-and-dems-but-not-trump,2,"Back when he was New York’s mayor, Mike Bloomberg routinely feuded with the press over his whereabouts.

He doggedly refused to release his weekend schedule, even if he was traveling out of town, favoring his own privacy over the public’s right to know.

Now, as of Sunday, he’s running for president. But one organization that won’t be covering him aggressively is Bloomberg News.

FORGOTTEN? WHY MSNBC’S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE MADE NO NEWS

This is a journalistic giant, churning out 5,000 stories a day, some of them market-moving. Bloomberg News has 2,700 journalists spread across 150 bureaus around the globe, along with a television network, a magazine and those extremely lucrative Wall Street terminals.

But after the 77-year-old billionaire jumped into the Democratic race, the news service’s editor-in-chief, John Micklethwait, issued an edict to his staff.

“We will continue our tradition of not investigating Mike (and his family and foundation),” the memo said. And that prohibition would extend to his rivals in the party because “We cannot treat Mike’s Democratic competitors differently.”

So everyone from Biden to Bernie to Booker to Bloomberg is off-limits for investigation.

But its team “will continue to investigate the Trump administration as the government of the day.”

If you wanted to come up with a policy that would seem to favor Bloomberg and his re-adopted party—he ran for mayor as a Republican—while disadvantaging the man whose job he wants, it would be hard to beat this.

I get that it’s a messy situation, but this is a compromise that satisfies precisely no one.

If Bloomberg’s family (and presumably Joe Biden’s son) are off-limits, are Donald Trump’s kids still fair game?

Bloomberg News has always been squeamish about covering its founder. A similarly restrictive policy was in place during Mayor Bloomberg’s 12-year tenure. But now he’s running for the highest office in the land. What issue doesn’t in some way touch on the presidential campaign?

When the ex-mayor flirted with a 2016 run, Kathy Kiely resigned as Bloomberg News’ political editor because of the same policy.

“I think that when you're running a political operation as we were that you should follow every story aggressively, and I felt that we weren't able to follow this story aggressively,” Kiely told me on “Media Buzz.” “And that I thought compromised us as an organization. I certainly --- I certainly felt it compromised me as an editor.”

Megan Murphy, Bloomberg’s former Washington bureau chief, tweeted that the policy was “ridiculous” and “not journalism.” She said she threatened to resign over a similar memo during that 2016 exploration.

The Micklethwait memo also addresses Bloomberg Opinion. The two top editors, Tim O’Brien (an MSNBC contributor) and David Shipley, are taking leaves to join the Bloomberg campaign. Meanwhile, the rest of the editorial board is being suspended and the section will refuse to publish any outside op-ed on the 2020 campaign. Closed for business.

The company says it will assign a reporter to follow the Bloomberg campaign, writing about speeches, policies and polls. The initial story on the launch said the candidate is “offering his own mix of moderate policy stances and experience in business, government and philanthropy as the way to beat President Donald Trump.”

The editor-in-chief says he doesn’t want to lay down too many rules so they can adapt to changing circumstances, and will reassess the situation if Bloomberg wins the nomination.

This is a dilemma not seen since William Randolph Hearst blatantly used his newspapers to promote his 1904 presidential bid. But Bloomberg’s company dwarfs that early 20th-century enterprise.

Other media companies examine their owners, or corporate parents, with little fuss. The Washington Post reports on Jeff Bezos and Amazon. ABC sometimes has to cover Disney. CNN had to cover Time Warner and now AT&T. It’s a fact of life in the era of corporate media.

Mike Bloomberg, to his everlasting credit, took a $10-million payout from a Wall Street firm to launch an incredibly successful business news operation. Many talented journalists have worked there over the years. It’s a shame that this short-sighted move could taint its reputation for journalistic independence."
76,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-orders-ex-white-house-counsel-mcgahn-to-testify-in-impeachment-probe,2,"Former White House counsel Don McGahn must appear before Congress pursuant to a subpoena issued earlier this year, a Washington, D.C. federal judge ruled late Monday, in a major setback to President Trump's effort to keep aides from testifying before House impeachment investigators.

If McGahn wanted to assert executive privilege to avoid testifying, U.S. District Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson ruled, he would need to appear before Congress and do it himself, likely on a question-by-question basis.

It remained possible, Jackson said, that the ""requested information is itself subject to withholding consistent with the law on the basis of a recognized privilege"" -- but, ""as far as the duty to appear is concerned, this Court holds that Executive branch officials are not absolutely immune from compulsory congressional process.""

A senior Justice Department official told Fox News the department would appeal Judge Jackson's decision and seek a stay pending that appeal. Should a higher court uphold the ruling, it could set a binding precedent affecting future disputes between Congress and the White House involving executive privilege, which generally allows the president and high-level officials to refuse to answer certain questions that might impair deliberative processes or compromise presidential communications and the separation of powers.

The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed McGahn on April 22, but the White House quickly blocked his appearance. Monday's ruling had apparent ramifications for Democrats seeking to compel other top White House officials to testify as part of their ongoing impeachment inquiry concerning the president's Ukraine policy.

The panel has been probing possible obstruction of justice by the president in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""I am pleased the court has recognized that the Trump Administration has no grounds to withhold critical witness testimony from the House during its impeachment inquiry,"" Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement. ""Don McGahn is a central witness to allegations that President Trump obstructed Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation, and the Administration’s claim that officials can claim 'absolute immunity' from Congressional subpoenas has no basis in law, as the court recognized today. Now that the court has ruled, I expect him to follow his legal obligations and promptly appear before the Committee.""

Jackson, a Barack Obama appointee, ruled that the ""venerated constitutional principles that animate the structure of our government and undergird our most vital democratic institutions"" were at stake.

READ THE JUDGE'S ORDER

“When DOJ insists that Presidents can lawfully prevent their senior-level aides from responding to compelled congressional process and that neither the federal courts nor Congress has the power to do anything about it, DOJ promotes a conception of separation-of-powers principles that gets these constitutional commands exactly backwards,"" Jackson wrote. ""In reality, it is a core tenet of this Nation’s founding that the powers of a monarch must be split between the branches of the government to prevent tyranny.

""As far as the duty to appear is concerned, this Court holds that Executive branch officials are not absolutely immune from compulsory congressional process—no matter how many times the Executive branch has asserted as much over the years—even if the President expressly directs such officials’ non-compliance,"" she continued. ""This result is unavoidable as a matter of basic constitutional law, as the Miers court recognized more than a decade ago.""

Jackson concluded: ""Today, this Court adds that this conclusion is inescapable precisely because compulsory appearance by dint of a subpoena is a legal construct, not a political one, and per the Constitution, no one is above the law. That is to say, however busy or essential a presidential aide might be, and whatever their proximity to sensitive domestic and national-security projects, the President does not have the power to excuse him or her from taking an action that the law requires.""

In May, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone penned a letter to Nadler notifying him that McGahn would not comply with the Democrats' subpoena, which sought certain White House records given to McGahn that are related to Mueller's investigation.

LIZ PEEK: DEMS ARE PAYING PRICE FOR IMPEACHMENT, AND NOW THEY'RE LOCKED INTO IT

“The White House provided these records to Mr. McGahn in connection with its cooperation with the Special Counsel’s investigation and with the clear understanding that the records remain subject to the control of the White House for all purposes,” Cipollone wrote. “The White House records remain legally protected from disclosure under longstanding constitutional principles, because they implicate significant Executive Branch confidentiality interests and executive privilege.”

He added: “Because Mr. McGahn does not have the legal right to disclose these documents to third parties, I would ask the Committee to direct any request for such records to the White House, the appropriate legal custodian.”

Monday's ruling comes hours after House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., signaled he would soon hand over a report -- and control over the impeachment probe -- to the House Judiciary Committee. However, Schiff also left open the possibility that more hearings before his panel could be possible.

“Today’s McGahn ruling is a very significant victory for congressional oversight, and for the American people,"" Schiff said late Monday. “With today’s ruling, the courts have made it absolutely clear – first with Harriet Miers and now with Don McGahn – that absolute immunity is not a legitimate basis by which to prohibit senior White House officials from testifying before Congress. To those witnesses who hide behind fallacious claims of absolute immunity, this ruling shows again how meritless their position remains.""

DEM STRATEGIST PLEADS WITH PARTY TO ABANDON IMPEACHMENT

Separately on Monday, the Supreme Court put a temporary hold on a lower court decision ordering accounting firm Mazars to turn over Trump tax return records, for now. The high court said it would entertain a writ for certiorari, essentially a formal appeal to the Supreme Court to hear the case on the merits, from the president by noon on Dec 5. If that writ is denied, the stay will be lifted.

Otherwise, the stay will remain in place until the Supreme Court hears and decides the case.

Light-hearted jabs about the deficit, alleged bias in the press, Romney's wealth and Big Bird showed a different side of the two men at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, organized by the Catholic Archdiocese of New York to benefit needy children. The quip-a-thon came just two days after the presidential contenders squared off in a contentious debate a short drive away at Hofstra University.

[pullquote]

""I've already seen early reports from tonight's dinner,"" said Romney, who earlier in the day learned that the latest Gallup poll showed him surging to a 52-45 lead nationally. ""Headline: Obama embraced by Catholics, Romney dines with rich people.""

""People seem to be very curious about how to prepare -- first refrain from alcohol for 65 years, then get the biggest straw man and mercilessly attack it,"" said Romney, a teetotaling Mormon who said at the first debate that he'd cut funding for public broadcasting. ""Big Bird didn't even see it coming.""

Obama poked fun at himself and the media, referring to his first, lackluster debate performance, which came on his and first lady Michelle Obama's 20th anniversary: ""I particularly want to apologize to Chris Matthews,"" Obama said. ""Four years ago gave him a thrill up his leg, this time I gave him a stroke.

""I learned there are worse things that can happen to you on your anniversary than forgetting to buy a gift,"" he added.

The men will put the gloves back on Monday night, when they have their third and final debate in South Florida. But for one evening, both seemed to enjoy a respite from what has been a bruising campaign. The event was expected to raise $5 million for Catholic charities, and was overseen by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

Romney also took a swipe at Obama's overseeing of the swelling national deficit, saying, ""The president's remarks are brought to you by the letter O and the number 16 trillion.""

Obama took a different kind of spending jab at Romney, whose net worth has been estimated at $250 million: ""Earlier today I went shopping at some stores in Midtown,"" Obama said. ""I understand Governor Romney went shopping for some stores in Midtown.""

As the two men milked the room for laughs, Romney made light of Vice President Joe Biden's performance in his own debate against Paul Ryan, in which Biden was criticized in some quarters for grinning and laughing inappropriately: ""I was hoping Biden would be along, because he'll laugh at anything,"" Romney said, drawing guffaws.

Garbed in a tuxedo, Romney told the audience, ""It's nice to finally relax and wear what Ann and I wear around the house."" Of Obama, Romney said: ""You have to wonder what he's thinking. So little time, so much to redistribute.""

Obama said he has been preparing for the final debate with Romney on Monday, which will focus on foreign policy.

""Spoiler alert: We got bin Laden,"" Obama said."
78,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lisa-page-breaks-silence-saying-trumps-fake-orgasm-forced-her-to-speak-out,2,"“Honestly, his demeaning fake orgasm was really the straw that broke the camel’s back.""

With those striking words in an interview published late Sunday, Lisa Page, the ex-FBI lawyer who carried on an extramarital affair with former FBI head of counterintelligence Peter Strzok as the two exchanged anti-Trump text messages, said she was breaking her silence.

The 39-year-old Page was referring to Trump's comments about her and Strzok at an October rally. During the event, Trump performed a passionate, dramatic reading of Strzok and Page's August 2016 text messages, including Strzok's conspicuous promise to Page that ""we'll stop"" Trump from becoming president. At the time, Strzok was overseeing the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the probe into the Trump campaign.

At one point, Trump screamed out, ""I love you, Lisa! I love you so much! Lisa, she's going to win one-hundred-million-to-nothing. But just in case she doesn't win, we've got an insurance policy!"" (Conservative commentators have disputed that Trump was mimicking an orgasm.)

Page spoke exclusively to The Daily Beast Sunday in a highly sympathetic profile authored by Molly Jong-Fast, who called Strzok ""hawt"" in a tweet last year. In the interview, Page said Trump's remarks had forced her to confront the president publicly.

""I had stayed quiet for years hoping it would fade away, but instead it got worse,” Page said. “It had been so hard not to defend myself, to let people who hate me control the narrative. I decided to take my power back.”

The interview comes just days before a widely anticipated new report from DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz into possible FBI misconduct is expected to be released Dec. 9. Horowitz has reportedly found that an unidentified lower-level FBI lawyer falsified a key document used to obtain a secret surveillance warrant against a former Trump adviser. In a report last year, Horowitz found that the ""damage"" from Strzok and Page's conduct implicated ""the heart of the FBI's reputation for neutral factfinding and political independence"" and ""cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation"" into Clinton.

But, Page claimed she was coming forward now because of Trump's ""fake orgasm,"" not to get ahead of the new upcoming IG report.

“It's like being punched in the gut,"" Page continued. ""My heart drops to my stomach when I realize he has tweeted about me again. The president of the United States is calling me names to the entire world. He’s demeaning me and my career. It’s sickening.”

Separately, Page tweeted, ""I'm done being quiet."" In her interview, Page went on to call the president's remarks ""intimidating.""

“But it's also very intimidating because he’s still the president of the United States,"" Page said. ""And when the president accuses you of treason by name, despite the fact that I know there's no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all, let alone treason, he's still somebody in a position to actually do something about that. To try to further destroy my life. It never goes away or stops, even when he’s not publicly attacking me.”

The president's attacks, Page said, affected her day-to-day life.

STRZOK'S WIFE FOUND EVIDENCE OF HIS AFFAIR WITH LISA PAGE ... AND 'PARANOID' NEW YORK AGENT FOUND STRZOK WAS APPARENTLY SLOW-WALKING WEINER LAPTOP REVIEW, FILING SAYS

“I'm someone who’s always in my head anyway – so now otherwise normal interactions take on a different meaning,"" Page complained. ""Like, when somebody makes eye contact with me on the Metro, I kind of wince, wondering if it’s because they recognize me, or are they just scanning the train like people do? It’s immediately a question of friend or foe? Or if I’m walking down the street or shopping and there’s somebody wearing Trump gear or a MAGA hat, I’ll walk the other way or try to put some distance between us because I’m not looking for conflict. Really, what I wanted most in this world is my life back.”

Page insisted that when she was assigned to the Clinton email probe, she knew the ""case was going to get picked apart"" and that ""Director [James] Comey was very clear he wanted this completed as soon as humanly possible and outside of the political environment. So there was a real focus to get it done before the conventions that were happening that summer. And so that’s what we did.”

However, as the FBI was preparing to interview Clinton at her home at the close of the email probe, Page sent Strzok a text message that suggested she was concerned about the political impact of the investigation.

WATCH REP. GOHMERT UNLOAD ON ‘SMIRKING’ STRZOK: ‘HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU LOOK SO INNOCENT INTO YOUR WIFE’S EYES AND LIE TO HER?’

“One more thing: She might be our next president,” Page wrote to Strzok on Feb. 24, 2016. “The last thing you need us going in there loaded for bear. You think she’s going to remember or care that it was more doj than fbi?”

“Agreed….” Strzok responded.

Horowitz, the DOJ inspector general, noted in an initial report last year that Strzok and Page's anti-Trump texts were ""not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate’s electoral prospects.”

Comey's firing shortly after Trump took office, Page said, was ""totally within the authority of the president,"" but at the same time was ""unprecedented and unimaginable given the circumstances.""

“It was horrible,” Page said. “It was a devastating moment at the FBI. It was like a funeral, only worse, because at least when someone dies, you get to come together and celebrate and talk about that person. He was still alive. But he was inaccessible to us. It jolted the ranks and the investigation. It was so abrupt. He was there one day and gone the next. ... The president fired him with the knowledge that, of course, we were investigating Russian contacts with his campaign. I mean, it just gave the aura of an obstructive effort.”

Page said that when internal DOJ investigators said she was under investigation for anti-Trump text messages, she had no idea what they were talking about -- and maintained, as Strzok has, that she is capable of separating her personal life from work.

“At the end of July in 2017, I am informed by the DOJ Inspector General's office that I’m under investigation for political text messages and honestly, I have no idea what they're talking about,” Page said. “I have no recollection. And initially they’re very coy about it. They don’t tell me much about it. I don't have the first clue what they're talking about. What I do know is that my text messages will reveal that I had previously had an affair. I’m overwhelmed by dread and embarrassment at the prospect that OIG investigators, Andy [McCabe], and my colleagues, now know or could learn about this deeply personal secret.”

Last month, the Department of Justice released documents outlining a slew of ""security violations"" and flagrantly ""unprofessional conduct"" by Peter Strzok — including his alleged practice of keeping sensitive FBI documents on his unsecured personal electronic devices, even as his wife gained access to his cellphone and discovered evidence that he was having an affair with Page.

Although Strzok claimed to have ""double deleted"" sensitive FBI materials from his personal devices, his wife nonetheless apparently found evidence of his affair on his cellphone — including photographs and a hotel reservation ""ostensibly"" used for a ""romantic encounter."" Strzok didn't consent to turning over the devices for review, according to the DOJ, even as he acknowledged using Apple's iMessage service for some FBI work.

FBI BLAMES SYSTEM-WIDE SOFTWARE FAILURE FOR MISSING STRZOK TEXTS -- PHONE FROM MUELLER DAYS TOTALLY WIPED

""[My wife] has my phone. Read an angry note I wrote but didn't send you. That is her calling from my phone. She says she wants to talk to [you]. Said we were close friends nothing more,"" one of Strzok's text to Page read, according to the filing.

""Your wife left me a vm [voicemail]. Am I supposed to respond? She thinks we're having an affair. Should I call and correct her understanding? Leave this to you to address?"" Page responded. Strzok's wife allegedly threatened to send Page's husband some of the photographs from Strzok's phone.

Strzok then wrote, ""I don't know. I said we were [] close friends and nothing more. She knows I sent you flowers, I said you were having a tough week."""
79,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-hears-gun-control-case-that-inspired-threat-from-dems,2,"The Supreme Court took up its first major gun control case in nearly a decade on Monday, hearing arguments in a dispute between a gun advocacy group and New York over a statute that restricted the transportation of firearms outside city limits -- even when licensed, locked and unloaded.

The city's statute was later amended but the court heard arguments over the original measure anyway, in a case that could have ramifications for local gun laws. The fact the high court even considered the case -- New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. City of New York -- prompted a stunning complaint earlier this year from Democratic senators, who filed a brief essentially threatening to pack the court absent changes.

SENATE DEMS DELIVER STUNNING WARNING TO SUPREME COURT: 'HEAL' OR FACE RESTRUCTURING

The warning underscored what could be at stake in Monday's case.

The Supreme Court has not issued a significant gun rights decision since 2008’s District of Columbia v. Heller. Since then the court applied Heller – which recognized the right to possess a firearm for purposes such as home protection – to states via the 14th Amendment in 2010’s McDonald v. City of Chicago. A 2016 ruling in Caetano v. Massachusetts, which dealt with a state ban on stun guns, did not focus on traditional firearms but acknowledged that the Second Amendment extends to other weapons as well.

It's unclear whether the case before the court on Monday could join the list of landmark Second Amendment cases.

The law in question said city residents could apply for a ""premises"" license to keep a firearm in their home, but they had to keep the weapons at home. Licensees were permitted to take their guns to one of the seven authorized city shooting ranges if kept in a locked container. The New York State Rifle & Pistol Association fought the law, claiming it was unconstitutional to keep people from bringing their weapons to second homes or ranges outside of the city.

While the court agreed to hear the case, New York City amended the regulation following a change in state law, removing prohibitions against transporting locked, unloaded, licensed firearms to homes, shooting ranges, or competitions outside the city. The city and its supporters claimed that the change ultimately makes the case moot.

Liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor appeared to agree.

""The Petitioners have gotten the relief that they sought,"" Ginsburg noted during Monday's arguments. Sotomayor told plaintiff's attorney Paul Clement that this was ""a case in which the other side has thrown in the towel and completely [given] you every single thing you demanded in your complaint for relief...""

Clement argued this was not the case, and that the new law is still unclear because while it permits ""continuous and uninterrupted"" transportation of firearms on their way out of New York City, it does not address what would happen if a gun owner, for instance, takes a coffee or bathroom break along the way.

Sotomayor noted this is an issue with the new law, not the old one at the center of this case. The new law has yet to be reviewed by lower courts. Justice Stephen Breyer also said he believes that people who stop for coffee while transporting guns would not be prosecuted.

Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, however, pointed out that stopping for coffee while transporting a gun would still have been a problem under the old law, so this issue should be relevant in the current case. The attorney for the city, meanwhile, argued that such breaks ""are entirely permissible,"" as the ""continuous and uninterrupted"" language is absent from the state's law, which is controlling.

Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, however, argued that the plaintiffs could be awarded damages for economic harm suffered while the old restrictions were in place. Ginsburg noted that this could have been a lifeline for the plaintiffs' case, except they never requested damages.

""They've had every opportunity to say that they want damages, including today,"" Kagan pointed out, ""and for whatever reason, Mr. Clement has, you know, basically said this case is not about damages.""

DEM SENATOR HIT WITH BAR COMPLAINT FOR 'OPENLY THREATENING' SUPREME COURT

What the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association really wants is for the court to issue a ruling on the constitutionality of the old law, which could impact future legislation.

Clement claimed that a ruling was necessary to send a message regarding the unconstitutionality of limiting the transportation of firearms, which could prevent future prohibitions from going forward.

It was to the backdrop of this case that Democratic senators issued their warning earlier this year.

""The Supreme Court is not well. And the people know it,"" said the brief, filed in August by Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. ""Perhaps the Court can heal itself before the public demands it be 'restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.'""

That brief drew criticism from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and others.

“When you hear Democrats talking about expanding the Supreme Court….....they are talking about making the Court more liberal,” Graham tweeted at the time.

Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe, a well-known liberal voice and fierce critic of the Trump administration, also came out against the Democrats on this issue, calling their brief “inappropriately --- and stupidly --- threatening.”"

""There's nowhere I'd rather spend Thanksgiving than with the toughest, fiercest warriors,"" Trump told troops on the ground. ""I'm here to say Happy Thanksgiving and thank you very much. As president of the United States, I have no higher honor than serving as commander in chief.""

TRUMP SAYS PEACE TALKS WITH TALIBAN HAVE RESUMED DURING SURPRISE VISIT TO AFGHANISTAN

But in order to make the visit, intense security and a host of other measures were required to ensure the news didn’t leak. The journey began Wednesday, where Trump snuck out of Mar-a-Lago.

Many of the details of how he did so are a secret, but the president flew out of an undisclosed airport in Florida on a small, also undisclosed, plane Wednesday evening.

On that flight bound for Joint Base Andrews, in Maryland, there was only one Fox News journalist, who was serving as the pool reporter. The plane was bare-bones, except for four blue leather chairs and a port-a-potty that had been brought for the occasion.

As part of the security measures phones were taken from all onboard, including senior White House officials. Trump greeted the crew but remained in the cockpit for takeoff.

When the plane landed in Joint Base Andrews later Wednesday evening, Trump switched to Air Force One — which was not lit up on the tarmac, but was instead hidden in a hangar. It took off from JBA with all interior lights off and the windows drawn.

The plane landed in Afghanistan on a pitch-black runway, while the pool was only allowed to take pictures of Trump’s arrival from a nearby van. Accompanying Trump was White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien, Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere, and Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Grisham said that only a tight circle of White House officials knew about the trip, and the White House even scheduled tweets to be sent out from the president’s account during the Internet blackout that he faced.

“It’s a dangerous area and he (the President) wants to support the troops,” Grisham said. “He and Mrs. Trump recognize that there is a lot of people who are away from their families during the holidays and we thought it would be a nice surprise.”

It certainly was a surprise to the troops, the public and the media -- catching some outlets completely flat-footed. Newsweek had to overhaul an article that it had earlier posted that reported the president would spend the day tweeting and playing golf.

TRUMP SAYS TALKS WITH TALIBAN ARE ‘DEAD,’ AFTER CANCELING SECRET CAMP DAVID SUMMIT

After serving and eventually sitting down for a Thanksgiving dinner -- that included turkey, mashed potatoes, cornbread, baked ham, mac and cheese, cornish hen and candied yams -- Trump took as many pictures as time would allow with troops.

He then met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. Due to security concerns, the White House notified Ghani only “a few hours ago,” according to the White House.

Trump then finished his trip by addressing a few hundred cheering troops in the hangar on the airfield, bringing Ghani on the stage to also express his appreciation to the American troops. Trump told them that everyone was working hard to bring them back home.

“We will continue to work tirelessly for the day when all of you can go home to your families … and that day is coming very soon,” he said.

81,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-to-unveil-articles-of-impeachment-focused-on-abuse-of-power-obstruction-of-congress,2,"House Democrats on Tuesday introduced two articles of impeachment against President Trump alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress regarding his interactions with Ukraine, touching off a rapid-fire sequence that could result in a momentous floor vote in a matter of days.

“The framers of the Constitution prescribed a clear remedy for presidents who so violate their oath of office,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y. ""No one, not even the president, is above the law.”

His office later posted text of the articles, which declare Trump's actions warrant impeachment, trial and removal from office.

IMPEACHMENT TENSIONS FLARE: DEM COUNSEL SAYS TRUMP ABUSED POWER, AS GOP RIPS 'RUBBER STAMP' HEARING

The White House swiftly hit back, accusing Democrats of using the Ukraine issue as an excuse for ""this partisan, gratuitous, and pathetic attempt to overthrow the Trump Administration and the results of the 2016 election.""

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., also countered at a GOP press conference that Trump's actions are ""absolutely"" not impeachable.

""Other countries admire us because we believe in the rule of law, we believe in due process. But not in Nancy Pelosi's House when she became speaker,"" he said.

The key Democratic committee leaders, along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., outlined their impeachment plans in a brief and pointed statement to the media early Tuesday morning, and left without taking questions.

Nadler previewed two articles ""charging the president with high crimes and misdemeanors."" He said the first is dedicated to ""abuse of power,"" alleging the president has ""exercised the powers of his office for his personal benefit while ignoring or injuring the public interest."" Nadler said Trump put himself before country while endangering national security and America's democracy.

""Trump has engaged in unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance of the impeachment inquiry,"" Nadler added, as he announced the second article focused on obstruction of Congress.

The article text posted by his office reflected these statements, while alleging in stark terms that Trump ""has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law.""

READ THE IMPEACHMENT ARTICLE TEXT

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has led much of the inquiry, called impeachment ""an extraordinary remedy.""

""He has given us no choice,"" Schiff said of Trump. ""To do nothing would make ourselves complicit in the president's abuse of his high office.""

Trump fired back minutes later, blasting the entire inquiry as a ""WITCH HUNT!"" -- the same term he used for the Russia investigation.

""Nadler just said that I 'pressured Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 Election.' Ridiculous, and he knows that is not true. Both the President & Foreign Minister of Ukraine said, many times, that there 'WAS NO PRESSURE.' Nadler and the Dems know this, but refuse to acknowledge!"" Trump tweeted.

White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham slammed the announcement as part of Democrats' bid to ""overturn the votes"" of 63 million Americans who supported Trump in 2016.

""Today, in a baseless and partisan attempt to undermine a sitting President, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats announced the pre-determined outcome of their sham impeachment – something they have been seeking since before President Trump was inaugurated,"" she said in a statement.

While Republicans have blasted the process as partisan, dubbing it the ""focus group impeachment"" in response to reports that Democrats tested different allegations with focus groups, Democrats are moving swiftly ahead of the holiday break.

Pelosi directed the Judiciary Committee to proceed with drafting the measures just last week.

""The clock and the calendar should not be the basis for impeachment,"" House Judiciary Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., told Fox News' ""America's Newsroom"" minutes before the announcement.

It is unclear, at this point, whether Democrats’ articles focused on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress could be modified to reach beyond the Ukraine controversy and into former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The lawmakers did not mention such a step on Tuesday morning save for a Russia reference from Nadler, despite pressure from some Democrats to link the two.

""The integrity of our next election is at risk from our president who already sought foreign interference in the 2016 and now 2020 elections,"" Nadler said.

GOP LAWYER TURNS IMPEACHMENT TABLES BY SCORCHING BIDENS AT HEARING

Mueller found no evidence of conspiracy or coordination between members of the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election but left the door open to whether the president obstructed the federal probe -- a point that Democrats have made in the public hearing phase of the House impeachment inquiry.

Absent from the planned charges is a “bribery” count, which Democrats have repeatedly accused the president of in regards to his highly controversial July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- in which he pressured him to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter’s dealings with Ukraine.

Pelosi held a meeting in her office Monday night with the chairs of the key committees involved in the inquiry after a hearing held by Nadler’s panel that featured lawyers laying out the evidence for and against impeachment.

In drafting the articles of impeachment, Pelosi is facing a legal and political challenge of balancing the views of her majority while hitting the Constitution's high bar of ""treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.""

At the center of the impeachment inquiry is Trump’s efforts to press Zelensky to launch politically related investigations—regarding Joe Biden's effort to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been looking into the natural gas firm where his son Hunter served on the board.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats have argued shows a “quid pro quo” arrangement. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

The impeachment articles unveiled Tuesday accuse Trump of ""soliciting the interference of a foreign government"" and doing so for ""corrupt purposes,"" explicitly accusing him of conditioning two official acts -- releasing the foreign aid and holding a White House meeting with Zelensky -- on the announcement of an investigation. The aid was eventually released without such an announcement from Ukraine's president."
82,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-judiciary-committee-impeachment-vote-sparring,2,"Gobsmacked Republicans made known their fury and frustration late Thursday as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., abruptly wrapped up an all-day marathon hearing on the adoption of two articles of impeachment against President Trump by delaying planned votes on the matter until Friday morning.

""It is now very late at night,"" Nadler said shortly before midnight in D.C. ""I want the members on both sides of the aisle to think about what has happened over these last two days, and to search their consciences before we cast their final votes. Therefore, the committee will now stand in recess until tomorrow morning at 10 a.m., at which point I will move to divide the question so that each of us may have the opportunity to cast up-or-down votes on each of the articles of impeachment, and let history be our judge.""

Ranking Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., raised an immediate objection as Nadler began leaving, saying it was ""the most bush-league stunt” he had ever seen.

""Mr. Chairman, there was no consulting with the ranking member on your schedule for tomorrow -- you just blew up schedules for everyone?"" Collins asked incredulously. ""You chose not to consult the ranking member on a scheduling issue of this magnitude? This is the kangaroo court we're talking about. Not even consult? Not even consult? 10 a.m. tomorrow?""

He later told reporters: “This is why people don't like us. This crap like this is why people are having such a terrible opinion of Congress. What Chairman Nadler just did, and his staff, and the rest of the majority who sat there quietly and said nothing, this is why they don't like us. They know it's all about games. It's all about the TV screens. They want the primetime hit. This is Speaker Pelosi and Adam Schiff and the others directing this committee. I don't have a chairman anymore. I guess I need to just go straight to Ms. Pelosi and say, what TV hit does this committee need to do? This committee has lost all relevance. I'll see y'all tomorrow.""

Texas GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert called out the tactic as ""Stalinesque,"" and other Republicans essentially heckled Nadler's conduct as unbelievable and ""outrageous."" Gohmert also openly suggested that Democrats wanted to have the vote when more people would be watching on television, and that they wanted to be able to say they had a ""three-day trial"" in the Judiciary Committee, even if they called no fact witnesses to appear before the panel.

“The claim that Republicans promised Judiciary Democrats that Thursday’s markup would end by 5:00 p.m. is false,"" Jessica Andrews, a spokeswoman for the House Judiciary Committee Republicans, told Fox News. ""Republicans were prepared to offer an arsenal of appropriate amendments to address the clear deficiencies in the articles of impeachment and were told that the committee would be voting on articles Thursday evening. Judiciary Democrats broke their promise as the cameras and lights were fading. They chose, instead, to reconvene when ratings would be higher and the integrity of our committee would be at a historic low.”

There is no more time remaining for actual debate on the articles of impeachment under the 41-member Judiciary Committee's rules. On Friday morning, Fox News expects the panel to vote to adopt each article of impeachment on a party-line vote after a hearing that could last between 45 minutes to around 2 hours.

Then, the articles will likely head to the Rules Committee, which controls access to the House floor and sets the parameters of debate there, before the full House votes on whether to impeach the president. That final vote is expected next Wednesday or Thursday. Should the House impeach the president next week, the matter would go to the GOP-controlled Senate for a trial and virtually certain acquittal.

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: MCCONNELL SAYS 'ZERO' CHANCE TRUMP IS CONVICTED AND REMOVED BY GOP-CONTROLLED SENATE

The last-minute confrontation on Thursday night was one final striking moment in long day full of them, where seemingly nothing was off-limits -- from Hunter Biden's rampant drug use to a Republican congressman's past drunken-driving arrest. (The evening was not always riveting, however: A Democratic congressman was caught watching golf on his laptop as the proceedings dragged on.)

At one point, Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., claimed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky looked ""as if his daughter was downstairs in the basement, duct-taped"" when he publicly undermined Democrats' case by declaring at the United Nations that he felt no undue pressure from the president to conduct any political investigations.

""The picture of President Trump and President Zelensky meeting in New York in September at the UN -- big chair for President Trump, little chair for President Zelensky. Big, 6-foot-4 President Trump, five-foot-eleven President Zelensky. ... There's an imbalance of power in that relationship,"" Johnson said, as some attendees laughed. Republicans, including Donald Trump Jr., responded by mocking Johnson online for once suggesting that the island of Guam could capsize due to overpopulation, and for deriding Trump supporters in highly personal terms.

""JUST IN: Democrats want to impeach the President for [checks notes] being too tall,"" the White House tweeted, as the hearing, which began at 9 a.m. ET, extended all the way into the late-night hours.

There was even some intrigue during breaks in the proceedings when a Reuters photographer, Josh Roberts, was caught on camera approaching the dais and furtively taking photographs of private documents that Louisiana GOP Rep. Mike Johnson said belonged to Republicans. Roberts was later escorted out of the Capitol building, and Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz announced at the hearing that Roberts had in fact photographed Democrats' desks. Reuters posted wire photos apparently showing the desk of Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., who was not in attendance at the hearing.

""Media spy games,"" House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., tweeted.

Democrats, for their part, accused Republicans of plotting procedural tricks. As the clock approached midnight, New York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries complained that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had vowed in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity earlier on Thursday night that he would coordinate any Senate trial with the White House.

""There will be no difference between the President's position and our position in how to handle this,"" McConnell said.

In the meantime, though, all eyes were on the 31 moderate House Democrats from districts Trump won in 2016, most of whom have remained mum on how they'll vote, as support for impeachment has flatlined in several battleground-state polls. The House is comprised of 431 members, meaning Democrats would need 217 yeas to impeach Trump. There currently have been 233 Democrats, so they could lose only 16 of their own and still impeach the president.

During the day's markup, as members debated the language of the impeachment resolutions, Republicans repeatedly pointed out that Trump was not accused of any offense actually defined anywhere by law: neither ""abuse of power"" nor ""obstruction of Congress"" was a recognized federal or state crime.

Early in the hearing, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., supported Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan's amendment to strike Democrats' ""abuse of power"" article of impeachment entirely, arguing, ""There was no impeachable offense here.""

But, Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., responded that impeachment articles did not necessarily have to include statutory crimes -- and that Trump’s actions would satisfy criminal statutes such as bribery anyway.

This led Gohmert, R-Texas, to retort, ""Well then, why aren't they in this impeachment document?""

'COUP HAS STARTED,' UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER'S LAWYER WROTE IN 2017, VOWING TO IMPEACH TRUMP

Democrats had floated the idea of formally accusing Trump of bribery, after focus groups suggested voters would like that term more. But, the idea fell out of favor after news of the focus group leaked, and analysts pointed out that Trump's conduct didn't seem to constitute bribery.

Later in the day, Gohmert observed that the Trump administration ultimately provided lethal aid to Ukraine, unlike former President Barack Obama, who also withheld military aid to Ukraine and ""just let people die over there"" by providing only nonlethal assistance.

Gohmert went on to object to the ""obstruction of Congress"" article of impeachment as ""tyrannical,"" saying it violated separation-of-powers principles for Congress to impeach the president whenever he failed to cooperate fully with their investigations.

Under Obama, the White House repeatedly refused Republicans' document requests concerning the ""Fast and Furious"" gunrunning scandal, leading Congress to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt. No impeachment proceedings were commenced.

Democrats countered that it simply was not ""credible"" that Trump was withholding aid to Ukraine for legitimate anticorruption evidence, even though he also withheld $100 million in assistance to Lebanon this year.

""The president has been talking about foreign corruption and the misuse of American taxpayers' [funds]"" since before the 2016 election, Johnson, R-La., said, emphasizing that it was in-character for the president to rein in excess spending for NATO and elsewhere.

""Everybody knows the president s concerned about the misuse of taxpayer dollars overseas. It's one of his primary driving forces. It's one of his main talking points... Oh, Ukraine, the third-most corrupt nation in the world, is the only one he wasn't concerned about? It just doesn't make sense. Let's stop with the games.""

At a particularly heated moment in the hearing, Gaetz, R-Fla., brought up Hunter Biden's admitted past substance abuse issues -- and Johnson, D-Ga., shot back by alluding to Gaetz's own past arrest for drunken driving.

Gaetz was arguing that Biden was incompetent and corrupt, citing his lucrative job on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings while his father was overseeing Ukraine policy as vice president. The impeachment inquiry began after Trump suggested the Ukrainians look into Joe Biden's successful effort to pressure Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor by withholding $1 billion in critical U.S. aid -- at a time when Burisma was under criminal scrutiny.

The Florida lawmaker referenced an article in The New Yorker, which included interviews with Hunter Biden and reported on a 2016 car crash in which the younger Biden was involved. According to that story, employees at a rental car agency claimed they found a crack pipe inside the vehicle. It also quoted Hunter Biden describing his attempts to buy crack cocaine in a Los Angeles homeless encampment.

IMPEACHMENT NEEDLE NOT MOVING, MAJORITY OF VOTERS OPPOSE IMPEACHMENT

""The pot calling the kettle black is not something we should do,"" Johnson said. ""I don’t know what members, if any, have had any problems with substance abuse, been busted in DUI. I don't know, but if I did, I wouldn't raise it against anyone on this committee."" Johnson added: ""I don't think it’s proper.""

Separately, Gaetz introduced a December 2017 article in The New York Times discussing Nadler's contemplation about impeaching the president years ago. Democrats, Gaetz and other Republicans said, have been trying to impeach and remove the president ever since he stunned the world by defeating Hillary Clinton, first by peddling discredited allegations that his campaign criminally conspired with Russians.

Impeachment, Republicans argued, was politically motivated theater, long in the works and foreshadowed openly by Democrats for months, if not years.

The two-day markup began late Wednesday and saw Republicans lambasting Democrats and the media for pushing discredited claims about the Trump campaign's Russia ties. The rapid pace of the markup and vote came as numerous polls showed declining support for impeachment in key swing states.

For example, impeachment and removal was opposed by 50.8 percent of voters in Michigan, 52.2 percent of voters in Pennsylvania, and 57.9 percent of voters in Wisconsin, according to the Firehouse/Optimus December Battleground State Poll.

Two other polls released Wednesday showed that most Americans did not want Trump impeached and removed.

Politico reported earlier this week that the numbers were making a ""small group"" of moderate Democrats, who have held seats in districts where Trump won in 2016, nervous about how to vote. They instead have suggested Trump be censured instead, which would prevent the GOP from holding a potentially damaging Senate trial and give them political cover in the upcoming election.

EX-FBI LAWYER LISA PAGE SUES DOJ FOR COST OF 'THERAPY' AFTER TRUMP MOCKS HER ANTI-TRUMP TEXTS, EXTRA-MARITAL AFFAIR WITH ANTI-TRUMP OFFICIAL LEADING CLINTON, TRUMP PROBES

As the members debated Wednesday night, the White House Office of Management and Budget released a lengthy legal justification for the withholding of aid to Ukraine, which was obtained by Fox News. OMB classified the temporary pause in providing the aid to Ukraine as a ""programmatic delay"" that was necessary and proper under the law to ""ensure that funds were not obligated prematurely in a manner that could conflict with the President's foreign policy.""

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., accused OMB of an ""after-the-fact coverup"" by writing its justification -- prompting Collins to respond, stunned, by noting that a Senate Democrat had requested the letter.

""It is amazing that this is an after-the fact coverup since it was asked by a Democratic senator,"" Collins said. ""So, that's an after-the-fact coverup? ... This is exactly what I thought would happen when we came back from lunch.""

Collins went on to point out that Zelensky repeatedly has said that he did not feel that Trump pressured him in any way, and that Democrats have taken to ""belittling"" Zelensky by calling him an ""actor"" and ""weak"" only because he undermined their case.

Jayapal also lamented that Trump hadn't followed official ""talking points"" provided by career bureaucrats while on his July phone call with Zelensky, prompting Republicans to respond that the president, as an elected official, is ultimately in charge of foreign policy.

When Democrats repeatedly argued that Trump's suspension of foreign aid had cost Ukrainian lives, Collins angrily responded that, even according to the same media reports cited by Democrats, no causal link had been shown between any Ukrainian casualties and the temporary aid hold up.

""People died!"" Swalwell said late in the evening, charging that Collins wanted to ignore reality.

Collins called the arguments a ""cheap shot"" and ""hogwash,"" reiterating that the Democrats' claims were entirely speculative, and that they were falsely claiming he'd said no one in Ukraine died.

""That is the most amazing, amazing, lack of honesty and integrity that I have ever seen,"" Collins said emphatically. ""In wars, people die. Is that difficult to understand? It's not hard to understand. And, to say that. ... Besmirching the folks who died, that's just amazing to me, even for this majority. To sit there and keep repeating the lie, after lie, after lie. ... People died when there was money we released earlier. Are we going to claim that was because we didn't give them enough money? I don't know. I get it. Y'all have an agenda to push, and the clock is ticking.""

Hardline Democrats in safe districts haven't budged on impeachment. California Rep. Karen Bass, for example, said earlier this week she's open to impeaching Trump again even if he were to win the 2020 election.

""This is the other side of it being political -- you’ve got about 30 House Democrats who are in districts won by Donald Trump and they realize that they are going to pay a political price if they go along with impeachment,"" Fox News contributor Charles Hurt, the opinion editor of The Washington Times, told ""Fox & Friends"" Wednesday.

Freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich. -- who flipped a GOP district in 2018 that Trump won by 7 points in 2016 -- told Fox News last month that she was tentatively weighing all the evidence. On Wednesday, she confirmed she's still undecided.

""The phones are ringing off the hook,"" she told CNN. ""We literally can't pick up the phones fast enough -- and it's people on both sides of it.""

In the meantime, Gaetz offered some advice to swing-district Democrats who vote to impeach the president: ""For the upcoming year, rent, don't buy, here in Washington, D.C.""

83,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-responds-to-impeachment-deadline-i,2,"The White House said Friday it will not participate in House Judiciary Committee impeachment proceedings, blasting the inquiry as ""completely baseless"" in a curt response to Democrats ahead of Monday's scheduled hearing.

“House Democrats have wasted enough of America’s time with this charade,"" White House counsel Pat Cipollone said in a scathing one-page letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., obtained by Fox News. ""You should end this inquiry now and not waste even more time with additional hearings.""

PELOSI CALLS FOR ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST TRUMP: 'NO CHOICE BUT TO ACT'

Friday was the deadline for Trump to respond to Nadler's request for participation in committee proceedings.

But instead of giving House Democrats a direct ""no"" answer, Cipollone penned a two-paragraph letter derailing the entire process.

""As you know, your impeachment inquiry is completely baseless and has violated basic principles of due process and fundamental fairness,"" he wrote. ""Nevertheless, the Speaker of the House yesterday ordered House Democrats to proceed with articles of impeachment before your Committee has heard a single shred of evidence.”

A senior administration official, though, made it clear they won't be participating, telling Fox News: ""We don’t see any reason to participate because the process is unfair. Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi has already announced the predetermined result. They will not give us the ability to call any witnesses.”

Nadler is set to continue hearings in the committee on Monday.

The decision by the administration likely accelerates the pace of impeachment.

In 1998, the Clinton Administration took 30 hours to present its side of things to the Judiciary Committee. That means there may not be another hearing after Monday’s session.

Trump telegraphed Thursday he wanted to sidestep the House impeachment process and move quickly to the Senate where he believes he'll be acquitted by the GOP-led upper chamber.

“Therefore I say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate and so that our Country can get back to business,” Trump tweeted.

Cipollone repeated Trump's comments in the letter and said the House Democrats would be making a historically unjust mistake by plowing forward.

""Adopting articles of impeachment would be a reckless abuse of power by House Democrats, and would constitute the most unjust, highly partisan and unconstitutional attempt at impeachment in our Nation’s history,"" he said.

Trump and his allies in Congress have dismissed the impeachment as a “sham” partisan exercise aimed at undoing the results of the 2016 presidential election. Trump says his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “perfect” when he asked the newly elected foreign leader to investigate the Bidens and the Democratic National Committee server.

Pelosi, however, said the facts of Trump’s wrongdoing involving Ukraine are “uncontested” and announced Thursday Democrats are moving forward with drafting articles of impeachment against Trump.

“The president abused his power for his own personal political benefit at the expense of our national security,” Pelosi said.

WHITE HOUSE, IN FIERY LETTER, DECLARES TRUMP WON’T PARTICIPATE IN HOUSE JUDICIARY IMPEACHMENT HEARING

Trump declined to have his lawyers participate in the House Judiciary Committee’s first impeachment hearing Wednesday when four legal scholars debated whether Trump’s conduct was impeachable.

Cipollone blasted the “baseless and highly partisan inquiry” in a letter Sunday declining to attend. The White House also accused the Judiciary Committee of “purposely” scheduling its first impeachment hearing when Trump would be meeting with NATO leaders in London and couldn’t attend.

At Wednesday’s hearing, the three lawyers the Democrats invited made the case that Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine for personal political purposes and his stonewalling of Congress are impeachable. The lone GOP witness, George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley, said Trump’s call was “anything but perfect” but said Democrats haven’t made the case.

“One can oppose President Trump’s policies or actions but still conclude that the current legal case for impeachment is not just woefully inadequate, but in some respects, dangerous, as the basis for the impeachment of an American president,” Turley said.

Nadler, D-NY, had set a deadline of 5 p.m Friday in a letter he penned to the president a week ago.

“I am writing to determine if your counsel will seek to exercise the specific privileges set forth in the Judiciary Committee’s Impeachment Procedures … and participate in the upcoming impeachment proceedings,” Nadler wrote in the Nov. 29 letter.

84,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kentucky-matt-bevin-pardoned-hundreds,2,"Former Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin pardoned 428 people -- including some violent offenders -- between Election Day last month and the end of his term Tuesday, the state Secretary of State's Office said this week, prompting calls for an investigation by state officials.

Those pardoned by Bevin included a man convicted of reckless homicide, a convicted child rapist, a man who murdered his parents at age 16, and a woman who threw her newborn in the trash after giving birth in a flea market outhouse. Bevin wrote that the woman, Kathy Harless, had “paid enough for the death of her newborn son.” Another pardon recipient, Dayton Jones, who was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy at a party. The incident was captured on video and shared to social media; the boy suffered internal injuries as a result of the attack.

In yet another case, Bevin pardoned Patrick Brian Baker, who was convicted of homicide and other crimes in a fatal 2014 home break-in. The Louisville Courier-Journal reported this week that Baker's family raised $21,500 for Bevin at a political fundraiser and Baker's brother and sister-in-law also gave $4,000 to Bevin’s campaign on the day of the fundraiser.

KENTUCKY REPUBLICAN GOV. MATT BEVIN CONCEDES TO DEM ANDY BESHEAR IN REELECTION BID

Senate President Robert Stivers, a Republican, condemned Bevin's actions as “a travesty and perversion of justice” and called on the U.S. attorney in Kentucky to investigate. Democratic lawmakers called on Attorney General-elect Daniel Cameron to appoint a special prosecutor or a bipartisan team to investigate some of the ex-governor's pardons. Cameron, a Republican, takes office next week.

The pardons also drew a rebuke from Kentucky's most powerful Republican, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

“Honestly, I don’t approve,” McConnell told reporters Friday at the Kentucky Capitol. “It seems to me it was completely inappropriate.”

Commonwealth’s Attorney Jackie Steele -- also a Republican -- said it would be an “understatement to say I am aggrieved” by the pardons. He noted that in the Baker case, Bevin did not pardon Baker’s co-conspirators in the robbery and homicide. Steele said he believes Baker was pardoned because of the money his family had donated to Bevin.

Judge David Williams, who sentenced Baker in 2017, told the Courier-Journal that, in his 30 years of practice, “I’ve never seen a more compelling or complete case... The evidence was just overwhelming.”

KENTUCKY'S BESHEAR RESTORES VOTING RIGHTS TO OVER 100,000 CONVICTED FELONS DAYS AFTER INAUGURATION

Bevin responded to the uproar in a series of tweets Friday evening, saying he reviewed hundreds of pages of court transcripts and thousands of letters.

“The myriad statements and suggestions that financial or political considerations played a part in the decision-making process are both highly offensive and entirely false,” he wrote on Twitter, adding that ""armchair critics” are not aware of ""facts, evidence, lack of evidence, supporting documents, reasons and unique details"" of the cases.

Bevin also claimed that ""not a single person was released who had not already been scheduled for a specific release date or who was sentenced with the eligibility to be considered for early release.""

""The vast majority of those who were pardoned, have actually been out of prison for years and have fully paid their debt to society,"" Bevin added.

Lawyer Eddy Montgomery said the pardoned criminals' victims received no warning of their release, and he rushed to inform families before they were blindsided.

Montgomery said he was particularly shocked to see Brett Whitaker pardoned -- Whitaker was convicted of two counts of murder after killing a pastor and his wife while driving under the influence in 2011.

Another pardon was granted to Micah Schoettle, who was convicted last spring of raping a 9-year-old child and sentenced to 23 years in prison. Bevin wrote that Schoettle had been convicted of the crime “based only on testimony that was not supported by any physical evidence.”

The governor has full jurisdiction over pardons under Kentucky’s constitution, except in cases of treason against the state.

The House – as it prepares to vote on articles of impeachment against President Trump – approved all 12 spending bills. They now go to the Senate to sync up later this week.

TRUMP TELLS PELOSI IN BLISTERING LETTER THAT DEMS HAVE 'CHEAPENED THE IMPORTANCE' OF IMPEACHMENT

“I am proud that we were able to come together, negotiate our differences, and reach a bipartisan agreement that makes investments to strengthen our nation and give every American a better chance at a better life,” said New York Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey, the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee.

The deadline to fund the government is Dec 20. These bills would fund the government for the rest of fiscal 2020, through Sept 30.

The hard-fought legislation also funds a record Pentagon budget and is serving as a must-pass legislative locomotive to tow an unusually large haul of unrelated provisions into law, including an expensive repeal of Obama-era taxes on high-cost health plans, help for retired coal miners, and an increase from 18 to 21 for the nationwide legal age to buy tobacco products.

The White House said Tuesday that Trump will sign the measure.

""The president is poised to sign it and to keep the government open,"" said top White House adviser Kellyanne Conway.

The roster of add-ons grew over the weekend to include permanent repeal of a tax on high-cost ""Cadillac"" health insurance benefits and a hard-won provision to finance health care and pension benefits for about 100,000 retired union coal miners threatened by the insolvency of their pension fund. A tax on medical devices and health insurance plans would also be repealed permanently.

The deficit tab for the package grew as well with the addition of $428 billion in tax cuts over 10 years to repeal the three so-called ObamaCare taxes.

The legislation is laced with provisions reflecting divided power in Washington. Republicans maintained the status quo on several abortion-related battles and on funding for Trump's border wall. Democrats controlling the House succeeded in winning a 3.1 percent raise for federal civilian employees and the first installment of funding on gun violence research after more than two decades of gun lobby opposition.

Meanwhile on Tuesday, the Democrat-led House Rules Committee on Tuesday dove into a marathon session to prepare the ground rules for what is likely to be a furious showdown vote on the House floor to adopt articles of impeachment against Trump.

The panel’s meeting lays the procedural groundwork for the House debate on Wednesday, outlining the timetable and other factors for the historic and divisive moment in Washington.

Murphy, a Democrat, signed the bill after it was approved by the Democratic majorities in both the state Assembly and Senate, during their final legislative sessions of the year.

The legislation allows illegal immigrants over age 16 to obtain driver's licenses and learner's permits. Applicants can use foreign documents such as passports or their old driver's license from their home country to complete the process. A Social Security number is not required, according to The Associated Press.

The law reportedly establishes two types of licenses. One would conform to federal REAL ID requirements and would require proof of legal residency. The second license would only require six points of identification. The applicant would not have to provide proof of U.S. citizenship.

The Supreme Court’s decision not to hear the case – which came without comment or a dissent – is a major win for homeless activists, but a blow to city officials across the west who argue that the ruling by a federal appeals court last year hinders their abilities to regulate homeless encampments on city sidewalks.

“The Ninth Circuit’s decision misapplies and radically expands this Court’s precedent, creates conflicts with five other circuit or state supreme courts, and stretches the Eighth Amendment beyond recognition,” the lawyers representing Boise wrote in their petition to the Supreme Court. “In doing so, it eliminates the ability of state and local governments to protect the health and safety of their residents.”

LA PUSH TO DEVELOP SKID ROW PROMPTS NEW CLASHES IN CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS CRISIS

The homelessness problem has become a particular problem in California, where cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco are dealing with massive tent encampments on city streets and freeway underpasses along with public health and safety concerns related to the homeless crisis.

Los Angeles alone saw a 16 percent increase in its homeless population over last year – soaring to more than 36,000 people living on the streets and landing a blow to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and other city officials working to add more affordable housing and social services. Overall in the bigger Los Angeles County, the homeless population rose 12 percent compared with last year’s count, bringing the total population to almost 59,000.

Last year, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Boise ruled that prosecuting or fining homeless people for sleeping on public property when they have no access to a shelter was in violation of the Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. While cities like Los Angeles have begrudgingly adhered to the ruling, other cities have been accused of sweeping homeless individuals out of their jurisdiction and into more tolerant cities – leading officials in cities like Los Angeles to threaten legal action against their neighbors.

“They’re slacking, and some are not even doing that much,” Branimir Kvartuc, a spokesperson for L.A. City Councilman Joe Buscaino, told Fox News. “Some are taking the homeless out of their cities and moving them to the L.A. city side.”

Los Angeles City Attorney Michael Feuer supported the petition by Boise and questioned if the city needed to have shelter for all 36,000 homeless individuals “before taking enforcement action against a single unsheltered individual who refuses an available shelter bed in one of the city’s regional shelters, just because shelters at the opposite end of the city are full,” according to the Los Angeles Times."

It was the annual Christmas concert at his Christian preschool, and after weeks of practice, it was finally time to perform “Feliz Navidad” and ”Jingle Bells” for the proud parents.

But first, the head pastor of the church that hosts the preschool took the stage to welcome the families and offer a few thoughts on why we celebrate Christmas. “Welcome! It’s wonderful to be together today to celebrate the birth of Christ. But before the children perform, I’d like to offer a brief word of encouragement, which is this: Parents, please don’t keep Christ in Christmas.”

I’ll admit the preacher didn’t have my complete attention until that moment. I had a full day ahead of me, and my mind was on how I was going to get my older kids to all the places they needed to go and still navigate all the things I needed to do.

PHIL ROBERTSON: THIS POWERFUL CHRISTMAS MESSAGE CAN TRANSFORM AMERICA – EVEN WASHINGTON

While the pastor continued on about the bumper stickers we often see on cars at this time of year that say “Keep Christ in Christmas” I turned to my husband and asked, “Did the pastor really just say “Don’t keep Christ in Christmas?” Before he could respond, the pastor answered the question for me.

I can’t remember his precise words but his message clarified my confusion.

“When parents pack up the Christmas decorations, they tend to put away Christ as well,” he said. “We tend to keep Christ in Christmas day alone. The invitation is to take Christ beyond your Christmas celebration and into your everyday lives.”

As the pastor concluded his message, I nodded my head in agreement and whispered a prayer of gratitude for a God who wants to go with me and chooses to dwell in me by His Spirit.

It’s the “wants to” that gets me. He loves us so much that He chose to enter our fallen world and broken lives in the humble form of a baby, His Son. But this is no ordinary Son. He is both God and man. He is Jesus, and every longing of the human heart finds its fulfillment in Him.

In John 10:10 Jesus said, “I came so you might have life, a great full life. My purpose is to give you a rich and satisfying life.”

Life! This is Christ’s gift to us.

He was born in a manger in Bethlehem to fulfill God’s perfect and pure law on our behalf so that we might walk in freedom from trying to do enough and be enough to secure God’s love and welcome.

If this is who He is and why He came, why do we put Him away with the Christmas décor? Maybe it’s because we’re more prone to think that Christ came to give us laws to follow rather than life to the fullest? But Jesus said, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.” (Matt 5:17).

He was born in a manger in Bethlehem to fulfill God’s perfect and pure law on our behalf so that we might walk in freedom from trying to do enough and be enough to secure God’s love and welcome.

The Apostle Paul also attests to the freedom from the weight of the law that Christ came to offer when he wrote, “So Christ has truly set us free. Now make sure that you stay free, and don’t get tied up again in slavery to the law.” (Gal 5:1)

These are just some of the gifts given to us in Christ.

Freedom from striving for God’s affection.

Life to the fullest.

Love that doesn’t waver based on our behavior.

Hope in hardship.

Peace that passes understanding.

Joy that isn’t contingent on our circumstances.

This doesn’t mean we won’t continue to walk through trials and heartbreak on this side of heaven. Jesus assured us, “In this world, you will have trouble.” But, He continues, “Take heart! I have overcome the world.” (John 16:33)

To “Keep Christ in Christmas” is to miss out on the gifts Christ was born to give us. May 2020 be the year we choose not to put Christ back in the décor boxes in the basement but rather accept the invitation to live in real relationship with Him.

89,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-newsom-california-homeless-crisis-federal-intervention,2,"President Trump issued a warning to California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday, threatening federal intervention if Newsom is unable to solve his state's homeless crisis.

""Governor Gavin N has done a really bad job on taking care of the homeless population in California. If he can’t fix the problem, the Federal Govt. will get involved!"" Trump tweeted.

The Golden State has led the nation in the number of homeless people with an estimated total of over 129,972 in January 2018, according to a Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] report. Just over 68 percent of the homeless population in California, the most populous U.S. state, is also categorized as unsheltered.

Earlier this month, Newsom blamed the Trump administration over rising homelessness in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, saying the White House was taking no action on ""Housing First,"" the governor's approach to solving homelessness. The proposal would involve getting people in homes first, and potentially adding job-skills training or addiction services later.

TRUMP CRITICIZES CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR OVER HANDLING OF WILDFIRES

""They're not serious about this issue,"" Newsom said. ""They're playing politics with it... expect nothing but division coming from the folks at HUD and the Trump administration.""

On Christmas day, Trump retweeted Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren who responded to Newsom's earlier comment, blasting him for his lack of accountability.

""Take accountability, Gavin,"" Lahren wrote. ""This is your state and you and your democratic cohorts created this mess. You can’t blame @realDonaldTrump forever. Step away from the hair gel and get to work!!!""

Trump's latest criticism of the governor came a month after he attacked Newsom for doing a ""terrible job of forest management"" as wildfires raged across California.

He also put pressure on Newsom by suggesting there won't be any more federal funding to battle the wildfires unless the state improved its forest management system.

Two men were killed when the gunman opened fire at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, as more than 240 parishioners were inside. Within seconds, he was shot to death by two congregants who fired back.

At a news conference Sunday night, White Settlement Police Department Chief J.P. Bevering told reporters the gunman – who has yet to be identified – had sat down in a pew before getting up, taking out a shotgun and firing at a parishioner, who was killed.

TEXAS REPUBLICAN CREDITS CHURCH SECURITY TEAM, CHANGE IN STATE LAW AFTER SHOOTING

FBI special agent in charge, Matthew DeSarno, said the gunman had been arrested multiple times in the past. He said he was “relatively transient” but had roots in the area.

A woman who was seated near the gunman said something seemed off from the moment the gunman entered the church. Besides never seeing the man in church before, he also appeared to have a beard and a wig that looked fake.

“I should have listened to my gut,” Isabel Arreola, 38, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “While he was there, I couldn’t sing. I couldn’t pray. There was just something not right about him. But at the same time, I thought that maybe I was being too hard.”

Arreola told the newspaper she and her husband decided they would move with her 7-year-old daughter to the other side of the church after communion. But as communion came to a close, a livestream of the church service shows the gunman getting up from a pew and talking to someone at the back of the church before pulling out a gun and opening fire. Parishioners can then be heard screaming and seen ducking under pews or running as papers fly to the floor.

“I saw him pull the gun out and I was just panicked ​and then we heard it go off and we’re just screaming, ​you know, trying to get under the pews,” Arreola told CBS11.

Two people with minor injuries that were sustained while ducking for cover were treated at the scene, according to MedStar Mobile Healthcare spokeswoman Macara Trusty.

As the gunman opened fire, Bevering said the church's security team “eliminated the threat,"" firing back and killing the suspect. An elder at the church told The New York Times that one of those killed was a security guard who responded to the shooter, calling him a dear friend.

“He was trying to do what he needed to do to protect the rest of us,” Mike Tinius told the newspaper, adding, “It’s extremely upsetting to see anyone committing violence.""

TEXAS CHURCH SHOOTING IS LATEST OF MANY ATTACKS AT US HOUSES OF WORSHIP IN RECENT YEARS

While authorities have yet to release information about the church's volunteer security team, a witness to the shooting told CBS11 the church member who shot the suspect was a former FBI agent.

The actions of the two congregants who opened fire as part of the volunteer security team at the church were praised by authorities during a news conference late Sunday.

“This team responded quickly and within six seconds, the shooting was over. Two of the parishioners who were volunteers of the security force drew their weapons and took out the killer immediately, saving untold number of lives,"" Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told reporters as he also hailed the state's gun laws.

While authorities have also not yet identified those killed in the shooting, Tiffany Wallace told Dallas TV station KXAS that her father, Anton ""Tony"" Wallace, was one of the victims in the attack.

""I ran toward my dad and the last thing I remember is him asking for oxygen and I was just holding him, telling him I loved him and that he was going to make it,"" Wallace said.

Wallace said her father was rushed to a hospital but he did not survive.

Gov. Greg Abbott asked the state to pray for the victims, their loved ones and the community of White Settlement, located about 8 miles west of Fort Worth.

“Places of worship are meant to be sacred, and I am grateful for the church members who acted quickly to take down the shooter and help prevent further loss of life,” Abbott said in a tweeted statement.

91,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-high-alert-christmas-gift-missile-north-korea,2,"U.S. officials are on high alert for signs of a possible missile launch from North Korea in the coming days that officials have referred to as a “Christmas gift.”

A significant launch or nuclear test would raise the end of North Korea's self-imposed moratorium on missile launches and tests. It would also be a major blow to one of President Trump’s major foreign policy goals to get North Korea back to the negotiating table to eliminate its nuclear weapons.

Earlier this month, the North conducted what U.S. officials say was an engine test. Experts believe it may have involved an engine for a long-range missile.

""North Korea has been advancing. It has been building new capabilities,"" said Anthony Wier, a former State Department official who tracks nuclear disarmament for the Friends Committee on National Legislation. ""As long as that continues, they gain new capabilities to try new missiles to threaten us and our allies in new ways,""

North Korea warned of a possible ""Christmas gift"" in early December, saying the Trump administration was running out of time on nuclear negotiations, and it was up to the U.S. to choose what ""Christmas gift"" it gets from Pyongyang.

NORTH KOREA WARNS US COULD ‘PAY DEARLY’ FOR HUMAN RIGHTS CRITICISM

Victor Cha, a Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said a review of the possible launch sites in North Korea shows they are a ""basically ready to go.""

Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters earlier this week that the U.S. has heard all the talk of a possible upcoming test around Christmas.

""I've been watching the Korean Peninsula for a quarter-century now. I'm familiar with their tactics, with their bluster,"" he said. ""We need to get serious and sit down and have discussions about a political agreement that denuclearizes the peninsula. That is the best way forward and arguably the only way forward if we're going to do something constructive.""

Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Friday that the U.S., Japan, and South Korea are ready to defend against any move by the North.

""We always maintain very high levels of readiness,"" he said.

At a meeting in Singapore in June 2018, Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a joint statement that the North ""commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."" But negotiations stalled in February after the U.S. rejected North Korea’s demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the North's nuclear capabilities.

According to the U.S. military, North Korea has launched more than 20 missiles this year. They've included new types of missiles as well as a submarine-launched ballistic missile, in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.

KELLY CRAFT AT UN: NORTH KOREA MISSILE LAUNCHES ‘RISK CLOSING THE DOOR’ ON DIPLOMATIC PROGRESS

In 2017, North Korea conducted a torrent of missile tests, including flying two intermediate-range missiles over Japan and threatening to fire those weapons toward the U.S. territory of Guam. It also tested three developmental ICBMs, including the Hwasong-15 that demonstrated the potential range to reach deep into the U.S. mainland.

But those ICBM tests showed no clear sign the North had perfected the technology needed to ensure a warhead could survive atmospheric re-entry. Experts said North Korea needed additional flight tests to determine the reliability and accuracy of its ICBMs and establish a capable re-entry protection system.

North Korea’s missile tests in 2017 triggered a sharp U.S. reaction. Trump said he would bring ""fire and fury"" to North Korea and exchanged threats of total destruction with its leader. Kim subsequently suspended ICBM and nuclear tests, allowing Trump to tout the move as a foreign policy win.

A key discussion point has been the reduction in U.S. military exercises with South Korea — a move by the Trump administration to appease North Korea and woo them to the negotiating table for denuclearization talks. The U.S. has about 28,000 troops in South Korea.

As of Tuesday night, protesters set up tents outside the embassy in the Iraqi capital where they said they intended to stage a sit-in “until American troops leave Iraq and the embassy is closed.” About 100 Marines are being sent to the embassy to bolster security and an Army Apache helicopter flew over the premises and dropped flares in a ""show of force,"" with the goal of dispersing the crowd, a U.S. defense official told Fox News.

Earlier in the day, at least six U.S. soldiers were seen standing on the roof of the main building pointing their firearms at the demonstrators and sounds of gunfire could be heard.

US CARRIES OUT AIRSTRIKES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA AFTER CONTRACTOR IS KILLED

Two Iraqi foreign ministry officials initially told Reuters the U.S. ambassador and staff were evacuated, but U.S. officials pushed back, telling Fox News that was not correct. Ambassador Matthew H. Tueller was not evacuated, but was out of the country on a planned vacation, an official said. A State Department spokesperson later told Fox News that ""U.S. personnel are secure.""

""We have taken appropriate force protection actions to ensure the safety of American citizens, military personnel and diplomats in country, and to ensure our right of self-defense,"" added Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. ""We are sending additional forces to support our personnel at the Embassy.""

Dozens of protesters, many of whom are reported to be wearing militia uniforms, are said to have come within 200 yards of the embassy after busting through an entrance used by cars.

“Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible,” President Trump tweeted. “In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!”

A video obtained by the AP showed the demonstrators trashing the embassy's reception area and also taking away paperwork.

The embassy attack, one of the worst in recent memory, followed deadly U.S. airstrikes on Sunday that killed 25 fighters of the Iran-backed group, the Kataeb Hezbollah. The U.S. military said the airstrikes were in retaliation for last week's killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base, which the U.S. blamed on the militia.

Military jet fighters conducted ""precision defensive strikes"" on five sites belonging to Kataeb Hezbollah, Jonathan Hoffman, a spokesperson for the Pentagon told Fox News. Two defense officials added that Air Force F-15 jet fighters carried out the strikes.

TRUMP BLAMES IRAN FOR U.S. EMBASSY ATTACK IN IRAQ

Supporters of the militia held funerals Tuesday for the fighters killed, before setting their sights on the embassy.

The mob shouted “Down, Down USA!” as the crowd first tried to push inside the embassy grounds, hurling water and stones over its walls, The Associated Press reported. They raised yellow militia flags and taunted the embassy's security staff who remained behind the glass windows in the gates' reception area. The mob also sprayed red graffiti on the wall and windows, in support of the Kataeb Hezbollah, reading: “Closed in the name of the resistance.”

Following the breach of the gate, an Associated Press reporter at the scene saw flames rising from inside the compound. Smoke from tear gas that was fired rose in the area, and at least three of the protesters appeared to have difficulties breathing. A man on a loudspeaker also was heard urging the mob not to enter the compound, saying: “The message was delivered.”

No one was immediately reported hurt in the rampage and security staff withdrew inside the embassy when protesters started to gather outside.

""We differentiate between these militia groups and the legitimate protesters who have been in the streets for the last couple months demanding a better government and a better future for themselves. These people came right on in. They are very clearly identified,"" a U.S. official told Fox News.

""Iraqi security forces did participate [in protecting the embassy] and the President's message is that we continue to do so,"" the official added. ""Our first priority is the security of our people and assets in the embassy. The President was very clear in the tweet that the government of Iraq needs to protect the embassy.""

The Embassy, on its Facebook page, urged American citizens not to approach the compound and “to review their personal security and emergency preparedness.”

JAMES CARAFANO: US FOREIGN POLICY -- ARE WE BETTER OFF THAN WE WERE A DECADE AGO?

Jaafar al-Husseini, a spokesman for Kataeb Hezbollah, said the protesters had no intention to storm the embassy, only to send a message. He told the AP that the sit-in outside the embassy will continue “until American troops leave Iraq and the embassy is closed.”

As tempers rose, the mob also set fire to three trailers used by security guards along the embassy wall.

Yassine al-Yasseri, Iraq's interior minister, appeared outside the embassy at one point and walked around to inspect the scene. He told the AP that the prime minister had warned the U.S. strikes on the Shiite militiamen would have serious consequences.

""This is one of the implications,"" al-Yasseri said. ""This is a problem and is embarrassing to the government.""

He said more security will be deployed to separate the protesters from the embassy, an indication the Iraqi troops would not move in to break up the crowd by force.

Seven armored vehicles with about 30 Iraqi soldiers arrived near the embassy hours after the violence erupted, deploying near the embassy walls but not close to the breached area. Four vehicles carrying riot police approached the embassy later but were forced back by the protesters who blocked their path.

93,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/john-fund-lets-resolve-not-to-forget-the-good-news-changing-our-world,2,"About half of us make New Year’s resolutions at this time. Most of us end up not fulfilling them, whether it be losing weight, becoming more organized or getting out of debt.

But here’s one resolution that may be easier to keep and help maintain your sanity during the upcoming presidential campaign. Stop letting all the “bad news” that floods your mobile phone or TV make you forget there’s a lot of good news out there that makes a bigger difference to all of us in the long run.

Keeping a resolution against letting bad news dominate your media consumption won’t be easy. There’s an old saying among editors that “if it bleeds, it leads,” and 90 percent of news is negative because that’s what interests us.

NOEL YEATTS: NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS THAT MATTER — FOUR WAYS YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORLD

Daniel Kahneman, who shared a Nobel Prize in economics in 2002, first noted that human nature has saddled us with some baggage. We suffer from “negativity bias,” which leads us to pay more attention to negative details than positive ones and also “confirmation bias,” which leads to look at information that reconfirms our negative expectations.

There’s lots of evidence these biases affect our news judgment. In 2014, the Russian news site City Reporter decided to cover only good news and silver linings for an entire day. It lost two-thirds of its normal readership that day. When I was growing up in California, a businessman in my hometown launched ""The Good News,"" an unrelentingly cheerful weekly paper that found subscribers in 50 states and 10 countries. But it went broke in 16 months.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

So it may be obvious that calling on news outlets to publish more “good news” isn’t going to trump human nature. But we can at least take time to recognize our biases and resist them at times.

In the best article this year that you probably haven’t read, science writer Matt Ridley writes in the British Spectator: ""We’ve Just Had The Best Decade In Human History. Seriously."" His thesis is clear: ""We are living through the greatest improvement in human living standards in history. Extreme poverty has fallen below 10 percent of the world’s population for the first time. It was 60 per cent when I was born. Global inequality has been plunging as Africa and Asia experience faster economic growth than Europe and North America; child mortality has fallen to record low levels; famine virtually went extinct; malaria, polio and heart disease are all in decline.""

While the news focuses on terrorism, Syria, economic inequality, the personality of Donald Trump and the legacy of slavery, Winston Churchill would remind us that “great forces are on the move in the world” that in the long run may be more important.

While our populations and economies are growing, MIT scientist Andrew McAfee has demonstrated many nations are using less water, fewer minerals and less land even as they make more of everything. For example, thanks to better irrigation and technology, we use 65 percent less land to produce the same amount of food we did 50 years ago.

Ridley points out the good news on using fewer resources that sits in our own hands: “Mobile phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the 1970s. I use mine instead of a camera, radio, torch, compass, map, calendar, watch, CD player, newspaper and pack of cards.”

For most of my life, I’ve grown up hearing doomsayers saying we are running out of energy. How many people grasp that the shale oil revolution and the explosion of renewable energy has brought the U.S. to the edge of being a net energy exporter?

Time Magazine may make Greta Thunberg its ""Person of the Year,"" but that obscures the news that U.S. carbon emissions actually declined in the last decade. Natural gas emits half as much carbon as coal, and as the U.S. Energy Information Administration points out, it was the ""largest source,"" or about 35 percent, of U.S. electricity in 2018. Coal dropped from 45 percent in 2010 to 25 percent in 2019, and may drop to 22 percent in 2020.

Ridley points out that we could make even more progress on carbon emissions if environmental opposition to the newer, safer generation of nuclear power wasn't so intense. Nuclear power uses the least land, least fuel and the least in building materials of any form of energy generation. As for the future, Ridley notes, “It is now possible that nuclear fusion will one day deliver energy in minimalist form, using very little fuel and land.”

So by all means, let us not tune out the slinging of political mud in the coming campaign or the natural disasters that take human life. But let’s all resolve to put it all into some context, and carry with us the realization that human progress continues.

Ridley, the author of the book “The Rational Optimist,” predicts that at the end of the 2020s “we will see less poverty, less child mortality, less land devoted to agriculture in the world. There will be more tigers, whales, forests and nature reserves. (We) will be richer, and each of us will use fewer resources.”

Let me add to that a prediction that if more of us recognized our ""bad news biases"" and resolved to let a bit more sunshine into our lives, we would all live in a saner world.

Qassem Soleimani, President Trump has demonstrated to Iran's leaders that he will take ""swift, decisive"" actions to protect Americans, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday on ""Fox & Friends.""

Pompeo stressed that the Trump administration has shown military ""restraint"" in the face of dozens of attacks directed by Iran and its proxies against American interests, culminating in the death of an American contractor in Iraq last week.

""I think the Iranian leadership understands President Trump will take action. ... We made very clear that these responses would be swift and decisive. We have now demonstrated that. I hope the Iranian leadership will see that and see American resolve and that their decision will be to de-escalate and take actions consistent with what normal nations do. In the event that they do not and they go in the other direction, I know that President Trump and the entire United States government is prepared to respond appropriately,"" said Pompeo.

President of Iran Hassan Rouhani promised early Friday to ""take revenge for this heinous crime"" carried out by the United States.

TRUMP ORDERS ATTACK THAT KILLS IRANIAN GEN. QASSIM SOLEIMANI, OTHER MILITARY OFFICIALS IN BAGHDAD, PENTAGON SAYS

The Pentagon confirmed Thursday evening that Trump had ordered the attack that killed Soleimani and other military officials at Baghdad International Airport in Iraq. Iran’s top “shadow commander” was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more, the State Department said.

Pompeo said the strike was carried out to prevent an ""imminent attack"" by forces directed by Soleimani.

""He's got hundreds of American lives and blood on his hands. What was sitting before us was his travels throughout the region, his efforts to make a significant strike against Americans. There would have been many Muslims killed as well, Iraqis and people in other countries. It was a strike that was aimed at disrupting that plot, disrupting further aggression and we hope, setting the conditions for de-escalation as well,"" he said.

Brigadier General Esmail Ghaani, who served as Soleimani’s deputy commander since 1997, will now take over the helm as head of the Quds Force, Reuters reported, citing Iranian state media. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also warned ""harsh retaliation is waiting"" for the U.S."

The resolution asks the Iraqi government to end the agreement under which Washington sent forces to Iraq more than four years ago to help in the fight against the Islamic State terror group.

""The Iraqi government has an obligation to end the presence of all foreign forces on Iraqi soil and prevent it from using Iraqi lands, waters, and airspace or any other reason,"" Iraqi Parliament Speaker Mohammed al-Halboosi said in an address to lawmakers before the vote.

IRANIAN MP THREATENS TO 'ATTACK THE WHITE HOUSE': REPORT

The majority of about 180 legislators present in Parliament voted in favor of the resolution. It was backed by most Shiite members of parliament, who hold a majority of seats. Many Sunni and Kurdish legislators did not show up for the session, apparently because they oppose abolishing the deal.

But the Iraqi Parliament vote doesn't mean that the U.S. military has to leave the country immediately. It's a non-binding vote, which is seen as mostly symbolic. The 5,000 U.S. troops are in Iraq at the invitation of the country's executive branch, the Prime Minister's office -- not Parliament. It is up to the Iraqi Prime Minister whether the troops will be expelled.

The vote came two days after a U.S. drone strike killed Soleimani at the Baghdad airport, ratcheting up tensions in the region and raising fears of war.

""The United States is disappointed by the action taken today in the Iraqi Council of Representatives. While we await further clarification on the legal nature and impact of today's resolution, we strongly urge Iraqi leaders to reconsider the importance of the ongoing economic and security relationship between the two countries and the continued presence of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.

Pelosi and other Democrats have been critical of Trump’s decision to conduct an airstrike in Iraq that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' elite Quds Force, claiming he did not properly notify Congress in advance and warning about the risk of escalation in the region. Trump has also threatened additional action if Iran retaliates for Soleimani’s death.

TRUMP NOTIFIES CONGRESS OF WARNING AFTER LAWMAKERS SAID THEY WEREN'T INFORMED ABOUT SOLEIMANI IN ADVANCE

“This week, the House will introduce and vote on a War Powers Resolution to limit the President’s military actions regarding Iran,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to fellow Democrats, referring to a similar Senate resolution to be introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. “It reasserts Congress’s long-established oversight responsibilities by mandating that if no further Congressional action is taken, the Administration’s military hostilities with regard to Iran cease within 30 days.”

The first War Powers Resolution was passed in 1973 in an effort to prevent presidents from using the military without congressional approval. Since then, questions of presidential compliance have become common, with controversy stemming from President Bill Clinton’s actions in Kosovo and President Barack Obama’s operations in Libya.

On Saturday, the White House sent Congress formal notification of the drone strike under the War Powers Act, a senior administration official told The Associated Press. The notification, required by law within 48 hours of the introduction of American forces into an armed conflict or a situation that could lead to war, had to be signed and sent to Congress.

The gory episode in Soleimani's hometown of Kerman, which also reportedly left more than 200 injured, came as the U.S. Maritime Administration is warning ships across the Middle East to be on alert for possible retaliatory attacks from Iran.

“Unfortunately as a result of the stampede, some of our compatriots have been injured and some have been killed during the funeral processions,"" Pirhossein Koulivand, the head of Iran’s emergency medical services, told state media.

IRAN GUARD LEADER VOWS TO 'SET ABLAZE' US-BACKED PLACES, NETANYAHU REPORTEDLY DISTANCES ISRAEL FROM KILLING

The cause of the stampede was not immediately clear. Videos posted online showed people lying lifeless on a road and others shouting and trying to help them — and the incident has now delayed Soleimani’s funeral services.

It’s not the first time that chaos has erupted at a funeral for an influential Iranian figure.

In 1989, a funeral procession in Tehran for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was interrupted when his half-naked remains toppled out of an open coffin live on state television. Mourners had blocked the path of a truck carrying the deceased leader of the Iranian revolution and tore at his burial shroud, knocking his body to the ground. That led the broadcast to be cut short and his body airlifted by military helicopter away from the crowd until his remains could be rewrapped.

Soleimani, before he was killed last week, was the head of the Iran Revolutionary Guards’ elite Quds Force. The U.S. had blamed him for the killing of American troops in Iraq and accused him of plotting new attacks just before his death Friday in a drone strike near Baghdad’s airport. Soleimani also led forces in Syria backing President Bashar Assad in a long war and served as the point man for Iranian proxies in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.

DANIEL DAVIS: US SHOULD WITHDRAW FROM MIDDLE EAST WHILE THERE'S STILL TIME TO AVOID ANOTHER COSTLY WAR

Speaking in Kerman on Tuesday, Hossein Salami – the leader of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards – threatened to “set ablaze” places supported by the United States to avenge Soleimani’s death. His remarks were met with cries of “Death to Israel!” from a crowd of supporters, according to The Associated Press.

A separate procession Tuesday in Soleimani’s honor, in the capital of Tehran, is said to have drawn more than one million people.

Iran so far has worked up 13 sets of plans to avenge Soleimani's killing, according to a report from the Tasnim news agency.

It quoted Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, as saying that even the weakest among them would be a “historic nightmare” for the U.S. But he declined to give any details.

“If the U.S. troops do not leave our region voluntarily and upright, we will do something to carry their bodies horizontally out,"" Shamkhani said.

BERNIE SANDERS COMPARES TRUMP TAKING OUT SOLEIMANI TO PUTIN 'ASSASSINATING DISSIDENTS'

The fiery rhetoric from Iran has prompted the U.S. Maritime Administration to issue a warning to ships across the Middle East.

“The Iranian response to this action, if any, is unknown, but there remains the possibility of Iranian action against U.S. maritime interests in the region,” it said.

Oil tankers were targeted in mine attacks last year the U.S. blamed on Iran. Tehran has denied being responsible, though it did seize oil tankers around the crucial Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20 percent of the world’s crude oil travels.

The U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet says it will work with shippers in the region to minimize any possible threat.

The 5th Fleet “has and will continue to provide advice to merchant shipping as appropriate regarding recommended security precautions in light of the heightened tensions and threats in the region,” 5th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Joshua Frey told The Associated Press.

At the same time, he said the U.S. continues to evaluate options. Trump said he would immediately impose economic sanctions ""until Iran changes its behavior,"" called on other world powers to break away from the Iran nuclear deal and called on NATO to become more involved in the Middle East.

The president's statement, while stressing American military might and marking new sanctions, nevertheless represents a move toward de-escalation after days of fiery threats from both sides that included vows of retribution from Tehran and warnings from Trump -- later clarified -- that even Iranian cultural sites could be targeted in response. It was the latest in a series of world-altering developments that began with an Iran-linked strike that killed an American contractor, escalated with an American retaliatory strike and went into uncharted territory when militia supporters stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad -- ultimately leading to the stunning strike against Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Global fears of a new war in the Middle East had built in recent days, as Washington was gripped by new partisan fights -- this time, over the Soleimani strike.

Trump continued to stand by that decision Wednesday, saying: ""Soleimani's hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood.""

While all sides appeared to be pulling back from the brink of a greater military confrontation for now, Trump again pressed to block Iran's nuclear path. ""As long as I am president of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon,"" he vowed.

""Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism,"" Trump said, calling on the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China to ""recognize this reality"" and ""break away from the remnants"" of the Obama-era nuclear pact. He claimed that the ""very defective"" deal ""gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout.""

The president touted the military under his administration but added: ""The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we need to use it. ... We do not want to use it.""

Trump said: ""The U.S. is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it.""

The president’s address comes after Iran fired as many as 15 ballistic missiles into Iraq. Ten missiles hit the Ain al-Asad Air Base, which houses U.S. troops, one missile hit a U.S. military base in Erbil, and four missiles failed to hit their targets, according to a U.S. military spokesman for Central Command, responsible for American forces in the Middle East.

The late Tuesday attacks unfolded in two waves, about an hour apart.

While no U.S. or other NATO casualties were reported, the bases were potentially vulnerable.

U.S. defense officials told Fox News the U.S. military did not attempt to shoot down the ballistic missiles fired from Iran because there were no American military assets in place to intercept them. The Patriot and Avenger anti-missile defense systems are deployed to other locations in the Middle East, but not to the two Iraqi bases targeted by Iran. Officials say the American assets are in high demand and short supply around the world.

“For the past few years, our focus was defeating ISIS and keeping a light footprint in Iraq. We did not need air defense systems against ISIS,” one official said, explaining why there were no U.S. missile defense systems in place at the Iraqi bases.

Iran’s foreign minister said the targets in Iraq were chosen because that is where U.S. Special Operations forces launched the drone strike to kill Soleimani.

But the U.S. was prepared. U.S. military officials were warned about Iran’s pending ballistic missile strike “when the air defense systems went active,” shortly before the attack was launched, a U.S. official in Baghdad told Fox News on Wednesday.

Just after the missile strikes, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps warned the U.S. and regional allies against retaliating for the attack.

“We are warning all American allies, who gave their bases to its terrorist army, that any territory that is the starting point of aggressive acts against Iran will be targeted,” IRGC warned in a statement carried by Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, while also threatening Israel.

Pentagon officials told Fox News that Iran had more than 2,000 ballistic missiles — a figure determined in the latest U.S. intelligence assessment.

The attack late Tuesday came just days after a U.S. airstrike killed Iranian Quds Force Gen. Soleimani. The U.S. blamed Soleimani for the killing of hundreds of American troops, and said he was plotting new attacks just before his death.

Iranian officials and Trump have traded threats since Soleimani's death, and more U.S. troops have been deployed to the region amid heightened tensions.

IRANIAN OFFICIAL TWEETS PHOTO OF IRANIAN FLAG AFTER ATTACK ON US TROOPS IN IRAQ

Iran-backed militias in Iraq, known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), have threatened revenge on American interests and personnel for the killings.

On Sunday, Iraqi lawmakers approved a resolution to expel U.S. forces from the country. U.S. troops were deployed to Iraq five years ago at the request of the Iraqi government, after the Islamic State overtook vast swaths of the country.

After the attack on U.S. bases Tuesday night, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that ballistic missile attacks targeting U.S. military and coalition forces in Iraq Wednesday morning were ""a slap in the face"" to the United States.

Khamenei said the U.S. should leave the region, adding, “Military action like this is not sufficient. What is important is ending the corrupting presence of America in the region,” Reuters reported.

Officials said U.S. intelligence increasingly points at the airliner being accidentally struck by a Russian-made missile, killing all 176 people on board the flight, just hours after Iran fired more than a dozen ballistic missiles targeting two military bases housing American and coalition troops.

""An absolute tragedy,"" one U.S. official told Fox News. ""They just screwed up and it is tragic.""

The revelations come as Ukrainian investigators reportedly are awaiting permission from Iranian authorities to examine the crash site and look for missile fragments. Iran's head of civil aviation was quoted by the ISNA News Agency as saying Thursday that ""scientifically, it is impossible that a missile hit the Ukrainian plane, and such rumors are illogical,"" according to Reuters. Iranian officials have blamed a technical malfunction for the aircraft’s doom.

UKRAINIAN PLANE LIKELY SHOT DOWN BY MISTAKE BY IRAN JOINS LIST OF AIR DISASTERS DURING CONFLICT

The U.S. official told Fox News that a Russian-made SA15 missile, which is part of the Tor surface-to-air missile system, was the kind that brought down the aircraft. Russia delivered 29 Tor-M1 systems to Iran in 2007 as part of a $700 million contract signed in December 2005. Iran has displayed the missiles in military parades as well.

""A strike by a missile, possibly a Tor missile system, is among the main (theories), as information has surfaced on the internet about elements of a missile being found near the site of the crash,"" Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's Security Council, told Ukrainian media earlier. He did not elaborate on where he saw the information.

When asked Thursday about what could have happened to the Ukrainian International Airlines flight, President Trump said he didn't believe that a mechanical failure caused the plane crash.

""It was flying in a pretty rough neighborhood,"" he said. ""Somebody could have made a mistake on the other side.""

Danilov also said other possible causes under consideration for Wednesday's downing included a drone or another flying object crashing into the plane, a terrorist attack or an engine malfunction causing an explosion. However, no terror group has claimed responsibility for the attack and the plane was less than four years old.

The crash came just a few hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack against Iraqi military bases housing U.S. troops amid a confrontation with Washington over it killing an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general in a drone strike last week.

Newsweek was the first to report that the plane was mistakenly shot down by missiles.

RUSSIAN MISSILE STRIKE EYED AS ONE OF MANY POSSIBLE CAUSES THAT LED TO PLANE CRASH IN IRAN: UKRAINE

Gen. Abolfazl Shekarchi, the spokesman of the Iranian armed forces, earlier denied a missile hit the airplane in comments reported Wednesday by the Fars news agency. He dismissed the allegation as ""psychological warfare"" by foreign-based Iranian opposition groups.

The incident has similarities to the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine.

All 298 passengers and crew on board flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur were killed on July 17, 2014, when a missile shattered the Boeing 777 midair, sending debris and bodies raining down onto farms and fields of sunflowers. The jet in 2014 was shot down by a Soviet-made missile over rebel-held eastern Ukraine, about 25 miles from the Russian border, where fighting had been raging for months between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists.

The National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB] announced Thursday night it ""designated an accredited representative to the investigation of the crash."" Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman told Fox News, ""We are supporting the NTSB in the investigation per Annex 13 protocol."" Annex 13 protocol refers to the Convention on International Civil Aviation's recommended practices for investigating aircraft incidents.

US-IRAN TENSIONS: A TIMELINE OF INCIDENTS BETWEEN TWO LONGTIME RIVALS

An initial report prepared by Iran's Civil Aviation Organization said Thursday that the plane’s crew never made a radio call for help and was trying to turn back for the airport when it went down.

The Ukrainian International Airlines flight took off at 6:12 a.m. Wednesday, after nearly an hour's delay, from Tehran's Imam Khomeini Airport, the main airport for travelers in Iran. It gained altitude heading west, reaching nearly 8,000 feet, according to both the report and flight-tracking data.

Then something went wrong, though “no radio messages were received from the pilot regarding unusual situations,” the report said. In emergencies, pilots reach out to air-traffic controllers to warn them and to clear the runway for their arrival, though their first priority is to keep the aircraft flying.

US DEFENDS SOLEIMANI KILLING AS ‘SELF-DEFENSE’

Eyewitnesses, including the crew of another flight passing above it, described seeing the plane engulfed in flames before crashing at 6:18 a.m., the report said. Flight-tracking data for the plane stopped before the crash, which occurred in the town of Shahedshahr to the northeast of the plane's last reported position.

The crash caused a massive explosion when the plane hit the ground, likely because the aircraft had been fully loaded with fuel for the flight to Kyiv, Ukraine.

But the report also confirmed that both of the “black boxes” that contain data and cockpit communications from the plane had been recovered, though they sustained damage and some parts of their memory were lost. It also said that investigators have initially ruled out laser or electromagnetic interference as causing the crash.

""We insist Iran give us full access to the investigation and to the materials of the investigation and I call on everyone to avoid any speculations,"" Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's deputy minister for foreign affairs, said Thursday.

Oleksandr Zaporozhchenko, a mechanic with the Ukraine International Airlines in 2016-2018, said he knew one of the crew members of the plane and had never heard any complaints about the aircraft.

“It is one the most reliable planes out there,” Zaporozhchenko told The Associated Press.

The plane was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, at least 63 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians, according to officials. Many of the passengers were believed to be international students attending universities in Canada; they were making their way back to Toronto by way of Kiev after visiting with family during the winter break.

Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the aerospace division of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, told state TV that his unit accepts “full responsibility” for shooting down the aircraft minutes after it took off Wednesday from Tehran’s international airport. He said that when he learned about the downing of the plane, “I wished I was dead.”

The aircraft, which was heading to Kiev, was shot down hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on two military bases housing U.S. and coalition troops in Iraq. Those attacks were in retaliation for the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in an American airstrike in Baghdad.

No one was wounded in the attack on the bases.

IRAN DEMANDS WEST 'SHOW FINDINGS' AS NEW VIDEO REVEALS AIRCRAFT WAS STRUCK BEFORE FIERY CRASH

Days later, U.S. military officials said they believed Iran had mistakenly shot down the plane using a surface-to-air missile. This conclusion was supported by videos that purportedly show a fast-moving light through the trees before a high fireball illuminates the landscape.

Someone off-camera says in Farsi: “The plane has caught fire. ... In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. God, help us. Call the fire department!”

Hajizadeh told Iranian state media that Tehran had beefed up its air defenses and was at the “highest level of readiness,” fearing any U.S. retaliation to the missile attacks on its troops.

He said the pilot and crew of the passenger plane had done nothing wrong and that the armed forces alone were responsible. An officer made the “bad decision” to open fire on the plane after mistaking it for a cruise missile, he added.

US-IRAN TENSIONS: A TIMELINE OF INCIDENTS BETWEEN TWO LONGTIME RIVALS

“A sad day,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted. “Human error at time of crisis caused by US adventurism led to disaster. Our profound regrets, apologies and condolences to our people, to the families of all victims, and to other affected nations.”

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DOCTORAL STUDENT, MOTHER AND SISTER AMONG 176 KILLED IN IRAN PLANE CRASH

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani also tweeted about ""human error"" causing the ""horrific crash,"" calling it a ""great tragedy & unforgivable mistake.""

He also wrote, ""The Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets this disastrous mistake,"" but made no mention of the U.S. in either message.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, expressed his “deep sympathy” to the families of the victims and called on the armed forces to ""pursue probable shortcomings and guilt in the painful incident.”

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy issued a statement saying the crash investigation should continue and the “perpetrators” should be brought to justice. He said Iran should compensate victims' families, and he requested “official apologies through diplomatic channels.”

The plane, which was bound for Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, had 167 passengers and nine crew members aboard. Those killed included 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians, officials said.

Among the dead were a California doctoral student, who was an Iranian immigrant to Canada, as well as her sister and mother, who were residents of Edmonton, Alberta in Canada, reports said.

On Friday, Canada's foreign minister had announced the launch of an international effort to press Iran for a thorough investigation into the cause of the crash.

Iran's acknowledgment of responsibility was likely to renew questions of why authorities did not shut down the country's main international airport and its airspace after the ballistic missile attack when they feared U.S. reprisals.

It also undermines the credibility of information provided by senior Iranian officials. As recently as Friday, Ali Abedzadeh, the head of the national aviation department, had told reporters “with certainty” that a missile had not caused the crash.

Cory Booker on Monday suspended his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination after struggling since the start to break into the top tier and failing to make the cut for the upcoming debate.

“It’s with a full heart that I share this news -- I’ve made the decision to suspend my campaign for president,” Booker said in an email to supporters.

TRUMP HITS BACK AT ‘MINI MIKE BLOOMBERG,’ ACCUSES HIM OF ‘FALSE ADVERTISING’

Booker entered the race last February but struggled to gain traction in the polls. It wasn’t long ago that Booker, the energetic former mayor of Newark, N.J., was considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, but he was outshined throughout the primary and never enjoyed a break-out moment like others.

In his note to supporters, the Democrat acknowledged he didn’t see a path to victory.

“It was a difficult decision to make, but I got in this race to win, and I’ve always said I wouldn’t continue if there was no longer a path to victory,” Booker said.

His exit from the race comes just a day before the Democratic field meets for another debate in Iowa. While having participated in early debates, Booker had failed to meet the qualifications to participate in Tuesday’s event. It also comes less than a month before Iowa kicks off the nominating season with the caucuses on Feb. 3.

In a tweet, Booker said: “To my team, supporters, and everyone who gave me a shot—thank you. I am so proud of what we built, and I feel nothing but faith in what we can accomplish together.”

Booker is the latest candidate of color to exit the race, following the departure of California Sen. Kamala Harris, who is also black, and former Obama administration official Julian Castro, who was the only Latino in the field. The top tier candidates are all white: former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

The last African-American candidate in the race is former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, but he has not qualified for the debate.

As he often does when a Democratic candidate exits the 2020 contest, President Trump reacted to the news by mocking Booker's candidacy.

""Really Big Breaking News (Kidding): Booker, who was in zero polling territory, just dropped out of the Democrat Presidential Primary Race. Now I can rest easy tonight. I was sooo concerned that I would someday have to go head to head with him!"" he tweeted.

It's a humbling finish for someone who was once lauded by Oprah Winfrey as the ""rock star mayor"" who helped lead the renewal of Newark. During his seven years in City Hall, Booker was known for his headline-grabbing feats of local do-goodery, including running into a burning building to save a woman, and his early fluency with social media, which brought him 1.4 million followers on Twitter when the platform was little used in politics. His rhetorical skills and Ivy League background often brought comparisons to former President Barack Obama, and he'd been discussed as a potential presidential contender since his arrival in the Senate in 2013.

But Booker struggled to land on a message that would resonate with voters. He's long been seen as a progressive Democrat in the Senate, pushing for criminal justice reform and marijuana legalization. And on the campaign trail, he proposed establishing a $1,000 savings account for every child born in the U.S. to help close the racial wealth gap.

He was among the first candidates to release a gun control plan, and at the time it was the most ambitious in the field, as it included a gun licensing program that would have been seen as political suicide just a decade before. He also released an early criminal justice reform plan that focused heavily on addressing sentencing disparities for drug crimes.

But he also sought to frame himself as an uplifting, unifying figure who emphasized his bipartisan work record. That didn't land in a Democratic primary that has often rewarded candidates who promised voters they were tough-minded fighters who could take on Trump.

103,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-announces-trump-impeachment-managers,2,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday announced the seven lawmakers who will serve as impeachment managers to prosecute the case against President Trump in his imminent Senate trial.

“This is about the Constitution of the United States,” Pelosi said, as she presented the Democrats' legal team and noted that she put an emphasis on ""litigators"" in assembling them.

The managers include House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who will be the lead manager and who directed much of the impeachment inquiry out of his committee, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose panel drafted the articles of impeachment.

Pelosi also tapped House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.; Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo.; Val Demings, D-Fla.; Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas; and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.

Many of the managers were chosen because of their backgrounds: Lofgren has been involved in three presidential impeachment proceedings: as a Judiciary Committee staffer during former President Richard Nixon's and a committee member during former President Bill Clinton's impeachment, and now as a manager.

During Clinton’s impeachment in 1999, there were 13 House impeachment managers. Pelosi chose seven for Trump's trial.

Announcing the managers, Pelosi argued the charges against the president will be a stain on his legacy, dramatically referring to an ""impeachment that will last forever."" She said the House on Wednesday will pass a resolution to appropriate funds for the trial, and transmit the articles -- abuse of power and obstruction of Congress -- to the Senate.

""This is a very serious matter and we take it to heart in a really solemn way,"" Pelosi said. ""It's about the Constitution, it's about the republic if we can keep it and [senators] shouldn’t be frivolous with the Constitution of the United States even though the president of the United States has.""

She added: ""The president is not above the law. He will be held accountable. He already has been held accountable. He has been impeached and you can never erase that.""

Trump hit back in a tweet after the announcement: “Here we go again, another Con Job by the Do Nothing Democrats. All of this work was supposed to be done by the House, not the Senate!”

Pelosi defended her decision to delay sending the articles to the upper chamber for an entire month -- despite taunts from Republicans that it accomplished nothing -- saying that ""time has been our friend in all of this because it has yielded incriminating evidence.""

TRUMP’S IMPEACHMENT TRIAL TEAM: WHO ARE THE LAWYERS DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT?

Pelosi, in holding back the impeachment articles for weeks, had sought to pressure Republicans to commit to allowing new testimony and documents. Some Republicans are open to this, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., wants to decide such matters after the process has started.

At the heart of the case is Trump's effort to convince Ukraine to launch investigations of Democrats, while his administration withheld military aid. Trump denies wrongdoing, while Democrats allege he abused the power of his office.

Meanwhile, a White House official told Fox News on Tuesday that the president’s legal defense team in the looming impeachment trial would be led by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone. The official said that Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow would also serve on the president’s defense, as well as Cipollone deputies Michael Purpura and Patrick Philbin.

The official told Fox News that other attorneys could cycle through or be on the floor in a support capacity, but that those details and types of decisions will be made by the president if and when he deems necessary.

After several days of procedural steps later this week, the Senate is poised to launch into the heart of the impeachment trial as early as next Tuesday. McConnell on Tuesday shot down the idea being floated by the president earlier this week of bypassing a trial and dismissing the articles altogether. GOP senators argue they'd rather pursue acquittal."

Those documents, released by Democratic lawmakers, showed Lev Parnas -- an associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani -- communicating about the removal of Marie Yovanovitch as the ambassador to Ukraine.

In some of those communications, Trump donor Robert F. Hyde seemed to indicate intimate knowledge of Yovanovitch’s activities – claiming at one point her phone and computer were off, and at another point that she was next to the embassy, adding, “Not in the embassy. Private security. Been there since Thursday.""

YOVANOVITCH CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION AFTER DOCUMENTS SHOW SHE MAY HAVE BEEN SURVEILLED IN UKRAINE

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif, wrote Tuesday that Hyde's texts indicated ""that he had Ambassador Yovanovitch under physical surveillance."" Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders said it was ""outrageous that the president’s personal lawyers appear to have directed the surveillance of a U.S. ambassador"" and demanded that the matter be ""fully investigated."" Yovanovitch herself called for a probe.

Yet Parnas, in an interview Wednesday with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, undercut such claims by dismissing Hyde’s messages as either inflated or influenced by alcohol.

""I don't believe it was true, I think he was either drunk or was trying to make himself bigger than he was,"" Parnas told Maddow. ""I didn't take him seriously. I didn't even respond to him most of the time. If I did, it was something like 'LOL' or 'Okay' or 'Great' or something like that.""

Parnas said that after he received the texts from Hyde about the apparent surveillance, he called up a mutual acquaintance at the super PAC America First -- and that the acquaintance told Parnas to stay away from Hyde.

But the claims will now get a closer look out of Kiev.

DONALD TRUMP JR. ACCUSES YOVANOVITCH OF 'MONITORING' HM, OTHER AMERICANS

The Ukrainian Interior Ministry, which runs the police forces, said in a statement that Ukrainian police ""are not interfering in the internal political affairs of the United States.""

""However, the published messages contain facts of possible violations of Ukrainian law and of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, which protect the rights of diplomats on the territory of another state,"" the statement continued.

The statement said Ukraine ""cannot ignore such illegal activities on the territory of its own state"" and vowed to investigate whether there was a violation of the law or ""whether it is just a bravado and a fake information in the informal conversation between two US citizens.""

The Interior Ministry also said it has invited the FBI to take part in the investigation.

Parnas, meanwhile, made other explosive claims during his interview that further implicated Trump and his inner circle in the matter at the heart of the impeachment probe – the push to withhold aid while Trump representatives pressed for an investigation of Democrats and specifically presidential candidate Joe Biden. Trump’s Senate trial is expected to move into full swing next week, after the House on Wednesday voted to transmit two articles of impeachment to the upper chamber.

""President Trump knew exactly what was going on,"" said Parnas, a Soviet-born Florida businessman facing a raft of criminal charges related to campaign finance violations. ""He was aware of all my movements. I wouldn't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani, or the president.""

He said he delivered an ultimatum in May to the incoming president of Ukraine that no senior U.S. officials would attend his inauguration and all American aid to the war-torn country would be withheld if an investigation into Joe Biden wasn't announced.

The team will also include former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, former federal prosecutor Robert Ray and Jane Raskin, who was part of the president's legal team during former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. Both Starr and Dershowitz are former Fox News contributors.

TRUMP'S IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE TEAM: TOP LAWYERS TAPPED FOR LOOMING TRIAL

The inclusion of Starr drew an immediate reaction from Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern whose affair with Clinton eventually led to his impeachment before he was acquitted in a Senate trial. ""This is definitely an 'are you f----ng kidding me?' kinda day,"" she tweeted.

Fox News reported earlier this week that White House Counsel Pat Cipollone will take the lead on the president’s defense team in the Senate trial, along with Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow. Cipollone deputies Michael Purpura and Patrick Philbin will also work on the team.

Dershowitz confirmed his role in a series of tweets on Friday, saying he would ""present oral arguments at the Senate trial to address the constitutional arguments against impeachment and removal."" Dershowitz later told Fox News he is not a “full-fledged” member of the legal team, though he will be contributing to the effort.

""While Professor Dershowitz is non partisan when it comes to the constitution -- he opposed the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and voted for Hillary Clinton -- he believes the issues at stake go to the heart of our enduring Constitution,"" he said in another tweet.

Despite that apparent expectation, the president in recent days has publicly pushed for the case to be outright dismissed, and for the Senate to bypass a trial completely.

“Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, ‘no pressure’ Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have,” Trump tweeted on Sunday. “I agree!”

“We made a mistake,” it said in a statement.

NATIONAL ARCHIVES BLURS ANTI-TRUMP SIGNS IN IMAGE OF 2017 WOMEN'S MARCH: REPORT

The photograph in question -- on display as part of an exhibit celebrating the centennial of women’s suffrage -- shows the 2017 march down Pennsylvania Avenue the day after President Trump was elected. The image, taken by Getty Images photographer Mario Tama, shows the street crammed with marchers, many showing anti-Trump signs.

But The Washington Post first reported that many of those placards had been blurred out. Placards that read “God Hates Trump” had “Trump” blurred. Other signs that refer to women’s anatomy were altered, according to The Post. One that said “If my vagina could shoot bullets, it’d be less REGULATED” had “vagina” blurred out, while one that says “This P---y Grabs Back” had the obscenity blurred out.

In its statement, the National Archives said that it was not an archival record, but one licensed to use as a promotional graphic: “Nonetheless, we were wrong to alter the image.”

“We have removed the current display and will replace it as soon as possible with one that uses the unaltered image,” the statement said. “We apologize, and will immediately start a thorough review of our exhibit policies and procedures so that this does not happen again.”

In a previous statement to The Post, it had said that archivist David Ferriero -- appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2009 -- supported the decision.

“As a non-partisan, non-political federal agency, we blurred references to the president’s name on some posters, so as not to engage in current political controversy,” Archives spokeswoman Miriam Kleiman told The Post.

But the decision quickly came under heavy criticism.

Rice University historian Douglas Brinkey told The Post there was no reason to alter a historic photograph.”

""There's no reason for the National Archives to ever digitally alter a historic photograph,"" Brinkley said. ""If they don't want to use a specific image, then don't use it. But to confuse the public is reprehensible.""

Under the hypothetical deal, Democrats would reportedly offer up Biden or his son Hunter Biden to testify at President Trump's Senate impeachment trial in return for testimony from a Republican figure, such as ex-national security adviser John Bolton.

The Washington Post quoted the former vice president admitting that it was ""not an irrational question"" but said Trump's trial was a ""constitutional issue."" He said he does not want to see the trial turn into a ""farce or some kind of political theater.""

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY: BIDEN WANTS NO PART OF WITNESS SWAP BECAUSE HE'S 'IMPLICATED'

Biden, while campaigning in Iowa, denied that talks of a witness swap were taking place. When told by a Post reporter that the topic was being discussed, he responded, ""No they're not,"" the paper reported.

A witness swap that would result in Hunter Biden and Bolton testifying would be the most dramatic development in the trial thus far. At the heart of the impeachment trial is Trump's July 25, 2019 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump said the call was focused on corruption in Kiev and raised Biden as an example.

Hunter's position on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma while his father was vice president has been a rallying point for Republicans as they try to defend Trump against impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

Democrats see Bolton as a potential witness who could provide first-hand testimony linking Trump's decision to withhold U.S. aid from Ukraine directly to the country's willingness to investigate the Bidens.

Fiona Hill, a former top White House expert on Russia, testified in November that Bolton shared her concern about what she saw as a push to get Ukraine to conduct the investigations.

She testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee and recalled Bolton expressing his own concerns about the push and told her to tell National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg that he does not want to be a part of this ""drug deal.""

""He was saying that sarcastically, of course, I mean, just to be clear. Actually, he was angry, but he was also sarcastic. I mean — he wasn’t inferring that they were cooking up an actual drug deal in the War Room,"" she said.

Trump and Zelensky have both denied any quid pro quo. Trump called the entire impeachment process a political witch hunt. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.

The Post reported that some of the Democrats taking part in the discussion about a potential witness swap believe Biden could actually benefit politically from testifying because it would give him a chance to deliver a statesmanlike performance.

Both Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have spoken out against the potential of a witness swap.

108,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trumps-legal-team-launches-first-day-of-impeachment-defense,2,"Donald Trump's lawyers defended the president against articles of impeachment Saturday morning arguing it’s the Democrats trying to interfere in elections by seeking to remove Trump from the 2020 ballot for doing “absolutely nothing wrong.”

White House Counsel Pat Cipollone said Democrats have no case and are doing damage to democracy by trying to undermine the will of American voters.

“For all their talk about election interference, they're here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history,” Cipollone said in his opening remarks to the Senate. “And we can't allow that to happen.""

LIVE BLOG: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL

Cipollone continued: “It would violate the sacred trust that the American people have placed in you and have placed in them. The American people decide elections. They have one coming up in nine months.”

Saturday was the first chance Trump’s lawyers had to refute the House’s case of impeachment and they came out making a forceful case that there are no grounds to remove Trump from office. Not only are Democrats asking the Senate to undo the results of the 2016 election but to tear up all ballots in the 2020 election with Trump’s name, Cipollone charged.

“They're asking you to do something that no Senate has ever done and they're asking you to do it with no evidence. And that's wrong,” Cipollone said.

Billed as a teaser for next week's argument, Trump's legal team gave a 2-hour preview of their legal argument. All told, they'll have three days and up to 24 hours to launch their defense - the same amount of time as House managers -- but Cipollone told senators up front they would be ""respectful"" of their time and make their presentations shorter and less repetitive than Democrats.

WHO ARE THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS? MEET PELOSI'S HAND-PICKED PROSECUTORS

House impeachment managers spent the prior three days arguing that Trump needs to be removed from office because he’s put his own self-interests before that of national security by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and withholding nearly $400 million in security assistance to a country at war with Russia.

In smoothly choreographed presentations that relied on videos from witnesses and slideshows, the seven House Democrats drilled home the narrative that Trump needs to be impeached for abusing his oath of office by soliciting foreign election inference solely to boost his 2020 reelection chances. Trump, they charge, then obstructed Congress from investigating when he got caught.

But Trump's legal team sought Saturday sought to dismantle the argument on several fronts. First, Trump couldn't have pressured Ukraine because President Volodymyr Zelensky didn't know it was on hold until after his phone call with Trump, they said.

Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said the president's actions can't be viewed in a ""vacuum"" and reminded that Trump was ""subjected"" to the ""Crossfire Hurricane"" FBI probe before he was president and then Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe after he was in office. Trump had reason to not ""blindly trust"" the intelligence community and turned instead to his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters, he said.

Sekulow noted the administration has placed holds on aid to a number of countries, including Afghanistan, Lebanon, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The U.S. withheld $300 million in military aid to Pakistan because it wasn't meeting counter-terrorism obligation, he said.

""You didn't hear about any of that from my Democratic colleagues, the House managers,"" Sekulow charged.

GOP SENATORS: DEMS THREW BIDENS 'UNDER THE BUS' IN TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL

But Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich, noted the big difference was Congress was notified and supportive in previous cases. She pointed to a GAO report that found the Trump administration broke the law by withholding the aid against Congress's wishes.

""He did actually break the law,"" Stabenow told Fox News. ""And so I'm going to be interested in hearing how the White House responds to the fact, that in this particular case ...Congress was not informed and not involved, which is the process they're supposed to take.""

SCHIFF REFERS TO CBS 'HEAD ON PIKE' STORY, INFURIATING GOP: 'EVERY ONE OF US KNOWS IT IS NOT TRUE'

Trump's legal team went on offense by targeting the lead impeachment manager, Rep. Adam Schiff -- first showing the Intelligence Committee chairman reading the essence of Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky -- and ripping Schiff's rendition as ""a fake."" They also showed contradictory videos of Schiff's comments about first wanting to hear from the whistleblower and then changing course over security concerns for the person who blew open the Ukraine case.

""Adam Schiff got kneecapped,"" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla, told Fox News after the opening statements.

But Schiff called any allegations he colluded with the whistleblower ""nonsense.""

“I don’t even know who the whistleblower is,” Schiff, D-Calif., said Saturday at a press conference.

The fifth full day of impeachment trial proceedings began around 9:50 a.m. with a procession of the House managers and their aides wheeling the 28,578-page trial record to the Secretary of the Senate. The binders and files transported in carts will serve as the permanent historical record of the evidence against Trump. Democrats believe the record should have been thousands of pages longer if the White House hadn’t thwarted their attempts to get documents related to dealings with Ukraine.

House managers, led by Schiff, have an upward climb of getting two-thirds of the Senate to convict Trump on the two articles of impeachment, especially when Democrats are in the minority with 47 seats and GOP senators have little political incentive to defy Trump, who remains extremely popular among his Republican base.

Instead of winning them over, Schiff and Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., ticked off two key GOP swing voters this week with unforced errors on the Senate floor. Both Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska., said they were upset that Nadler accused Republicans of engaging in a “cover-up” for taking a “treacherous vote” to deny new witnesses.

Nadler's language and Cipollone's lashing back that Nadler should be ""embarrassed"" prompted Chief Justice John Roberts to admonish both sides.

And Schiff brought up CBS News' reporting Friday night that GOP senators were warned “your head will be on pike” if you vote against Trump. Republicans groaned at Schiff’s assertion and Collins, visibly agitated, shook her head on the Senate floor and loudly shot back at Schiff: “Not true!”

The Democrats argued that Trump’s high crimes and misdemeanors are such an offense to the constitution and a threat to the fairness of the 2020 election that senators must remove him from office immediately, rather than wait for voters to decide at the ballot box in November.

‘STUNNED’ SEN. COLLINS OBJECTED TO NADLER’S IMPEACHMENT ACCUSATION IN NOTE TO ROBERTS

“If he [Trump] is not removed from office, if he is permitted to defy the Congress entirely, categorically, to say that subpoenas from Congress in an impeachment inquiry are nonsense, then we will have lost ... all power to hold any president accountable,” Nadler, D-N.Y., said. “This is a determination by President Trump that he wants to be all-powerful. He does not have to respect the Congress. He does not have to respect the representatives of the people. Only his will goes. He is a dictator. This must not stand and that is another reason he must be removed from office.""

With little hope of winning a conviction in the GOP-controlled Senate, Democrats have turned their attention to forcing a vote on calling new witnesses and obtaining White House documents, which would take the support of just 51 senators--or four GOP defections.

Another vote on witnesses is expected next week after Trump’s defense team finishes its arguments and senators complete 16 hours of questioning to both sides.

109,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/americans-need-thanksgiving-founders-knew-value-robert-jeffress,2,"In October 1789, George Washington issued our nation’s first Thanksgiving proclamation, declaring that Thursday, Nov. 26 would be “devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”

Washington was just a few months into his first term. It was far from clear that our fledgling nation would survive, much less still be thriving over two centuries later.

Yet Washington found much to be thankful for.

PAUL BATURA: WHAT'S THERE TO BE THANKFUL FOR ON THIS CORONAVIRUS THANKSGIVING?

He called upon Americans to be “united in rendering unto [God] our sincere and humble thanks” for what we had. He recounted how God’s provision had been evident throughout the history of the nation, from settling the colonies to making it through a difficult war. The nation’s statesmen had come to a peaceable ratification of the new Constitution. Americans lived in a land with “civil and religious liberty.” The new president was grateful.

Washington also called on the nation to “unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions.” From the outset, our nation has aspired to be great but it hasn’t ever been perfect. Washington encouraged all Americans to acknowledge this. They were invited to spend Thanksgiving not only in gratitude but in repentance as well.

These responses – gratitude and repentance – don’t come naturally to us. Americans have always been a hard-working, industrious people. We’re proud of what we make and what we accomplish. We’re always striving for more, planning for the next quarter, projecting growth into the future. We’ve got a national dissatisfaction with the status quo.

Thanksgiving, however, is a way Americans devised in our earliest days to collectively hit pause on the grind and toil of work. Instead of being hyper-focused on what we can achieve, we take a day off to look at all the things God has achieved for us.

When you look back at the past few decades, we seem to have so much more now than we’ve ever had. Yet I think we enjoy it so much less.

This has been going on since well before the pandemic. We experienced incredible economic growth alongside skyrocketing depression, loneliness and addiction across our country.

Our growing dissatisfaction with life is because of our nation’s shrinking belief in God – a fact that is verified by numerous public opinion polls.

But Thanksgiving as a holiday makes no sense and serves no purpose without God. You can’t be “thankful” unless you’re thankful to someone. You can’t see what you have as a “gift” unless you admit you’ve received it from someone.

I’m praying that, amid all the challenges we’ve faced this year as a nation, we might return back to that spirit expressed by our first president at that first national Thanksgiving in 1789.

Let’s not spend the day simply overeating and hunting for Black Friday deals on our iPhones. Let’s set aside some time on Thursday to “give thanks to the Lord” for his “steadfast love,” which endures throughout pandemics and political turmoil, and into all eternity (Psalm 118:1).

Asked by a reporter following a teleconference with military troops on Thanksgiving if he would leave after an unsuccessful electoral college vote, he replied, “Certainly I will. ... You know that I will.""

Regarding the series of legal challenges in multiple states, Trump said: “A lot of things [are] happening between now and Jan. 20.”

“It’s going to be a very hard thing to concede,” Trump later added.

WHAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP DOING ON THANKSGIVING?

Asked if he would consider running again on the Republican ticket in 2024, Trump said, “I don’t want to talk to 2024 yet.”

The president stated that the 2020 election results still “have a long way to go.”

Trump also revealed he’d travel to Georgia on Saturday to campaign for GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler to supper them in their runoff contests.

He also said that people were “very disappointed we were robbed”’ in Georgia after the state certified its election results in favor of Biden.

The Trump legal team was dealt a blow this week after Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Nevada certified their election results. A Wednesday lawsuit from attorney Sidney Powell sought to decertify Georgia’s election result and award it to Trump.

The lawsuit, which names Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger among the defendants, alleges multiple Constitutional violations, citing fact witnesses, expert witnesses and statistical impossibilities within the election results, and says tens of thousands of votes were impacted -- enough to sway the state in favor of Biden.

WHAT IF TRUMP ACTUALLY DID IT?

Trump on Wednesday asserted again that he had won the election.

""This election was rigged and we can't let that happen. We can't let it happen for our country,"" Trump said via speakerphone to the Pennsylvania Senate Majority Policy Committee, ""And this election has to be turned around because we won Pennsylvania by a lot and we won all these swing states by a lot.""

Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who attended the public hearing in Pennsylvania, argued that the Trump campaign has been denied the opportunity ""almost uniformly"" to raise concerns about voter fraud. The former mayor of New York also claimed that mail-in ballots were the ""primary device"" used to carry out the alleged fraud."

Former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, also announced that they are in ""full support"" of the COVID-19 vaccination effort and urged Americans to get their immunizations as soon as the drugs are released, according to a statement from the Carter Center.

Some politicians have expressed skepticism over a vaccine developed and distributed by the Trump administration, including President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, among other Democratic leaders.

""A few weeks ago President Bush asked me to let Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx know that, when the time is right, he wants to do what he can to help encourage his fellow citizens to get vaccinated,"" Bush Chief of Staff Freddy Ford told Fox News.

""So if Anthony Fauci tells me this vaccine is safe, and can vaccinate, you know, immunize you from getting COVID, absolutely, I'm going to take it.""

Obama added that he ""may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed"" so Americans know he trusts the science that went into developing the vaccine.

""What I don't trust is getting COVID,"" he said. ""I think at this point, particularly in the African American community, we are -- African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans -- we have the highest death rates from this thing, and are most exposed and most vulnerable, in part because we have a lot of preexisting conditions.""

Biden, during an interview with CNN, said he will ask Americans to mask up, but only for a limited period.

""The first day I'm inaugurated I'm going to ask the public for 100 days to mask,"" Biden said. ""Just 100, not forever -- 100 days.""

""I think we'll see a significant reduction that occurs with vaccinations and masking to drive down the numbers considerably.""

Biden's comments come a day after the U.S. recorded a new high in coronavirus-related fatalities on Wednesday at 2,804, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWNS BY STATE: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

The nation – which has logged more than 14 million cases and more than 275,000 deaths since the pandemic began – also recorded 200,070 new daily COVID-19 illnesses, though it did not surpass a previous daily case record set Nov. 27 of 205,557.

The record daily death toll coincides with news of a record number of hospitalized coronavirus patients, topping 100,000 on Tuesday. The grim milestone comes as health officials warned of surges tied to holiday travel and lockdown fatigue.

Biden's comments also come as he urges lawmakers on Capitol Hill to get behind a bipartisan COVID-19 relief effort after a monthslong logjam to deliver much-sought aid as the tempestuous congressional session speeds to a close.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer of New York on Wednesday came out in support of an almost $1 trillion approach as the basis for discussions. The announcement appeared aimed at budging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who so far has been unwilling to abandon a $550 billion Senate GOP plan that has failed twice this fall.

The Democrats embraced a $908 billion approach from moderate Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, among others. It would establish a $300 per week jobless benefit, send $160 billion to help state and local governments, boost schools and universities, revive popular “paycheck protection” subsidies for businesses, and bail out transit systems and airlines.

“In the spirit of compromise we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,” Pelosi and Schumer said. They said they would try to build upon the approach, which has support in the House from a bipartisan “problem solvers” coalition.

The statement was a significant concession by Pelosi and Schumer, who played hardball this fall during failed preelection discussions with the administration on a costlier bill. They wanted a more generous unemployment benefit and far more for state and local government. Their embrace of the $908 billion measure was a retreat from a secret $1.3 trillion offer the two Democrats gave McConnell just on Monday.

It’s another sign of urgency for additional COVID aid and economic stimulus as the economy struggles to recover from being slammed by the novel coronavirus. While the jobless rate isn’t as high as was feared, the restaurant and airline industries are desperate for aid, as are other businesses, state and local officials, transit systems and the Postal Service, among others.

Loeffler brought up how Warnock has supported redistribution of income and praised Marxism in his past writings and asked her opponent to clarify his stance on the issue by denouncing socialism and Marxism.

""I believe in our free enterprise system,” Warnock said. He then said that his father was a small-business owner and recalled how he himself helped his church build a community center that helped members “participate in our free enterprise system” during the 2008 recession.

The Democrat then attacked Loeffler by accusing her of “teaching the big banks how to hide their investments offshore in the Cayman Islands” and buying her Senate seat. He later tweeted a video clip of his response that omitted Loeffler's question.

Republicans were swift to call him out for his indirect response.

“Raphael Warnock can’t simply say ‘yes’ when asked to denounce Marxism and socialism,” said National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Jesse Hunt in response to Warnock's answer.

""He refuses to denounce these dangerous & radical worldviews because he agrees with them,"" Loeffler tweeted.

Loeffler also called out Warnock for dodging a question about court packing. Democrats have often threatened to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court and add liberal justices.

116,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-executive-order-coronavirus-vaccine-america-first,2,"EXCLUSIVE: President Trump is expected to sign an executive order Tuesday that will ensure all Americans have access to the coronavirus vaccine before the U.S. government begins aiding nations around the world, Fox News has learned.

Senior administration officials told Fox News Monday that the president will reemphasize to the American people that the “priority has been an America First approach,” during a vaccine summit at the White House Tuesday.

The news of the executive order comes just days ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's Thursday meeting regarding Pfizer and BioNTech’s application for emergency authorization of their coronavirus vaccine, three weeks after the companies filed for it. The FDA also plans to meet on Dec. 17 to discuss Moderna’s vaccine.

A source close to the White House Coronavirus Task Force told Fox News last week that the Pfizer-BioNTech authorization could come as early as Friday. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn last week said that they are “very hopeful” of approval and that they are “moving very quickly.”

“The priority is to make sure we distribute these vaccines to Americans before we start shipping them around the world to get international access,” an official told Fox News, predicting that international assistance could come “late spring, early summer,” and after they “achieve vaccinating those who have a desire to be vaccinated.”

PENCE SAYS US 'A WEEK AND A HALF AWAY' FROM 'LIKELY APPROVAL' OF FIRST CORONAVIRUS VACCINE

The official said that the executive order is “clear and is directing that we prioritize access to the American people before working with partners and allies to provide access to the vaccine.”

The official added that the order will identify “who will be working with the international aspect of this, the framework, guides and tools, for when we have an excess supply to meet those demands.”

“We will very soon have highly effective COVID-19 vaccines to the American people,” another official told Fox News, adding that the vaccines are “critical to ensuring the health and safety of our citizens, viability of the economy and the security of our nation.”

The order will direct the secretary of Health and Human Services to prioritize distribution of the vaccines to Americans, at speeds “unseen before.”

The order will also be accompanied by a framework for international access to COVID-19 vaccines, which will provide guidelines for how USAID, HHS, the Export-Import Bank, and the U.S. International Development Finance Corp interacts with foreign countries to bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic.

The order will outline the government’s “three primary approaches,” which includes working with partners and allies that have the financial means to procure highly-effective vaccines.

LIVE UPDATES: TODAY'S LATEST COVID-19 HEADLINES

For countries that are not as financial well-off, the senior administration official said that they will “leverage resources to help them to procure the vaccine” and garner “ancillary supplies necessary to administer and track.” The order will also call for work with organizations focused on donation of resources, so that the U.S. government can be sure to aid in low-income countries — specifically Gavi, the vaccine alliance, which will work with USAID to support “92 low to low-middle income countries.”

Meanwhile, the officials said that Operation Warp Speed, the public-private partnership President Trump created earlier this year in an effort to create vaccines against the novel coronavirus, is working with six vaccine candidates — two of which have already filed for FDA emergency use authorization.

The officials told Fox News that the Trump administration has invested “at risk” with all of the vaccine manufacturers, providing funding and helping to manufacture vaccines even before approval from the FDA, which they described as “outside the norm.”

Typically, the official explained, clinical trials take place, and then they receive FDA approval and begin manufacturing supply of the vaccine. But the official said the government has “been facilitating production on the front end.”

“If any of these six candidate come effective, they’ll have a supply on the shelf,” the official said, adding that they intend to ship the vaccines across the country “within the first 24 hours” of EUA.

The officials said that they “anticipate late spring, early summer” for international assistance, but noted that can “move left or right depending on how we’re dealing with other vaccine candidates.”

LOCKDOWNS COULD BE 'CAUSING A LOT MORE HARM,' WARNS TOP WHITE HOUSE TASK FORCE MEMBER

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said this week that the average American can expect to be vaccinated by the ""second quarter"" of 2021.

Meanwhile, the officials clarified that in the U.S., the first to receive doses of the vaccine will be frontline healthcare workers, the vulnerable population, inside nursing home and long-term care facilities. The officials said that states have developed distribution plans.

One official explained that once the EUA is in effect for the vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ICIP) will meet to “get into more details about where the other doses go.”

“Frontline healthcare workers, long-term care facilities and nursing homes,” one official said. “When we get beyond that, the CDC will further refine distribution plans.”

The official added that the Trump administration has been engaged in “unprecedented collaboration” through the federal government, the private sector, and with International partners.

The agency’s scientists have been working non-stop on a “massive amount of data,” according to information provided to Fox News. The quickest approval process involving this amount of data ever completed before was 3.5 months, putting the current schedule on pace for historic speed.

An FDA spokesperson added that the thousands of pages of data must be divided up and reviewed by experts from different disciplines, and then integrated into an overall review.

""Completion of these reviews involves such things as ensuring that the manufacturing process and the controls on manufacturing are appropriate, checking statistical analyses performed to ensure that they were done properly, and doing additional analyses, as necessary, to look at the effect of the vaccine on subsets of individuals who might be at greater risk of adverse effects,"" the spokesperson said."
117,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-texas-supreme-court-election-lawsuit,2,"President Trump on Wednesday touted Texas' suit demanding the U.S. Supreme Court block the Electoral College votes of Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, calling it the ""big one.""

""We will be INTERVENING in the Texas (plus many other states) case. This is the big one. Our Country needs a victory!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.

Trump's legal team has faced repeated setbacks in challenging the results of states that went for President-elect Joe Biden. Trump's team could file an amicus brief in support of Texas' suit.

TRUMP TEAM CONTINUES LEGAL FIGHT AS ELECTORAL COLLEGE 'SAFE HARBOR' DEADLINE ARRIVES

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued battleground states Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin on Tuesday to challenge their 2020 presidential election results.

""These elections in other states where state law was not followed ... affects my voters because these are national elections, and so if there are fraudulent things or things that affect an election and state law is not followed as is required by the Constitution it affects our state,"" Paxton told ""Fox & Friends"" on Wednesday. ""It affects every state.""

""We can't go back and fix it, but we can say, OK, let's transfer this to the legislature ... and let them to decide the outcome of the election. That would be a valid constitutional situation,"" Paxton continued.

The legal challenge seeks to invalidate the 62 Electoral College votes from those four battleground states and award Trump a second term, alleging unconstitutional changes to election rules before the vote.

""Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a justification, government officials in the defendant states of Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (collectively, 'Defendant State'), usurped their legislatures’ authority and unconstitutionally revised their state’s election statutes,"" Paxton's complaint says. ""They accomplished these statutory revisions through executive fiat or friendly lawsuits, thereby weakening ballot integrity.""

At least three more states are getting behind the Texas lawsuit.

Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said Tuesday her office would be joining the suit, and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt announced that his state is also ""in the fight"" with Texas.

Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry also backed the suit in a statement.

“Election integrity is central to our republic,” Schmitt, a Republican, tweeted. “And I will defend it at every turn. As I have in other cases – I will help lead the effort in support of Texas’ #SCOTUS filing today. Missouri is in the fight.”

The Supreme Court on Tuesday denied a request from Trump allies to stop the certification of Pennsylvania's election results.

The high court left intact a decision from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that tossed a lawsuit from Rep. Mike Kelly challenging a 2019 law to expand mail-in voting.

Georgia stands out as a defendant in the Texas suit because both of its senators are facing tough challenges in runoff elections that will determine the balance of power in the Senate.

""We fully support President Trump’s legal recourses and Attorney General Paxton's lawsuit,"" Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler said in a joint statement on Tuesday. ""The president has every right to use every legal recourse available to guarantee these simple principles: every lawful vote cast should be counted, any illegal vote submitted cannot be counted, and there must be full transparency and uniformity in the counting process. This isn't hard and it isn't partisan. It's American. No one should ever have to question the integrity of our elections system and the credibility of its outcomes.""

118,https://www.foxnews.com/health/fda-meeting-pfizers-coronavirus-vaccine-eua-application-what-to-expect,2,"On Thursday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will meet to discuss Pfizer and BioNTech’s emergency use authorization application for its coronavirus vaccine candidate.

The companies were the first to submit their application for EUA to the FDA, with Moderna following suit shortly after.

The meeting will include members of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research advisory committee, outside vaccine experts and Pfizer representatives and will begin at approximately 9 a.m., with opening remarks and introductions, according to a draft agenda published by the regulatory agency. Next will be a presentation on emergency use authorization, followed by an update on epidemiology and a question-and-answer session.

Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease and a senior official on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) task force, will then lead a discussion on vaccine safety and effectiveness monitoring, which will precede a presentation on operational distribution plans. Messonnier played a pivotal role in the CDC’s early coronavirus response press conferences.

Before breaking for lunch, the committee will discuss “considerations for placebo-controlled trial design if an unlicensed vaccine becomes available,” and will return for an open public hearing. There will then be a sponsor presentation led by Pfizer representatives before an FDA presentation and voting questions.

The committee then will take a short break before reconvening for more discussion before holding a vote on the EUA application. Based on documents published ahead of tomorrow’s all-day data review, it appears as though the panel is poised to approve the vaccine for EUA. In documents that were published on Tuesday, the FDA said it found no new concerns regarding the vaccine, and that it had met all EUA requirements.

However, even if the committee votes in favor of EUA, the decision is not final, as it will still have to be reviewed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research officials. The same was true when a CDC panel voted to distribute the eventual vaccine candidate to health care workers and long-term care residents first. That decision also faced a final decision, which was later made by CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield.

It is not clear when the FDA officials will issue their decision. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn previously told NPR that the final decision will depend on how Thursday’s review goes.

“A lot of what this depends upon is what the discussion is like [with] these outside experts from the vaccine advisory committee,” he told the news outlet. “If they have substantial questions or additional analyses that they think are relevant to our decision-making, we will judge whether that’s important to do. That may need to be done and that may contribute to some additional time needed. But again, I can’t prejudge what that conversation is going to be like.”"
119,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/manchin-bipartisan-coronavirus-bill-fox-news-sunday,2,"Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is confident that an urgently needed bipartisan coronavirus relief bill will soon be finalized.

In a conversation with “Fox News Sunday,” Manchin said that despite a rocky negotiation process, progress has been made and he expects the bill's text to be ready Monday.

JOE MANCHIN SAYS 'SQUAD' COULD HAMPER $908B CORONAVIRUS RELIEF

“It hasn’t fallen apart -- we’ve been meeting day and night for the last month,” Manchin said. “We were on the call all day yesterday, we’ll get on the call again this afternoon to finish things up. We’ll have a bill produced for the American people tomorrow -- $908 billion.”

Manchin noted that with a legislative package of this size there will be pieces that not everyone will agree with, but he said lawmakers must compromise for the good of the country. He emphasized that the bill would only address the needs of the country for the first quarter of 2021.

SENATE APPROVES INTERIM SPENDING BILL BY VOICE VOTE, ALIGNS WITH HOUSE

“This is only until April 1. We’re trying to get through the toughest first quarter of our country that we’ve ever faced,” he said.

Two major issues that have been debated are extending increased unemployment benefits and liability protection for small businesses that reopen. President Trump has said that instead of extending weekly unemployment benefits in the upcoming bill, lawmakers should instead issue a single stimulus payment of $600 to all Americans.

NEW WHITE HOUSE COVID-19 RELIEF PROPOSAL INCLUDES $600 STIMULUS CHECK BUT NO UNEMPLOYMENT BOOST

“It’s a bad idea, and I hope he reevaluates that statement,” Manchin said, stating that $600 payments to everyone would mean people with jobs would be getting government assistance. He believes that instead, the government should focus on devoting resources to the unemployed.

Manchin’s fellow Democrats have opposed liability protection for small businesses. Manchin addressed the arguments for both sides.

“There’s nobody that wants a business to be litigated out of business,” he said. “On the other hand, we don’t want to throw caution to the wind that the businesses aren’t safe places to work, the workers’ not protected and the people that patronize these places of businesses are not in a safe environment.”

Manchin offered a reminder, however, that despite the difficulties lawmakers may have with this issue, granting protection would only be temporary.

“We’re not changing the tort laws forever. We’re just trying to get through an emergency period of time,” he said."

Their acceptance of the president-elect's victory comes nearly six weeks after the Nov. 3 election, as President Trump refuses to concede while making claims of widespread voter fraud that have so far been unsubstantiated.

""The Electoral College has spoken, so today I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday on the Senate floor. ""The president-elect is no stranger to the Senate. He's devoted himself to public service for many years.""

He went on to congratulate Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, saying that despite political differences, ""all Americans can take pride that our nation has a female vice president-elect for the very first time.""

""Many millions of us had hoped the presidential election would yield a different result. But our system of government has processes to determine who will be sworn in on January the 20th,"" McConnell said.

Before McConnell's speech, which began by praising Trump's accomplishments and ""tireless work,"" Senate Chaplain Barry Black mentioned Monday's Electoral College vote and asks for ""blessings"" for Biden and Harris.

Other Republicans also jumped on the congratulatory bandwagon on Monday.

""At some point, you have to face the music,"" Sen. John Thune of South Dakota told the Associated Press Monday. ""Once the Electoral College settles the issue today, it’s time for everybody to move on.""

Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, chairman of the inaugural committee, said the panel will now ""deal with Vice President Biden as the president-elect.""

REPUBLICANS BACKING TRUMP FRAUD CLAIMS EVEN AS BIDEN WINS ELECTORAL COLLEGE

Just last week, the Republicans on the inauguration committee had declined to publicly acknowledge Biden's win over Trump. Blunt said Monday’s Electoral College vote ""was significant.""

Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said barring further legal challenges, it appears Biden will be president.

""That’s sort of the nature of these elections. You got to have a winner. You got to have a loser,"" Cornyn told the AP, adding that once Trump's legal arguments are exhausted, ""Joe Biden’s on a path to be president of the United States.”

LIVE UPDATES: BIDEN ADDRESSES NATION AFTER ELECTORAL COLLEGE FORMALIZES VICTORY

Other Republican lawmakers will continue to fight election results until Jan. 6, when Congress will vote on whether or not to accept the Electoral College's results. Some have suggested that the president's legal battle should continue until the inauguration on Jan. 20.

""It’s a very, very narrow path for the president,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said. ""But having said that, I think we’ll let those legal challenges play out.""

122,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joe-biden-foul-play-hunter-tax-investigation,2,"President-elect Joe Biden defended his son Hunter Biden amid an ongoing investigation into the younger Biden’s taxes.

During an interview with Stephen Colbert that aired Thursday night, Biden sat alongside his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, and expressed ""confidence"" in his son.

In raising the subject of Hunter Biden, the liberal comedian Colbert claimed to Joe Biden that ""the people who want to make hay in Washington are going to try to use your son as as a cudgel against you.

""How do you feel about that?"" Colbert asked. ""And what do you have to say to those people?""

""I have, we have, great confidence in our son,"" Biden responded. ""I am not concerned about any accusations being made against him. It's used to get to me. I think it’s kind of foul play but look, it is what it is and he’s a grown man, he is the smartest man I know. I mean, from a pure intellectual capacity – and as long as he’s good, we’re good.""

HUNTER BIDEN’S FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS REPEATEDLY FLAGGED AS POTENTIAL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY, SENATE PROBE FOUND

The Biden transition team clarified that Biden was not referring to the investigation as ""foul play,"" but rather to Republicans who have used Hunter Biden's business dealings to go after him personally for months.

When Colbert asked how he would handle attacks from Republicans, Biden said he would be willing to work with critics because it’s what’s best for the country.

The Delaware U.S. Attorney is investigating Hunter Biden’s taxes – a probe that has been ongoing since 2018 but was only recently publicly disclosed.

Hunter Biden has a complex network of international business dealings.

His involvement with Ukranian energy company Burisma in 2014 has come under intense scrutiny, and was a repeated target of President Trump during his campaign for the 2020 presidency.

The younger Biden was paid $50,000 per month to serve on the board of Burisma, sparking concerns about the perceptions of a conflict of interest given the fact that his father was involved in U.S. policy toward Ukraine.

Hunter Biden also has connections to Chinese and Russian nationals that have raised eyebrows.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., told Fox News on Thursday that he believed Joe Biden would not interfere in the Hunter Biden investigation when he assumes the White House in January, because he ""believes in the rule of law."""
123,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-china-cyber-attack-pompeo-russia,2,"President Trump on Saturday claimed China ""may"" have been behind a massive cyberattack on U.S. government systems -- a day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the attack was ""pretty clearly"" perpetrated by Russians.

Trump downplayed the attack, dubbed by one U.S. official as ""the worst hacking case in the history of America,"" as ""far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality.""

POMPEO: RUSSIANS ARE 'PRETTY CLEARLY' BEHIND HACK OF US GOVERNMENT

""I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control,"" he tweeted. ""Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!).""

He then used the attack to fuel his claims that he did not lose the election to President-elect Joe Biden, claiming there ""could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA.""

Trump has disputed the results of the election, which has been certified as having been won by Biden, and has launched a number of mostly unsuccessful legal challenges in key swing states.

But his claim that China could have been responsible for the attack contradicts Pompeo, who on Friday linked the Kremlin to the attack.

""[T]here was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. Government systems and now it appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,"" Pompeo said on the ""Mark Levin Show.""

""This was a very significant effort, and I think it’s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,"" he said.

RUSSIA'S ALLEGED HACK OF US GOVERNMENT: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in a warning message Thursday that the hack compromised federal agencies and ""critical infrastructure"" in a sophisticated attack that was hard to detect and will be difficult to undo.

Currently, the State Department, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and elements of the Department of Defense have reported being compromised. The hack may have lasted for months, targeting Treasury and Commerce departments.

Microsoft, which has helped respond to the breach, revealed late Thursday that it had identified more than 40 government agencies, think tanks, non-governmental organizations and IT companies infiltrated by the hackers.

124,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-gop-coronavirus-stimulus-demands-georgia-senate-race,2,"President Trump in a video posted to Twitter on Tuesday night demanded that lawmakers amend the coronavirus stimulus package they passed Monday to include $2,000 checks for individuals instead of $600 checks -- while also insisting that ""wasteful and unnecessary"" items be cut from the year-end spending package that was attached to the pandemic aid.

The president, meanwhile, doubled down on his baseless claims that he won the presidential election in a ""magnificent landslide"" and attacked the two most powerful Republicans in the U.S. Senate because they've acknowledged that President-elect Biden won the election.

Trump's broadsides against his own party, unproven election claims and 11th-hour stimulus demands after essentially being absent through the entire negotiating process continued his pattern of sowing chaos in the waning days of his presidency as he's failed to publicly accept that he will be leaving the White House in less than a month.

""I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000, or $4,000 for a couple,"" Trump said in his Twitter video. ""I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation, and to send me a suitable bill or else the next administration will have to deliver a package, and maybe that administration will be me.""

Watch:

The year-end funding package, often referred to as an omnibus, was combined with the coronavirus stimulus bill as Congress raced to get out of Washington, D.C., for Christmas. The funding package was previously negotiated in Congress, while lawmakers finally came to an agreement on the coronavirus aid over the weekend. Both would have had to pass anyway, but combining them allowed it to be done in one vote.

TRUMP'S CALL FOR $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS HAILED -- BY CRITICS PELOSI, AOC, SANDERS

Some lawmakers had voiced process objections over the fact the two were combined and derisively termed the monstrous legislation the ""coronabus."" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said it ""should have been divided into well over 20 bills.""

But Trump appeared to confuse the spending package that funds the government and the coronavirus stimulus.

""A few months ago, Congress started negotiations on a new package to get urgently needed help to the American people. It's taken forever,"" Trump said. ""However, the bill they are now planning to send back to my desk is much different than anticipated. It really is a disgrace.""

Trump added: ""For example, among the more than 5,000 pages in this bill, which nobody in Congress has read because of its length and complexity -- it's called the COVID relief bill, but it has almost nothing to do with COVID.""

It's unclear at this point what Congress will do about Trump's demands. Trump did not issue a direct veto threat in his Tuesday video and still could sign the bill if lawmakers and their staffs don't come back -- although it is not clear if they will or not, according to congressional sources.

FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF, TRUMP DEMANDS CONGRESS INCREASE DIRECT PAYMENTS TO AMERICANS

Trump also has the potential, if he simply refuses to sign the ""coronabus"" and Congress doesn't send him anything more, to ""pocket veto"" the legislation. That would force Congress to essentially start the legislative process all over. It would put the government at risk of a shutdown yet again, as it is currently operating on a seven-day interim spending bill.

Democrats, meanwhile, immediately seized on Trump's check demand to attack Republicans and demand that the direct stimulus be increased to $2,000 per individual. The House plans on Thursday to try to amend the bill via unanimous consent.

""Republicans repeatedly refused to say what amount the President wanted for direct checks,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted. ""At last, the President has agreed to $2,000 — Democrats are ready to bring this to the Floor this week by unanimous consent. Let’s do it!""

""I’m in. Whaddya say, Mitch?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted. ""Let’s not get bogged down with ideological offsets and unrelated items and just DO THIS! The American people deserve it.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office did not respond to a request for comment on what the Senate may do in light of Trump's Monday video. He and other GOP lawmakers touted the stimulus deal as a triumph on Monday and Tuesday before Trump called it a ""disgrace."" The White House also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story.

PRESIDENT TRUMP GRANTS SEVERAL HIGH-PROFILE PARDONS

And the pressure on Republicans is not just from a legislative angle in Congress. Trump handed the Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia a cudgel with which to hammer their incumbent Republican opponents.

""Last night Kelly Loeffler and I left Georgia late, got up there just before midnight, we voted on this next round of COVID relief and I'm so proud to be able to bring that relief back to Georgia,"" Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., said in a video posted Tuesday, hours before Trump slammed lawmakers for sending the package to his desk.

Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for Jon Ossoff, who is the Democrat challenging Perdue, shared Trump's video with his followers.

""David Perdue is already running ads touting a COVID relief bill he had nothing to do with,"" Moussa said. ""Here’s Donald Trump ripping it apart.""

""President Trump is as ever, erratic and all over the place, but on this point, he's right. $600 is a joke,"" Ossoff himself added. ""And David Perdue, my opponent, who opposed even the first round of $1,200 checks – imagine that... And now decided he wanted to cut it down to $600 bucks when people can barely feed their families through no fault of their own.""

Many Republicans were already worried that Trump's election fraud claims could depress GOP turnout for Loeffler and Perdue, although Trump has vocally backed the two senators and even traveled to Georgia to campaign for them. The campaigns for Perdue and Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., did not respond to requests for comment on the Trump video. The Georgia Senate races will decide which party controls the body for the next two years and to what extent Republicans can thwart Biden's agenda.

In a separate video Tuesday, Trump continued his false claims that ""we won the election by a landslide, we won it big."" He repeated a number of claims that have been pushed by fringe allies of his, including lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, whose election-related lawsuits have been uniformly rejected by the courts.

WHY HOUSE SPLIT THE CORONAVIRUS AND OMNIBUS PACKAGE INTO TWO VOTES, AND WHAT IT MAY MEAN FOR NEXT CONGRESS

Trump concluded, ""We cannot allow a completely fraudulent election to stand.""

Trump's allegations of voter fraud have been putting Republicans in a tight spot, forcing them to choose between supporting the president's unsubstantiated claims or risking his Twitter ire.

And no Republicans are immune from it. In the past week, Trump has lambasted the top two Republicans in the Senate for accepting the result of the presidential election -- that Biden won.

After McConnell congratulated Biden on his victory, Trump last week said in a tweet that McConnell ""and Republican Senators have to get tougher.""

Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., meanwhile, previously said that ""it's time for everybody to move on"" from the election challenges and to accept Biden's victory. Asked Monday about the prospects for success of a challenge in Congress to Biden's Electoral College victory, which Trump has endorsed, Thune said it will be ""going down like a shot dog.""

That led Trump to declare that Thune's time in the Senate is limited.

""Republicans in the Senate so quickly forget. Right now they would be down 8 seats without my backing them in the last Election. RINO John Thune, 'Mitch’s boy', should just let it play out,"" Trump said in a tweet Tuesday. ""South Dakota doesn’t like weakness. He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!""

Thune's office has not publicly responded to the Trump tweet.

Trump will leave office on Jan. 20 when Biden is inaugurated, at least somewhat easing the pressure on the GOP to back his erratic behavior. But he has already hinted that he would run for president in 2024, which could freeze the field of presidential candidates and force Republicans to continue to be accountable to Trump or else risk losing his base.

Fox News reported Tuesday that Bill Stepien, Trump's reelection campaign manager, and other top Trump campaign members are setting up a political consulting firm that will likely work with Trump as he continues to wield his influence over the GOP even after he leaves office.

125,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-grants-15-pardons-5-commutations,2,"President Trump issued full pardons to 15 individuals and commuted part or all of the sentences of an additional five people, the White House announced Tuesday.

Included in the list are Duncan Hunter, a former GOP congressman from California, Chris Collins, a former GOP representative from New York and Trump campaign advisor George Papadapoulous.

The pardons and commutations came at the recommendation of Trump allies in Congress and in the media, and at the recommendation of Alice Johnson, whose sentence was commuted at the request of Kim Kardashian.

Papadapoulous had been convicted of making false statements during the Mueller investigation.

He was sentenced to 14 days in prison and a $9,500 fine for lying to the FBI during Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, after he pleaded guilty to misleading federal investigators about his meetings with Russia-connected Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud.

TRUMP THREATENS TO VETO MASSIVE COVID BILL

The White House said Tuesday Papadapoulous had been charged with a ""process-related crime"" even though ""Mueller stated in his report that he found no evidence of collusion in connection with Russia’s attempts to interfere in the election.""

Alex van der Zwaan, who also pleaded guilty to lying to Mueller investigators and was sentenced to 30 days in prison, received a pardon from the president.

Meanwhile Hunter, a Trump ally, was sentenced to 11 months in prison and three years of supervised probation after he plead guilty to a corruption charge.

The Republican abruptly pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds last December after arguing for more than a year that the criminal charges brought against him and his wife were a ""witch hunt.""

Hunter’s wife, Margaret Hunter, also was charged in the case and in June accepted a plea deal that called for her to testify against her husband. The couple could have faced decades in prison before the plea deals.

Federal prosecutors said the couple spent more than $250,000 in campaign money for golf outings, family vacations to Italy and Hawaii, tequila shots and airline tickets for their pet rabbit.

Collins in January was sentenced to 26 months in jail for securities fraud.

Federal investigators said Collins provided non-public information about biotechnology company Innate -- where he sat on the board -- to his son Cameron, tipping him off in June 2017 that a drug the company was working on had failed a clinical trial so that Cameron could sell his shares before the stock price went down.

The president also pardoned four Blackwater guards who had been convicted in connection with the killing of Iraqi civilians while working as contractors in 2007.

One of the guards, Nicholas Slatten, had been sentenced to life in prison for his in the killing of 17 Iraqi civilians in Nisour Square in Baghdad. The other guards included Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard.

The pardon had come at the recommendation of a handful of GOP House members.

""On appeal, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that additional evidence should have been presented at Mr. Slatten’s trial. Further, prosecutors recently disclosed—more than 10 years after the incident—that the lead Iraqi investigator, who prosecutors relied heavily on to verify that there were no insurgent victims and to collect evidence, may have had ties to insurgent groups himself,"" the White House reasoned.

Other pardons included Pittsburgh dentist Alfonso Costa, who pleaded guilty to health care fraud related to billing and 89-year-old Alfred Crum, who pleaded guilty to helping illegally distill moonshine in 1952.

Trump also commuted the sentence of Crystal Munoz, who had served 12 years in prison for marijuana distribution, at the request of Alice Johnson among others, and Tynice Nichole Hall, who had served 14 years in prison of her 18 year sentence for allowing her apartment to be used to distribute drugs. Trump had commuted her term of incarceration after her fourteenth year in prison.

Also with the support of Johnson, Trump commuted the remainder of Judith Negron's supervised release. She was sentenced to 35 years for her role as a minority-owner of a healthcare company engaged in a scheme to defraud the federal government.

Trump also pardoned Weldon Angelos, who was sentenced to 55 years in prison for selling marijuana and carrying a handgun while doing so, and Otis Gordon, who was convicted of possession with intent to distribute.

Trump commuted the sentence of Steve Stockman on ""humanitarian and compassionate grounds,"" as Stockman is 64 and has pre-existing health conditions that put him at risk for Covid-19. A former U.S. representative from Texas, Stockman served two years of a 10-year sentence after he was convicted of misuse of charitable funds. He will still have to pay $1,000,000 restitution.

At the request of more than 100 members of Congress, Trump pardoned Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, Border Patrol agents who were convicted after Ramos shot an undocumented immigrant thought to be trafficking marijuana.

In order to put forward a unanimous consent request during a pro forma session, as the House was in Thursday, the speaker and the leaders of both the minority and majority must agree.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., who said Democrats' proposal was ""consistent"" with Trump's request, was present to represent Democrats while Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., represented Republicans. Each side blocked the others' attempts to bring unanimous consent requests.

The brief and unfruitful exchange of political barbs came as it's still unclear whether Trump will veto the original piece of legislation. Even as he attacked it Tuesday he did not explicitly say he'd veto it.

Trump on Tuesday night released a scathing video in which he called panned $600 stimulus checks for Americans as too small, saying the number should instead be $2,000.

He also demanded that ""wasteful and unnecessary"" spending – Trump specifically listed foreign aid to several countries, along with a few other line-items – be cut from the year-end spending package which lawmakers married to the coronavirus aid so it could all be passed in one vote.

TRUMP PUTS GOP ON ITS HEELS WITH 11TH HOUR STIMULUS DEMANDS, THROWS WRENCH IN GEORGIA SENATE RACE

""A few months ago, Congress started negotiations on a new package to get urgently needed help to the American people. It's taken forever,"" Trump said. ""However, the bill they are now planning to send back to my desk is much different than anticipated. It really is a disgrace.""

Some lawmakers, especially in the House Freedom Caucus, voiced process objections to the way the monstrous, 5,000-page-plus legislation was moved through Congress in one fell swoop, saying it should have been split into several votes. Trump, however, appeared to confuse the reason for why the spending and the stimulus came to his desk at the same time.

But that nuance mattered little to Democrats. They immediately seized on Trump's comments to taunt Republicans and call for them to get on board with the $2,000 checks, which many in the GOP opposed throughout the monthslong coronavirus negotiations process from which the president was largely absent.

MCCONNELL SILENT AFTER TRUMP THREATENS TO BLOCK CORONAVIRUS, GOVERNMENT FUNDING PACKAGE

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., swiftly announced plans to bring a stand-alone piece of legislation to the House floor Thursday in a pro forma session, to boost the stimulus checks to $2,000. By asking for unanimous consent to pass it essentially dared House Republicans to object — which they did.

""Mr. President, sign the bill to keep government open! Urge McConnell and McCarthy to agree with the Democratic unanimous consent request for $2,000 direct payments! This can be done by noon on Christmas Eve!"" Pelosi tweeted Wednesday.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Wednesday evening responded by announcing Republicans would put forward their own unanimous consent request on foreign aid.

""[B]y waiting days before Christmas, Speaker Pelosi tried to use the American people as leverage to make coronavirus relief contingent on government funding — which includes billions of foreign aid at a time when there are urgent needs at home,"" McCarthy said in a letter to GOP lawmakers.

He added: ""House Democrats appear to be suffering from selective hearing. They have conveniently ignored the concerns expressed by the President, and shared by our constituents, that we ought to reexamine how our tax dollars are spent overseas while so many of our neighbors at home are struggling to make ends meet. Thus, Republicans will offer a unanimous consent request to revisit the State and Foreign Operations title of the Omnibus so that we can fully address the concerns at hand.""

Pelosi's office did not respond to a request for comment on McCarthy's plans made Wednesday night.

TRUMP HEADS TO MAR-A-LAGO FOR CHRISTMAS WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDING, CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE IN LIMBO

The floor stalemate Thursday leaves lawmakers and the president right where they were when Trump first released his Twitter video on the stimulus and spending Tuesday night.

Even if one or both of the unanimous-consent requests had passed the House, both would have highly uncertain prospects of succeeding in the GOP-controlled Senate.

The office for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., did not respond to a request for comment on McCarthy's letter sent Wednesday night. It also did not respond to requests for comment on Pelosi's request and Trump's video asking for $2,000 checks.

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., objected to an effort to make the checks in the just-passed stimulus bill $1,200 instead of $600, so it is nearly certain that he or another Senate Republican would have scuttled that unanimous consent request if it did make it to the Senate.

The political maneuvering in the House comes as Trump, who departed D.C. for Mar-a-Lago Wednesday, is also bringing a government shutdown back into the equation by not signing the funding package. The government is currently operating on a one-week spending bill that was mean to keep the lights on just long enough for the president to sign the omnibus legislation that would fund the government for the next year.

Further, unemployment benefits for many Americans are set to run out the day after Christmas. Multiple other pandemic-related benefits, including an eviction moratorium, are set to run out before the end of the year. The House is set on Monday to revisit the interim spending bill to make it last into the new year, which could potentially avert a shutdown if the interim bill makes it through the Senate and the president agrees to sign it.

Trump on Tuesday did not issue an explicit veto threat on the spending and stimulus, so some are still hopeful that the president will sign the legislation as is. But he could also utilize a rare ""pocket veto,"" holding on to the legislation and refusing to act on it.

That would force Congress to essentially restart the legislative process on the stimulus and spending back at square one.

127,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/christmas-year-despair-truth-greg-laurie,2,"As we approach the end of 2020, our nation’s mental health is the worst it has been in decades. That’s not my opinion — it’s the findings of a recent report from Gallup, which has asked Americans about the state of their mental health since 2001.

This year, nearly one-fourth of Americans rated their mental health as ""fair"" or ""poor,"" the most significant decline in our country’s psychological well being on record.

The sad truth is these findings won’t surprise anyone who has lived through 2020. A global pandemic, social unrest, an economic downturn, a polarizing election: you name it. This year has thrown us a litany of challenges that would burden anyone’s mental well being.

Even as we hear news that a vaccine for the coronavirus is now available — a veritable Christmas miracle! —it may take months before it reaches the average person.

JACK GRAHAM: CHRISTMAS 2020 MAY NOT BE A TRADITIONALLY HAPPY ONE, BUT HERE ARE 3 WAYS TO MAKE IT JOYFUL

Doctors have warned we still face a ""very dark winter"" ahead, leading one commentator to pronounce on national news, ""Christmas is probably not going to be possible this year.""

If you ask me, it seems all America wants for Christmas is some hope.

The good news is Christmas was meant to be celebrated exactly in the kind of hopeless moment we are living through.

I have found that the greatest moments of Christmas are not the ones we get psyched about. Rather, it’s those in-between moments when we are present with another.

You see, 2,000 years ago on the first Christmas things looked pretty bleak too. The Jewish people were under Roman occupation. This is not the way things were supposed to be: God had said they would live freely and prosper in the land he had promised to their forefathers.

Worst yet, they had not heard from God in a long time — not one solitary miracle, not one angelic appearance and no mighty prophet thundering the word from the Lord. Just an apparent icy silence from Heaven.

Then one night when no one was expecting it the heavens lit up as a host of angels sang, ""Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.""

We know how the rest of the story goes: God had come to his people in the form of a baby. Jesus Christ, the savior of the world, was born in the humble town of Bethlehem.

In the middle of a dark chapter in the story of Israel, God was reminding his people that everything was right on schedule — his schedule.

The birth of Jesus was the advent of hope to a world that had been weary and burdened for a long time. As the classic Christmas hymn says:

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices

For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees

O hear the angels' voices

O night divine

O night when Christ was born.

The birth of Jesus still offers a thrill of hope to everyone seeking comfort from a weary world.

It is true, Christmas probably will look very different this year: no malls packed with shoppers, no big parties at work with the dreaded, obligatory white elephant gift exchange game and no crazy holiday traffic (thank you very much). Depending on where you live, even caroling may be discouraged.

But we shouldn’t miss the silver lining running through all of this: Covid-19 has reminded us what Christmas is really all about.

""‘Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel’ (which means, God with us),"" says the Gospel of Matthew.

If you think about it, Christmas is about God undoing our loneliness. At a time when people feel so isolated and abandoned, the promise of God’s presence is indeed good news.

This is why over the years I have found that the greatest moments of Christmas are not the ones we get psyched about. Rather, it’s those in-between moments when we are present with another.

These moments are especially shared with family and not only our actual flesh-and-blood families but also the family of God. The Gallup poll I mentioned earlier found that the only group that didn’t report a negative change in their mental health were people who attended church regularly.

So wherever you are this Christmas, know that Immanuel, God’s healing, loving and comforting presence, is available to you right now.

Hope has a name, and it’s Jesus Christ.

128,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/marco-rubio-2000-stimulus-check,2,"Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on Monday voiced support for $2,000 stimulus checks, diverging from some of his Republican Senate colleagues.

The House on Monday passed a measure in the $900 billion COVID-19 relief package that President Trump signed on Sunday night to give Americans making up to $75,000 direct payments of $2,000 – rather than an initial proposal of $600 – but it is unclear whether the Senate will vote to do the same.

""I agree with the [p]resident that millions of working-class families are in dire need of additional relief, which is why I support $2,000 in direct payments to Americans struggling due to the pandemic,"" Rubio said in a Monday statement.

Rubio went on to blame Democrats for rejecting Republican attempts to ""pass additional relief for workers, families, and small businesses...at every turn.""

BERNIE SANDERS, SENATE DEMS SEE DEFENSE BILL VETO OVERRIDE AS AVENUE TO $2G CHECKS

""Remember, months ago Speaker Pelosi and Democrats rejected the Administration’s previous offer of $1,200 per adult and $1,000 per child. Thankfully, she’s finally stopped holding working families hostage,"" Rubio said.

He continued: ""I share many of my colleagues’ concern about the long-term effects of additional spending, but we cannot ignore the fact that millions of working-class families across the nation are still in dire need of relief. Congress should quickly pass legislation to increase direct payments to Americans to $2,000.""

It is now up to the Senate to vote on the measure that Trump has been pushing for since last week, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not publicly stated how he plans to address the issue.

Rubio will also introduce legislation to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act so that it continues to protect small businesses and companies that promote free speech on the Internet but takes away ""immunity"" for certain Big Tech platforms that moderate certain content, according to a press release.

Section 230 offers liability protections to websites that allow third-party users to post content on their platforms.

""I also stand ready to work with my colleagues to make much-needed changes to Section 230 and take steps to ensure the American people can once again have confidence in our elections,"" Rubio said.

WHEN CAN ELIGIBLE AMERICANS EXPECT TO SEE CHECKS?

President Trump last week vetoed the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 after warning he would do so if it didn’t repeal Section 230. The House on Monday voted to override the veto."
129,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/josh-hawley-to-object-electoral-college-certification-jan-6,2,"Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., on Wednesday became the first Republican senator to publicly say he will object to the certification of the presidential election results when a joint session of Congress meets in one week to formally certify President-elect Joe Biden's 306-232 Electoral College victory over President Trump.

Roughly a dozen Trump supporters in the House – led by Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama – have said they will challenge the slate of electors from six battleground states where Biden narrowly edged Trump in last month's election. But the challenge of at least one senator is needed for both houses of Congress to debate the objections.

GROWING NUMBER OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO CHALLENGE BIDEN'S VICTORY OVER TRUMP

Hawley, a conservative lawmaker and Trump supporter, said in a release issued Wednesday that in his objection he’ll highlight what he said was the failure of some states – most notably Pennsylvania – to follow their own election laws. A number of states – including Pennsylvania – allowed for a greater use of absentee balloting due to serious health concerns over in-person voting at polling stations amid the coronavirus pandemic.

""I cannot vote to certify the electoral college results on January 6 without raising the fact that some states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws,"" the senator highlighted in a statement.

Hawley also charged, ""I cannot vote to certify without pointing out the unprecedented effort of mega corporations, including Facebook and Twitter, to interfere in this election, in support of Joe Biden. At the very least, Congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the integrity of our elections. But Congress has so far failed to act.""

He pointed out that ""following both the 2004 and 2016 elections, Democrats in Congress objected during the certification of electoral votes in order to raise concerns about election integrity. They were praised by Democratic leadership and the media when they did. And they were entitled to do so. But now those of us concerned about the integrity of this election are entitled to do the same.""

PENCE APPARENTLY DOESN'T BACK LAWMAKER'S PLAN TO OBJECT TO ELECTION RESULTS

The president has repeatedly claimed he beat Biden, who topped the president by more than 7 million votes. Trump has charged that widespread voter fraud aided Biden’s victory. Trump has unsuccessfully urged states with GOP governors or Republican controlled legislatures to overturn Biden’s victories in their states. And dozens of legal challenges by the president and his allies have been shot down. Plus, Attorney General William Barr, who has since stepped down, said last month that his Justice Department has not seen fraud on the kind of scale that could flip the election.

Trump met at the White House last week for a strategy session with some of the House Republicans who have said they will object to the election certification.

Senate GOP leaders are against this effort to challenge Biden's win, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recognizing the former vice president’s victory, and behind closed doors urging Senate Republicans not to contest the election results.

But with Hawley joining the small group of House Republicans in objecting, the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6 would be dissolved and the House and Senate would then meet separately for two hours to debate a contested state’s electoral vote.

US DOWN A RABBIT HOLE OF QUESTIONING ELECTION INTEGRITY

Each body would then vote whether to accept or reject that state’s slate of electoral votes. Then the House and Senate reconvene in the joint session. The last time this happened (and only the second time in U.S. history) was in January 2005, following President’ George W. Bush’s narrow reelection victory over Democratic challenger Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. One Senate Democrat – Sen. Barbara Boxer of California – and one House Democrat – Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones – objected. In 2017, a handful of House Democrats objected to Trump’s victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, but no Senate Democrats joined them.

A state’s slate of electoral votes would only tossed if both the House and Senate vote to do so.

But with the Democrats controlling the House and most Senate Republicans not expected to back the push to contest the results, it’s extremely unlikely there would be enough votes to reject any state’s certification.

While Hawley is the first GOP senator to say he’d object to the certification, Senator-elect Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Sen. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas could potentially join their colleague from Missouri.

https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-york-times-cancel-culture-teenage-revenge-cheerleader-racial-slur-video?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral",2,"There’s a story in the New York Times this week that everyone should read in order to get a full grasp of how out of control and scary the race-baiting monsters of the so-called “Social Justice movement” can be.

The article, headlined, “Slur, Surfacing on Old Video, Alters Young Lives and a Town,” tells the tale of a white high school student in Virginia who saw her future as an athlete at a major university go up in smoke after one of her peers, who is biracial, shared online a years-old video of the first student casually using the N-word.

Jimmy Galligan, the black student, chillingly says at the very end of the story, “I’m going to remind myself, you started something. You taught someone a lesson.”

The New York Times frames the depressing affair in the context of our never-ending nightmare that the media have dubbed a “racial reckoning,” when really it’s about the havoc caused by “social justice” advocates who intimidate and harass innocent people while claiming the moral high ground.

Mimi Groves, the white student, had sent a three-second video to a friend on Snapchat, wherein Groves, after getting her learner’s permit, is seen saying, “I can drive,” followed by the N-word.

The video was recorded in 2016, when Groves was a high school freshman. It wasn’t until three years later, when both Groves and Galligan were seniors and Groves herself was calling for racial justice for black people, that Galligan received the clip from a friend.

“He tucked the video away, deciding to post it publicly when the time was right,” the New York Times said. It wasn’t until after protests for the death of George Floyd were underway that Galligan decided it was time to blow up Groves’s dreams of attending the University of Tennessee, which had sent her an acceptance letter and granted her a spot on the school’s cheerleading team.

“Mr. Galligan, who had waited until Ms. Groves had chosen a college, had publicly posted the video that afternoon,” the story said. “Within hours, it had been shared to Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter, where furious calls mounted for the University of Tennessee to revoke its admission offer.”

The university, in response, removed Groves from the cheer team and told her she should reconsider enrolling. She withdrew her acceptance and ended up attending an online community college.

The incident, the New York Times said, revealed a “complex portrait of behavior that for generations had gone unchecked in schools in one of the nation’s wealthiest counties, where Black students said they had long been subjected to ridicule.”

Nonsense. Galligan wasn’t ridiculed by Groves. He wasn’t the intended recipient of the video, which he didn’t even see until three years after it was recorded.

Galligan’s intentions were rotten, as was revealed in the story when he describes how he confronted his father, who is white, after he had used the N-word. “A few years ago, he said his father said it aloud,” the New York Times said, “prompting Mr. Galligan and his sister to quietly take him aside and explain that it was unacceptable, even when joking around.”

Why couldn’t Galligan have done the exact same thing for Groves? That question is also answered in the story by a black student who had defended Groves during the uproar. “We’re supposed to educate people,” she wrote on a social media post, “not ruin their lives all because you want to feel a sense of empowerment.”

That’s what “social justice” advocates do — tear people down in order to feel morally superior. It’s sick.

In the story, Groves is exceedingly embarrassed and apologetic for the video she sent on Snapchat. But what she did in private was not even nearly as offensive as what Galligan did to her in public."
131,https://www.foxnews.com/us/wis-hospital-intentionally-covid-19-vaccine,2,"A Wisconsin-based hospital on Wednesday said an employee who removed 57 vials of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine from the refrigerator earlier this week which resulted in 500 doses being discarded, acted intentionally.

In a statement to Fox News, Advocate Aurora Health said it was led to believe the act was an error, but the employee in question ""today acknowledged that they intentionally removed the vaccine from refrigeration.""

The employee is no longer with the company, it said.

""We continue to believe that vaccination is our way out of the pandemic,"" the company said. ""We are more than disappointed that this individual's action will result in a delay of more than 500 people receiving their vaccine.""

Aurora officials initially said the employee at the Aurora Medical Center in Grafton forgot to put the vials back in refrigeration after removing them. Each vial contained 10 doses of the vaccine, according to local reports.

The former employee's actions were ""a violation of our core values"" and have been reported to authorities for further investigation, the company said."
132,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/perdue-says-trump-call-with-georgia-secretary-of-state-wont-affect-runoff,2,"Sen. David Perdue, one of two Republicans in Georgia fighting to keep their seats in a tight runoff election, said Sunday that he doesn't believe President Trump’s leaked phone call with the state's top election official will have any bearing on Tuesday’s election.

The Washington Post obtained the voice audio of a phone call between Trump and Georgia’s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. At one point during the conversation, Trump reportedly said, ""All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state.""

Georgia certified election results shows Joe Biden won the state by 11,779 votes. Trump said Biden only won because of fraud and called on interventions from state officials that have yielded no major changes. The ballots were counted three times, including a mandatory hand count and a Trump-requested recount.

Trump’s critics seized on the phone call as evidence that the president was pressuring an election official to interfere, while Trump supporters said the fact that the audio was leaked shows the contempt that Georgia's secretary of state’s office has towards the president.

Perdue, who was a guest on ""The Next Revolution,"" said he was ""shocked"" that a member of the Republican Party would tape a sitting president and leak it to the media.

""It’s disgusting in my view,"" he said. ""But what the president said is exactly what he’s been saying the last few months.""

Perdue said that Trump has been consistent with his claims that there were voter irregularities and said Trump just ""wants some answers.""

Perdue, who is facing Democrat Jon Ossoff in the runoff election, said earlier Sunday that he supports the Republican senators who announced they will contest the electoral votes from several states during a joint session of Congress later this week.

GOP SENATORS WANT ELECTION COMMISSION SIMILAR TO WHAT DECIDED DISPUTED 1876 RACE

Sen. Kelly Loeffler, the other Republican in the state facing Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock, said she hadn’t decided whether to join Republican colleagues in challenging the legitimacy of Biden’s victory over Trump when Congress meets Wednesday to affirm Biden’s 306-232 vote win in the Electoral College.

Both candidates have been supported by Trump.

Perdue pointed out that he has already called on Raffensperger to resign. He said the secretary of state’s office and the state’s legislature both failed to answer Trump’s questions about voter fraud in the state.

Steve Hilton, the host of the show, pointed out that Trump was set to campaign in Georgia on Monday and Perdue said he welcomes the support.

""He’s going to call his faithful out here,"" Perdue said. He said that Trump is going to remind voters in Georgia that the future of the country is in their hands.

""The people of Georgia will determine the future direction of the country. He’s going to remind them of that,"" he said.

Biden is also due to campaign in Georgia on Monday, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris stumped in Garden City, Georgia, on Sunday, slamming Trump for the call.""It was a bald, bald-faced, bold abuse of power by the president of the United States.""

Those numbers were more than half of the record-setting 4.9 million total voters in the state who cast in the general election.

Both Georgia Senate seats – and control of the chamber – will be up for grabs on Tuesday as Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler aim to hold off Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.

REP. COLLINS EXPECTS GEORGIA GOP ELECTION DAY TURNOUT TO COUNTER DEMS' EARLY VOTING ADVANTAGE

The runoff elections have gripped national attention and were necessary after no candidate won more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election.

Democrats are optimistic based on early-voting numbers. Figures showed that Black voters made up a larger percentage of the early-voting electorate than in November’s general election.

Meanwhile, hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on ads in what are likely to be two of the most expensive months of nonpresidential politics in American history. If Republicans win one or both of those seats, the party will retain a slim majority in the Senate.

With Democrats already having control of the House and the White House after November's election, Loeffler told ""Fox News Sunday"" that Democratic victories this week would result in drastic changes in Washington.

134,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ossoff-perdue-georgia-runoff-elections,2,"Democrat Jon Ossoff defeated Republican former Sen. David Perdue in a bitterly contentious Senate race in Georgia, a win that along with Rev. Raphael Warnock's defeat of GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler secures the Democrats' control in the upper chamber of Congress, Fox News projected Wednesday.

Ossoff, a 33-year-old media executive, won a runoff election against Perdue, the one-term senator and former Fortune 500 CEO, who at 71 is more than twice Ossoff's age. The November Election Day result failed to give either candidate a majority, forcing Tuesday's rematch.

Ossoff claimed victory Wednesday morning, before the Fox News projected him to be the winner. Warnock was declared the winner over Loeffler early Wednesday morning by Fox News, The Associated Press and other news outlets. Loeffler has not yet conceded.

""It is with humility that I thank the people of Georgia for electing me to serve in the Senate,"" Ossoff said in brief remarks delivered virtually.

He pledged to serve all Americans.

""Whether you were for me or against me, I will be for you in the U.S. Senate,"" he said. ""I will serve all of the people in this state. I will give everything I've got.""

In a statement issued shortly after 2 a.m. ET, Perdue's campaign said the race was ""exceptionally close"" but predicted victory.

""As we've said repeatedly over the last several weeks and as recently as this evening, this is an exceptionally close election that will require time and transparency to be certain the results are fair and accurate and the voices of Georgians are heard,"" the Perdue campaign said.

With Warnock and Ossoff’s wins, the Senate is deadlocked with 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as the tie-breaking vote for Democrats. But Democrats still need to get their entire caucus on board to remove the 60-vote filibuster to end debate on most legislation, which is no sure thing.

Perdue narrowly missed defeating Ossoff in November's election, falling short of the 50% threshold needed for victory. In that race, Perdue topped by Ossoff by 88,098 votes, 49.73% to 47.95%, with Libertarian Shane Hazel pulling in 115,039 votes.

Perdue was at a disadvantage when it came to fundraising. Ossoff was the best-funded candidate of all time for a single congressional election. Through Dec. 16, the latest FEC filings available, Ossoff raised $138.3 million and Perdue raised $89.1 million.

OSSOFF: HERE'S MY MESSAGE FOR PEACH STATE REPUBLICANS

Perdue hit his opponent for his heavy out-of-state donations, saying that Ossoff ""raised twice as much money in California as he did in the state of Georgia.""

""The people in Georgia do not like people in California and New York coming down here trying to tell us how to run our state,"" Perdue told ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday, calling liberal-run New York and California ""failed states.""

Ossoff’s top contributors include employees at Google's parent company Alphabet who contributed $952,685. Apple employees donated $295,794, Microsoft workers gave $275,864; Amazon employees donated $255,115; and Facebook workers shelled out $225,313, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Perdue’s top contributors include employees at Delta Airlines who contributed $130,779. Home Depot employees gave $108,419, and Goldman Sachs employees contributed $86,225, according to the research group.

The Georgia runoffs have been some of the most expensive two months of nonpresidential politics in American history. The total ad spending in the two races reached nearly $500 million.

That's about the amount of spending of an average presidential campaign.

WHO IS JON OSSOFF? 4 THINGS TO KNOW

It's rare that voters head to the polls for a congressional race knowing there are such high stakes. It’s not usually clear that such races will determine the balance of power in either chamber when they cast their votes on the same day as other states.

Ossoff promised to ""take power away from Mitch McConnell"" if he won, and he hit his opponent for ""profiting off the pandemic.""

In a viral moment during the only debate, Ossoff said, ""Perhaps Sen. Perdue would have been able to respond properly to the COVID-19 pandemic if you hadn't been fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading. It's not just that you're a crook, senator, it's that you're attacking the health of the people that you represent.""

Perdue later pulled out of the final debate to campaign with President Trump. Ossoff hit his opponent as ""too much of a coward"" to debate him.

""Perdue is a dime-a-dozen politician, up to his neck in the corruption that taints both political parties, whose bank accounts are stacked with corporate cash. I assure you Perdue would never admit that,"" Ossoff wrote in an op-ed for Fox News Digital. ""The point isn't Democrats against Republicans. It's The People against Crooks – crooks who are lining their pockets in office while they refuse to fight for the people.""

In addition to staking out his position as a force against a ""socialist takeover,"" Perdue repeatedly accused Ossoff of concealing financial ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

Insight TWI, the media company of which Ossoff serves as CEO, received up to $5,000 from PCCW Media Limited, a Hong-Kong based media company, to produce an ISIS war crime documentary. The Chinese government is an 18.4% shareholder in PCCW through the Chinese state-owned Assets Supervision & Administration Commission, and PCCW's chairman, Richard Li, opposes the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement.

135,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/electoral-college-objections-congress-what-to-know,2,"The House and Senate will convene at 1 p.m. Wednesday for a joint session of Congress to certify President-elect Joe Biden's electoral win, and a group of GOP lawmakers intends to raise objections to the results.

The traditional tally of the electoral results from each state is the final stage in the selection of an American president. It's normally a lackluster procedure, but President Trump has changed that by calling on his GOP allies in Congress to fight for him until the bitter end.

A good number have stood with Trump, but other Republicans have blasted the last gasp of resistance as detrimental to democracy and counter to the U.S. Constitution.

""To challenge a state’s certification, given how specific the Constitution is, would be a violation of my oath of office—that is not something I am willing to do and is not something Oklahomans would want me to do,"" Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said in a statement Tuesday in announcing he will be accepting Biden's win.

On the other end of the divided Republican Party are lawmakers who are responding to the frustrations of voters who continue to believe that the election was stolen from Trump. More demonstrations are planned in Washington, D.C., and Trump is expected to address the crowds at 11 a.m.

Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., have said at least 100 House Republicans are supporting the objections. In the Senate, at least 13 Republicans have said they'll object to the results in some fashion, with Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, leading the way.

LOEFFLER TO OBJECT TO CERTIFICATION OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS

""I don't know the outcome, but I think it's worth fighting for,"" Greene told Fox News of the final effort to stop the certification.

Greene hopes the objections will set off a debate in Congress over the allegations of voter fraud that courts thus far have not taken up. Greene spoke to Trump about election irregularities abroad Air Force One when she accompanied him to a rally in Georgia Monday night.

""It's our duty to object,"" Greene said. ""... The American people deserve to at least start to hear the evidence of fraud.""

To prepare for the debate, the House Judiciary Committee GOP staff prepared a 41-page memo outlining alleged electoral problems in six states, such as making mail-in ballots more readily available during the coronavirus pandemic.

""The last-minute push for all-mail in voting in many states, coupled with moves to erase long-standing safeguards for mail-in voting, created conditions ripe for election administration errors or election-related crimes,"" the memo obtained by Fox News states.

House Republicans are preparing to object to the electoral votes in at least six states that Biden won -- Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada. As of Tuesday afternoon, it was unclear how many states would get support from a senator, which is necessary for any debate to begin.

Cruz will object to Arizona, with a focus on creating an Electoral College commission to audit the results and not necessarily for setting aside the election results, according to a source familiar. Hawley has narrowed in on Pennsylvania. And Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who was projected to lose her Georgia Senate seat to Democrat Raphael Warnock after Tuesday's election, was expected to object to certification in Georgia.

GOP SENATORS 'STILL DISCUSSING' WHICH STATES TO OBJECT TO DURING JAN. 6 ELECTORAL COLLEGE CERTIFICATION

Biden won the Electoral College vote 306-232, but Trump has refused to concede and has instead repeated unproven allegations of widespread vote fraud that have been rejected by the Supreme Court, his attorney general, state election officials and dozens of other courts.

Some Democrats have objected to election results in the past when GOP presidents have won, but they've come out strong against this last-ditch effort.

Rep. Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader, says Trump's ongoing claims of voter fraud are ""seditious"" and blasted Republican leaders who have refused to acknowledge that Biden won the election fair and square.

TRUMP PUTS PRESSURE ON PENCE AHEAD OF ELECTION SHOWDOWN IN CONGRESS

""They have cavalierly supported by their silence, or by their active participation the president's false claim -- his, in many ways, seditious claim -- that the vote was not fair,"" Hoyer said Tuesday. ""...It's a tragedy that they have done so.""

Here are some things to know before the Joint Session convenes:

VP Mike Pence will play a ceremonial role

When the House and Senate meet together Wednesday at 1 p.m., Vice President Mike Pence is expected to preside over the Joint Session of Congress.

Trump has placed pressure on Pence to help him out during this process, insisting that Pence has the power to object to ballots and telling a Georgia crowd Monday that he hopes Pence ""comes through for us.""

But regardless of how much the president turns up the volume on his vice president, White House officials tell Fox News that Pence will ""follow the law"" on Wednesday.

The electoral votes will be brought into the House chamber in mahogany boxes.

Pence will begin the tally of votes from each state in alphabetical order starting with Alabama and then Alaska.

The first expected objection is to come from Arizona, where Biden won.

Objections only work if there's support from both a senator and a representative.

Under the Electoral Count Act, a petitioner from both the House and Senate are required to challenge a state’s slate of electoral votes, and the objection must be in writing.

Cruz has indicated he'll join the House in objecting to Arizona, according to a source familiar. Cruz has led a group of about a dozen senators who say they would object to the certification of the Electoral College results unless there was an emergency 10-day audit of the results by an electoral commission. Cruz is expected to raise the Electoral College commission issue -- but not settling aside the election results altogether.

The debate is slated for two hours with Democrats and Republicans taking turns talking.

Once there is a joint objection, the senators will go back to their chamber, and the House will stay in its chamber to debate the merits of that state's electors.

Members will have a five-minute speaking limit.

Democrats have former impeachment managers leading their debate.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tapped Rep. Adam Schiff, chair of the Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, chair of the House Administration Committee, to lead to Democratic response. Both are former impeachment managers.

Others prepared to lead the debate are Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a constitutional law professor, and Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., who sits on the Judiciary Committee.

Democrats who represent the state that is being challenged will also speak in defense of the validity of the election results.

A vote of both the majority of the House and Senate is needed to throw out a state's slate of electors.

After the debate, the House and Senate will both vote on whether to accept that state's electors.

It's a roll call vote that will document how each lawmaker stands on each state's electors.

It takes both the House and Senate to reject a state’s electoral votes. If that happens, the electoral slate just disappears. It would be as though Arizona never voted.

This could take a very, very long time.

After the votes on that particular state, the House and Senate resume jointly again and begin the tally for the rest of the states.

If there is another joint objection, the House and Senate separate again for another two hours of debate and a vote on that contested state.

The time needed to separate, debate and vote on each state could be three to four hours.

The process repeats itself until all the states are counted.

The votes are not on Trump's side

Since Democrats control the House and enough Republicans in both the House and Senate accept that Trump lost the election, these objections are a longshot effort.

At the end of the process, Biden and Kamala Harris are expected to be certified as the next president and vice president of the United States.

Their inauguration would be on Jan. 20.

136,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcconnell-trump-election-claims-sweeping-conspiracy-theories,2,"Noting that the presidential election was ""not unusually close,"" Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged his colleagues not to object to the electoral vote count.

The Senate leader, between a series of emotional remarks, said that the vote to certify the Electoral College results was the most important vote in his 36 years in office.

""Our nation deserves a lot better than this,"" the Kentucky Republican said in opening remarks.

At least 13 Republican senators have said they will object to the results favoring President-elect Joe Biden in some fashion.

McConnell noted that every election features ""some illegality,"" which he called ""unacceptable."" He said he supported state-led voting reforms and said that pandemic voting procedures ""must not become the new norm.""

Still, McConnell said that no evidence had been provided that would tip the scale in favor of President Trump.

""We cannot simply declare ourselves a national board of elections on steroids,"" he said. ""The voters, the courts, and the states have all spoken ... if we overrule them it would damage our republic forever. This election was not unusually close.""

He added that courts, many consisting of Trump-appointed judges, had rejected claims of mass election fraud ""over and over.""

TRUMP SAYS HE WILL 'NEVER CONCEDE,' PRESSURES PENCE TO SEND ELECTION 'BACK TO THE STATES'

McConnell said that many of the Trump team’s allegations of fraud included ""sweeping conspiracy theories,"" and if the election were overturned by ""mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral.""

As Congress meets to certify results, Trump has insisted he will ""never"" concede and pressured Vice President Mike Pence to thwart the process. Pence is set to preside over the joint session on Wednesday.

McConnell’s speech was his first public statement against the president’s efforts, after 12 senators and over 100 House members geared up for a fight they are likely to lose after all sides have certified their votes.

In private, McConnell has warned Republicans -- many of whom will be up for reelection in 2022 -- of the grave political ramifications of attempting to stymie Biden's transition into the White House, but he has publicly shied away from going toe-to-toe with the president.

Meanwhile, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz called for ""a bit less certitude"" on ""both sides,"" as he led the effort to contest the election results. Instead of tossing the presidency back to Trump, Cruz proposed ""door number three,"" a compromise between the two sides -- appointing an electoral commission to conduct a 10-day emergency audit of the results and any evidence of fraud.

Trump has kept up a steady barrage of tweets, praising Sens. Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, and others who have pledged to vote against certifying the election results, while simultaneously lambasting McConnell and any other Republican who refuses to stand with them.

LIVE UPDATES: CONGRESS MEETS TO CERTIFY ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTE

""I hope the Democrats, and even more importantly, the weak and ineffective RINO section of the Republican Party, are looking at the thousands of people pouring into D.C. They won't stand for a landslide election victory to be stolen. @senatemajldr @JohnCornyn @SenJohnThune,"" Trump said on Twitter Tuesday, stoking supporters who flocked outside the White House overnight to protest Congress' vote.

Hundreds of Trump supporters stormed Capitol Hill barricades Wednesday and entered the Capitol in support of the president, and two nearby buildings were evacuated.

The president addressed the protesters in a speech, calling on Pence to send the election ""back to the states.""

""We are supposed to protect our country and support our Constitution,"" Trump said. ""States want to revote. The states got defrauded, they were given false information and now they want it back.""

""Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem,"" Trump said, adding that he had ""immediately"" deployed the National Guard.

He tweeted out the video shortly after his account was unlocked by Twitter. Twitter, along with Facebook, suspended the president for his initial response to the riot.

""Emotions are high now, but tempers must be cooled and calm restored,"" the president continued. ""We must get on with the business of America. My campaign rigorously pursued every legal avenue to contest the election results. My only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote.""

""My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition,"" Trump said, acknowledging that ""a new administration"" would be inaugurated Jan. 20. ""This moment now calls for healing and reconciliation.""

MICHELLE OBAMA CALLS ON TECH GIANTS TO PERMANENTLY BAN TRUMP

He noted the struggles ahead mitigating the coronavirus and rebuilding the economy, calling for unity. ""It will require all of us working together. It will require a renewed emphasis on the civic values of patriotism, faith, charity, community and family.""

""To the citizens of our country, serving as your president has been the honor of a lifetime,"" he continued. ""To my incredible supporters I know you are disappointed ... our incredible journey is only just beginning.""

After vowing at the ""Save America"" rally in Washington Wednesday he would ""never concede,"" Trump promised on Thursday to offer an orderly transition, despite his grievances, after Congress certified the Electoral College results in favor of President-elect Joe Biden.

Between the president’s rally speech and Congress’ certification, chaos broke out at the Capitol when pro-Trump rioters breached security to wreak havoc inside the building -- in some instances defacing the space and stealing property -- prompting lawmakers in the joint session to go into hiding.

Republicans, even staunch Trump allies, spoke out against the president’s response to the riots and continued election challenges.

OBAMA SAYS TRUMP INCITED RAID ON US CAPITOL

On Wednesday evening, Trump tweeted out a statement: ""These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,"" Trump tweeted. ""Go home with love & peace.""

He added: ""Remember this day forever!""

Before that, he posted a video message to Twitter, addressing supporters, saying: ""I know your pain, I know your hurt.""

""We had an election that was stolen from us,"" Trump said from the White House. ""It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side.

""This was a fraudulent election, but we can’t play into the hands of these people,"" Trump said. ""We have to have peace.""

Twitter suspended the president for the pair of tweets and removed them."
138,https://www.foxnews.com/us/twitter-suspends-realdonaldtrump-account-permanently,2,"Twitter announced the permanent suspension of President Trump’s account Friday, following months of flagging his tweets with warnings -- and days after the company said he violated its policies.

The platform locked Trump out of his account for the first time this week. The social media company deemed a number of tweets connected to the violent protests at the Capitol on Wednesday as inflammatory.

""After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them — specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,"" the company wrote in a blog post.

Later, when the president shared three messages from the official @POTUS handle, Twitter quickly took them down. He sent the same text out in a statement to White House reporters, criticizing Twitter as an opponent of free speech and teasing a potential new conservative social media platform in the future.

The official account had, until that point, not shared any tweets since late December. It will be transferred to President-elect Joe Biden after Inauguration Day and remains active.

TRUMP SAYS HE WON'T ATTEND BIDEN'S INAUGURATION

The president’s account was suspended Wednesday night after he posted a video with a message for protesters who had stormed the Capitol earlier. After violence that led to multiple deaths, Trump told them to ""go home,"" but maintained that the 2020 presidential election was ""stolen"" from him.

Twitter removed the president’s video before suspending his account and warning that further violations of the platform’s policies could result in a ""permanent suspension.""

Sharing two tweets from the president Friday, including one in which he said he would not attend President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, the company argued that they had to be viewed in part of a greater context.

FACEBOOK BLOCKS TRUMP IDNEFINITELY AFTER CAPITOL RIOT RESPONSE

The other read: ""The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!""

""The mention of his supporters having a 'GIANT VOICE long into the future' and that 'They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!' is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an 'orderly transition' and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election,"" Twitter stated.

The blog post claimed plans for future armed protests over the election results already were being shared both on and off the platform -- ""including a proposed secondary attack"" on Capitol Hill.

""These two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks,"" the company said. ""After assessing the language in these Tweets against our Glorification of Violence policy, we have determined that these Tweets are in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy and the user @realDonaldTrump should be immediately permanently suspended from the service.""

Jason Miller, a senior advisor to Trump's 2020 campaign, called the move ""disgusting.""

""Big Tech wants to cancel all 75M @realDonaldTrump supporters,"" he wrote on the platform. ""If you don’t think they’re coming for you next, you’re wrong.""

For years, the president has used Twitter to communicate directly to the American people -- bypassing the media and other gatekeepers of information. But some of his more fiery tweets have drawn criticism, sometimes from his own party.

Twitter confirmed in early December that special privileges granted to world leaders are rescinded once they leave office. The platform has a public interest exemption for prominent figures whose words are newsworthy and important for their citizens to read, even if they violate the rules.

TWITTER WEIGHS IN ON WHETHER TRUMP COULD BE BANNED AFTER LEAVING OFFICE

Trump’s personal Twitter account had more than 88 million followers as of last month. Amid the 2020 presidential election, Twitter began attaching ""fact-checking"" warnings to some of Trump's tweets. Messages containing unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud garnered warning tags that read, ""This claim about election fraud is disputed.""

Facebook also permanently blocked Trump on Thursday night.

""We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement Thursday. ""Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.""

White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere slammed the company at the time.

""It is indisputable that nobody has been more successful at using digital media than President Trump to communicate directly with the American people, but it’s incredibly ironic, yet not surprising, that when the President spoke to the country at a critical time Big Tech chose to censor and block him from doing so,"" Deere told Fox News. ""Big Tech is out of control.""

The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment on his permanent Twitter suspension.

Twitter’s longstanding policy is to ban accounts that promote violent extremism, share personal information of others in order to harass them (also known as doxing), or engage in abusive behavior or operating fake accounts, among other violations. The company argued Friday that Trump's most recent tweets risked inspiring people to ""replicate the violent acts that took place on January 6, 2021.""

And after Wednesday's rioting on Capitol Hill, the company appeared ready to take more drastic action.

""The use of the words 'American Patriots' to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol,"" Twitter said.

139,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-trump-impeachment-dodge-house-democrats,2,"President-elect Joe Biden is avoiding taking a firm position on removing President Trump from office ahead after last week's Capitol riot, as House Democrats signaled they would introduce articles of impeachment against him on Monday.

Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu, David Cicilline, and Jamie Raskin drafted the article of impeachment, ""Incitement to Insurrection,"" which they plan to introduce in a House pro forma session on Monday.

SCHUMER: USE 25TH AMENDMENT TO REMOVE TRUMP 'IMMEDIATELY'

""With every new day we learn that the violent insurrection was even worse than we thought. Impeaching @POTUS would be just the bare minimum of what needs to occur,"" Lieu tweeted. ""Donald Trump should be prosecuted for a range of felonies, including inciting an insurrection and felony murder.""

Biden, over the weekend, said that Trump is ""not above the law,"" saying that ""justice serves the people — it doesn't protect the powerful.""

But the president-elect has stopped short of outright calling for Trump’s impeachment or for Vice President Mike Pence and the Trump Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment.

WHAT IS THE 25TH AMENDMENT AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

When asked whether he supported bringing articles of impeachment, or invoking the 25th, which both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have called for, Biden said it was up to Congress to decide.

""I’m focused on the virus, the vaccine and economic growth. What Congress decides to do is for them to decide,"" Biden said. ""We’re going to do our job and the Congress can decide how to proceed with theirs.""

He added: ""That's a decision for the Congress to make. I am focused on my job.""

Biden, though, said that he has ""been saying for now well over a year that he’s not fit to serve,"" calling Trump ""one of the most incompetent presidents in the history of the United States of America.""

Biden emphasized that ""it's important to get on with the business of getting him out of office,"" but he said ""the quickest way that that will happen is us being sworn in on the 20th. What action happens before or after that is a judgment for the Congress to make.""

Biden added: ""If we were six months out, we should be doing everything to get him out of office, impeaching him again. Trying to invoke the 25th Amendment. Whatever it took to get him out of office. But I am focused now on us taking control as president and vice president on the 20th and getting our agenda moving as quickly as we can.""

Biden’s comments came as the Democrat-controlled House reached more than 200 co-sponsors for an article of impeachment against Trump, which they plan to introduce Monday. There are 222 Democrats in the House.

""It is the hope of members that the president will immediately resign,"" Pelosi said in a statement Saturday after an hourslong phone call with Democrats on impeachment. ""But if he does not, I have instructed the Rules Committee to be prepared.""

It’s unlikely that impeachment would make it through both the House and the Senate by Jan. 20, when President-elect Biden is inaugurated.

ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST TRUMP TO BE INTRODUCED MONDAY

Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., has called for Trump to be removed through the 25th Amendment, the first GOP member of the House to publicly do so. Meanwhile, frequent Trump critic Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., has said he would ""definitely consider"" impeachment articles if they were brought forth.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, became the first Republican to call on the president to resign Friday, and said Trump’s leadership of the GOP leaves her questioning whether to remain in the party.

""I want him to resign. I want him out. He has caused enough damage,"" Murkowski said in an interview with the Anchorage Daily News.

Meanwhile, Schumer and other Democrats have urged Pence to ""immediately"" invoke the 25th Amendment, calling it the ""quickest and most effective way"" to remove Trump from office.

Schumer, though, warned that if Pence and the Cabinet did not take that path, Congress could ""reconvene to impeach the president.""

The 25th Amendment includes a section allowing the vice president and a majority of Cabinet members to declare a president ""unable"" to perform the job.

A senior Trump administration official told Fox News that Pence has not been involved in any 25th Amendment conversations.

The calls for Trump’s removal come after the president spoke at a rally Wednesday, telling supporters that he would ""never concede,"" and repeated unsubstantiated claims that the election was ""stolen"" from him and that he won in a ""landslide.""

During his remarks, he renewed pressure on Pence, claiming that he should decertify the results of the presidential election and send it ""back to the states,"" claiming that if he did that, Trump would be president for another four years.

Trump’s remarks came ahead of a joint session of Congress to certify the results of the presidential election. As members of the House and Senate raised objections to certain electoral votes, both chambers called for a recess and left their chambers as pro-Trump protesters breached the Capitol building.

Washington, D.C., police said the security breach at the Capitol resulted in four deaths – including a woman who had been shot inside the building – and at least 70 arrests.

MURKOWSKI CALLS ON TRUMP TO RESIGN, QUESTIONS HER FUTURE WITH GOP

Congress later returned and certified the Electoral College vote early Thursday, formally giving Joe Biden his presidential victory.

White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino posted a statement from the president on Twitter early Thursday morning, saying: ""Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.""

""I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted,"" Trump said. ""While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!""

The House voted to impeach Trump in December 2019, but the Senate acquitted him on both articles of impeachment – abuse of power and obstruction of Congress – in February 2020.

The House impeachment inquiry began after the president, during a phone call in July 2019, pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to look into Biden’s role pressing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been investigating the founder of Burisma Holdings – a Ukrainian natural gas firm where his son, Hunter, sat on the board.

Trump's pressure campaign against Ukraine prompted a whistleblower complaint, and, in turn, the impeachment inquiry.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.

SEE PHOTOS: WASHINGTON'S SECURITY PREPS IN HIGH GEAR FOR INAUGURATION

Still, the inauguration is set to proceed as scheduled with several high-profile security precautions in place, including enhanced National Guard presence and ramped-up law enforcement by state and local officials. President Trump also declared a state of emergency in Washington, citing the ""emergency conditions"" of Biden's inauguration.

Despite heightened alarm about further violence, Biden told reporters that he intends to carry on as planned with the event. The inauguration’s theme is ""America United.""

""I'm not afraid of taking the oath outside,"" Biden said Monday.

Officials increase the number of National Guard members who will be deployed in Washington during the presidential inauguration from 15,000 to 20,000 on Wednesday, about three times the number of U.S. troops currently deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan combined. The inauguration comes exactly two weeks after insurrectionists stormed the Capitol. Five people, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer who was beaten with a flag pole, died in the unprecedented attack.

MCCONNELL SUPPORTS MOVE TO BEGIN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS: SOURCES

Public access to the inauguration, which was already scaled back as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, will be further limited. City officials are erecting a perimeter throughout downtown, putting up barriers around the White House, the National Mall and the Capitol. In order to travel through the perimeter, people will need to provide proof of essential purpose.

""The FBI received information about an identified armed group intending to travel to Washington, DC on 16 January,"" the memo, a copy of which was obtained by ABC News, read. ""They have warned that if Congress attempts to remove POTUS via the 25th Amendment, a huge uprising will occur.""

With COVID-19 cases surging nationwide and growing fears about the safety of the event, the leaders of Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia issued a joint statement urging Americans to stay away from the inauguration and instead tune in virtually.

""We will work together, and with our partners in the federal government, to ensure the safety of the National Capital Region,"" they wrote. ""Due to the unique circumstances surrounding the 59th Presidential Inauguration, including last week's violent insurrection as well as the ongoing and deadly COVID-19 pandemic, we are taking the extraordinary step of encouraging Americans not to come to Washington.""

There will also be no public access to the Capitol grounds during the inauguriation, acting U.S. Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman said in a statement on Monday. The Capitol Police, who have been heavily criticized after they were overrun by the far-right extremists last week, are working with federal, state and local law enforcement to ensure the inauguration goes smoothly, she said.

ROY BLUNT BALKS AT ATTEMPT TO IMPEACH TRUMP AGAIN: 'NOT GOING TO HAPPEN'

""We have comprehensive, coordinated plans in place to ensure the safety and security of the congressional community and the upcoming presidential inauguration,"" Pittman said.

The Washington Monument is also closed through Jan. 24 due to ""credible threats to visitors and park resources"" surrounding Biden's inauguration, the National Park Service said. The threats include possible disruption to the ""set-up and execution of inaugural events, which occur in several park areas,"" the agency said.

Officials are fortifying the city days earlier than planned in anticipation of potential violence on Saturday.

In a memo on Monday, the FBI warned that an armed group has threatened to come to Washington on Jan. 16 and stage a ""huge uprising"" if President Trump is removed from office before Jan. 20. The agency also warned that armed protests are being planned at all 50 state capitals and at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 20, the day of Biden's inauguration, regardless of whether the states certified electoral votes for Biden or Trump.

""There are people plotting to do danger, at least online, and the bottom line is our authorities have to be completely on top of it,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters this week.

House Democrats were briefed late Monday about threats to the event, including that thousands of armed pro-Trump supporters are plotting to surround the Capitol ahead of the inauguration, according to Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa.

""They were talking about 4,000 armed 'patriots' to surround the Capitol and prevent any Democrat from going in,"" Lamb told CNN on Tuesday.

Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., who participated in the security briefing for lawmakers, told The Washington Post that if the extensive measures planned for the inauguration had been in place on Jan. 6, ""a fly could not have gotten into the Capitol.""

""Last week was a wake-up call,"" Malinowski said."

""Now, the process continues to the Senate — and I hope they’ll deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation,"" Biden said in his statement Wednesday after the House impeached Trump.

The Senate is in recess and will return on Jan. 19. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told GOP colleagues this week that the upper chamber would not reconvene early to take on impeachment without the consent of all 100 senators.

BIDEN TWEETS ABOUT IMPEACHMENT VOTE, REMINDS SENATE OF 'OTHER URGENT BUSINESS'

The House can deliver a message to the secretary of the Senate while they are in recess, informing the Senate that the House has appointed managers to exhibit, or read aloud, the articles of impeachment. But the Senate can take no action on that message until it reconvenes on Jan. 19.

Once the Senate reconvenes, the secretary of the Senate notifies the body of receipt of the message from the House managers, triggering the Senate’s impeachment rules.

During Trump’s January 2020 impeachment trial, and during former President Bill Clinton’s January 1999 impeachment trial, the Senate instructed House managers to exhibit, or read aloud, the articles of impeachment the day after the Senate’s rules were triggered.

Based on Senate Impeachment Rule III, after the articles are exhibited by the House managers, ""the Senate shall, at 1 o’clock afternoon of the day… or sooner if ordered by the Senate, proceed to the consideration of"" the article.

""Timing is everything, they say,"" a senior GOP aide told Fox News. ""With this reality check, will Pelosi and Schumer be so selfish and shortsighted that they don’t let Biden have his day in the sun (on Inauguration Day) and get a clean start on his mission to heal the nation?""

Biden, earlier this week, told reporters he asked senators if they could ""bifurcate"" their time between the Senate trial and other ""urgent"" business.

""Can we go half-day on dealing with the impeachment and half-day getting my people nominated and confirmed in the Senate?"" he told reporters.

The focus of Biden team is Senate confirmations of key Cabinet posts, as well as the Biden agenda.

""I hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of the nation,"" Biden said after Trump was impeached. ""From confirmations to key posts such as secretaries for Homeland Security, State, Defense, Treasury and Director of National Intelligence, to getting our vaccine program on track, and to getting our economy going again.""

Biden added: ""Too many Americans have suffered for too long over the past year to delay this urgent work.""

Fox News has learned that the president-elect and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will at the same time aim to drive a unifying message, and will stress that the U.S. ""can’t afford to wait"" on their policy agenda – specifically regarding COVID-19, the economy and national security – or confirmations.

And another source warned that once the Senate holds the article of impeachment, the upper chamber would fall into ""paralysis,"" saying ""we can’t do anything else"" but focus on impeachment.

""It steps on Biden’s message,"" the source said.

Senate committees have begun scheduling hearings to consider Biden nominees this week.

The Senate Intelligence Committee said it would hold a hearing Friday, Jan. 15, to consider the nomination of Avril Haines for director of National intelligence; the Senate Foreign Relations Committee announced a Jan. 19 hearing for Antony Blinken for secretary of State; and the Senate Finance Committee scheduled a Jan. 19 hearing for Janet Yellen as secretary of the Treasury.

At this point, the Biden team is still awaiting a hearing for Alejandro Mayorkas to be considered as secretary of Homeland Security – which the team said is a critical post that needs confirmation ahead of Biden’s inauguration – and nominee for Defense secretary, Gen. Lloyd Austin.

BIDEN SAYS US 'CANNOT AFFORD GAPS IN NATIONAL SECURITY LEADERSHIP,' URGES SENATE TO CONFIRM NOMINEES

Sen. Chuck Schumer, who will soon be Senate Majority Leader, is looking at ways to speed through the Senate trial, which would traditionally take weeks and leave little time for other business, according to The Washington Post.

The House on Wednesday made history by voting to impeach Trump for a second time — this time for ""incitement of insurrection"" after pro-Trump supporters besieged the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a failed attempt to stop the certification of Biden’s electoral college victory.

The House votes 232-197 to impeach the president. Ten Republicans joined with Democrats.

Trump has just one week left in office, but supporters of the impeachment push say he is too dangerous to remain in office for a minute longer. The impeachment resolution condemns Trump for spreading misinformation that he won the election in a landslide, and for riling up a crowd of supporters in Washington D.C. before the riot that killed five people—including a Capitol Police officer.

Unlike the last House impeachment of Trump in December 2019 for soliciting foreign interference in the presidential election, Democrats had GOP support. Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, backed impeachment because she said the violent attack at the Capitol could not have happened without Trump.

Meanwhile, McConnell, who signaled support of the impeachment effort, told GOP colleagues Wednesday that he has ""not made a final decision"" on how he will vote on impeachment.

""While the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote, and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate,"" McConnell said.

McConnell’s comment comes after sources told Fox News that McConnell is ""done"" and ""furious"" with the president.

One source told Fox News on Tuesday that McConnell does not see House Democrats’ efforts to impeach Trump as a partisan exercise like the previous impeachment effort in 2019.

Another source told Fox News that McConnell confided to associates that impeachment will help rid the Republican Party of Trump and his movement.

John Sullivan can allegedly be heard egging on protesters in video he provided to the FBI, according to a federal criminal complaint. He has also shared the video to his YouTube and Twitter accounts under the pseudonym Jayden X.

BLM ACTIVIST INSIDE CAPITOL CLAIMS HE WAS 'DOCUMENTING' RIOTS, ONCE SAID 'BURN IT ALL DOWN'

He was charged Thursday in federal court in Washington after being arrested by the FBI. He remains in custody in Toeele County, in his home state of Utah, on a U.S. Marshals Service hold request.

James Sullivan, the man’s brother, told Fox 13 News that he gave tips about his brother to the Salt Lake City FBI. James Sullivan said he found out that his brother was at the Capitol when friends posted pictures online.

The FBI’s Salt Lake City office did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News seeking comment.

BLM ACTIVIST INSIDE CAPITOL CLAIMS HE WAS 'DOCUMENTING' RIOTS, ONCE SAID 'BURN IT ALL DOWN'

Inside the building, he told rioters that ""We got to get this s--- burned,"" and ""it’s our house m------------,"" according to an affidavit signed by FBI Special Agent Matthew Foulger.

He faces federal charges of civil disorder, entering a restricted building and violent entry or disorderly conduct.

Sullivan also allegedly told Foulger that he had been in the Capitol during the riot, entering through a broken window while wearing a ballistic vest.

As protesters climbed over a wall near the Capitol entrance, he allegedly exclaimed in the video, ""You guys are f------ savage. Let’s go!""

""There are so many people,"" Sullivan’s voice can be heard saying as the camera shows a large group of people making its way toward the building. ""Let’s go. This s--- is ours! F-- yeah. I can’t believe this is reality.""

""We accomplished this s---,"" he said at another point ""We did this together. F--- yeah! We are all a part of this history.""

In an interview with Rolling Stone published Wednesday, Sullivan said he was putting on an act to build rapport with the protesters.

""I had to relate to these people, and build trust in the short amount of time I had there to get where I need to go,"" he told the magazine. ""To the front of the crowd to see the dynamic between the police and the protesters, because nobody wants to see the backs of people’s heads from a far-off distance.""

He apparently made it there. During the unrest, he tweeted up-close video of the moment a Capitol Police officer fatally shot Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt during the riot. It had been taken just a few feet away, at the height of the chaos outside the Speaker’s Lobby.

Investigators used this detail and other aspects of the video to confirm Sullivan’s alleged whereabouts within the Capitol, they said.

Sullivan, the founder of a Utah-based group called Insurgence USA, told Fox News last Thursday that he’d entered the besieged Capitol to ""document"" what was going on and to dispute ""this narrative going around"" that Antifa instigators had played a role in the riot.

While he has denied ties to Antifa, or anti-fascists, in recent interviews, his group Insurgence USA had advertised an event called ""Kick These Fascists out of DC"" on Wednesday around the same time as a pro-Trump rally near the National Mall that preceded the Capitol chaos.

After the Trump rally, a mob of demonstrators breached the Capitol, ransacked congressional offices, and stormed the Senate floor, prompting a chorus of condemnations from members of both major parties. The breach interrupted a joint session of Congress aimed at validating Joe Biden as president-elect. Congress reconvened later in the evening and finished the process.

Sullivan, who was still in custody Thursday, could not be reached for comment.

143,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-expected-pardons-commutations-lil-wayne-before-leaving-office,2,"President Trump is expected to issue between 50 and 100 commutations and pardons before he leaves office this week, two sources familiar with the list told Fox News.

The sources told Fox News that the announcement of the pardons will likely come in one large batch on Tuesday, but there is a slight chance the White House will wait to make them official Wednesday morning. The president has until noon on Wednesday to do so.

TRUMP ISSUES NEW WAVE OF PARDONS, THREE COMMUTATIONS

Fox News has learned that there was a meeting at the White House on Sunday afternoon to finalize the growing list of pardons and commutations. But sources with knowledge of the process say Trump is not expected to grant protective pardons for any members of his family, nor is he expected to attempt to issue a pardon for himself.

Despite an aggressive campaign by WikiLeaks to try to secure a pardon for its founder Julian Assange, the president is not expected to give him one.

The Justice Department has maintained that Assange should face trial on 18 charges, put forth by the Obama administration in 2010, centered on conspiring to breach government computers and violate the Espionage Act. The charges carry a maximum of 175 years in prison.

Fox News has also learned that rapper Lil Wayne is expected to be on the list, while former Trump associate Steve Bannon is described as being ""TBD.""

Lil Wayne, whose real name is Dwayne Carter, pleaded guilty in 2020 in federal district court to illegally possessing a loaded, gold-plated .45-caliber handgun while traveling to Florida on a private jet in 2019. The contents of Carter’s bag also included small amounts of cocaine, ecstasy and oxycodone, according to the U.S. attorney.

Bannon, a former adviser to Trump and an architect of his 2016 campaign, was arrested on fraud charges over the summer. Bannon pleaded not guilty in federal court in Manhattan after being indicted with three others who were accused of defrauding donors to the online fundraising campaign known as ""We Build the Wall"" that raised $25 million.

Bannon, 66, was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

Bannon was released on a $5 million bond.

PRESIDENT TRUMP GRANTS SEVERAL HIGH PROFILE PARDONS

The president has issued a number of high-profile pardons and commutations during his administration.

Last month, the president pardoned former California GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter, who was sentenced to 11 months in prison and three years of supervised probation after pleading guilty to a corruption charge, as well as former GOP Rep. Chris Collins, who was sentenced to 26 months in prison for securities fraud.

Trump also pardoned former campaign aide George Papadopoulos, who had been convicted of making false statements during the Mueller investigation.

The White House said Tuesday that Papadopoulos had been charged with a ""process-related crime"" even though ""Mueller stated in his report that he found no evidence of collusion in connection with Russia's attempts to interfere in the election.""

The president also pardoned Alex van der Zwaan, who also pleaded guilty to lying to Mueller investigators and was sentenced to 30 days in prison.

And just before Christmas, the president pardoned more than two dozen other individuals – including his 2016 campaign manager Paul Manafort and adviser Roger Stone – both of whom were prosecuted and convicted in Mueller's investigation.

Trump had commuted Stone’s sentence in July, but gave him a full pardon last month.

Before Thanksgiving, the president pardoned his former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn, who also pleaded guilty twice to making false statements as part of Mueller’s investigation.

However, the prosecution came under scrutiny after the release of FBI documents that suggested a plot to get him to lie.

""What is our goal?"" read one of the FBI's notes. ""Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?""

Following those revelations, Trump's Justice Department moved to drop its case against Flynn, but encountered hurdles after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Flynn's plea to force U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan to drop his criminal case in August.

Also last month, Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was convicted and sentenced to two years for preparing false tax returns, witness retaliation and making false statements to the Federal Election Commission, and Margaret Hunter, the wife of former Congressman Hunter. Ms. Hunter pleaded guilty in 2019 to one count of conspiracy to misuse campaign funds for personal expenses and was sentenced to three years of probation.

144,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-biden-cabinet-nominees,2,"While more attention will be paid to Wednesday's inauguration of Joe Biden, the real drama this week may come when Senate committees hold confirmation hearings for several of the president-elect's Cabinet picks.

Confirmation hearings are often marked by partisan differences, and this week is likely to be no different. In November, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who sits on the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees, expressed broad opposition to Biden's selections.

PROGRESSIVES GIVE BIDEN'S CABINET PICKS MIXED REVIEWS, DEMAND REPRESENTATION

""Biden's cabinet picks went to Ivy League schools, have strong resumes, attend all the right conferences & will be polite & orderly caretakers of America’s decline,"" Rubio tweeted, adding that he supports ""American greatness"" and has ""no interest in returning to the 'normal' that left us dependent on China.""

The action kicks off Tuesday morning, with the Senate Finance Committee hosting Treasury secretary nominee Janet Yellen, the Senate Intelligence Committee holding a hearing for Director of National Intelligence pick Avril Haines, and Homeland Security secretary nominee Alejandro Mayorkas appearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

BIDEN PICKS BLINKEN, MAYORKAS, SULLIVAN FOR KEY CABINET POSITIONS

That afternoon, Biden's pick for secretary of State, Antony Blinken, will have a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Senate Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing for Defense secretary nominee Lloyd J. Austin III. Finally, Thursday will see the hearing for Transportation secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.

Yellen, among the first to face a hearing this week, is no stranger to the confirmation process, having gone through it when she became head of the Federal Reserve in 2014. Back then, she was opposed by 26 Republicans when the full Senate voted. Five of those senators are currently on the Finance Committee.

Blinken is likely to face questions from Republicans who are concerned that the incoming administration will adopt similar foreign policy approaches to the Obama administration. He could also be asked about his attitude toward entering into a new nuclear deal with Iran, as well as his approach to China. The Trump administration has taken a strong stance against Iran, and current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has not been shy about criticizing China. Pompeo has gone so far as to accuse China of being ""bent on Western destruction.""

BIDEN SECRETARY OF STATE PICK ADMITTED OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 'FAILED' IN SYRIA

Mayorkas, who was deputy Homeland Security secretary under President Obama, has a record that Republicans could point to in contesting his nomination, particularly regarding his role in crafting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, commonly known as DACA. The program, which provides benefits for people who were brought illegally to the U.S. as children, has faced opposition from Republicans since its inception. The Trump administration tried – but failed – to repeal it when the Supreme Court ruled that they did not follow proper protocols.

The Senate Transportation Committee hearing will likely feature Republicans challenging Buttigieg to explain why being mayor of a city with just over 100,000 people makes him qualified to head up transportation for the U.S. Biden’s choice of his Democratic primary rival for this post raised concerns about Buttigieg’s inexperience, which he will have to address at Thursday’s hearing.

Austin and Haines could both potentially face opposition from the left. Austin, a retired four-star general has worked for defense contractor Raytheon since ending his military service. Raytheon is the same company for which recent Secretary Mark Esper worked before joining the Trump administration. During his confirmation hearing to lead the Defense Department, Esper was grilled by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., over whether he would recuse himself from any matters involving Raytheon.

Haines' nomination has already been met with criticism from leftist activist groups like CODEPINK, which launched a campaign against her nomination, citing her role in drone strikes when she was deputy director of the CIA.

Time will tell whether opposition to any of the picks will be enough to sink their nominations. Earlier this month, Biden was optimistic that this would not be the case when he announced his selections for secretaries of commerce and labor, as well as Small Business Administration chief during a Delaware event.

""It's my expectation and hope that the Senate will now move to confirm these nominees promptly and fairly,"" he said."

CAPITOL POLICE WARNED BEFORE RIOT THAT 'CONGRESS ITSELF' COULD BE TARGETED

Guard members have fanned out across the U.S. Capitol lawn, inside the building and in surrounding areas of D.C. for days. It's an unprecedented security force, deemed necessary in the wake of a deadly riot at the Capitol and continuing threats of domestic terrorism.

At least 7,000 National Guard troops from dozens of states are already on the ground in the nation's capital, with more expected to arrive in coming days at the request of the Secret Service, said Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau.

The military security force will be more than three times the total number of U.S. troops currently deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, reflecting heightened concerns after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying his loss in the Nov. 3 presidential election.

Heightened security concerns come after a mob stormed the Capitol building earlier this month, some intent on harming lawmakers, in a deadly siege that killed five people, including a Capitol police officer.

More than 25,000 National Guardsmen will be squared off around the Capitol's perimeter, with the areas around the White House, other federal buildings and the National Mall on lockdown and armed with a heavy security presence for the big event.

Trump made the comments at Joint Base Andrews as he was about to fly to Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Trump landed on Air Force One in Florida with about one hour left in his term.

As Trump walked to the podium in Joint Base Andrews, he was greeted by a 21-gun salute with ceremonial artillery. In his remarks, he touted his administration's accomplishments.

""We left it all on the field,"" Trump said of his time as president.

Fox News has been told that Trump left a note for Biden in the White House. He also wished the incoming Biden administration well in his Wednesday remarks.

""I wish the new administration great luck and great success,"" Trump said. ""I think they'll have great success.""

But he also warned that the Biden administration may roll back some of his policies.

""You're gonna see incredible numbers start coming in if everything is left alone, Trump said. ""Be careful.""

Potentially foreshadowing more involvement in politics to come, Trump said ""we will be back in some form."" There's been speculation that Trump could run for president in 2024, or that he may start his own political party.

The outgoing president also lamented the coronavirus pandemic, saying that ""The first thing we have to do is pay our respects and our love to the incredible people and families who suffered so gravely from the China virus. It was a horrible thing that was put into the world.""

Trump added: ""We put it in a position like it's never been before despite the worst plague to hit since, I guess you'd say 1917, over a hundred years ago.""

Trump thanked Vice President Pence, Congress and his family, saying, ""people have no idea how hard this family works."" He also praised the American people.

""I just want to say you are amazing people. This is a great, great country. It is my greatest honor and privilege to have been your president,"" Trump said. ""I will always fight for you.""

Trump also made brief comments to reporters as he left the White House one final time on his way to Joint Base Andrews. He said that being president was the ""honor of a lifetime"" and ""we love the American people.""

Trump will land in Florida before Biden is sworn in on Wednesday.

The reason Trump is leaving so early, Fox News is told, is so that the plane he touches down in Florida on is ""Air Force One"" -- the name given to whatever airplane the president is flying on. If Trump waited until Biden is sworn in, the aircraft would be called ""Special Air Mission 28000.""

Trump's decision not to attend Biden's inauguration is unprecedented in modern American history.

Among Trump's accomplishments during his chaotic four years as the leader of the free world the installation of three justices on the United States Supreme Court, more than any president since Ronald Reagan.

BIDEN'S INAUGURATION: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW

He also successfully nominated -- and the GOP-controlled Senate confirmed -- 234 federal judges. That's more in a single term than any other president in one term except for Jimmy Carter, who oversaw a massive expansion of the federal judiciary. Trump appointed 54 judges to the crucial U.C. Courts of Appeals, also more than any other president in a single term except for Carter.

Trump also oversaw a booming economy for much of his term, passed a tax cut that is still highly popular among Republicans and redefined U.S. trade policy.

Trump helmed the U.S. through an era full of change, including a burgeoning geopolitical rivalry with China. To address the threat from that country and others, Trump created a new branch of the military, the Space Force. Trump also oversaw a remarkable turnaround in the functionality of the Veterans Administration.

In the final full day of Trump's presidency, his State Department made a historic determination that China is committing genocide against Uyghur Muslims, a direct accusation of crimes against humanity past presidents have been reluctant to make against other nations.

In the waning months of his administration, the U.S. managed to make significant progress in facilitating Middle East peace, including the signing of the historic Abraham Accords.

But for all his successes, Trump also oversaw a number of failures and controversies.

The coronavirus pandemic killed more than 400,000 in Trump's final year in office alone, and he was often criticized for not taking the pandemic seriously enough and downplaying the seriousness of the virus.

Trump was surrounded by a number of questionable characters. Both of Trump's 2016 campaign chairmen, Paul Manafort and Steve Bannon, received pardons from the president in his final weeks in office. So did longtime adviser Roger Stone.

BIDEN TO SIGN 17 EXECUTIVE ACTIONS, ORDERS TO REVERSE TRUMP POLICIES, RESTORE OBAMA-ERA PROGRAMS ON FIRST DAY

Trump also pardoned former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn after he pleaded guilty -- then aimed to withdraw his plea -- for allegedly lying to the FBI.

Former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to multiple crimes, including campaign finance violations involving hush-money payments to women who said they had sex with Trump.

Others in Trump's circle who were caught in legal trouble were campaign adviser George Papadopolous and former Deputy Campaign Chairman Rick Gates.

Trump, meanwhile, spent much of his presidency fending off sexual assault accusations and investigations into his business dealings.

And a number of prominent White House staffers eventually left the administration and denounced Trump, including longtime Republican foreign policy mainstay John Bolton, who was Trump's national security adviser for a time; former Defense Secretary James Mattis; former chief of staff John Kelly; former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson; and most recently former White House Communications Director Alyssa Farah.

Trump's presidency was punctuated by two months' worth of battles over the validity of the presidential election that he lost, which eventually led to his impeachment this month. That made him the first president ever to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives.

TRUMP PARDONS STEVE BANNON, LIL WAYNE, DOZENS OF OTHERS; ALSO COMMUTES SENTENCES

Trump and his allies repeatedly falsely said that he won the presidential election, making claims of widespread voter fraud that were regularly debunked. Dozens of lawsuits uniformly failed in the courts. A plea by Trump to Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ""find"" enough votes to reverse Trump's loss in the state was unsuccessful.

The president eventually gathered a mass of his supporters in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 before Congress was set to certify the results of Biden's victory in the presidential election. After pitched rhetoric from Trump and his backers at the rally, a pro-Trump mob marched across the city and attacked the Capitol, forcing hundreds of lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence into hiding.

The sacking of the Capitol was the worst attack on the seat of the American government since the British burned it during the War of 1812. Trump was impeached one week later by the House of Representatives for inciting an insurrection. He will face an impeachment trial in the Senate during the first weeks of the Biden administration, which could result in him being barred from holding future office.

But nevertheless, Trump managed to transform the Republican Party in his image and garner more than 74 million votes during the 2020 presidential election -- although, that was more than 7 million fewer than Biden.

The GOP now is more of a populist party than it has been in a long time, with a fervent base among White working-class voters and growing support among minorities, especially inner-city Black Americans and Latinos. Where the party has lost ground has been among more educated voters and in the suburbs.

Trump figures to remain a force in Republican politics for some time. With his loyal following making up a significant portion of the Republican base, it will be difficult for Republicans to win primaries without his endorsement or at least embracing him publicly.

In perhaps a sign of a president who will remain engaged after his term, Trump's reelection campaign manager Bill Stepien and two other top members of his campaign set up a firm called National Public Affairs which figures to support Trump's political engagement after he leaves office.

""Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning,"" Trump said in his farewell message, released Tuesday. ""There’s never been anything like it. The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle but instead only grow stronger by the day.""

On Dec. 11, the FDA issued the first emergency use authorization of Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna's vaccine was approved on Dec. 18th.

More than a month after both vaccines started being distributed, only 16,525,281 Americans have received the first dose, according to the CDC. 35,990,150 doses have been distributed so far.

Blame for the messy rollout has shifted over time. The Trump administration was heavily involved in the vaccine development process through Operation Warp Speed, but left it up to states to distribute the vaccine themselves.

""It is up to the States to distribute the vaccines once brought to the designated areas by the Federal Government,"" former President Trump tweeted in late December. ""We have not only developed the vaccines, including putting up money to move the process along quickly, but gotten them to the states.""

President Joe Biden has promised to ramp up the federal government's involvement in the vaccination process, saying that he'll invoke the Defense Production Act to increase the supply of vaccines, while using the National Guard and Federal Emergency Management Agency to distribute them."

Reports of shabby treatment of National Guard troops at the U.S. Capitol were sparking bipartisan outrage among lawmakers and other officials Thursday -- with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott calling for the return home of his state's Guard members.

Thousands of National Guard troops from several states had deployed to the U.S. Capitol to protect Wednesday's inauguration of President Biden against threats of violence following the Jan. 6 riot.

Photos of Guard members sleeping on the marble floors of the Capitol quickly went viral -- until they later received cots. Then on Thursday came another insult: According to reports, the Guard members were abruptly told to take their break time inside a parking garage instead of inside the Capitol.

On Friday, Yogananda Pittman, acting chief of the U.S. Capitol Police, said in a statement that ""with the exception of specific times on Inauguration Day itself while the swearing-in ceremonies were underway, the United States Capitol police did not instruct the National Guard to vacate the Capitol Building facilities.""

""And on Inauguration Day, the Guard was notified and encouraged to reoccupy the spaces in the Capitol and CVC at 2 p.m.,"" Pittman added. ""As of this morning, all Guardsmen and women have been relocated to space within the Capitol Complex.""

The Guardsmen, who had been resting inside the Capitol between 12-hour shifts, were moved to a nearby parking garage where photos obtained by Politico and other outlets showed members crowded together on the ground -- some resting their heads against cement pillars.

By Thursday evening, Abbott was among those who had apparently seen enough.

""I have instructed General Norris to order the return of the Texas National Guard to our state,"" the Republican governor wrote on Twitter, referring to Major Gen. Tracy Norris of the Texas National Guard.

Abbott previously objected to reports that Guard members were being ""vetted"" over concerns about a possible ""inside"" attack during the Biden inauguration.

More outrage came earlier Thursday from other lawmakers and officials, both Republicans and Democrats.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted about the parking garage reports, ""If this is true, it's outrageous. I will get to the bottom of this.""

NATIONAL GUARD SAYS THERE WERE 'NO CONFRONTATIONS' WITH PROTESTERS DURING BIDEN INAUGURATION

Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., visited the troops and tweeted that he brought them pizza. ""No soldier will ever, ever sleep on a garage floor in the US Capitol while I work in Congress.""

U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., tweeted, ""This is absolutely unacceptable and despicable treatment of our brave and dedicated National Guard who answered the call to serve. We need to demand answers now and this needs to be fixed immediately.""

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., called the treatment of Guard members, ""outrageous, shameful, and incredibly disrespectful.""

""We need it fixed and we need answers on how it happened,"" she tweeted.

Sinema was one of several lawmakers to offer the use of her office to the Guardsmen and at around 10:30 p.m. ET she tweeted that the members had all been ""welcomed back to the Capitol tonight. No more parking garages.""

CBS reporter Kris Van Cleave reported early Friday the National Guard said the troops are out of the garage and will take their breaks in Emancipation Hall at the Capitol Visitors Center from now on. He included a video of the troops leaving the garage.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., confirmed that she had made several calls and had been informed the ""Capitol Police have apologized to the Guardsmen and they will be allowed back into the complex tonight. I’ll keep checking to make sure they are.""

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who also offered her office, confirmed the Guardsmen were being allowed back in the Capitol and said an offer of snacks ""still stands.""

NATIONAL GUARDSMEN REMOVED FROM US CAPITOL AHEAD OF INAUGURATION

One Guardsman told Politico that on the day of the inauguration dozens of lawmakers had taken photos with them, shook their hands and thanked them for their service. He added, ""Within 24 hours, they had no further use for us and banished us to the corner of a parking garage. We feel incredibly betrayed.""

Politico reported the unit that had been using space in the Dirksen Senate Office building were asked to move to the garage by the Capitol Police.

""After significant outcry, it seems like there is movement right now to get Guard members back inside the Capitol, into the visitors center,"" Politico reporter Natasha Bertrand, tweeted.

Politico reporter Lara Seligman said a Guard source told her ""all units at the Thurgood Marshall parking garage are ordered to relocate to the CVC (Capitol Visitors Center) immediately.""

The U.S. Capitol Police put out a statement on the report saying, ""The United States Capitol Police immensely appreciates the integral support of the U.S. National Guard in helping to secure the Capitol Complex leading up to, and including the Inaugural ceremony. The Department is grateful for their service and our strong partnership during this time.""

It continued, ""The Department’s request for National Guard assistance included a specific number of personnel to allow the National Guard to provide, at a minimum, 12 hours of off-campus rest time for the troops, and understood that this would be carried out throughout their deployment. Recently, the Department requested that the troops’ schedules be changed so they work no more than 8-hour shifts to allow for more off-campus rest time post-Inauguration.""

The Guardsmen have been using the garage only for breaks between their long shifts and have hotel rooms to sleep in at night, Van Cleave tweeted.

A spokesman for the National Guard told Politico, ""As Congress is in session and increased foot traffic and business is being conducted, Capitol Police asked the troops to move their rest area. They were temporarily relocated to the Thurgood Marshall Judicial Center garage with heat and restroom facilities. We remain an agile and flexible force to provide for the safety and security of the Capitol and its surrounding areas. The Guard is reviewing the request so that logistics and schedules can be adjusted.""

The National Guard did not immediately respond to Fox News requests for comment.

The new milestone, reported Sunday by Johns Hopkins University, is a grim reminder of the coronavirus’ wide reach in the U.S., which has seen far more confirmed cases and deaths than any other country in the world.

The U.S. accounts for roughly one of every four cases reported worldwide and one of every five deaths. India has recorded the second most cases, with about 10.7 million.

The number of new cases in the U.S. has shown signs of slowing recently, with an average of 176,000 reported daily in the past week, down from 244,000 in early January. The country’s first case of the infection was diagnosed almost exactly a year ago."
151,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-article-being-sent-to-senate-today-to-kick-off-trial,2,"Just before 7 p.m. on Monday, the House of Representatives' impeachment managers will march an article accusing former President Donald Trump of inciting an insurrection across to the Senate side of the Capitol, officially triggering a trial of the former president that could result in him being barred from holding office in the future.

That outcome appears unlikely with more and more Republican senators coming out to say they are against holding an impeachment trial in the first place -- citing the fact that Trump has already left office. But the trial will be a cloud hanging over the Senate and the first 100 days of the Biden administration for as long as it goes on, and will shut down business in the upper chamber once it gets started in earnest next month.

""Look, everyone wants to put this awful chapter in American history behind us, but sweeping it under the rug will not bring healing,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a press conference over the weekend. ""The only way to bring healing is to actually have real accountability, which this trial affords. And so we will move forward with the trial.""

""I think this is going to be really bad for the country,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said of the upcoming impeachment trial in an interview on ""Fox News Sunday.""

GROWING NUMBER OF GOP SENATORS OPPOSE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL

Rubio has been one of the Republican senators willing to criticize the president for his role in the Jan. 6 riots. Sunday he said, ""I think the president bears responsibility for some of what happened, it was most certainly a foreseeable consequence of everything that was going on.""

But, Rubio also said: ""It's going to ... keep us from focusing on really important things, but it's also just going to stir it up even more and make it even harder to get things done moving forward.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had suggested a schedule for an impeachment trial that would put off the main part of the trial until February, giving the House impeachment managers and Trumps's legal team a chance to submit briefs outlining their arguments before the main part of the trial.

Schumer essentially agreed to the terms wholesale in a move that will also give the upper chamber a chance to work on President Biden's Cabinet appointments and potentially even some legislation before the Senate is stuck hearing impeachment trial arguments six days per week.

It will also give Schumer and McConnell more time to come to an agreement on what's called an organizing resolution, which delineates how many members from each party will be on committees and how legislation will move through the Senate. Talks on that power-sharing deal have been hung up on McConnell's demand that Schumer gives assurances that Democrats won't get rid of the legislative filibuster, something Schumer has strongly resisted.

MCCONNELL SAYS TRUMP 'PROVOKED' THE CAPITOL RIOT AS SENATE WEIGHS ANOTHER IMPEACHMENT TRIAL

The House impeachment managers will begin their walk from the House side of the Capitol to the Senate side at 6:55 p.m. Monday. They'll arrive at the Senate at 7 p.m. and at that moment the Senate will officially be conducting an impeachment trial of the former president.

The senators will be sworn in as jurors for the impeachment trial Tuesday, even though the heart of the affair won't begin until the second week in February.

On Feb. 2, Trump's legal team will have to submit its response to the House impeachment article. That same day the impeachment managers will submit their pre-trial brief.

Another set of briefs are due on Feb. 8 -- Trump's pre-trial brief and the House managers' reply to Trump's answer to the impeachment article.

Then on Feb. 9, the House managers will submit their rebuttal to Trump's pre-trial brief, and the trial will begin in earnest.

MCCONNELL, SCHUMER SPAR OVER POWER-SHARING AS DISAGREEMENT OVER FILIBUSTER HAMSTRINGS TALKS

""I was pleased that we worked out a bipartisan schedule,"" veteran Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said on ""America's News Headquarters."" ""That gives the president, the former president, his team an opportunity to properly prepare their defense. It also allows us to get some of the business at hand with the president by his cabinet. And these urgent issues where we start from, we have no choice.""

It takes a two-thirds vote for the Senate to successfully issue a conviction in an impeachment trial. That means 17 Republican senators will need to join all 50 Democrats in voting to convict Trump, which appears unlikely, despite the widespread outrage in the Senate GOP against the president over his post-election behavior.

Trump for two months falsely claimed that he won the election while advancing claims of widespread fraud that were repeatedly batted away by the courts. He then invited thousands of supporters to a rally in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, the date Congress would certify Biden's win in a joint session. Trump tweeted the event would be ""wild.""

He then repeated his false claims at the rally as his allies used fiery rhetoric describing their election grievances on the same stage. Shortly after that rally, a pro-Trump mob stormed and ransacked the Capitol, forcing hundreds of lawmakers and former Vice President Mike Pence to take shelter. Some of the rioters chanted ""hang Mike Pence.""

McConnell has made clear his displeasure with the former president and left open the possibility of voting to convict Trump, which may or may not bring along some of his allies like Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.

And Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah; Susan Collins, R-Maine; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; Ben Sasse, R-Neb.; and Pat Toomey, R-Pa. are considered the best bets to vote to convict Trump.

But even if all of those GOP senators break against the former president, those who favor impeaching Trump will need to get several other Republicans to join them -- a tall task given the political sway many expect Trump to still hold in the Republican Party in the future.

Plus, many of the senators who may opt to vote to convict Trump are facing reelection in 2022. Voting to convict Trump would almost certainly prompt a primary challenge to those senators and could even spur Trump to campaign for that primary challenger -- he's already vowed to support challenges to multiple Republicans he views as insufficiently loyal.

The impeachment managers who will march to the Senate Monday, officially triggering the ordeal which may last more than a month, are Reps. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.; Diana DeGette, D-Colo.; David Cicilline, D-R.I.; Joaquin Castro, D-Texas; Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.; Ted Lieu, D-Calif.; Joe Neguse, D-Colo.; Madeleine Dean, D-Pa.; and non-voting Delegate Stacy Plaskett of the Virgin Islands.

They'll be the stars of the show for as long as the trial lasts, authoring briefs and making arguments on the Senate floor.

Trump's legal team will be led by South Carolina attorney Butch Bowers.

152,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-senators-to-meet-biden-monday-on-coronavirus-relief-as-dems-ready-to-pass-bill-without-republican-support,2,"A group of 10 Republican senators is headed to the White House Monday to discuss a potential compromise on a coronavirus relief plan that could gain bipartisan support to pass the Senate, in the first sign of significant talks between the parties on the issue.

The move comes as Democrats in Congress this week are taking the procedural steps necessary to pass a relief bill without any Republican support, using a brute-force legislative tactic called budget reconciliation that would allow them to circumvent a GOP filibuster.

And it follows a week in which Republicans were vocal that they felt left out of negotiations on the bill, and the White House was using aggressive pressure tactics to ensure moderate Democrats were on board with their coronavirus plan.

The group of 10 Republicans, which is led by Sen. Susan Collins of Maine announced a $600 billion plan Sunday. They revealed more details of the plan Monday, including $1,000 per person stimulus checks and $300 per week boosted unemployment benefits through June 30.

10 REPUBLICAN SENATORS AGREE TO MEET WITH BIDEN TO TALK COVID-19 RELIEF

""In 2020, Members of the House and Senate and the previous Administration came together on a bipartisan basis five times to direct the resources of the federal government toward combatting the urgent COVID-19 pandemic,"" the senators said in a letter to the White House. ""Each of these laws received the support of members from both political parties.""

They added: ""With your support, we believe Congress can once again craft a relief package that will provide meaningful, effective assistance to the American people and set us on a path to recovery.""

President Biden then invited the Republicans to the White House Monday to discuss their offer and the broader effort for coronavirus relief. The senators in the coalition if paired with all 50 Democrats could provide enough votes to overcome a filibuster by other Republicans. The group also includes Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska; Bill Cassidy of Louisiana; Mitt Romney of Utah; Rob Portman of Ohio; Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia; Todd Young of Indiana; Jerry Moran of Kansas; Mike Rounds of South Dakota; and Thom Tillis of North Carolina.

WHAT'S IN BIDEN'S $1.9T STIMULUS PLAN?

But the statement from White House press secretary Jen Psaki -- especially when contrasted with the letter from the Senate Republicans -- makes clear there is still a large gulf between Biden and even this group of moderates.

""With the virus posing a grave threat to the country, and economic conditions grim for so many, the need for action is urgent, and the scale of what must be done is large,"" Psaki said. ""As leading economists have said, the danger now is not in doing too much: it is in doing too little. Americans of both parties are looking to their leaders to meet the moment.""

The Republicans, meanwhile, emphasized unspent money and fiscal concerns in their letter, pushing for a ""targeted"" plan about one third the size of Biden's proposal.

""Finally, we note that billions of dollars remain unspent from the previous COVID relief packages. Just last month, Congress provided $900 billion in additional resources, and communities are only now receiving much of that assistance,"" the Republicans said. ""Some of the spending appropriated through the CARES Act, passed last March, also has yet to be exhausted. The proposal we have outlined is mindful of these past efforts, while also acknowledging the priorities that need additional support right now.""

NEW REPUBLICAN STIMULUS PROPOSAL WOULD COST $600B, INCLUDE MORE DIRECT CHECKS: WHAT TO KNOW

Even if Biden and Republicans do come to a compromise somewhere between their respective proposals, it's not clear that plan would be able to round up support from all 50 Senate Democrats, who are pushing for bold and immediate action. Congressional Democrats this week will introduce budget resolutions in each chamber, the first step towards the once-per-fiscal-year parliamentary gambit of budget reconciliation. Using that, they can pass a bill with no GOP support, though it may take weeks.

""We are in the midst of a once-in-a-century crisis. It requires a once-in-a-century effort to overcome it,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said last week. ""The dangers of undershooting our response are far greater than overshooting it... So the Senate, as early as next week, will begin the process of considering [a budget resolution, a potential first step to pursuing] a very strong COVID-relief bill.""

Schumer said his ""preference"" for a bill to have bipartisan support"" but said, ""if our Republican colleagues decide to oppose this urgent and necessary legislation, we will have to move forward without them.""

Schumer's office did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News on Sunday night asking his thoughts on the moderate Republicans' plan or if there are any dealbreaker priorities that must be included in a compromise bill for Schumer to support it.

Meanwhile, it's not clear that Democrats could get Biden's plan through the Senate if they used reconciliation. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., a moderate whose power increased significantly when the Senate reached a 50-50 party split, essentially giving him a veto on any Democratic bill, has expressed skepticism of the $1.9 trillion Biden plan.

BIDEN SUGGESTS HE WOULD ALLOW COVID-19 RELIEF BILL TO MOVE UNDER 'RECONCILIATION' WITH GOP SUPPORT

Manchin organized a call last week on which a bipartisan group of senators specifically raised questions about the need for $1,400 stimulus checks for wealthy Americans, which is included in Biden's plan.

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., is another moderate who Democrats are not sure they can count on as a vote for Biden's stimulus plan. She and Manchin were the two Democrats who doubled-down their support of a filibuster last week, handing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a win in his effort to preserve the minority protection in the Senate amid Democratic calls to scrap it.

Perhaps most telling about Sinema's and Manchin's perceived stances on coronavirus relief is that Vice President Kamala Harris last week did interviews with local television stations in both Arizona and West Virginia, emphasizing the need to quickly pass a coronavirus relief package.

""[Biden's 'American Rescue Plan' is] about opening schools back up in a safe way, it’s about getting support for small businesses, getting relief for families. So many people have been unemployed for almost a year at this point,"" Harris said in an interview with WSAZ, a station in the Huntingdon/Charleston, West Virginia market. ""The president and I feel very strongly that these are the moments when we are facing a crisis of unbelievable proportion [and] that the American people deserve their leaders to step up and stand up for them.""

Notably, the White House did not give Manchin a heads up that Harris would be taking her case directly to his constituents.

""I saw [the interview], I couldn’t believe it. No one called me [about it],"" Manchin later told WSAZ. ""We’re going to try to find a bipartisan pathway forward, but we need to work together. That’s not a way of working together.""

Manchin's office did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News on Sunday night.

153,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-legal-team-responds-impeachment-acquit,2,"Former President Donald Trump's legal team on Tuesday filed its response to the House article of impeachment ahead of next week's trial, denying wrongdoing and calling for the Senate to acquit Trump of the charge.

The answer denies that Trump violated his oath of office while also saying that he was protected by the First Amendment in response to claims he incited an insurrection.

""It is denied that the 45th President of the United States ever engaged in a violation of his oath of office,"" the Trump legal team brief says. ""To the contrary, at all times, Donald J. Trump fully and faithfully executed his duties as President of the United States, and at all times acted to the best of his ability to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, while never engaging in any high Crimes or Misdemeanors.""

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS FILE PRE-TRIAL BRIEF AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT: 'EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING'

Trump's legal team also argues that a Senate trial against him would be unconstitutional.

""Donald John Trump, 45th President of the United States, respectfully requests the Honorable Members of the Senate of the United States dismiss Article I: Incitement of Insurrection against him as moot, and thus in violation of the Constitution, because the Senate lacks jurisdiction to remove from office a man who does not hold office,"" the brief says.

The argument from Trump's counsel that the trial is constitutionally impermissible is one that is supported by the vast majority of the Republicans in the Senate. Last week Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., raised a point of order, claiming that it is unconstitutional for the Senate to hold an impeachment trial of a former president.

It was defeated by a 55-45 vote, with five Republicans joining all 50 Senate Democrats in what is likely to be the final word on whether or not the trial may proceed – it's highly unlikely any court would step in and tell the Senate how to run the trial.

But it would take 17 Republicans joining all 50 Senate Democrats to convict Trump on the impeachment article, meaning a dozen Senate Republicans would have to change their mind about the trial's constitutionality for Democrats to even have a chance of convicting the former president.

RAND PAUL CALLS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 'DEAD ON ARRIVAL' AFTER 45 GOP SENATORS VOTE AGAINST IT

The brief also doubles down on the false claims that Trump won the election.

""To the extent Averment 5 alleges his opinion is factually in error, the 45th President denies this allegation,"" the brief reads, referencing the House's allegation that Trump at his Jan. 6 rally ""reiterated false claims that 'we won this election, and we won it by a landslide.'""

""Insufficient evidence exists upon which a reasonable jurist could conclude that the 45th President’s statements were accurate or not, and he therefore denies they were false,"" the brief also says.

Trump's previous legal team quit over his demand that they make an election fraud case, Fox News was told. Trump's new legal team of Bruce Castor Jr. and David Schoen were the only two lawyers signed onto the document that was submitted to the Senate on Tuesday.

Earlier Tuesday, the House impeachment managers filed their pre-trial brief, essentially previewing their argument against Trump in the trial that's set to start next Tuesday.

""In a grievous betrayal of his Oath of Office, President Trump incited a violent mob to attack the United States Capitol during the Joint Session, thus impeding Congress’s confirmation of Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the winner of the presidential election,"" the impeachment managers, led by Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., wrote. ""As it stormed the Capitol, the mob yelled out 'President Trump Sent Us,' 'Hang Mike Pence,' and 'Traitor Traitor Traitor.'""

They added: ""This is not a case where elections alone are a sufficient safeguard against future abuse; it is the electoral process itself that President Trump attacked and that must be protected from him and anyone else who would seek to mimic his behavior.""

But the Trump team brief on Tuesday directly addresses the allegation that the former president incited the riot.

""It is denied that the phrase 'if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore' had anything to do with the action at the Capitol as it was clearly about the need to fight for election security in general, as evidenced by the recording of the speech,"" the Trump team brief reads. ""It is denied that President Trump intended to interfere with the counting of Electoral votes.""

It adds: ""The purpose of the Joint Sessions of Congress in 2017 and on Jan. 6, 2021, was for Members of Congress to fulfill their duty to be certain the Electoral College votes were properly submitted, and any challenges thereto properly addressed under Congressional rules. Congress’ duty, therefore, was not just to certify the presidential election. Its duty was to first determine whether certification of the presidential election vote was warranted and permissible under its rules.""

Outside of a range of answers to the specific allegations from the House impeachment managers, the Trump team brief also previews a menu of legal arguments it says support the argument that the Senate should not convict Trump.

These include the Senate lacking jurisdiction to hear a trial of a former president; that Trump's speech was protected by the First Amendment; that the House ignored due process in ""rushing to issue an Article of Impeachment""; that Chief Justice John Roberts will not oversee the trial, and that the House weaves together a plethora of independent allegations into a single article of impeachment.

Trump's team and the House impeachment managers will submit another round of briefs next Monday. These will be the House managers' reply to Trump's answer today, and the Trump team's pre-trial brief.

The impeachment trial will then start in earnest next Tuesday.

The theme of Black History Month this year is ""The Black Family: Representation, Identity and Diversity.""

Robinhood, TD Ameritrade and others restricted trading on Thursday and Wednesday, respectively, following an unexpected surge in trading volume of shares of GameStop, AMC Entertainment, Bed Bath & Beyond, BlackBerry and others. Limbaugh feels the move was made to protect hedge fund billionaires.

GAMESTOP STOCK PRICE FRENZY: WHAT TO KNOW

""Folks, it’s not just political now. The elites are bent out of shape that a bunch of average, ordinary users have figured out how to make themselves billionaires,"" Limbaugh said on Thursday. ""I’ve been studying it all morning and the best thing I can tell you is… whatever you think is going on in politics, Washington establishment, the Deep State, what have you, it’s the same thing in finance.""

Limbaugh said there are ""those who are allowed to make a lot of money"" and those who can’t.

""If you figure out how to make a lot of money, and if you’re like Donald Trump and you figure out how to get elected, you figure out how to beat the Deep State, they’re gonna come and they’re gonna wipe you out,"" he said. ""They’re gonna destroy you, and that’s what’s happening with GameStop.""

Limbaugh then explained that a bunch of people on Reddit figured out how to ""game the system"" and turn the stock market in to a ""profit-making device for themselves"" but it came with consequences.

""In the process they are harming the intended winners in this financial circumstance and that would be the hedge funds out there. The hedge funds are supposed to be the ones making a lot of money. They’re not and they’re begging other hedge funds to bail them out,"" he said.

GameStock share prices instead spiked this week as retail investors, spurred by the online Reddit forum WallStreetBets, piled into the stocks. The volatility continued Wednesday as platforms like Robinhood and Interactive Brokers limited trading on certain stocks.

CHARLES PAYNE UNLOADS ON WALL STREET 'WHINING' ABOUT GAMESTOP, AMC FRENZY: 'NOW YOU'RE LOSING'

GameStop Corp. shares have risen by more than 1,900% since the start of this year, hurting market short-sellers. Shares soared from $17.08 a few weeks ago to $347.51 at Tuesday's close. GameStop's stock had been struggling for six straight years before a slight surge in 2020 and its most recent explosion.

Limbaugh said that the elite doesn’t simply call ordinary people racists, sexists and bigots any more when looking to shame Americans.

""Now they’re actually making it clear to anybody that has the ability to notice that you’re not allowed to use the stock market the way they do, you’re not allowed to profit, you’re not allowed to make the kind of money they do,"" he said, noting that the ""elites"" expect many perks.

""And the perks are, the ability to guarantee your kid’s financial future. The ability to guarantee yourself a financial future, the ability to guarantee yourself a position of some power, depending on who you are in the establishment, the club of elites, whatever you want to call it, and it extends to far more than just political,"" Limbaugh said. ""This GameStop business now makes this something that is understandable beyond the political world and that is its value. It’s not just political anymore. It’s not just that you can’t think for yourself, on issues, and matters of politics… everything is rigged in favor of the elites and this has come along and set that rigging.""

Limbaugh said that the establishment censors or cancels anything that doesn’t benefit the ruling class, whether it’s free speech or even attitude.

""Well now, with this GameStop story, and the revelations contained in it, the elites, the same people that were hell-bent on getting rid of Donald Trump, the same people are now trying to tell you what you can or can’t do with your money,"" he said.

GameStop had lost most of its charm among investors in recent years as a brick-and-mortar store trying to survive in an Amazon world, but a spike in video game purchases amid the coronavirus pandemic suggested that things might turn around for the video game retailer.

Meanwhile, a lone investor on Reddit, a social website on which users can discuss news and opinions, was promoting GameStop and suggesting users band together to short squeeze its stock, despite initially getting little interest from other investors, on a forum called WallStreetBets.

After the Reddit user then suggested a short squeeze, smaller investors exhorted each other online to keep GameStop's stock rolling higher as short-sellers were betting against it.

As a result, big bets short-sellers made that GameStop's stock would fall went wrong, leaving them facing billions of dollars in collective losses. In such bets, called ""short sales,"" investors borrow a share and sell it in hopes of buying it back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference. GameStop is one of the most shorted stocks on Wall Street.

As GameStop's gains grew and short sellers scrambled to get out of their bets, they had to buy shares to do so. That accelerated the momentum even more, creating a feedback loop. As of Tuesday, short sellers of GameStop were already down more than $5 billion in 2021, according to S3 Partners.

Much of professional Wall Street remains pessimistic that GameStop's stock can hold onto its immense gains. The company is unlikely to start making big enough profits to justify its $22.2 billion market valuation anytime soon, analysts say.

Mobile brokerage apps faced outages on Wednesday and Thursday amid market volatility.

The Robinhood app, popular among new and young investors, restricted transactions for certain securities, including GameStop according to a press release. TD Ameritrade also restricted certain transactions.

156,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/futures-of-liz-cheney-marjorie-taylor-greene,2,"House Republicans will gather Wednesday afternoon for a conference meeting that comes as two of its members are in hot water for very different reasons, and they could face threats to their futures in the party.

Debate is expected at the meeting about the standing in the conference of Reps. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. Cheney angered many of her fellow Republicans with a vote to impeach former President Trump, triggering a push by some of the Trump loyalists in the conference to remove her as the conference chair.

And intense focus is on Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., over Greene. The GOP leader Tuesday had his long-awaited, in-person talk with Greene – who's shown little if any remorse for previously espousing conspiracy theories.

Democrats are moving to potentially strip Greene of her committee assignments if McCarthy doesn't. That will be a topic of discussion in a separate Rules Committee meeting Wednesday. But some Republicans have alleged a double standard given past anti-Semitic affiliations of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and inciteful words from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. A group of Republicans moved to strip Omar of her committee assignments Tuesday.

GRAHAM BACKS CHENEY AMID ATTACKS OVER HER TRUMP IMPEACHMENT VOTE

Politico reported Wednesday that McCarthy would try to work out a deal with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., to get Democrats to back off a vote to remove Greene from committees, which would place House GOP members in a painful political position. But according to a statement from Hoyer Wednesday, nothing came of their conversation and the House will vote to strip Greene of her committee assignments Thursday.

Responding to earlier reports that McCarthy might have been considering removing her from at least one committee to preempt a House vote, Greene said in a tweet: ""No matter what @GOPLeader does it would never be enough for the hate America Democrats.""

The movement to remove Cheney as the GOP conference chair is spearheaded by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who traveled to Wyoming last week to hold a political rally against Cheney.

""We are in a battle for the soul of the Republican party and I intend to win it,"" Gaetz said. He was joined by phone by Donald Trump Jr., who said ""it's time to have a change at the top.""

Cheney is backed by a number of other members of the conference, however, including Reps. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas; Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y.; Chip Roy, R-Colo., and Tom Cole, R-Okla. She also received tepid support from McCarthy.

But more recently, some powerful Senate voices have backed Cheney, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who usually does not insert himself into House affairs.

""Liz Cheney is a leader with deep convictions and the courage to act on them. She is an important leader in our party and in our nation. I am grateful for her service and look forward to continuing to work with her on the crucial issues facing our nation,"" McConnell said in a statement Monday.

GOP LAWMAKERS SEEK TO REMOVE OMAR FROM COMMITTEES AS DEMS PRESS TO DROP GREENE FROM PANEL

McConnell has made clear his disdain for Trump after the former president's post-election behavior. But one of the senators who's been most involved in Trump's impeachment defense also backed Cheney.

""I believe @RepLizCheney is one of the strongest and most reliable conservative voices in the Republican Party,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said. ""She is a fiscal and social conservative, and no one works harder to ensure that our military is well prepared.""

He added: ""Liz knows that a strong America is a safe America. She believes we must confront radical Islam and take the fight to them to ensure there are no more 9/11’s. In the eyes of many – Liz Cheney’s experience, leadership, and strength are invaluable to the Republican Party.""

The Republicans who are upset at Cheney over her impeachment vote said that her stance against Trump – who she said ""summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack"" – means she's out of touch with the majority of the House GOP conference, which is still loyal to the twice-impeached former president.

""When Rep. Cheney came out for impeachment today, she failed to consult with the conference, failed to abide by the spirit of the rules of the Republican Conference, and ignored the preferences of Republican voters,"" Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., who was among the first to call for her ouster as conference chair, said. ""She is weakening our conference at a key moment for personal political gain and is unfit to lead.""

There's expected to be major disagreements at the Wednesday conference over what to do about Cheney, who has been working the phones to whip support, multiple sources tell Fox News.

LIVE UPDATES: GRAHAM FOLLOWS MCCONNELL IN DEFENDING CHENEY AFTER HER TRUMP IMPEACHMENT VOTE

They add that Cheney will likely make her case at the meeting but is not expected to apologize for her impeachment vote. Instead, she’s expected to talk about the future of the Republican Party.

Meanwhile, it's likely there will also be a discussion about Greene's future in the House GOP.

House Republicans have been largely silent on Greene, including and especially the leadership. Asked if any decisions were made at a House GOP Steering Committee meeting Tuesday night, Minority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said ""No, we're still going to be working through some things.""

But some Senate Republicans this week, as they threw their support behind Cheney, also condemned Greene, citing past conspiratorial comments.

""Somebody who’s suggested that perhaps no airplane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, that horrifying school shootings were pre-staged, and that the Clintons crashed JFK Jr.’s airplane is not living in reality,"" McConnell said Monday. ""This has nothing to do with the challenges facing American families or the robust debates on substance that can strengthen our party.""

AS MCCARTHY SEEKS UNITY WITH TRUMP, GAETZ SLAMS CHENEY IN WYOMING AMID SPECULATION OVER PRIMARY CHALLENGES

Senate Republican Conference Chair John Barrasso of Wyoming, who has defended Cheney, on Tuesday compared Greene to former Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who the House GOP stripped of committee assignments over racist statements.

""I think our party has to make it very clear that she does not represent us in any way. Our big tent is not large enough to both accommodate conservatives and kooks,"" Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, also said.

What likely won't happen Wednesday is a vote to remove Cheney as the conference chair, which would require a petition that she step down with 20% of the conference – or 43 members – signed on to be submitted at the meeting. Then, it would require a two-thirds vote to suspend the rules – or McCarthy's support – to get to an up-or-down vote on a resolution that Cheney step down.

Instead, it will probably be a longer process with a petition calling for a special conference meeting to consider such a resolution, with the same requirements, submitted after Wednesday. House conservatives say that they have well over 100 members willing to remove Cheney as conference chair.

If those circulating the petition against Cheney do get the requisite number of signatures, then the petition must be granted within 10 legislative days. At that meeting, the resolution could be either voted on immediately with two-thirds support or with McCarthy's support, or it would be sent to a committee. That committee would later report the resolution with a favorable or unfavorable recommendation, which could then be passed by a simple majority vote.

TRUMP PUSHES POLL SHOWING CHENEY WOUNDED IN WYOMING BY IMPEACHMENT VOTE

The resolution would be that Cheney should step down as the leader of the conference, not to actually remove her, so it would not actually have force. But it is not expected that Cheney would attempt to remain conference chair if the resolution passes.

Trump Jr. indicated at the Thursday rally that those interested in ousting Cheney may take their time in this process, warning that if too many Trump-supporting congressmen run for Cheney's spot, she could keep her seat with the support of less than half of the conference.

""Let's find exactly the opposite of her, and let's back that person fully,"" Trump Jr. said at the Gaetz rally. ""But let's not make that decision today. We have some time. Let's find the right one, let's not split this vote up and blow our opportunity to get rid of a RINO.""

What Republicans do about Cheney and Greene may also indicate the path it will take in the post-Trump era.

Some members still want to hold tightly to the former president, who has indicated that he will fuel primary challenges to any members he sees as insufficiently loyal to him. That fear of a primary challenge, plus Trump's loyal base, may guide many members' actions, just as it did during Trump's presidency.

But others worry that if the GOP accepts Greene while rebuking Cheney, it may keep the Trump base happy at the expense of its morality and any hope of winning moderates in future elections.

""I think we should have nothing to do with Marjorie Taylor Greene, and think we should repudiate the things she said and move away from her,"" Romney said.

157,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-conviction-zero-chance-republicans-say-as-dems-move-forward-with-case-on-eve-of-trial,2,"The hearings for the second impeachment trial of former President Trump start on Tuesday and Republicans are making it clear, even before they're gaveled in, that they believe the result is predetermined.

""It's a partisan farce,"" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said of the impeachment effort on ""Fox News Sunday."" Paul added that he does not believe it's possible Trump will be convicted.

""Zero chance of conviction,"" Paul said when asked if he thinks there's a chance the Senate could meet the 67-vote threshold to convict Trump. ""Forty-five Republicans have said it's not even a legitimate proceeding so it's really over before it starts. As far as witnesses, I think unlikely to be witnesses; if they do want witnesses, there's going to be so much evidence that the president had nothing to do with this.""

Indeed, Paul last month raised a point of order in the Senate alleging that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional. This forced a vote and only five Republicans joined the Senate's 50 Democrats in saying that the trial is constitutionally allowed to move forward. That means that 12 Republicans would have to change their minds on whether the trial is constitutional for Democrats to have even a chance of convicting Trump.

REPUBLICAN WHO CALLED ON TRUMP TO RESIGN ADMITS CONVICTION 'VERY UNLIKELY'

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. ‒ who is in favor of convicting Trump and made the case on ""Fox News Sunday"" that the Senate has a responsibility to hold a trial of the former president ‒ even allowed that Paul makes a reasonable point that the trial is unconstitutional.

""I admit this is of course a matter of first impression and so I don't think the case that Senator Paul is making is a ridiculous one,"" he said.

Other top Republicans also believe Trump is highly unlikely to be convicted, which if it does happen, could result in him being barred from holding office in the future.

""They know that this has no chance of winning. There's no chance of the president actually being convicted here,"" Trump 2020 senior adviser Jason Miller said on Fox News Sunday. ""This is designed to try to implement political pain, so to speak, over the course of a week, maybe a week and a half, and then they're going to move on. They're not even taking this seriously.""

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., meanwhile, criticized the process of the impeachment in the House, saying it tainted proceedings in the Senate.

""Let's face it, the House did an incredibly poor job of building a case before the impeachment vote,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""There was no process. I mean, it's almost like, you know, if it happened in the Soviet Union, you would have called it a show trial.""

Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that the trial is ""designed for nine House Democrats to do two things — to get political vengeance and have a viral moment.""

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT IS 'PARTISAN FARCE,' SCHUMER WOULD DESERVE TO BE IMPEACHED TOO: RAND PAUL

Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., added on CNN that because 45 Republicans have already said the trial is unconstitutional, ""you can infer how likely it is that those folks will vote to convict.""

As for Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., he said ""the outcome is not really in doubt.""

""Impeachment is a political process. We've never impeached a president once they're out of office. I think this is a really bad idea. Forty-five-plus Republicans are going to vote early on that it's unconstitutional. It's not a question of how the trial ends. It's a question of when it ends,"" Graham said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""The only question is will they call witnesses? How long does the trial take?""

Graham also said that he does not endorse the events of Jan. 6 and didn't walk back his previous statements holding Trump partially responsible for the attack on the Capitol. But Graham said he does not believe Trump actually committed a crime, and that the trial itself should not be moving forward.

""It's not a crime. The House is impeaching him under the grounds that his speech created a riot,"" Graham said. ""If you believe he committed a crime, he can be prosecuted like any other citizen. Impeachment is a political process. We've never impeached a president once they're out of office.""

Trump's trial stems from an impeachment vote in the House on Jan. 13, one week after a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol. Trump for months made false claims that he won the presidential election before gathering a massive crowd in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, the day Congress was set to certify the presidential election results. Trump said the rally would be ""wild.""

LIVE UPDATES: REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT FACE BACKLASH AT HOME

During that speech, Trump doubled down on his false claims about the election and said, ""If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore."" Trump did tell his followers to march ""peacefully and patriotically"" to the Capitol, but those who favor his impeachment and conviction say the balance of his post-election behavior and his comments at the rally made clear the president was the cause of the violence at the Capitol. Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, called for ""trial by combat"" on the very same stage that morning.

After the rally ended at 1:12 p.m., and Trump told his followers to ""walk down,"" the Capitol began to be locked down as the attack intensified shortly after 2 p.m.

""The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,"" Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said of her vote to impeach Trump last month. ""Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the president.""

Even though the final outcome is very clear on the eve of the Senate's impeachment trial, what's less clear is the path the Senate takes to conviction.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have yet to announce an agreement on how the hearings for the trial itself will work. The only thing that is currently known is that the affair will gavel-in at 1 p.m. on Tuesday and that Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., will oversee the proceedings.

What's unknown, as Graham said, is how long the trial will last, if there will be witnesses, how the trial will be structured as it's happening, and if the Senate will split its time between tackling legislation and nominations and holding the trial, or if it will only take care of trial proceedings.

SEN. MURPHY: 'WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY' TO HOLD TRUMP'S TRIAL

Murphy said he hopes the Senate will split its days between the trial and other business, saying, ""the Senate can walk and chew gum at the same time.""

A potential agreement for a trial framework is being shopped around to senators to see if they could agree on it. The trial would start with four hours of debate on whether the trial is constitutional, then a vote on whether to proceed. There also could be debate and a vote on if impeachment managers can call witnesses, which would be subject to a simple majority threshold.

And the trial framework would be modified from six days per week with Sundays off to six days per week with Saturdays off. Trump lawyer David Schoen observes the Jewish Sabbath, so he's requested that the trial stop by 5 p.m. Friday and resume Sunday.

Murphy also argued that it's constitutional for the Senate to move ahead with the trial and it's not critical there be witnesses at the Senate trial, but they should be allowed if the impeachment managers request them.

""There is clear precedent for the Senate moving forward on impeachment trial once being sent articles, even after an official has left office and so, you know, my analysis here sort of begins and ends with what is my constitutional responsibility,"" he said. ""This time we saw what happened in real time. President Trump sent that angry mob to the Capitol on live TV, so it's not as important that you have witnesses. But if the House managers want witnesses we should allow them to be able to put them on.""

Also happening Monday, the House impeachment managers and Trump's defense team will submit a second round of briefs to the Senate, as part of a pretrial deal struck between McConnell and Schumer. Those briefs should provide a further window into how each side will present its argument after they submitted a round of briefs last week.

Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., predicted Sunday on MSNBC that the impeachment managers will ""make a great presentation.""

""Well, first of all, I know that our impeachment managers are going to do a terrific job. If you take a look at the briefs that they've already exposed somewhat, you will see that they have the information. They have the facts. And they have connected the dots,"" she said.

One of the arguments that Trump's defense team is likely to use is comparing Trump's post-election rhetoric to words from various Democrats. This could include comments Schumer made about Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, which caused Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a condemnation of the senator, and comments Waters made previously about what people should do if they see Trump officials in public.

""They’re not going to be able to go to a restaurant, they’re not going to be able to stop at a gas station, they’re not going to be able to shop at a department store,"" she said. ""The people are going to turn on them, they're going to protest, they’re going to absolutely harass them.""

Waters on MSNBC, however, said she has ""absolutely"" never glorified violence.

158,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-saudi-led-offensive-operations-yemen,2,"President Biden announced Thursday that the U.S. will end its support for Saudi-led offensive operations in Yemen against Houthi rebels, as part of a new foreign policy outlook by the new administration.

""This war has to end, and to underscore our commitment we are ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arm sales,"" Biden said.

UN EXPERTS FIND 'GROWING' EVIDENCE IRAN SENDING WEAPONS TO HOUTHI REBELS IN WAR-TORN YEMEN

Earlier, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan pointed to the stopping of two arms sales of precision-guided munitions that were moving forward under the last administration as an example.

Biden noted the Saudis are attacked by weapons and UAVs from ""Iranian-supplied forces in multiple countries"" and promised to support the Saudis in defending their sovereignty and people.

He also pledged his support for U.N. initiatives to apply a cease-fire, ensure humanitarian aid, and restore peace talks between the two sides.

The civil war, which has been ongoing since 2015, has led to the deaths of 112,000 people and has obliterated the country’s infrastructure. U.N. estimates say 13.5 million Yemenis face food insecurity.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION PUTS A FREEZE ON TRUMP-ERA ARMS SALES OVERSEAS

Biden also announced Timothy Lenderking, a career foreign service member who has served in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, as a special envoy to Yemen.

The actions are part of a number of moves related to foreign policy announced by Biden in the speech from the State Department. He also promised to raise U.S. admissions of refugees, and said the Penatagon would be conducting a global posture review of U.S. forces -- which includes a pause on the withdrawal of troops from Germany.

He said his administration would ""course correct our foreign policy and better unite our democratic values with our diplomatic leadership.""

""America cannot afford to absent any longer from the world stage,"" he said.

The Yemen civil war began in 2015 when Saudi began the offensive against the Houthis, who had seized territory and launched missiles across the border into Saudi Arabia.

The U.S. has, until recently, backed the Saudis in the conflict and Trump-era Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had imposed sanctions on the Houthis in the final days of the administration, designating them a ""foreign terrorist organization"" (FTO). That move was part of the administration’s efforts to isolate Iran and also support the Saudis in the region.

US EXPLORING NEW BASES IN SAUDI ARABIA AMID IRAN TENSIONS

However, since taking office, the Biden administration has suspended some of the sanctions attached to that designation until Feb. 26 -- although it hasn’t yet reversed the designation. A U.N. report warned that the designation of the Houthis as an FTO could harm aid and food deliveries into the country, hurting the peace process and exacerbating malnutrition.

That report by a panel of experts painted a grim situation of the crisis.

""The situation in Yemen has continued to deteriorate, with devastating consequences for the civilian population,"" it said.

It accuses all parties involved of ""continuous and widespread human rights and international law violations with impunity; and escalations in fighting and its impact on civilians, including displacements.""

""All parties continue to commit egregious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, including indiscriminate attacks against civilians, enforced disappearances and torture,"" the report says.

The report also said ""there is a growing body of evidence that shows that individuals or entities within the Islamic Republic of Iran are engaged in sending weapons and weapons components to the Houthis"" in violation of U.N. resolutions.

159,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-set-to-prosecute-case-at-trump-impeachment-trial-amid-speculation-over-which-republicans-might-convict,2,"The House impeachment managers will begin their opening arguments on the merits of the impeachment of former President Donald Trump when the chamber convenes at noon on Wednesday, following a 56-44 Senate vote to move ahead with the trial Tuesday.

Meanwhile, speculation is running rampant about which Republicans may vote to convict Trump. The attention has mainly been on a group of moderate senators, but also includes Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that McConnell hasn't decided how he'll vote on the final conviction question and has told other Republicans that their vote is a personal decision.

That's consistent with previous comments by McConnell that have been reported. And a source close to McConnell told Fox News that there's nothing new he's saying or doing ""at all other than his vote yesterday on Constitutionality, which in itself, was a repeat of the vote from the week before.""

It's almost certain that 17 Republicans won't vote to convict Trump -- the number necessary for Democrats to reach the 67-vote supermajority threshold. That's bolstered by the fact McConnell and 43 other Republicans voted Tuesday that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional. But the House impeachment managers are hopeful they can get more Republicans on board to deliver a stronger rebuke to the former president.

They made some progress in that direction Tuesday when Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., switched his vote from against the trial's constitutionality in a test vote forced by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., last month to in favor of constitutionality. Cassidy had said his previous vote ""was a vote in a moment in time"" and that his Tuesday vote was because ""the House managers had much stronger constitutional arguments. The president’s team did not.""

TRUMP 'BEYOND ANGRY' WITH IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE TEAM'S SHOWING: SOURCES

""We were told that it would be completely partisan and locked from the last vote and it wasn’t, so people's minds are open,"" lead House impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said. ""We haven't started the evidence yet, but we're starting tomorrow.""

The impeachment managers are expected to make the case that Trump is fundamentally responsible for the attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters that resulted in multiple deaths and forced hundreds of lawmakers and former Vice President Pence into hiding -- interrupting the certification of the 2020 presidential election result.

""After spending months propagating the lie that the 2020 election had been stolen from him, President Trump summoned his supporters to a rally in Washington on January 6,"" the impeachment managers said in a brief Tuesday, offering a preview of their trial argument. ""Against this backdrop, President Trump addressed a crowd that he knew was armed and primed for violence. He falsely raged to the crowd that the Joint Session was the culmination of a treasonous plot to destroy America. He exhorted his supporters to ""fight like hell [or] you’re not going to have a country anymore.""

They continued: ""And he urged the mob to march to the Capitol, telling them that ""[y]ou’ll never take back our country with weakness. He thus lit the match of insurrection and threw it into the powder keg he had spent months creating.""

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., not an impeachment manager but one of their key supporters in the upper chamber, said Tuesday that Trump fed ""the mob the lies that motivated their behavior.""

SCHUMER ASKS REPUBLICANS TO KEEP OPEN MIND AT TRUMP TRIAL, SAYS HE FED MOB 'LIES THAT MOTIVATE THEIR BEHAVIOR'

The five senators initially getting the most attention as possible conviction votes were Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah; Susan Collins, R-Maine; Ben Sasse, R-Neb.; Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. This is because they are all well-known Trump critics within the GOP and they all voted for the trial's constitutionality last month. Cassidy joins the group under watch for a vote to convict after his Tuesday vote to move ahead with the trial.

Cassidy made clear Tuesday, however, this his initial vote ""is not a prejudgment on the final vote to convict.""

Democrats are expected to make a highly visual case on Trump's responsibility for inciting an insurrection, the fundamental charge in the article of impeachment. On Tuesday, they played a graphic video of the events of Jan. 6 to a solemn Senate chamber, showing Trump's inflammatory rhetoric at his rally that day, his supporters saying he sent them to the Capitol and the damage done by the mob.

They'll also aim to parry arguments from the Trump legal team that the impeachment was not done fairly and that his actions were protected by the First Amendment, among others.

""The events that form the basis for President Trump’s impeachment occurred in plain view. They are well known to the American people,"" the impeachment managers wrote in a brief, addressing the due process argument. ""Many Members of Congress were themselves witnesses to his conduct and its consequences. There is no basis on which President Trump could assert that what a horrified Nation saw with its own eyes, and heard with its own ears, is somehow 'fake news.'""

IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS SAY TRUMP 'HAS NO GOOD DEFENSE' IN REPLY TO PRESIDENT'S PRE-TRIAL BRIEF

""The First Amendment has no application in an impeachment proceeding, which does not seek to punish unlawful speech, but instead to protect the Nation from a President who violated his oath of office and abused the public trust,"" the impeachment managers said on Trump's First Amendment argument.

They add: ""President Trump attempts to equate his January 6 speech to statements by other politicians, arguing that convicting him will chill political speech. But context matters under the First Amendment. While other political figures have used heated rhetoric, none of the speeches that President Trump cites bears any resemblance to President Trump’s anti-democratic effort to prolong his presidency by exhorting a mob to attack the Congress.""

Trump's lawyers, however, say that the trial is ""political theater"" and that his Jan. 6 comments do not comport with Democrats' narrative that he incited the crowd to storm the Capitol.

There is no basis on which President Trump could assert that what a horrified Nation saw with its own eyes, and heard with its own ears, is somehow 'fake news.' — Brief from House impeachment managers

""Mr. Trump spoke for approximately one hour and fifteen minutes. Of the over 10,000 words spoken, Mr. Trump used the word 'fight' a little more than a handful of times and each time in the figurative sense that has long been accepted in public discourse when urging people to stand and use their voices to be heard on matters important to them; it was not and could not be construed to encourage acts of violence,"" Trump's lawyers said in a brief filed Monday.

The House managers have up to 16 hours over the court of two days to make their case to the senators, although they may take less time. Then Trump's legal team will have the same opportunity.

By this time, the trial will likely be bleeding into the weekend, and senators will have four hours to question the lawyers for each side, before two hours of debate on whether to allow witnesses, if indeed either party asks to bring witnesses.

That vote will likely determine if the trial comes to a quick conclusion early-to-mid next week or if it could drag on potentially much longer before a final vote.

The fate of U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who runs the office in Delaware, has been the source of some speculation. It is standard procedure for new presidents to ask for the resignation of all U.S. attorneys once they enter the office. But Fox News peppered the Biden transition team with questions about Weiss’ future and his team did take an official stance. Biden has promised to restore the Justice Department’s independence from the White House.

The senior official also told Fox that John Durham, the U.S. district attorney in Connecticut who was named special counsel to investigate the origins of the FBI probe into the 2016 election, will resign from his position, but he will stay on as special counsel, the source said.

The transition is expected to begin on Tuesday and could take weeks to complete.

The DOJ has been investigating the finances of Hunter Biden, including scrutinizing some of his Chinese business dealings and other transactions. The tax investigation was launched in 2018, the year before the elder Biden announced his candidacy for president. Hunter Biden confirmed the existence of the investigation in December after a round of subpoenas was issued in the case.

Trump and his allies have accused Hunter Bidden of profiting off his political connections, and have also raised questions about his work in Ukraine at the time his father was vice president and leading the Obama administration’s dealings with the Eastern European nation.

Sources familiar with Durham’s investigation told Fox News last week that the prosecution of high-level FBI officials, like former Director James Comey, is ""unlikely."" Durham completed the CIA portion of his investigation last year -- and has now shifted his focus to activities of the FBI, the sources said.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, urged acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson to ""refrain from interfering"" in Durham’s investigation and the federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s ""tax affairs"" while the Senate works to confirm Biden’s nominee to lead the Justice Department.

""President Biden committed to pursuing practical, results-oriented engagements when it advances the interests of the American people and those of our allies,"" the White House said.

Senior administration officials before the call Wednesday night said that Biden would lay down the ""range of concerns"" he has with China’s actions and policies while ensuring that the two leaders keep ""an open line of communication.""

One senior administration official said Biden approached the call with Xi Wednesday night ""hard-headed, practical, clear-eyed, and rooted in a deep familiarity with his counterpart on the other end of the line.""

Another official said that the U.S. is being ""very careful in our initial interactions with China,"" and that the administration is ""trying to be clear where our priorities are.""

The president’s ""prescription"" for U.S.-China relations, according to administration officials, is to strengthen U.S. economic foundation at home and make investments.

""We can get everything else right in our China, Asia policy, but if we get that wrong, we are not going to prevail in this competition, and in general, we are not going to prevail in our foreign policy,"" an administration official said. ""This is a core part of our China strategy, and we believe we are off to a very strong start on this.""

Last week, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that a ""priority"" of the Biden administration is ""dealing with China’s trade abuses"" that harm American workers. Sullivan said the Biden administration’s national security strategy will allow the United States to ""compete more effectively"" with China and said the national security team is focused on ""creating jobs and raising wages here in the United States.""

But officials on Wednesday also said the Biden Administration will focus on rebuilding alliances and partnerships ""not out of nostalgia,"" but for the purpose of holding China ""accountable for its abuses.""

""We are engaged deeply at the presidential level and at every level below that with European partners on issues of trade and security, and there is a lot more work to do on this front,"" the official said.

Senior administration officials also said Wednesday that an ""immediate"" focus is on technology— an area they say they have already started working with Republicans on—a move they say is ""required in key industries of the future,"" referring to supply chain issues, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, biotech, clean energy and more.

Intelligence officials have told Fox News that China exploits the U.S. government and industry supply chains by using trusted suppliers and vendors against the U.S.

As for trade, officials said that they have ""not taken any precipitous actions,"" and have maintained Trump-era tariffs, but they maintained that it is ""not because we believe the trade war was successful, but because we believe we have to very carefully, in consultation with allies and partners, in consultation with Congress, work through the leverage we have on the economic front and move out with a sharper, and more effective trade strategy toward China.""

BIDEN 'PRIORITY IS DEALING WITH CHINA'S TRADE ABUSES' THAT HARM AMERICAN WORKERS, SULLIVAN SAYS

Officials said that the Biden Administration is keeping the tariffs put in place under the Trump administration while they conduct ""an intense consultation and review.""

""We are keeping them in place until we are ready to roll out an affirmative trade strategy built on the proposition that we are better off executing jointly with allies rather than by ourselves,"" the official said. ""That is going to take some time.""

Officials rejected suggestions that they were engaging in a ""continuation"" of Trump-era policies, saying that ""there will be changes to trade policy toward China"" which will ""unfold"" over time.

""We need a substantially different strategy toward China, but one that does point in the direction of intense strategic competition,"" the official said. ""That is the strategy that the Biden Administration will pursue.""

Officials said that in order to ""effectively prevail"" in competition with China, the U.S. needs to ""compete from a position of strength.""

""This is something that from our perspective is a sustainable strategy that will play out, not over the course of days or weeks or even months, it will play out over the course of years,"" one official said. ""That doesn’t mean there isn’t urgency. There is urgency and we are acting urgently, but also means that we need to stick with this and we need to play the long game, and in playing the long game, we need to be making these investments in these foundational components of the strategy now—effectively, comprehensively, decisively, and in a way where we are gathering the additional sources of strength we need to be able to prevail over time.""

Since taking office just three weeks ago, Biden officials have reviewed the Trump administration’s policies with regard to China and said they ""found merit in the basic proposition,"" which was ""an intense strategic competition with China"" and the need for the U.S. to ""engage in that vigorously and systematically"" across the government.

But officials said that they found ""deep problems with the way in which the Trump administration went about that competition.""

""Our diagnosis was that the Trump strategy depleted core American sources of strength that put us in a weaker position with which to carry on that competition,"" one senior administration official said, saying that, under the Trump administration, there was a ""weakening of our political and economic model at home and a weakening of our alliances,"" as well as a ""lack of clarity and consistency"" around values ""that have long been the core part of American foreign policy.""

Meanwhile, senior administration officials stressed the ""need for a clear and consistent subscription to American values, universal values of human rights, human dignity, democracy, and here we have spoken out with clarity on our commitments.""

One senior administration official pointed to the military coup in Burma, saying that is the ""first test"" the administration has had, noting that they have responded ""swiftly, decisively, and in concert with other countries.""

BIDEN SAYS US WILL 'IMMEDIATELY SANCTION' MILITARY LEADERS WHO DIRECTED COUP IN BURMA

The president on Wednesday approved an executive order to ""immediately sanction"" military leaders who directed the coup in Burma, calling on them to ""immediately release"" democratic leaders and activists.

The president also said the U.S. government was now taking steps to prevent those military generals from having access to Burmese government funds held by the U.S. and will impose ""strong export controls"" while freezing U.S. assets that benefit the Burmese government.

Biden said, though, that the U.S. would continue its support for health care, civil society groups and other areas that ""benefit the people of Burma directly.""

But as for China, a senior administration official said that there has been a ""sense of change"" in its pattern of behavior that is causing ""concern"" among partners like India, Australia, and Korea—some of those concerns involving sanctions, ""unprecedented economic attacks,"" and increased activities of the Chinese military in the South China Sea.

The official added that some in Asia are concerned that the United States ""is not going to play its traditional role.""

""We have been the supporter, and in many respects, the architect, of the operating system of Asia,"" the official said, pointing to treaties, support for trade, freedom of navigation, and efforts toward peaceful resolution of disputes, calling it ""complex,"" but ""effective period of accumulation of wealth and pulling people out of poverty in the history of mankind.""

""It is not surprising that China has sought to undermine elements of that. Rising powers do that,"" the official said. ""They want to redesign the system in ways that are beneficial to it.""

The official said that Asian allies and partners signaled that the ""most worrisome blows to the system have come from the U.S.""

The official pointed to the Trump administration, saying that allies have taken issue with ""unpredictability when it comes to every element of diplomacy, kind of weird interactions with North Korea.""

""What Asian friends and others want is, first and foremost, a domestic recovery and a vigilance and purposeful approach and a steadiness in terms of how we engage going forward,"" the official said.

The official added, though, that the United States is in a position where ""if we can get through the next six to eight months, we will be able to surge forward and continue to play a strong role in the Asia Pacific and also find areas that are consequential and important that we can work with China.""

As for working with China, Biden Administration officials said that there are areas in ""mutual common interest,"" including on nuclear proliferation and climate.

Meanwhile, Fox News reported earlier this week that Secretary of State Tony Blinken and White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan believe that China poses ""the greatest long-term national security threat to the United States.""

ODNI WARNS CHINA'S COLLECTION OF US HEALTH CARE DATA, DNA POSE 'SERIOUS RISKS' TO ECONOMIC, NATIONAL SECURITY

The top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told Fox News that he had met with both Blinken and Sullivan, who signaled that sentiment.

""While we’re not able to read out individual meetings, he regularly discusses Biden administration national security priorities in these conversations, certainly including dealing with the long-term strategic challenge posed by China in coordination with our allies and partners,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne told Fox News.

""Our priority is not to get access for Goldman Sachs in China,"" Sullivan said. ""Our priority is dealing with China’s trade abuses harming American workers in the United States.""

National security and intelligence officials from the Biden administration, and the Trump administration before leaving office, have pointed to a number of threats China poses to the U.S. — including espionage, intellectual property theft, and malign foreign influence.

During her confirmation hearing, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines also committed to focusing on providing intelligence to support efforts to ""out-compete China."""
162,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/13/obama-task-force-reportedly-to-urge-overhaul-nsa-spy-tactics/?intcmp=latestnews,2,"The Obama administration does not plan to split the positions of National Security Agency director and chief of the U.S. Cyber Command into two, Fox News confirmed Friday.

The White House had been weighing breaking up the spy agency and the Cyber Command unit which carries out cyber warfare, but has chosen to keep it under one job. The push to split was seen by some as a way to rein in the controversy over widespread surveillance programs leaked by former contractor Edward Snowden.

The news comes on the heels of a presidential review panel tasked with examining policies and procedures at the National Security Agency. The panel drafted a series of proposals that would overhaul the agency's surveillance tactics, Fox News confirmed.

The panel's draft recommendations would limit how the spy agency collects and retains the electronic information of Americans and change the agency's leadership from military to civilian.

The panel proposed that the records of most phone calls made in the United States be held instead by the phone company or a third-party organization. Stricter standards for NSA access to the data were also recommended, according to the report.

White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden declined a request by The Wall Street Journal to comment on the report, which will be formally submitted to the White House on Sunday. The draft proposals aren't binding and could change before the final draft is submitted.

One of the panel's recommendations ""aligns very closely"" with legislation introduced by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wisc., chairman of the House Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee, a source told the Journal.

The Leahy-Sensenbrenner proposal would end the bulk collection of Americans' phone records and provide more safeguards for warrantless surveillance. Other lawmakers, such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have offered less aggressive reforms.

At a Senate hearing Wednesday, NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander defended the spy programs exposed by leaker Snowden in June that collect billions of phone and Internet records from around the world.

""How do we connect the dots?"" Alexander said, referring to often-hidden links between a foreign terror threat and a potential attack on the U.S. ""There is no other way that we know of to connect the dots. ... Taking these programs off the table is absolutely not the thing to do.""

During an Aug. 9 speech, Obama said the review panel's members would ""consider how we can maintain the trust of the people, how we can make sure that there absolutely is no abuse in terms of how these surveillance technologies are used.""

The panel is exempt from the U.S. Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires such committees to conduct open meetings and notify the public about their activities.

Four of the five review panel members previously worked for Democratic administrations: Peter Swire, former Office of Management and Budget privacy director under President Bill Clinton; Michael Morell, Obama's former deputy CIA director; Richard Clarke, former counterterrorism coordinator under Clinton and later for President George W. Bush; and Cass Sunstein, Obama's former regulatory czar. A fifth panel member, Geoffrey Stone of the University of Chicago, was an informal adviser to Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.

163,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/04/21/ukraine-reportedly-presents-evidence-kremlin-agents-in-eastern-ukraine/?intcmp=latestnews,2,"Ukraine's interim government says it has proof that Russian military and intelligence forces are fomenting the unrest that has destabilized the eastern part of that country since Russia's annexation of Crimea last month.

The New York Times reports that photos and descriptions circulated by the Kiev government show that some of the so-called ""green men"" -- gunmen who have seized government buildings and demanded Crimea-style referenda on becoming part of Russia -- have been identified in other photos as being among Russian troops.

The Times also reports that one of the men in the photos has been identified as Igor Ivanovich Strelkov, a veteran Russian military and intelligence operative. Strelkov is believed to have served Russia undercover both in Crimea and in the city of Slovyansk, one of the centers of the most recent unrest.

Last week, Ukrainian authorities released a wanted poster for Mr. Strelkov, accompanied by a pencil sketch of his gaunt face. ""What, they can't even get a proper photo of him?"" one of the men behind the sandbagged entrance to the city council of Slovyansk over the weekend, who referred to himself simply as Daisy, told a Wall Street Journal reporter. When asked about the role of Russian intelligence, the man declined to answer and told a reporter to leave immediately.

The Obama administration has endorsed the claims of the Ukrainians, saying that Russia could face new economic sanctions if government buildings currently occupied by demonstrators are not vacated under the terms of an agreement reached Thursday among Russian, Ukrainian, American and European diplomats. Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to arrive in Ukraine Monday morning to meet with Ukraine's interim prime minister and president, as well as other officials.

Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have repeatedly denied that Russian forces are involved in the unrest, which began after the February deposition of pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. That message is backed up by the separatists themselves, who claim that their movement is entirely homegrown and in response to what they consider an illegal coup that resulted in Yanukovych's downfall.

The unit accused of operating in eastern Ukraine is known as the GRU, the Russian acronym for the Main Intelligence Department of the Russian General Staff. It is an elite Russian military intelligence unit that has participated in virtually every military conflict in which Moscow has been embroiled in recent decades, including wars in Afghanistan, Chechnya and Georgia.

In eastern Ukraine, Ukraine's State Security Service alleges the Russian operatives' task is to coordinate pro-Russian militias, help them identify targets and carry out seizures of key installations, such as police and security headquarters, government offices and communications infrastructure.

Ukrainian security officials say Russian intelligence has spent years building up a network of sleeper agents in eastern Ukraine. One of them, they say, is Igor Bezler, a 49-year-old Crimean native who they say served in the GRU until 2002, when he moved to the eastern city of Horlivka. There, he worked as a security guard and as head of a funeral company.

Then, last week, after a pro-Russian mob took over the town's police station, a video posted on a local news organization's website showed him parading in fatigues in front of a couple dozen local police, identifying himself as a lieutenant colonel in the Russian army and telling them they had a new chief. Ukrainian officials allege he was tasked earlier this month with seizing state-security buildings in Donetsk region, then taking the police station in Horlivka.

""The fact that the Russians have woken up these networks is evidence that we're dealing with a serious operation, not a game,"" a senior Ukrainian security official told the Journal. Now, Mr. Bezler is occupying the police station with a group of armed men, officials say. According to local police, Mr. Bezler told them he had an order ""from the center in Slovyansk"" to hold the building at any cost and had sufficient force to do so.

The separatists' endgame is unclear. Some talk of federalization within Ukraine; others want independence; yet others dream of a Crimea scenario, energized by Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent mention of Novorossiya (literally, New Russia), a tsarist-era imperial term for what is now southeastern Ukraine. Moscow's goals have also been unclear in comparison to the Crimea campaign, in which Moscow rapidly annexed the peninsula.

It did not go as planned.

Witnesses say he writhed and shook on the table. Twenty minutes after the lethal injection had been administered, Mr. Lockett died of a heart attack.

[pullquote]

Immediately, the online and on television commentariat began morally preening over the state executing Clayton Lockett.

Liberals and even some conservatives were outraged.

Liberals are again calling for the end of all executions. They do not want Oklahoma to execute its next murderer on death row.

Much was tweeted and much will be written and said today about the savagery of executions. Some will declare all executions “cruel and unusual,” thereby suggesting they are unconstitutional — never mind the long history of executions in this country.

One person who will not weigh in on the merits of Clayton Lockett’s execution is Stephanie Neiman. Clayton Lockett tried to rob a house Miss Neiman was at. She tried to fight him off. He and his accomplices overwhelmed her.

They beat her, bound her with duct tape, taped her mouth shut, shot her, then buried her alive. Many of those outraged at how Mr. Lockett’s execution played out will, hopefully, pause to reflect on exactly why the state chose to execute him.

Sadly, Stephanie Neiman, is unavailable for comment on the situation."
165,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/05/20/in-surprise-move-thailand-army-declares-martial-law-after-months-unrest/?intcmp=latestnews,2,"Thailand's powerful army declared martial law Tuesday and deployed troops into the heart of Bangkok in a dramatic move it said was aimed at stabilizing the Southeast Asian country after six months of turbulent political unrest. The military insisted a coup d'etat was not underway.

The surprise, pre-dawn operation, which places the army in charge of public security nationwide, came amid deepening uncertainty over the nation's fate and one day after the caretaker prime minister refused to step down in the face of long-running anti-government protests.

Although soldiers entered multiple television stations to broadcast the army message, life in the vast skyscraper-strewn metropolis of 10 million people remained largely unaffected, with schools, businesses and tourist sites open and traffic flowing as usual.

In front of one of the country's most luxurious shopping malls, bystanders gawked at soldiers in jeeps mounted with machine guns who briefly diverted traffic. The mood wasn't tense; passers-by stopped to take cell phone pictures of the soldiers.

Thailand, an economic hub for Southeast Asia, has been gripped by off-and-on political turmoil since 2006, when former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was toppled by a military coup after being accused of corruption, abuse of power and disrespect for King Bhumibol Adulyadej. His overthrow triggered a power struggle that in broad terms pits Thaksin's supporters among a rural majority against a conservative establishment in Bangkok.

The army, seen by many as sympathetic to anti-government protesters, has staged 11 coups since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932. But it made no moves Tuesday to dissolve the country's constitution or its current, caretaker government.

Acting Prime Minister Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan -- who was not consulted beforehand on the army move -- called an emergency Cabinet meeting at an undisclosed location. In a brief statement, Niwattumrong said only that the government hopes the military action will ""bring peace back to the people of every group and every side.""

Education Minister Chaturon Chaisang, however, said in a post on his Facebook page that martial law was not an answer and warned it could ""eventually spiral into a situation in which the military has no choice but to stage a coup.""

Thailand's problems are ""fundamentally political problems that must be solved through political processes under democracy ... not military or security measures,"" Chaturon said.

The military statement was issued Tuesday by army chief Gen. Prayuth Chan-Ocha, who cited a 1914 law that gives the authority to intervene during crises. He said the military took action to avert street clashes between political rivals.

""The Royal Thai Army intends to bring back peace and order to the beloved country of every Thai as soon as possible,"" he said. We ""intend to see the situation resolved quickly.""

Prayuth met Tuesday afternoon with senior officials from government agencies, provincial governors and representatives from the country's independent agencies -- but not the Cabinet.

The latest round of unrest started last November, when demonstrators took to the streets to try to oust then-Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin's sister. She dissolved the lower house of parliament in December in a bid to ease the crisis, and later led a weakened, caretaker government.

Earlier this month, the Constitutional Court ousted Yingluck and nine Cabinet ministers for abuse of power. But the move, which left the ruling party in charge of government, did little to resolve the conflict.

Competing protests in Bangkok have raised concerns of more violence, which were heightened by anti-government protesters who set a Monday deadline for achieving their goals of ousting the remnants of the government.

An overnight attack last week on the main anti-government protest site left 3 dead and more than 20 injured. It raised the toll since November to 28 dead and drew a strong televised rebuke from the army chief.

""This week looked ominous,"" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. ""There was a strong likelihood of violence and turmoil.""

""Martial law is intended to impose peace and order, but the key will be the army treatment of the two sides,"" Thitinan said. ""If the army is seen as favoring one side over the other, then we could see the situation spiral and deteriorate. If the army is seen as even-handed ... we could actually see the situation improving.""

Throughout the morning, the army issued multiple edicts. In one, they asked TV and radio stations to be on standby to interrupt programming for army broadcasts when asked. At least 10 politically affiliated private TV stations from both sides ceased broadcasting -- after armed soldiers entered and requested they do so.

Prayuth said rival protesters could remain at their rally sites as long as remain peaceful and stop marching. The leader of anti-government demonstrators, Suthep Thaugsuban, handed a bouquet of flowers to army officers taking care of the Government House complex as his supporters vacated a building they had occupied for a week.

The leader of the pro-government Red Shirt movement, Jatuporn Prompan, said his group could accept martial law, but ""won't tolerate a coup or other non-constitutional means"" to grab power.

""We will see what the army wants,"" he said, warning that the undemocratic removal of the country's caretaker government ""will never solve the country's crisis and will plunge Thailand deeper into trouble.""

Red Shirts had been massing for days on the outskirts of Bangkok, and Jatuporn said his supporters were being ""surrounded."" More than 100 soldiers deployed near the rally venue with coils of barbed wire to block roads; they appeared to be taking over control of the area from police and rumors spread they would conduct a raid in search for weapons.

Brad Adams, Asia Director for Human Rights Watch, said denounced the army move, calling it ""a de facto coup.""

""The military has pulled a 100 year old law off the shelf that makes the civilian administration subordinate to the military, effectively rendering the executive, legislative and judicial branches powerless,"" Adams said.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said the U.S. was ""very concerned about the deepening political crisis in Thailand.""

We ""urge all parties to respect democratic principles, including respect for freedom of speech,"" she said. ""We expect the Army to honor its commitment to make this a temporary action to prevent violence, and to not undermine democratic institutions.""

On Monday, Thailand's acting prime minister insisted his government will not resign, resisting pressure from a group of senators who are seeking ways to settle the country's political crisis, and from anti-government protesters who are demanding an appointed prime minister.

A group of about 70 senators, most of them seen as siding with anti-government protesters, proposed a framework Friday that calls for a new interim government with full power to conduct political reforms. The Senate, the country's only functioning legislative body, had been seen as the last resort of the anti-government protesters."

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/06/12/white-house-weighs-sending-fresh-aid-to-iraq-amid-distrust-al-maliki/",2,"WASHINGTON — As the threat from Sunni militants in western Iraq escalated last month, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki secretly asked the Obama administration to consider carrying out airstrikes against extremist staging areas, according to Iraqi and American officials.

But Iraq’s appeals for a military response have so far been rebuffed by the White House, which has been reluctant to open a new chapter in a conflict that President Obama has insisted was over when the United States withdrew the last of its forces from Iraq in 2011.

The swift capture of Mosul by militants aligned with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria has underscored how the conflicts in Syria and Iraq have converged into one widening regional insurgency with fighters coursing back and forth through the porous border between the two countries. But it has also called attention to the limits the White House has imposed on the use of American power in an increasingly violent and volatile region.

A spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Bernadette Meehan, declined to comment on Mr. Maliki’s requests. “We are not going to get into details of our diplomatic discussions,” she said in a statement. “The current focus of our discussions with the government of Iraq and our policy considerations is to build the capacity of the Iraqis to successfully confront” the Islamic extremists."

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/09/16/ebola-crisis-us-sending-3000-military-personnel-west-africa/",2,"President Obama will announce Tuesday that the U.S. military will take the lead in overseeing what has been a chaotic and widely criticized response to the worst Ebola outbreak in history, dispatching up to 3,000 military personnel to West Africa in an effort that could cost up to $750 million over the next six months, according to senior administration officials.

By the end of the week, a general sent by U.S. Africa Command will be in place in Monrovia, Liberia — the country where transmission rates are increasing exponentially — to lead the effort called Operation United Assistance. The general will head a regional command based in Liberia that will help oversee and coordinate U.S. and international relief efforts while a new, separate regional staging base will help accelerate transportation of urgently needed equipment, supplies and personnel.

In addition, the Pentagon will send engineers to set up 17 treatment centers in Liberia — each with a 100-bed capacity — as well as medical personnel to train up to 500 health-care workers a week in the region.

The president’s decision to enlist the U.S. military, whose resources are already under strain as it responds to conflicts in the Middle East, reflects the growing concern of U.S. officials that, unless greater force is brought to bear, the epidemic could wreak havoc on the continent.

“It’s this broad range of capabilities together that will turn the tide of this epidemic,” said one senior administration official, who along with others spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss the president’s plan in advance of Obama’s trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Tuesday.

Global health experts and international aid groups who have been urging the White House to dramatically scale up its response praised the plan as described. They have said charities and West African governments alone do not have the capacity to stem the epidemic.

The U.S. military, with its enormous logistical capability, extensive air operations, and highly skilled medical corps, could address gaps in the response quickly.

“This is a really significant response on the military side,” said Laurie Garrett, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of a book about the first Ebola outbreak in 1976 and another on the global public-health system. “This is really beginning to seem like a game-changer.”

But much depends on how quickly personnel and supplies can get there.

“The problem is, for every single thing we’re doing, we’re racing against the virus, and the virus has the high ground right now,” she said. “I would hope this would reduce transmission, but it’s all about how fast people can get there and get the job done. If it takes weeks to mobilize, the strategy won’t even be within reach.”

Although the official death toll is at least 2,400 people in five African countries, officials say it vastly underestimates the true caseload. Garrett, who has been talking to health-care workers in the region, said the cumulative total, including deaths, could reach 250,000 by Christmas.

A senior official cautioned that the efforts “won’t happen overnight.” It will be several weeks before training of health-care workers can be up and running.

At a briefing Monday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama is visiting the CDC to get an update from the experts there “about the success of their efforts so far to try to confront this problem. . . . And that is the strategy that we’re implementing here, is to try to invest early to prevent this from becoming much more serious.”

Washington has come under fire from African officials — especially in the hardest-hit countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea — and on Capitol Hill for not marshaling more of its resources to combat the epidemic.

The United States has already spent $175 million responding to the outbreak and has dispatched 100 CDC experts, among the largest deployments of agency personnel in its history. The administration has sought an additional $88 million and may ask for more, according to a senior administration official. “I don’t want to close the door to potential additional funding,” the official said. Separately, the Pentagon wants to take up to $500 million from existing funds within the Pentagon’s budget that have not yet been spent and use it for the plan to fight Ebola.

The Pentagon announced last week that it would send a 25-bed hospital to Liberia. The hospital is designed to care for health-care workers who become ill, and eventually will be turned over to the Liberian government. It will be at least a month before the hospital is up and running. The United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps is preparing to deploy 65 Commissioned Corps officers to Liberia to manage and staff the hospital.

The United States has already set up one mobile laboratory, and another two are on the way.

In addition to expanding treatment and training facilities, the United States will send enough basic Ebola response kits to supply 400,000 households in Liberia, according to a senior administration official. That is intended to address an increasingly common phenomenon in which sick patients are being denied access to overflowing treatment centers and being sent home.

The packages, which include sanitizers, will help curb transmission of the disease among family members and expand access to ambulances and treatment centers so those infected can be isolated. As part of this effort, the U.S. Agency for International Development this week will airlift 50,000 home health-care kits from Denmark to Liberia to be hand-delivered to distant communities by trained youth volunteers.

The administration’s decision to involve the military in providing equipment and other assistance for international health workers in Africa comes after mounting calls from some unlikely groups — most prominently the international medical organization Doctors Without Borders — pressed the urgency of the issue.

While the world’s largest international health organizations, several governments and many nonprofits have already devoted significant resources to addressing the virus outbreak, administration officials said Monday that they had concluded that the United States would have to lead more aggressively in order to check Ebola’s spread. In Liberia’s capital, patients are dying on the street because there aren’t enough beds in treatment centers.

“Our concern is if we do not arrest that growth, and we don’t arrest that growth now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of cases” in Africa, the official said, noting that it will still take “months” to reduce the numbers of illnesses and deaths from the disease.

The U.S. response drew cautious praise from Doctors Without Borders, which has been the most active group in the region, battling the epidemic for months.

“Although we have not yet seen the official details, we welcome the ambition of the new US Ebola response plan, which appears to match the scope of the disaster unfolding in West Africa,” Brice de le Vigne, the group’s director of operations, said in a statement. “This latest pledge, alongside those from a handful of other countries, needs to be put into action immediately.”

He said that the response to Ebola continues to fall “dangerously behind” and that too many lives are being lost.

“If implemented swiftly, the deployment of new Ebola management centers, qualified staff and health personnel training could begin reversing the trend of the fight we have collectively been losing against Ebola,” he said.

Even as officials emphasized the need for bolder action and said they were bolstering defenses within the United States, they said the chance of an Ebola outbreak here was “a very low probability.”

Public health experts in America “know how to contain this virus,” one official said. “If there is a case that appears in the United States, that person would be isolated [and] the appropriate protocols would be put in place such that it would contain that.”

To some extent, the measures that the president is now adopting have been called for by some of his critics. On Friday, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) called on Obama to appoint a “central coordinator” to oversee the federal government’s response to the disease.

Sen. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), the top Republican on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said in a statement Monday, “This is an instance where we should be running toward the burning flames with our fireproof suits on.”

High-level planning by top officials from the CDC, the Pentagon, the State Department, USAID and the National Institutes of Health has been taking place for some time about options for a U.S. response, according to a senior administration official who spoke on background because planning was underway. The most recent high-level meeting was convened by Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, at the Pentagon last Wednesday.

Speaking on NBC’s “Meet The Press” on Sept. 7, Obama said that if the United States and other countries did not send equipment, health workers and other supplies to the region, the virus could mutate to become more transmissible."
168,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/09/29/hong-kong-pro-democracy-protesters-defy-calls-to-disperse-as-riot-police-fall/?intcmp=latestnews,2,"Protesters spent a peaceful night singing as they blocked streets in Hong Kong in an unprecedented show of civil disobedience to push demands for genuine democratic reforms.

But officials announced that schools in some districts of Hong Kong would remain closed Tuesday because of safety concerns, while dozens of bus routes were canceled and some subway stops near protest areas were closed.

Local media also reported that protest organizers had vowed to step up their protests if the government had not responded to their demands by Wednesday, which is a holiday for China's National Day.

Hundreds of people staged a brief ""mobile light"" vigil Monday night, waving their glowing cell phones as the protests stretched into their fourth day. Crowds chanted calls for the city's unpopular leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, to resign, and sang anthems calling for freedom.

""The students are protecting the right to vote, for Hong Kong's future. We are not scared, we are not frightened, we just fight for it,"" said Carol Chan, a 55-year-old civil service worker who took two days off to join the protests after becoming angered over police use of tear gas Sunday.

Students and activists have been camped out since late Friday, demanding that Beijing grant democratic reforms to the former British colony.

The government said it was canceling a fireworks display planned for Wednesday's celebration of National Day. Thursday is also a holiday, and even larger crowds are expected to flood the streets.

Police said they used 87 rounds of tear gas Sunday in what they called a necessary but restrained response to protesters pushing through cordons and barricades. They said 41 people were injured, including 12 police officers.

""Police cordon lines were heavily charged, by some violent protesters. So police had to use the minimum force in order to separate the distance at that moment between the protesters and also the police,"" said Cheung Tak-keung, the assistant police commissioner for operations.

The atmosphere was more festive Monday as constantly shifting crowds blocked major roads. People moved in and out of the sit-ins, some bringing in food and drink while others fetched their own. Some high school students, still in their school uniforms, sat on the pavement doing their homework.

""It's already the fourth day, so it's really tiring,"" said Ching-ching Tse, a 24-year-old student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who was on her second day of collecting trash in the protest area with her friends. ""So we are forming some groups and hope we can do some shifts and take turns.""

While many Hong Kong residents support the calls for greater democracy — dubbed the ""umbrella revolution"" by some, although the crowds' demands fall far short of revolution — the unrest worries others.

""I strongly disagree with the protesters,"" said an older woman who gave only her surname, Chan. ""Those of us who came to the city 60 or 70 years ago had nothing and we worked and suffered so much to make Hong Kong the rich city it is today. And now the protesters have made our society unstable. For me, being able to eat and sleep is already a luxury. I don't need democracy. What does it mean?""

Many younger Hong Kong residents raised in an era of plenty and with no experience of past political turmoil in mainland China have higher expectations. Under an agreement set in 1984, before most of them were born, Beijing promised to allow Hong Kong residents civil liberties — unseen in the rest of China — after it took control of the city of 7.1 million in 1997.

The protesters are dismayed by China's decision last month that candidates in the city's first-ever election for its top leader must be hand-picked by a committee of mostly pro-Beijing tycoons. That move is viewed by many residents as reneging on promises to allow greater democracy in the semi-autonomous territory, since Beijing had promised that the chief executive would eventually be chosen through ""universal suffrage.""

China's communist leaders take a hard line against any threat to their monopoly on power, including clamping down on dissidents and Muslim Uighur separatists in the country's far west, but it cannot crack down too harshly on the semi-autonomous territory where a freewheeling media ensures global visibility.

Across the border, Chinese state media have provided scant coverage of the protests beyond noting that an illegal gathering spun out of control and was being curtailed by police.

The protests began a week ago with a class boycott by university and college students demanding reforms of the local legislature and a withdrawal of Beijing's requirement that election candidates be screened.

Leaders of the broader Occupy Central civil disobedience movement joined the protesters early Sunday, saying they wanted to kick-start a long-threatened mass sit-in demanding Hong Kong's top leader be elected without Beijing's interference.

""People are feeling a kind of guilt that they were allowing the young kids in their late teens and early 20s to take all the risks, so people are coming out to support them,"" said Steve Tsang, a senior fellow at the University of Nottingham's China Policy Institute.

Occupy Central on Monday urged Leung to resign, saying his ""non-response to the people's demands has driven Hong Kong into a crisis of disorder."""
169,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/10/21/oscar-pistorius-sentenced/?intcmp=latestnews,2,"A South African judge sentenced former Olympic and Paralymic sprinter Oscar Pistorius to a maximum of five years in prison Tuesday for the culpable homicide of his girlfriend last February, though lawyers on both sides of the case later acknowledged that he is unlikely to serve his full sentence in prison.

Pistorius' defense team told Sky News that he would likely serve 10 months, or one-sixth of the term handed down by Judge Thokozile Masipa, before being released to serve the remaining time under house arrest. However, a spokesman for South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority said that the man once known as ""The Blade Runner"" would likely serve 20 months behind bars, before stating that such matters were ""not for the NPA to decide.""

Judge Masipa also handed the double-amputee a three-year suspended sentence on a firearms charge. She ordered that sentence to be wholly suspended for five years on condition that Pistorius is not found guilty of another firearm offense.

Masipa last month convicted Pistorius of culpable homicide, but acquitted him of murder after he testified he mistook Steenkamp for a nighttime intruder.

Masipa based the sentence on what she called the ""gross negligence"" of Pistorius, who shot Reeva Steenkamp multiple times through a toilet cubicle door in his home early on the morning of Feb. 14, 2013. Pistorius had testified that the shooting was an accident because he mistook his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder.

More On This...

""The following is what I consider is a sentence that is fair and just both to society and the accused,"" Masipa said as she announced her decision.

She asked Pistorius to stand as she delivered the sentence, and the world-famous disabled runner faced her with his hands clasped in front of him. Pistorius then left the Pretoria courtroom down a flight of stairs that lead to holding cells. His sentence starts immediately and he was taken straight to the cells, a spokesman for the NPA told The Associated Press.

""Having regard to the circumstances in the matter, I am of the view that a non-custodial sentence would send the wrong message to the community,"" Masipa said. ""On the other hand, a long sentence would also not be appropriate either, as it would lack the element of mercy.

""What may appear to be justice to the general public may not be justice. Society cannot always get what they want.""

Steenkamp's mother, June, told Sky News that the sentence provided a measure of closure, but added that full closure was not possible ""unless you can magic her back"".

Nathi Mncube, the prosecution spokesman, said his office is disappointed in the culpable homicide conviction and has not yet decided whether to appeal the sentence.

""We have not made up our minds whether we're going to appeal it or not,"" he said. He added that there was an ""appetite"" to appeal but that prosecutors have 14 days to review their options.

""We are satisfied with the fact that he will be serving some time in prison,"" he said.

He said he thought the South African public would be satisfied because their justice system had been shown to be ""functional.""

""It's not only about vengeance but it is about making sure that there is a fair and just process,"" he said.

Masipa had a range of options for Pistorius' punishment. She could have issued a suspended sentence and a fine, meaning Pistorius would not have gone to jail. She could also have ordered him to go under house arrest or she could have sent him to prison for up to 15 years.

Pistorius' lawyers had argued for a three-year period of correctional supervision, where the runner would have been under house arrest. Prosecutors asked the judge to send him to prison for at least 10 years.

The courtroom was packed, reflecting heightened media and public interest ahead of the sentencing. Police officers stood guard in the aisles.

Before proceedings started, Dr. Lore Hartzenberg, a psychologist, held Pistorius' hand and spoke softly to him. Hartzenberg had testified for the defense that Pistorius was a ""broken man"" after killing his girlfriend and had suffered emotionally and financially.

A Pistorius supporter laid three white roses near him.

""I just wanted to bestow a little bit of inner happiness on Oscar,"" said the supporter, who added that she thought he had lost a lot of self-respect.

Outside the courthouse, a man in orange garb carried chains and a large sign that read: ""Are certain offenders more equal than other offenders before the law?""

170,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/11/11/us-china-reach-understanding-to-scrap-tariffs-on-high-tech-goods-obama-says/?intcmp=latestnews,2,"President Obama said Tuesday that the U.S. and China have reached an ""understanding"" on a deal that would eliminate tariffs on certain high-tech goods.

Obama said that the breakthrough would help bring talks on expansion of the global Information Technology Agreement to a ""rapid conclusion."" Obama made the announcement during a meeting with leaders attending an Asia-Pacific economic summit in Beijing.

U.S. officials told the Associated Press that the progress with China includes an agreement to eliminate tariffs on goods like medical devices, global positioning systems, and video game consoles. The White House did not put a specific timeline on finalizing a broader agreement through the World Trade Organization.

Talks over the ITA broke down last summer due to disagreements over what products would be covered by an expanded deal. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman says the deal would mark the first major tariff reduction agreement by the WTO in 17 years. According to the U.S. government, the ITA now covers over $4 trillion in annual trade.

The understanding was the latest in a flurry of agreements reached ahead of the opening of the APEC summit. On the eve of the gathering, Beijing announced a free-trade agreement with South Korea. Also Monday, regulators approved a plan to open Chinese stock markets wider to foreign investors by linking exchanges in Hong Kong and Shanghai. That followed the weekend announcement of a $40 billion Chinese-financed fund to improve trade links between Asian economies.

Obama, meanwhile, opened two days of talks Tuesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, telling the Chinese leader he wants to take their relationship to ""a new level.""

Later Tuesday, APEC leaders agreed to launch a two-year study toward possible adoption of a free-trade deal proposed by Beijing. Xi called the decision a ""historic step.""

U.S. trade officials say the two proposals are not competitors. But they want Beijing to wrap up a U.S.-Chinese investment treaty in addition to the agreement to lower barriers to trade in information technology. Washington and some other governments argued the Chinese proposal would be a distraction at APEC but Beijing made it the centerpiece of the meeting.

On Monday, Obama insisted Washington sees no threat from Beijing's growing economic and political status.

""The United States welcomes the rise of a prosperous, peaceful and stable China,"" the American leader said in a speech at the business conference.

Still, American officials chafe at Beijing's insistence on promoting its proposed trade pact at a time when progress on a U.S.-led initiative, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, has stalled.

The TPP includes the United States, Japan and 10 other countries, but excludes China. Few details have been released but its promoters say it would reduce or eliminate tariffs on most goods among the member countries. That might hurt China by encouraging member countries to trade more with each other.

Leaders of the nations involved in TPP talks, including the United States, Mexico, Japan and Australia, met Monday and issued a statement saying they were making progress. The talks have been delayed repeatedly by disputes over the sweeping nature of its market-opening proposals.

""We have instructed our ministers and negotiators to make concluding this agreement a top priority,"" the statement said.

The initiative promoted by Beijing is less ambitious and is aimed at reducing conflict among overlapping trade agreements between pairs of Asia-Pacific economies.

It is a logical response to being excluded from the TPP, said Li Wei, an economist at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing.

""If the U.S. doesn't want China to join the TPP, then China can form its own trade groups,"" said Li.

Li also pointed to limits on access to U.S. markets for some Chinese technology companies such as Huawei Technologies Ltd., a maker of network switching gear, on security grounds.

""The world, with the U.S. leading, is retreating from free trade. It is moving into protectionism,"" said Li. ""If the U.S. is saying, I should be careful about who I have free trade with, then China should take a more liberalizing role.""

He showed no mercy – firing more than 100 rounds and exploding a pipe bomb in the balcony. There was nowhere to hide from the carnage.

Click here to follow Todd on Facebook for conservative conversation!

Seven people died that night. Seven others were wounded.

It was Sept. 15, 1999 – the day a madman slaughtered Christians inside Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas.

That was the year Carl Chinn began compiling statistic documenting violent attacks on churches and synagogues and other houses of worship.

Since 1999, he has recorded more than 1,000 such attacks – more than 150 so far this year.

Chinn tells me the attack on the pastor and parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is the worst attack on an assembled congregation in American history.

“This was a calculated attack,” he said. “It’s just awful. I hurt for those people.”

And one of the nation’s foremost experts in church security fears the Charleston massacre could only be the beginning.

“Violence directed against the church has been growing over the past decade,” said Tim Miller, the president of LionHeart International Services Group. “My fear is what we saw in Charleston is one incident of many more to come.”

LionHart specializes in providing security consulting to churches.

“Church security really matters,” he told me. “Churches are becoming more and more a major target. Dealing with this is really important.”

Miller, a retired Marine, served nearly 30 years as a former Secret Service agent, police officer and counter-intelligence officer. His team includes former Homeland Security agents, FBI agents and special-ops personnel.

“I spent my life learning how to protect others,” he said. “About three years ago, I realized the same threats we experienced overseas are now here. And we needed to pivot and direct our efforts to help those in churches and non-profits.”

Miller said churches are soft targets and what happened in Charleston should be a wakeup call.

“My first thought was to pray,” he said. “Having been in situations where that kind of carnage exists – the suffering is unimaginable. My second thought – was this is a realization of what we’ve been talking about and what we help churches prepare for.”

The difficulty is making the church a welcoming place for hurting souls – while at the same time preparing to deal with those who might commit violence.

“We welcome you on the one hand – while on the other hand if a gunman comes in – we have the resources to handle it,” he said.

I do believe the Old Testament Book of Nehemiah addressed such an issue: “We prayed to our God and posted a guard.”"
172,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/04/what-makes-me-proud-to-be-american.html,2,"Editor’s note: The following is the text of a speech delivered by Fox News co-host Dana Perino at the Fox News Proud American July Fourth celebration at Patriots Point Naval & Maritime Museum in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.

My fellow Americans – welcome to the best Fourth of July celebration in the United States of America.

There is no place I’d rather be than with you here at Patriots Point as we remember that on this day in 1776 our nation adopted the Declaration of Independence. Upon their signatures began the great experiment to create the most wonderful and free country the world has ever known.

As a nation and as individuals, we are not perfect – in both our distant and most recent past, we have been humbled…we have been brought to our knees in grief…we have marveled at the healing power of forgiveness…and so, we keep trying to improve, to be better, and to meet the challenge of protecting the God given right that He gives as a gift to every human being – the right of individual liberty, to be free, to be independent.

I’ll tell you from my personal experience of traveling the world as the press secretary to President George W. Bush that there’s no mistaking an American.

I want to thank Patriots Point and The Patriots Point Development Authority Board including Chairman Ray Chandler and Executive Director Mac Burdette. In addition, thank you to the Mt. Pleasant Police Department, the Yorktown Foundation, and Sticky Fingers Top Shelf Catering (though I may withdraw that thanks when I try on my swimming suit tomorrow).

This year the Fourth of July Fireworks Blast is being shared with Fox News fans all over the country. What better place to spend the holiday than here – rich in history and patriotism, home to the Patriots Point Naval and Maritime Museum, and – just across the water, within view of the many church bells of Charleston, our most recent tragic example of how fragile life is, how confronting evil can test our limits, and how astounding in grace and compassion American citizens can be.

Charleston, what courage you showed just three weeks ago . What unity, which I know this community has actively worked to build, and believe me it showed in the aftermath of the shooting.

We are a grateful nation for your leadership and community spirit. You led us well, when we should have been leading you. With a humbled broken heart for the gut wrenching violence you experienced, I thank you for having me here today and for being the best our country has to offer.

MISTAKEN IDENTITY

I really appreciate the warm welcome, but I just hope you don’t think you’re clapping for somebody else. See, I’ve been the victim of mistaken identity before – it happens in politics and television all the time…

I remember once I was at a New York Jets game. And anyone who watches “The Five” on Fox News knows, I fit in at a sporting event about as well as Tom Brady at a press conference—it’s just not my cup of tea.

But, I was privileged to be in the owner’s box when another guest approached me and said, “Oh my Gosh. I love you. I love your work. I watch your show every day. I think you’re amazing.”

I was so touched and thanked the man very much. And then he said, “Oh by the way, you look great after the baby.”

That’s when I realized I had just met the future president of the Megyn Kelly fan club. I decided to take it as a major compliment and didn’t correct him. I’d love to hear his side of the story. He probably says, “She’s a lot shorter than she looks on TV! (And, to answer one of the most frequently asked questions…yes, I’m even shorter than [fellow co-host] Greg Gutfeld).

NATIONAL IDENTITY

While I’ve been mistaken for others, I’ll tell you from my personal experience of traveling the world as the press secretary to President George W. Bush that there’s no mistaking an American.

We have many identities and labels for ourselves here at home – we are Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians, Blacks, Whites, Latinos, Asians, Millennials, Baby Boomers, Gen X-ers, and on and on. How we describe ourselves becomes a personal point of pride, a way to sort out how we approach life, but it can also be used to divide.

Identity politics is a terrible way to run a nation – and that is why it is important that at least on this day every year we come together with only one identity –- ingrained in the universal right of freedom and independence that nobody can take that away – we are Americans, and we are proud.

Sure America is changing. Some say it’s changing too fast. There are questions of who is America now and who will she be? But I believe that we will never lose our national identity because it is rooted in independence.

We declared our independence from an oppressor on this very day 239 years ago and we were able to do so because of the solidarity Americans had with each other.

No matter how much we squabble, there are many, many more things that unite us than separate us.

It's one thing that overseas travel teaches you. Every time I leave America, I end up saying the same thing: ""Thank God my great-grandparents were brave enough to leave the only home they’d ever known to help create the best country the world has ever seen.”

MY STORY AND THE AMERICAN DREAM

From that day forth, many of us have had the privilege of experiencing a little something called the American Dream.

In case you haven’t guessed, Perino is an Italian surname. My great-grandparents on my dad’s side were born in Italy. They were poor farm workers with little hope of a better lifestyle. And even though they spoke almost no English, thanks to the kindness of others they were able to make it from Ellis Island to Illinois and then to Wyoming. My great-grandparents grew up three miles apart in little villages near Torino, Italy – but they had never met. They met here. They married. They homesteaded in the Black Hills. And three generations later, I was born.

Imagine the gumption that took -- to land in New York, with no English, and make their way to the Wild West. I won't go to the corner store without a GPS and a way to phone a friend. These people crossed a continent. They were a different breed, motivated to find a better life. And that was the power of the American Dream.

My great grandmother lived to be 100 years old, so I got to know her and remember years ago watching the Fourth of July parade from her front porch of her town house in Newcastle. My grandfather would ride his horse in the parade with the other County Commissioners, and we’d squat on the curb ready to pounce when they threw some candy our way.

On those summers on the ranch, I thought I’d never leave the West. I thought all I ever needed was right there and pity the poor city fellas that didn’t have what we had…but that’s what’s so great about America. One day you’re sitting on a barnyard fence thinking you’ll never leave, and the next you’re the press secretary on Marine One with the president of the United States.

My great-grandparents walked in on one side of the American dream and I walked out on the other. God bless America indeed.

MY TRAVELS WITH PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH

President George W. Bush once said of America that, we are “a Nation with a mission -- and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs. We have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of empire. Our aim is a democratic peace - a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman.”

I traveled the country and the world with him as he spread that message of hope and freedom. From Iraq to China to Russia and all over the world – the ideals of freedom live on. They were born with the inalienable right to be free, too – it’s just that their governments suppress those rights.

I also traveled all over the United States with President Bush, from Alaska to Hawaii to Kansas and even to the beautiful Palmetto State, South Carolina.

Many of you might not know, but South Carolina is my adopted home on the East Coast. I came for a wedding a few years ago and was totally charmed.

I feel at ease here in South Carolina that I haven’t felt elsewhere – and that’s thanks to your hospitality, manners and sense of community.

I think it is beautiful here. I love the oak trees and Spanish moss. I love porch swings, folk art, fiddles and fiddlers.

Thank you for keeping the history intact, so that all of us can learn about the founding of the country as well as the war that tested our limits.

My husband and I plan to be here long term – and of course, that makes America’s Dog, Jasper, VERY happy.

And thank you also for the food: fire shrimp, fried green tomatoes, and coconut cake, which have also tested my limits a few times.

PROUD AMERICANS

Now I’m very aware that without my past, I wouldn’t have a future in South Carolina. President Bush gave me the opportunity of a lifetime to be the first Republican woman to serve as the White House Press Secretary – and then Fox News gave me a chance to figure out how I could speak for myself rather than for someone else. I’m grateful beyond measure for the confidence that’s been placed in me.

It’s safe to say that President Bush was one proud American. Some people used to say he had a swagger, but as he puts it, “in Texas, they call that walking.”

Of course, one of the best things about working for him was watching his interactions with our military.

Now, living in Texas – a place President Bush calls “the Promised Land” and Mrs. Bush calls “the After Life” – he says the only thing he misses about being president is being the commander in chief.

I witnessed every day his respect, honor, commitment and sense of duty to the armed forces.

One of my favorite stories was when he decided to take a last minute trip right before he left office to go see the Navy SEALs.

We arrived at a hangar full of young American men wearing suits and sporting really long beards. They clearly were preparing for a mission.

The president bounded onto the stage to thunderous applause. He spoke from the heart and without notes, and when he finished he had tears in his eyes and the SEALs ignored his pleas to stop clapping. It was the only order of his that they didn’t have to obey.

After his speech, a couple of SEALs came over to ask me if I was the press secretary and if they could get a photograph with me. As their buddy got his camera ready, I decided to make a little small talk.

“What made you want to become a Navy SEAL – family tradition, sense of adventure, chance to see the world, physical challenge?





“Oh no, ma’am, chicks dig it,” he said.

I then asked the second SEAL, “When you are preparing to go…wherever it is that you may be going. Do you have to take a lot of language courses?”

“Oh no ma’am…we’re really not there to talk.”

Indeed.

When we got back to Marine One, I told President Bush that story and he threw back his head and laughed and said, “God, I love those guys.”

Being around Navy SEALs can be very humbling, and I’m honored to know some of those heroes.

I’ve met several other proud Americans in my life – starting with my grandfathers. One fought in the Pacific, the other in Europe. Both of them rarely spoke of the war – they put it behind them, loved their wives and raised families, built businesses and served their communities. I miss them so much, and I have always been proud to be the granddaughter of two World War II veterans.

My husband, now there’s a proud American…but of the naturalized kind. He was born in the United Kingdom, his dad served in the Royal Air Force. Then, 18 years ago in 1997, he and I boarded a plane to fly from Denver to Chicago. We were assigned seats next to each other – and two hours later we were in love and have been together ever since.

Peter knew that when he married me, my country came as part of the package. And he wanted to be an American. He chose to become a citizen, and our country is better off having him. And now I feel like Lady Liberty is the only other woman in his life. He’s one of those people who loves everything that is America—baseball, barbecues…and apparently, cowgirls from Colorado and Wyoming.

We spent our first year together in his home country of England. We lived in a coastal village, about 20 miles north of Liverpool. It was cool and always raining, but I was determined to have a Fourth of July party. My father-in-law advised me to dial back the American independence bit. But I thought, goodness, no, everyone loves America! Right?

Well, even though they may have thought it was a little odd to have a backyard BBQ in the drizzle to celebrate America’s birthday, I’ll never forget how I had brought from the States a bunch of Fourth of July- themed napkins and little toothpicks with American flags on them – how I searched for Graham crackers and Hershey’s chocolate and had to improvise with rich tea biscuits and Cadbury’s – and when the day came, I was the proudest American. I wanted my guests to love my country as much as I did. For dessert, I made those S’mores and my neighbor, a World War II bomber pilot, devoured his with a knife and fork -- and then asked for more.

That year in England I learned so much including how much I loved America. We didn’t quite last a year in the U.K. before I was ready to come home.

I had never been more proud of my country than when I was away from it.

I can see there are a lot of proud Americans in this crowd as well – they practice daily acts of kindness and are part of the fabric that holds the greater Charleston community together. Let me tell you about a few of them:

FOLDS OF HONOR -- THE CHILDEN OF APRIL AND NELSON TRENT



Of course, we also know that freedom is not free. So many men and women have given the ultimate sacrifice or have suffered life altering injuries in the service of our nation. We are grateful beyond measure for their service. And that is why we must continue to support them and their families.

Folds of Honor presented two scholarships earlier this year to the children of April and Nelson Trent. April and Nelson both served in the military and were married before her first deployment. They served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sadly, on his third tour, Nelson was killed by a suicide bomber. Through her grief, she continued to raise their two children, David and Cameron. They are deserving of these scholarships and deserve our unending support and gratitude.

EVERYDAY ACTS OF BRAVERY

Corporal Adam Willis is one of many police officers that regularly do heroic acts. That’s part of the job. But just a month ago, Willis deserved special praise for his selfless act when he came upon a burning vehicle and realized there was a man, lying unconscious, in the car.

Willis said he didn’t stop to think about the danger, with the adrenaline running through his veins, he just reached in and got the guy out. He says the only thing he thought was, “Please, don’t be dead.” Without Corporal Willis, the man surely would have died – and so thank you for the daily courage you show, and for that particular heroic act that saved the life of a man you never even met.

CHARLESTON UNITY MARCH

As Charleston reeled from the evil shooting at the Emanuel AME Church, Lauren Dorsey and Darcy Creaturo were moved to action. They were heartbroken and wanted a way to show the solidarity of the community. It was no small feat, but they were able to organize a walk across the Arthur Ravenel Bridge to show support for the families and to bring the citizens of Charleston together.

The police force helped make it all happen – and that evening, nearly 15,000 people showed up to participate. They wanted to be a part of an act that showed the spirit of Charleston. And each step across the bridge brought them closer together through grief and into healing.

Darcy and Lauren – you reminded us the power of choosing to do something brave, complicated, inconvenient. And worth every moment. Your community and your country thank you. And, believe me, your children will speak of your kindness for the rest of their lives. What an example you’ve been for all of us.

LOYALTY TO COUNTRY

It’s proud Americans like those who remind us of the importance of serving the national interest and not the self-interest.

IT’S POSSIBLE TO REMAIN HOPEFUL & CIVIL IN THE MONTHS AHEAD

One additional thing I’d like to leave you with today is there’s reason for us all to remain hopeful even as another campaign cycle heats up.

Yes, there’ll be some heated exchanges, some contentious debates, some accusations and condemnations. But look on the bright side: Piers Morgan is gone.

As Americans, we can find ways to disagree without considering our political opponents as our enemies. I wrote in my book. “And the Good News Is…” that Democrats are people too.

It’s true, I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

One of the most memorable days I spent at The White House was when President George W. Bush invited President-elect Barack Obama and former Presidents Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter for a private lunch.

I remember grabbing Robert Gibbs’ arm and pulled him into the Oval Office for the photo opportunity. We stood next to the grandfather clock and watched how the five of them stood together for the cameras and showed the world how election after election we can still overcome the acrimony of a political campaign to work together.

What an honor it was to be with five duly elected presidents of these United States.

What it represented was so important. It demonstrated one of the hallmarks of the American system: the peaceful transition of power. There were no recriminations among these men. Nobody took off their shirts or challenged anyone to arm-wrestle. This wasn’t Russia.

The dignity, stability, and integrity of the American way was embodied in that room, by five extraordinary men.

So, whatever happens in 2016, we should recall that whoever wins, the peaceful transition to a new president is itself a victory, one unique in history. And we would do well to appreciate that fact before we start arguing again.

We no doubt will – which is all right too. After all – it’s how I make my living. But today, ladies and gentlemen, we are all Americans, and proudly so. Let’s celebrate together – sharing our identity of independence.

It has been a pleasure to be here with all of you today – I thank you and Fox News for this opportunity. It is one I will always cherish.

May God continue to bless all of you, and the United States of America.

173,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/16/chattanooga-shooting-proves-its-time-to-arm-our-armed-forces.html,2,"It turns out that at least one of the two military facilities attacked in Chattanooga, Tennessee -- was a gun-free zone.

If you looked closely crime scene photographs - you can see the sign -- plastered on the front of a bullet- riddled window.

Click here to follow Todd on Facebook for conservative conversation.

Four Marines were slaughtered -- a fifth wounded -- along with a Chattanooga police officer.

Authorities say the gunman, identified as 24-year-old Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, was killed in a shoot-out.

Abdulazeez is reportedly a Kuwaiti-native who attended high school in the Chattanooga area. The Times Free-Press posted his graduation photo – that included the phrase; “My name causes national security alerts. What does yours do?”

The FBI says it’s too soon to speculate on the suspect’s motive – but I think we’ve all got a pretty clear understanding of what went down.

As many as 50 shots were fired -- and all the survivors could do was barricade themselves inside.

The brave men and women who staff these military recruiting stations are sitting ducks. Soft targets - is the terminology they use.

The same thing happened at the Fort Hood massacre.

In response to the shooting Homeland Security ordered enhanced security measures at federal buildings. Since they can’t carry weapons what are they going to do? How are they going to defend themselves against the next Muhammad Abdulazeez -- lock the doors, pull the shades?

It's time to arm the Armed Forces. Now, I’m sure the experts will say there’s some sort of logical reason why military personnel should not have access to firearms – but I’m not convinced. Brave Marines gunned down in a Southern city -- and that is something we cannot abide. Our elected leaders must give them at least a fighting chance.

It makes absolutely no sense that Marines and Airmen and Sailors and Soldiers who defend our nation are unable to defend themselves – on American soil.

174,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/03/folly-obamas-clean-power-plan.html,2,"Before any rational discussion of the economic or scientific merits of President Obama’s Clean Power Plan can begin (it will be announced Monday), it is necessary to take his rhetoric about its benefits off the table. The president stated Sunday that his plan is ""protecting the world we leave to our children.” To be generous to the president, that is a gross exaggeration.

By the Environmental Protection Agency’s own calculations, the plan will reduce U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide by about 10% from what they are now projected to be in 2030. Since by that time the U.S. will be producing less than 20 percent of global CO2 emissions, the result is at most 2 percent less growth in global emissions.

Based on the calculations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that will make less than one-tenth of a degree of difference in global temperatures.

Contrary to the president’s claims about saving lives and reducing energy costs, his own EPA has found that the drastic cuts they are ordering will increase electricity costs, while doing next to nothing to slow the pace of climate change.

Contrary to the president’s claims about saving lives and reducing energy costs, his own EPA has found that the drastic cuts they are ordering will increase electricity costs, while doing next to nothing to slow the pace of climate change.

What the president will not admit about his ambitious plans is that they will not matter unless the countries actually responsible for future greenhouse gas emissions do far more than they now show any intention of doing.

The world’s future major emitters will be China, India, Brazil -- and of course Russia -- and other rapidly growing economies whose use of fossil fuels is part and parcel of their growth plans.

The Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency forecast that by 2030 these countries will be responsible for almost 60% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Their role is growing fast, not shrinking.

Despite the presidential hoopla about the upcoming Paris climate summit, what the actual preparations show is how little those other major emitters have any intention of doing.

The Paris meeting is not about setting new binding international targets for global emissions. Instead, nations will determine their own efforts and communicate their intentions in documents called “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs).”

This in the long run could be a great improvement over futile meetings to discuss mandatory targets, but China, the world’s largest source of CO2, has already stated its intention to keep growing carbon emissions out to 2030.

In other words, the president is claiming that the U.S. must provide a leading example at a time when the most important carbon emitters have already declared they will not follow it.

At the pace those countries are moving, the problem of climate change will be just as great for our children as it is today, no matter what costly regulations the president imposes on the U.S. economy."
175,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/07/trump-loses-republican-debate-but-rubio-cruz-others-triumph.html?intcmp=hpbt2,2,"The moderators of the GOP debate Thursday night at the Quicken Loans arena gave Donald Trump plenty of rope – and sure enough he hanged himself. Right out of the box, the candidates were asked to pledge their support to whomever ultimately wins the GOP nomination; the only hold-out was Trump, who refused to make that commitment and who elicited boos from the audience.

Later, in response to a sharp question from Megyn Kelly about his history of calling women “fat pigs” and “slobs,” Trump argued that the big problem with the country was political correctness. He concluded, “If you don’t like it Megyn, too bad; you haven’t been very nice to me.” Bad decision, Donald.

Trump was also asked to provide proof of his claims that the Mexican government was intentionally funneling criminals into the U.S. He didn’t provide the requested back-up, but rather claimed, “If it weren’t for me, we wouldn’t be talking about illegal immigration.” He followed that absurd claim with a rant about how much smarter the Mexican government was that our “stupid” America’s leaders.

In recent weeks Trump had explained that he gave money to numerous Democrat campaigns in order to secure favors – portraying those contributions as normal business transactions.

During the debate he was asked to provide specific examples of such benefits, and said that because he gave money to Hillary Clinton’s foundation and to her campaigns, he asked her to come to his wedding…and she did. Does he even know how tacky that sounds?

Undoubtedly, Trump will soon complain that the Fox anchors were out to get him. The truth is, the debate was his to lose and he lost it.

Trump was asked about his earlier support of a single-payer health care system, his several business failures, what he would do specifically about the visit of Quds Commander General Suleimani’s visit to Moscow (illegal under today’s sanction regime) and other issues that might (and should) give his enthusiastic followers some pause.

He was by turns bombastic and evasive, not answering the questions but rather launching into various diatribes about the stupidity of everyone not named Trump. And so it went.

Undoubtedly, Trump will soon complain that the Fox anchors were out to get him. The truth is, the debate was his to lose and he lost it.

Thankfully, it wasn’t all Trump all the time, though occasionally it seemed some candidates might have stepped out for some fresh air. When finally asked a question by Kelly, Dr. Ben Carson, thanked her and said “I wasn’t sure I was going to get to talk again.”

Who won the debates tonight? In the earlier round, Carly Fiorina once again proved herself a smart, formidable contestant, leaving many to wonder why her campaign has thus far failed to take off, relegating her to Stage 2.

Senator Marco Rubio did not lunge offstage for a glass of water, but instead handled himself well. His answers were crisp and thoughtful; on the contentious issue of immigration, he balanced a forceful demand for tightened borders with realism about the need to resolve the problem of our large illegal population.

He was challenged to defend his lack of executive experience and did so by reminding viewers of his several years running Florida’s state legislature. He also (rightly) noted that if the election came down to a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton would win.

Ted Cruz was also a winner Thursday night. His skills as a debater served him well, as did his forceful criticism of President Obama’s inability to confront ISIS, and his scathing rebuke of sanctuary cities.

John Kasich had a good night, too, and his success was essential. He entered the race late and he is not well known nationally. But, Kasich is popular with moderates who are skittish about electing another Bush, and this debate allowed him to reach a bigger audience.

Former Governor Jeb Bush failed to excite. His delivery was not crisp, and once again he got himself tangled up answering a question about the Iraq war. Really, he needs to get this down – his slightly fuzzy answers about his brother and the Iraq invasion make him appear irresolute. Maybe he really is simply rusty. The only issue on which he scored was education; he defends his support of Common Core with vigor.

Governor Chris Christie had a chance to crawl out of the doghouse last night, but barely made it past the door. He got into a shouting match over Rand Paul’s opposition to NSA snooping, with Christie citing his post-September 11 experience as reason to encourage more, not less, intelligence gathering. The confrontation was vintage Christie but somehow it lacked authenticity. Maybe Trump has simply stolen his tough-talk persona.

Carson, Huckabee and Walker all performed credibly, with Carson having the debate’s best line: “I’m the only one on the stage to separate Siamese twins. I’m the only one to remove half a brain, though you would think if you went to Washington that someone had beat me to it.”

Rand Paul seemed on the defensive, and did not impress. Though the country is tired of war, people are alarmed about ISIS, Iran, China and Russia. Paul’s semi-isolationist stance was an easier sell when our engagements in the Middle East were still building. His dustup with Christie came across as nasty on both sides, with Paul accusing the New Jersey governor of “blowing hot air.”

In the final minutes of the Great Debate, Senator Marco Rubio said “God has blessed the Republican Party; we have some very fine candidates; Democrats can’t even find one.”

On the basis on both the forums held Thursday in Cleveland, the voters may well agree."
176,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/05/republican-debate-what-establishment-candidates-must-accomplish-thursday-night.html,2,"As the leading Republican candidates prepare to square off in their first debate, one thing has become clear: Americans are dissatisfied. The ascent of real estate mogul Donald Trump and Socialist Bernie Sanders testifies to serious doubts about establishment politicians.

Hillary Clinton’s video announcing her candidacy hit all the buttons -- jobs, fairness, education, and gender -- necessary to hold together the majority that twice delivered President Obama to the White House. But a recent CNN poll indicates the majority of Americans want the next president to change most of President Obama’s policies.

Still voters don’t want a return to the days of President Bush and have expressed their frustration with both presidents by indicating preferences for Trump and Sanders despite their extreme views.

The two men advocate very opposite visions -- less vs. more government in markets and social institutions -- but address frustrations emerging from common roots -- an economy that not delivering enough growth and big institutions that bully ordinary people.

To step forward from the pack and dispatch Trump, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker or some other GOP hopeful must express an understanding of these forces and position himself as the champion of ordinary folks.

Globalization is cleaning the clock of most Americans by driving down wages and pushing too many workers into the contingent economy -- where they are working erratic hours, getting poor benefits and face zero job security.

Free trade in America means giving imports unimpeded access to our markets, while foreign governments target U.S. industries and jobs with cheap currencies, subsidies and discriminatory regulations. The GOP candidate who wants to be the Party's nominee should simply promise to level the playing field by doing whatever it takes to eradicate the $500 billion trade deficit -- and restore 4 million jobs in the bargain.

Americans can’t compete in the global marketplace without affordable colleges and universities but pouring money into these institutions through student loans has only left a generation too heavily in debt. The GOP candidate should promise to cut off federal loans and other aid to institutions that do not agree to cut costs and tuition by 20 percent and then limit future increases to no more than inflation.

No matter what Americans earn, they increasingly are up against forces that don’t make sense. Each year computer and communications technologies become less costly but home cable bills keep rocketing, banks pay hardly any interest on deposits but still charge 20 percent and more on credit card debt, and fuel prices are down but air fares stay high and planes are crowded.

Simply put, big businesses have absorbed smaller competitors in the airline and health insurance companies, merged and snuffed out competition, and CEOs feast like aristocrats before the French Revolution. The GOP candidate should promise to bust up those monopolies, lower prices and get Americans a fair shake in the marketplace.

Health care in the United States is 50 percent more costly than in Germany, which also has a system of mandatory private insurance, because prices are much lower there. The GOP candidate should require drug companies to charge no more in America than they do in Europe and for U.S. doctors, hospitals and insurance companies to benchmark costs against German practices.

Hillary’s trump card is gender -- many women want a woman for president. The GOP candidate has to convince women that he (or she) feels their pain and is committed to taking on their issues -- by explicit example.

Simply stated, half of his (or her) cabinet and political appointees must be female -- corporate America would be compelled to follow suit. If the GOP candidate does not commit to that, then President Hillary Clinton will surely enforce the same.

It’s all very radical but conservatives should be about radical ideas that empower individuals -- be they white or not, male or female, gay or straight. And they need to recognize that banks and corporations are legal contraptions invented to serve a public good not further enrich the wealthy."
177,"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/06/21/supreme-court-strikes-down-fcc-rules-on-profanity-nudity/?test=latestnews
http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2012/06/21/breaking_supreme_court_slaps_down_ninth_circuit_decides_against_seiu",2,"The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled against the FCC's policy regulating curse words and nudity on broadcast television.

In an 8-0 decision, the high court threw out fines and sanctions imposed by the Federal Communications Commission. The case involved some uncensored curse words and brief nudity on various networks, including Fox.

""Because the FCC failed to give FOX or ABC fair notice prior to the broadcasts in question that fleeting expletives and momentary nudity could be found actionably indecent, the Commissions' standards as applied to these broadcasts were vague,"" the Supreme Court said in its opinion.

The court said the FCC is ""free to modify its current indecency policy"" in light of the ruling.

The justices, though, declined to issue a broad ruling on the constitutionality of the FCC indecency policy. Instead, the court concluded only that broadcasters could not have known in advance that obscenities uttered during awards show programs and a brief display of nudity on an episode of ABC's NYPD Blue could give rise to sanctions. ABC and 45 affiliates were hit with proposed fines totaling nearly $1.24 million.

It was the second time the court has confronted, but not ruled conclusively on, the FCC's policy on isolated expletives. Justice Anthony Kennedy said in his opinion for the court that ""it is unnecessary for the court to address the constitutionality of the current policy.""

The case arose from a change in the FCC's long-standing policy on curse words. For many years, the agency did not take action against broadcasters for one-time uses of curse words. But, following several awards shows with cursing celebrities in 2002 and 2003, the FCC toughened its policy after it concluded that a one-free-expletive rule did not make sense in the context of keeping the air waves free of indecency when children are likely to be watching television.

But Kennedy said the commission did not adequately explain that under the new policy ""a fleeting expletive or a brief shot of nudity could be actionably indecent.""

The stepped-up indecency enforcement, including issuing record fines for violations, also was spurred in part by widespread public outrage following Janet Jackson's breast-baring performance during the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show.

That incident, and the FCC's proposed fine of $550,000, are not part of the current case. The government has an appeal pending of a lower court ruling that threw out the fine in that case.

The material at issue in Thursday's decision includes the isolated use of expletives as well as fines against broadcasters who showed a woman's nude buttocks on a 2003 episode of the show ""NYPD Blue.""

In December 2002, singer Cher used the phrase ""F--- `em"" during the Billboard Music Awards show on the Fox television network. A month later, U2 lead singer Bono uttered the phrase ""f------ brilliant"" during NBC's broadcast of the Golden Globes awards show. In the December 2003 Billboard awards show on Fox, reality show star Nicole Richie said, ""Have you ever tried to get cow s--- out of a Prada purse? It's not so f------simple.""

But the challenge went beyond just the penalties for the use of fleeting expletives. The broadcasters wanted the court to free them from all regulation of content around the clock. The court's 1978 Pacifica decision upheld the FCC's reprimand of a New York radio station for airing a George Carlin monologue containing a 12-minute string of expletives in the middle of the afternoon.

The broadcasters argued that the revolution in technology that has brought the Internet, satellite television and cable makes even the old rules obsolete. The regulations only apply to broadcast channels.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a brief opinion that she would have overturned the Pacifica ruling, which she called wrong even when it was decided. Justice Sonia Sotomayor did not take part in the case because she was involved in an earlier version while sitting as an appeals court judge in New York.

178,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/11/what-911-taught-me-are-never-powerless-everyone-can-do-something.html,2,"Editor's note: A version of this column originally appeared in Fox News Opinion on September 11, 2011.

Everybody has their own unique before and after September 11 story, and how the attacks changed their lives. Here’s mine.

Today, I am the National Security Analyst for Fox News but fourteen years ago I was a full time, stay-at-home mom, Manhattan style. My life revolved around our five children and stepchildren – play dates, homework and watching endless rounds of sporting events.

Tuesday, September 11 was a beautiful day, so after dropping my kids off at school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, I did what New York housewives do best, and headed to down to Lower Manhattan to shop at a garment district, discount sample sale.

My daughter asked what could we do to help those people? I knew no one was going to survive inside those towers, and that these girls probably knew some of them, including their teacher’s husband.

It was a few minutes before 9 a.m., and I was just about to walk into the store. I happened to glance up and saw black smoke billowing out of one of the Twin Towers, twenty blocks away. I figured it was either a colossal fire or a small plane must have hit it. But once the second tower was hit, I knew immediately it had to be terrorists and that my city, and my country, were under some sort of attack.

I bought a Sony Walkman at a local electronics store, and listened to the news as I rushed the two miles back uptown to my children’s schools. I had no idea whether my husband or children were safe -- my cell phone wasn’t working, and even when I found a phone booth, there were long lines. I was quicker on foot.

When I got to my daughter’s school, parents were frantically picking up their children. My daughter’s teacher had just run out of the classroom to get to the Twin Towers, where her husband worked.

Mayor Giuliani was closing Manhattan’s bridges and tunnels, and the principal asked if I could take some of my daughters’ friends home with me. Their parents couldn’t be reached, and they had get the children out and close the school. It was the least I could do. I took my daughter plus eight more. Everyone Can Do Something.

My son’s school decided to remain open. One of his classmates had both parents in the Twin Towers, and no one had been able to reach them: their office phones weren’t answering, and the cell phones weren’t working. So my son and his friends sat vigil with their classmate. Everyone Can Do Something. His parents arrived at their classroom door a few hours later, covered from head to toe in white ash.

The second we got to the apartment I turned on the TV. My daughter and her friends crowded around to see people jumping from the Towers. One girl said that the people must be jumping into safety nets. I knew no nets could catch people jumping down one hundred stories, but didn’t say anything. And then we watched together in horror as the buildings collapsed.

My daughter asked what could we do to help those people? I knew no one was going to survive inside those towers, and that these girls probably knew some of them, including their teacher’s husband. We all had friends or family who worked in the Twin Towers, and unless they escaped in time, they were likely dead, maybe even hundreds and thousands of them.

There would be plenty of grief and tears ahead, but I didn’t want those girls to feel the helplessness that was beginning to seep in. We needed to do something, anything, to keep from being victims ourselves. I didn’t want their lesson from that day to be that we are helpless in the face of tragedy, that people could attack us and kill us and we could do nothing about it. Everyone Can Do Something.

So, I said that while we couldn’t help the people in the Towers, we could help the people who were helping them. The policeman and fireman who rushed downtown to rescue people would probably work through the night, and wouldn’t get home for dinner. So we made them cookies. Dozens of them. Chocolate-chip, oatmeal raisin, sugar cookies. And then we made them peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Dozens of them, too.

When we were finished I loaded the cookies and sandwiches into shopping bags and the girls and I walked a few blocks to the local police precinct and fire station, to deliver our cookies and sandwiches.

We walked past a hospital where New Yorkers who were normally too impatient to wait for the light to change before crossing the street, stood in long lines waiting to donate blood. Everyone Can Do Something.

When we got to the police station, an officer took us into his office and thanked each and every girl for helping, saying that once his men got back they would be so thankful for the homemade cookies and sandwiches. Everyone Can Do Something.

The officer told us that volunteers from all over Manhattan had already gone downtown to help with the rescue and recovery efforts. Everyone Can Do Something.

A few days later my children set up a lemonade stand in front of our apartment building to raise money for the children whose parents had died in the Towers. They were charging a dollar for a cookie and cup of lemonade. Most people gave them a $20 dollar bill and said keep the change. A few people dropped $100 bills into the box. Everyone Can Do Something.

So what could I do? Before marrying and moving to Manhattan to raise a family, I had been a career woman in Washington, at the heart of American foreign policy.

In the 1970’s and 80’s I held top national security posts in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations. In my last job, at the Pentagon, I held the civilian equivalent rank of a three star general but retired in the 1980’s, after President Reagan had put in place the policies that would ultimately defeat the Soviet Union. I had been a Cold Warrior, and figured my fight was won.

But if there were enemies out there who were now bombing my city and killing our children, I was back in the fight. Everyone Can Do Something.

So, while the acrid dust from the Twin Towers still hung over Manhattan, I sat down and wrote a long memorandum to my former colleague, Secretary of State Colin Powell, outlining a strategic communications plan should we go to war and offering to help.

I set out to educate myself about radical Islam, Al Qaeda, and Afghanistan. I rejoined foreign policy circles and gradually reentered public life.

Now, ten years after September 11, I am fully engaged as the National Security Analyst for Fox News. I comment on national security issues, write regular columns, and travel the country and the world talking about American foreign policy and the challenges we face.

One of my daughters decided the best way she could serve the country was in uniform. She graduated from the Naval Academy and is an officer in the Pacific Fleet.

My other daughter, who watched with me as the Twin Towers collapsed, studies international relations and terrorism. Everyone Can Do Something.

Middle East scholar Fouad Ajami once said that on September 11 Usama Bin Laden ""wanted a battle but he got a war.""

Bin Laden thought that if he could attack the United States, damage a few buildings and kill some people he would crack the American spirit. He and his ilk preach victimhood and prey on the resentment, desperation and anger of their people.

But he never understood the American people -- that behind our wealth and power and material comforts, we remain a nation that believes Everyone Can Do Something."
179,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/16/trump-bush-fiorina-three-questions-three-answers-at-second-gop-debate.html,2,"If they’d known the 2016 Republican contest would end up this way – a monument to one billionaire’s ego – CNN and its GOP partners could have switched Wednesday’s presidential debate from the Reagan Library to a more appropriate venue: Hearst Castle, just up the California coast.

After all, William Randolph Hearst and Donald Trump have this much in common. Each ran for president (Hearst, as a Democrat, in 1904). Neither was a fan of those who habla español (Hearst cheerleading for the Spanish-American War). Both plutocrats would have you believe they cared about ordinary folks (Hearst’s slogan: “the people who work for a living”).

Hearst turned out to be a political flop. And Trump? It’ll take a few more GOP debates to see what fate has in store for the man who builds not castles but towers and resorts bearing his name.

Carly Fiorina had the good sense to handle the Trump face-slap with dignity – saying, in effect, that voters are smart enough to know what the man intended.

There were three threshold questions going into Wednesday night’s festivities:

1. Could the GOP’s troika of non-politicians – Trump, Dr. Ben Carson and business executive Carly Fiorina – show they’re more than a protest vote?

2. Could former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush put forward a passion and wit that his friends insist he possesses, but he seems loath to display?

3. Could Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a hot commodity earlier this summer, breath new life into a campaign that’s stalled in the early-primary states?

The answers to those questions:

1. Trump showed no growth – same old Donald; same vagaries about domestic and foreign policy. Carson spoke only when spoken to, a startling low-key alternative to other attention-starved debaters (maybe it’s part of Carson’s strategy that social media trumps television). We’ll get to Fiorina in a moment.

2. Bush showed improvement over his performance in the Cleveland Fox News debate (granted, a low bar to clear). Two moments to remember: when he stood up to Trump and stood up for his brother (“he kept us safe”); at the end of the debate, when he chose “Eveready” as his Secret Service name (“it’s very high energy, Donald”). That should quell his nervous financial base – for now.

3. Another rough night for Walker, already not popular in California GOP circles for bailing on the state party’s convention. Back to Wisconsin for the governor and figuring what to do in Iowa.

If we can call two occurrences a trend, then here’s a big problem with the GOP debates thus far. Instead of a level playing field for the candidates, imagine a radial spoke with Trump at the center of the scheme. For the non-Donalds, the close-up moments tend to be Trump-related – and in a bad way (Bush, for example, asked to respond to Trump’s comments about his wife’s Mexican heritage). Is this because what Trump has to say is all that compelling, or are the moderators trying to keep the big audiences from clicking their remotes?

And that leads us to Carly Fiorina, the star of the Reagan Library debate.

Five weeks ago, I wrote this column about the former Hewlett-Packard executive after her bravura performance at the first of the two debates in Cleveland. Her performance that night jump-started her campaign, bumped her poll numbers and (with the candidate’s persistent shaming of CNN) landed her a spot in prime time.

On Wednesday in Simi Valley, as in Cleveland, she aced it. No other GOP hopeful could match Fiorina’s depth and clear conciseness on defense strategy (missile defense, strengthen the 6th Fleet).

No one was tougher on Hillary Clinton (who else could get away with repeatedly calling her a liar?). Fiorina had the good sense to handle the Trump face-slap with dignity – saying, in effect, that voters are smart enough to know what the man intended (Trump’s feeble attempt to close out that segment by saying he thought she was attractive? Maybe his flattest moment of the night).

Bonus points for Fiorina: she was the only one of the bunch who didn’t pander to the question about a new face on the $10 bill, spinning it into a call for women to be recognized as equals, not an interest group.

Trump, in fact, had several flat moments – taking a swipe at Rand Paul’s hair; saying he didn’t mean to slur Columba Bush, then refusing to apologize to her in person. Most disturbing of all: the ideas cupboard is still lightly stocked.

Does this mean we’ve reached the end of Trump Fever? One doubts it. The GOP is headed for an uncomfortable stretch during which the party will be at odds with itself over government shutdowns, Planned Parenthood funding and fallout from the Iran deal. That’s fuel for the fire for an anti-politician like Trump (it might also give Texas Sen. Ted Cruz a needed boost).

Besides, Trump is good for ratings, which might be why CNN began the debate with an uncomfortable Donald-related question (as did Fox News in its debate). But CNN took matters a step further: clumping the candidates close together; keeping them on the stage for long stretches between bathroom breaks, preventing candidates from speaking for long stretches – all ways to elevate tension.

Maybe Trump isn’t going away anytime soon. But on Wednesday night, there were signs that the act’s beginning to wear thin.

And Carly Fiorina? On the debate stage, she wears it well."
180,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/21/benghazi-fundamental-question-that-still-hasnt-been-answered.html,2,"The Benghazi Committee set out to investigate why four Americans died in Benghazi September 11, 2012, not to damage a presidential candidate. Rightly or wrongly, their credibility has been called into question, including by statements from fellow Republicans.

What I’ll be watching for on Thursday is not questions about Hillary Clinton’s emails; but the fundamental question: What were the Americans doing in Benghazi in the first place? Consulates and embassy annexes are where diplomats issue visas and find lost luggage, and that’s clearly not what former special forces Americans were doing.

Who was Ambassador Stevens supposed to meet in Benghazi, and who was responsible for his security?

Which Libyan militia groups were we partnering with and who vetted them?

The committee should focus on what happened in the weeks leading up to the Benghazi attack. They should ask why Ambassador Stevens’ repeated calls for more security were ignored.

For over a year there have been unconfirmed reports that the Benghazi was a gun running operation to take Qaddafi’s abandoned weapons and turn them over to Syrian rebels. Is this what the American contractors were doing – running guns?

Were we working with and arming Libyan rebels who turned out to be Al Qaeda-type terrorists? If that’s true, then not only was this foolish, it was illegal.

Some have said that all of this is reminiscent of Watergate. And yes, Secretary Clinton worked House Judiciary Committee as a 27-year-old staff attorney during the Watergate investigation. But these are echoes not of Watergate, as some have claimed, but of the Iran-Contra affair.

The committee should focus on what happened in the weeks leading up to the Benghazi attack.

They should ask why Ambassador Stevens’ repeated calls for more security were ignored.

They should question why there was no rescue mission mounted while our men were under attack.

And, yes, they should ask who decided to lie about the events on September 11, 2012 being a planned terrorist attack and instead of using the lame excuse that they were the result of a YouTube video sparking a demonstration that got out of hand.

These questions have all been asked before but they have never answered.

Now, fast forward to October 22, 2015, the committee has new evidence, including Ambassador Stevens’ own emails. This time it will be difficult for any witness to keep dodging the questions.

Finally, and perhaps the most fundamental question of all – was the fiasco of the Libyan war another example of the Obama administration’s love affair with moderately radical Islamists? Has the Obama administration been willfully blind -- from the start -- to the dangers posed by all radical Islamists in Libya, in Egypt, in Syria, in Iraq, in Iran?

There is an overwhelming temptation for any politician in today’s Washington to be partisan. But it was the same forty years ago during the Watergate scandal.

I know because I was there, working for Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger as a young aide in the West Wing. It was a dark time not just for the Nixon team, but for the country.

The nation’s business was put on hold for well over a year while we investigated the president and his closest associates.

In the end, the system worked. Nixon resigned, a new president was sworn in and the rift was healed. It was due in no small part to the integrity of the Watergate Committee members – both Republican and Democrat.

Most of them were able to rise above politics and serve the nation’s business. A few, however, learned a different lesson – not the lesson that no one is above the law, but as long as you don’t get caught…

Was Secretary Clinton trying to hide something with her private email system? Perhaps. But that’s for the FBI to decide, not the House Republicans."
181,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/29/paul-ryan-what-to-expect-with-new-speaker-in-charge-house.html,2,"A new beginning is upon us with the election of Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House of Representatives.

As almost always happens in Washington, when someone takes a new post of importance, especially after duress, there is a honeymoon period where hope and happy thoughts dominate the discussion.

Republicans and Democrats alike have given loud applause to Speaker Ryan’s early statements. Off to a good start is surely better than the alternative.

The question is whether there is any prospect of the new atmosphere having some genuine durability. For once, this observer thinks optimism is also realistic.

Given the poisonous climate of our political conversation, it is fair to demand an explanation of that position. Well, here it goes.

After running for Vice President in 2012, Paul Ryan took a step back. He revisited his assumptions about virtually everything under the sun. Ryan became as much an observer as a participant in the arena. Think of being the kid in the secret tree house, able to look down on the other children, watching and listening to all there was to see and hear. From that view, he had the chance to reflect carefully on the policies that he champions.

In April of 2014, Ryan advanced “The Path to Prosperity: A Responsible Balanced Budget.” This budget would cut spending by $5.1 trillion over the next ten years. Not all pain and suffering, the budget constituted a blueprint to also grow the economy to achieve a balanced budget. Yes, this budget is conservative in nature. No, it is not rigid dogma or unfairly austere.

The Ryan budget centers itself on five pillars—protecting the nation, expanding opportunity, strengthening the safety net, securing seniors’ retirement, and restoring fairness. As was the case then, there is little doubt the particulars in that budget will be met with opposition from Democrats. That is to be expected, and it is fine.

Another, probably minor in the eyes of others, piece of legislation gives some clarity to how it is that Paul Ryan thinks. That legislation would be the Evidence-Based Policymaking Commission Act of 2015.

Yes, government is already too big. That does not mean there is no need for government or that it cannot be put to useful purposes.

The Ryan legislation creates a structure and process to “make recommendations on how best to incorporate outcomes measurement, institutionalize randomized controlled trials, and rigorous impact analysis into program design.”

In simple English, what this means is that Paul Ryan wants government to use actual facts and data when it comes to formulating policy rather than just making it up along the way. This careful and deliberative approach will serve him well in the coming days.

Paul Ryan is a conservative in every respect of the term. His philosophy, his demeanor, and his words all convey a deep and abiding respect for the foundations that have made America great.

He has specifically stated to the House that it is his intention to return to “regular order.” This allows for one and all to participate in the lawmaking that is required to move the country forward. He will respect those who disagree with him without compromising his own views or seeing a need to allow perfection to be the enemy of the good.

Paul Ryan knows who he is, what he believes, and where the House of Representatives fits into the fabric of the nation and its government. In his first speech as Speaker he commented “the House represented the best of America: the boundless opportunity to do good.” He added: “I am not interested in laying blame. We are not settling scores. We are wiping the slate clean.”

Speaker Ryan will encounter more than a few obstacles in the quest to help advance the nation in a forward direction. Because he understands and advocates the policies that can contribute in a positive fashion to this progress, and because he understands how to go about the business of legislating, we ought to have every hope for a successful Speakership.

Our Thanksgiving tip? Print this out and tuck it into your pocket as you prepare to enjoy Thursday's feast.



DO

? Do go in prepared. Have more facts than your crazy Uncle Mac.

? Do practice conversation stranger danger (if you’re sitting next to someone you don’t know, start with easy topics like the weather and football -- don’t launch into your thoughts about 2016)

? Do seek common ground -- find a way to say, “we agree, that’s a great point, I see your point of view.” It takes the sting out of when you drop the atomic elbow with your best point

? Do prepare yourself. Avoid confrontation if you don’t want one. Start drinking early.

? Do plant conspiracy theories in your political opponents heads so that they’ll sound crazy at the diner the next day.

DON’T

? Don’t get emotionally attached. It’s not worth a big family argument

? Don’t take the bait. When they say Obama is great, just say, “Would you pass the potatoes, please?”

? Don’t leave with the argument boiling inside you - imagine balling it up and throwing it into the fire before you go.

? Don’t throw any food. Or I you do, choose the mash potatoes or a roll -- those are less likely to stain than the cranberries."
183,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/12/02/carson-tumbles-rubio-rises-and-trump-still-on-top-in-new-national-gop-poll.html,2,"A new poll released Wednesday shows Dr. Ben Carson falling to third place in the race for the Republican 2016 nomination, while Florida Senator Marco Rubio surges into second – but still a significant distance behind frontrunner Donald Trump, who holds a comfortable lead.

The Quinnipiac University National Poll shows Trump leading with 27 percent of Republican voters, while Rubio moves into second place with 17 percent. Carson, who was in a virtual tie with Trump in a Quinnipiac poll taken last month, finds his support dropping to 16 percent, now tied with Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

In October, Carson polled at 23 percent, just shy of Trump’s 24 percent. In a Quinnipiac poll taken at the end of September, Carson polled at 17 percent – putting him in second place at that time.

Meanwhile Rubio's numbers show a steady increase from the 9 percent he received in September, and 14 percent he received last month.

Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush still finds his support in single digits, polling at just 5 percent, while no other candidate tops 3 percent.

“It doesn’t seem to matter what he says or who he offends, whether the facts are contested or the ‘political correctness’ is challenged, Donald Trump seems to be wearing Kevlar,” said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.

In the race for the Democratic nomination, frontrunner Hillary Clinton widened her lead over Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. The poll finds Clinton beats Sanders 60-30 percent, a significant boost over her 53-35 lead in the November poll.

In good news for the Democrats, the poll finds that in a general election matchup, Clinton beats Trump 47-41 percent, ties with Rubio, beats Carson 46-43 percent, and tops Cruz 47-42 percent."
184,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/12/01/obama-touts-progress-against-isis-sets-low-expectations-for-russian-cooperation.html?intcmp=hplnws,2,"President Obama used a press conference Tuesday at the Paris climate summit to once again claim progress in the U.S.-led coalition’s campaign against the Islamic State, while also setting low near-term expectations for gaining Russian President Vladimir Putin's full cooperation in the fight.

The president, speaking before he departs the climate summit to return to Washington, said “it is possible” over the next several months that there will be ""a shift in calculation in the Russians and a recognition that it's time to bring the civil war in Syria to a close.""

But he quickly tempered that prediction by acknowledging Russia is hitting Syrian opposition targets, some of whom are supported by the U.S.

“I don’t expect you’re going to see a 180 turn on their strategy over the next several weeks,” Obama said.

The president said the U.S. shouldn’t be under any “illusions” that Russia will start “hitting only ISIL targets.”

Obama said that wasn’t happening before, and, “It’s not going to be happening in the next several weeks.”

The comments demonstrate the potentially slow and plodding path ahead toward resolving the Syrian civil war.

While Russia opposes the Islamic State – which claimed credit for bringing down a Russian flight over Egypt – Moscow also supports Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.

Obama, though, reiterated that the civil war cannot come to an end while Assad remains in power

Obama suggested his hope is that diplomatic talks in Vienna result in a gradual change, including “pockets of cease-fires in and around Syria.”

This, he said, could bring about a “conversation about politics.”

Still, he conceded the extremist threat that has wrought fear across the Middle East and the West would not be eliminated in the short term.

""ISIL is going to continue to be a deadly organization because of its social media, the resources it has and the networks of experienced fighters that it possesses,"" Obama said, using one of several acronyms for the extremist group. ""It's going to continue to be a serious threat for some time to come.""

Concerns about ISIS have overshadowed Obama's two-day trip to Paris, where ISIS-linked attacks killed 130 people last month in the run-up to the climate negotiations. Obama had sought to turn the outrage over the Paris attacks and the group's shoot-down of a Russian passenger jet in Egypt into new resolve for stepping up the fight against ISIS.

Yet those hopes have been dampened by the spiraling diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Russia, sparked late last month when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane it said had violated its airspace along the border with Syria. The U.S. sees both Russia and Turkey as critical to resolving the Syria crisis.

Aiming to head off a rift between the two major Mideast players, Obama urged both to ""de-escalate"" their conflict and not get distracted from the campaign against ISIS. Yet in a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Obama also vouched for the NATO ally's right to self-defense, and he pledged a solid U.S. commitment ""to Turkey's security and its sovereignty.""

Sitting down with Erdogan on the sidelines of climate talks, Obama said the U.S. was very interested in accelerating its military relationship with Turkey. He also praised Turkey for generously accepting refugees fleeing violence in Syria, and credited Turkey with strengthening security along its border.

Turkey, too, hopes to avoid tensions with Russia, Erdogan told reporters as he and Obama finished their roughly hour-long meeting.

185,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/12/06/obama-speech-reassurances-about-isis-fall-flat-in-oval-office-address.html,1,"In the wake of the worst terrorist attack in America since 9/11, President Obama could have used his Oval Office address on Sunday night to announce different policies than the ones that have obviously failed to keep America safe from radical Islam.

He could have explained why a long-feared arrival of low-tech, soft-target terrorism had occurred, and what he would do to rectify the problem—beginning with apologizing for giving a U.S. visa to a jihadist from Pakistan and agreeing to stop his plan to bring more Syrian refugees here.

He could have announced a plan to undermine the ideology of our enemies—radical Islam—which impelled Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik to wage war in San Bernardino last week.

Instead he did what he always does with security threats: blame others for his administration’s lapses and do the minimum to appear to be reacting to them without actually doing anything.

The president instinctively wants to react to every security threat by assailing his domestic opponents.

In calling for Congress to ban those on the no-fly list from buying guns, Obama is attempting one of his trademark shifts in blame for problems he has created. The president instinctively wants to react to every security threat by assailing his domestic opponents.

Even if his proposed ban and other gun control measures were in place, they would not have stopped the attack in San Bernardino. Recent attacks like those in Paris show that jihadists have little problem overcoming gun laws, which serve mainly to disarm the law-abiding. Obama could also look to his adopted hometown of Chicago to see that gun control doesn’t work.

Obama’s moralizing about avoiding “suspicion and hate” implied, once again, that Americans are bigoted — another attempt to shift blame. It echoed a statement last week by Attorney General Loretta Lynch that the government would prosecute anti-Muslim speech that “edges toward violence,” whatever that means.

Thus did our government reveal its contempt for us and our Constitution in the wake of an attack it failed to prevent.

Obama’s reassurances about the fight against ISIS fell flat. In effect, a ragtag army of about 20,000 men have stood up to a year and a half of a U.S.-led war and prevailed—all the while expanding their influence around the globe. Their success has inspired attacks like the ones in Paris and San Bernardino.

Calling for Congress to approve retroactively his anti-ISIS campaign, as he did again in his Sunday evening prime time address, will do nothing to improve the flagging effort. This is merely another attempt to shift blame for failure down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to Congress.

Obama failed to climb down from his assessment that ISIS is “contained”—something that not even his own top general believes.

The president also preemptively surrendered to ISIS insurgents he said would sap any American-led ground forces, despite the success of the 2007 surge in Iraq that proved otherwise, and the fact that a U.S-led coalition could turn administration of Syria over to local tribes after destroying ISIS.

Sunday nights’ sad speech makes one wonder what the White House was thinking. Obama has always resisted addresses from the Oval Office for unclear reasons. In one of only two other such speeches during his tenure, he cheered our exit from Iraq, in which hard-won American gains were thrown away and the vacuum ISIS would eventually fill was created.

Whatever the reason, his aversion to Oval Office addresses may have been wise: the setting doesn’t suit him.

The office awaits a new president who can confidently explain how a restored America with restored alliances can defeat ISIS rapidly and with overwhelming force, fight back in the cultural and ideological war radical Islam is waging against us, and defend rather than blame the American people.

186,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/12/08/trump-calls-for-complete-shutdown-on-muslims-entering-us.html?intcmp=hpbt2,2,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump doubled down Tuesday on his plan to slam the door on Muslims seeking to enter the U.S., including refugees, tourists and, potentially, even Muslim Americans returning from trips abroad.

“We have no idea who is coming into our country, no idea if they like us or hate us,” Trump told supporters in South Carolina Monday night. “I wrote something today that is very salient…and probably not very politically correct. But I don’t care.”

The sweeping proposal for what Trump called a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” has drawn condemnation from Muslim groups, civil rights advocates, Democrats and Trump’s rivals for the GOP nomination. But in typical Trump fashion, the tough-talking tycoon is not walking back anything. Appearing on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” Tuesday, Trump invoked former President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s World War II proclamation that German, Italian and Japanese people, including American citizens, were potentially “enemy aliens” who could be detained if in the U.S.

“Look at what FDR did many years ago, and he’s one of the most respected presidents,” Trump said. “We have people in this country that want to blow up our country — you know it and so do I. They’re looking at the jihad. They want a jihad.”

Trump also appeared on CNN’s “New Day,” and MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” where repeated his pledge.

""You're going to have many more World Trade Centers if you don't solve it -- many, many more and probably beyond the World Trade Center,"" Trump told CNN anchor Chris Cuomo.

On MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Trump raised the ire of host Joe Scarborough after he repeatedly interrupted co-host Mika Brezezinski while she attempted to ask questions.

“Go to break, go to break,” an exasperated Scarborough said when Trump filibustered the hosts.

“Go to break, then, Joe. Go to break,” Trump taunted before the segment abruptly ended.

Trump’s proposal came five days after a radical Muslim couple killed 14 people and injured 21 at a holiday office party in San Bernardino, Calif., and as President Obama is seeking to resettle thousands of Syrian refugees in the U.S. Critics have questioned whether the refugees can be effectively screened, but none have gone so far as to call for a ban on all Muslims.

“Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,” Trump said in a statement.

Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told The Associated Press that Trump's proposed ban would apply to ""everybody,"" including Muslims seeking immigration visas as well as tourists seeking to enter the country.

Trump did not respond to questions about whether any ban would also include Muslims who are U.S. citizens and travel outside the country - or how a determination of someone's religion might be made by customs and border officials.

In response to a request for additional detail, Trump said via a campaign spokeswoman: ""Because I am so politically correct, I would never be the one to say. You figure it out!""

Meanwhile, his rivals for the Republican nomination wasted no time weighing in, with Jeb Bush tweeting that Trump “is unhinged” and Carly Fiorina calling the proposal an ""overreaction [as] dangerous as President Obama's under-reaction.""

Muslim leaders also expressed outrage at the idea.

""This type of knee jerk, if not demagogic policy stance, is unmitigated surrender to the Islamist global narrative that they, ISIS, and all the Islamist theocrats of the world own what is and is not Islam and faithful Muslim,"" said Zuhdi Jasser, president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy.

From the Democratic presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders said ""Trump and others want us to hate all Muslims"" and Hillary Clinton called the proposal ""reprehensible, prejudiced and divisive.""

On Capitol Hill, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona said, ""It's just foolish.""

But will it hurt Trump in the campaign? ""I have no idea,"" McCain said. ""I thought long ago that things he said would hurt his prospects, and he continues to go up.""

187,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/12/14/gop-debate-preview-which-candidate-will-leave-vegas-with-all-chips.html,2,"Befitting Frank Sinatra’s centennial birthday and “Old Blue Eyes’” fascination with presidential politics (he helped orchestrate JFK’s and Ronald Reagan’s inaugurals), Tuesday’s GOP debate will occur at the Venetian Las Vegas. It sits atop the ruins of the Sands Hotel – in early 1960, home to the famed “summit” featuring Frank, Dean, Sammy and their ring-a-ding pals.

Not that anyone is calling the nine presidential hopefuls in Tuesday’s main event the new “Rat Pack.” Smoking, boozing and late-night prowling? Not these conservative rats.

That said, Las Vegas and its various means of risking fortunes are an apt metaphor for this, the fifth GOP presidential debate.

Think of it as an evening of political roulette. With the following wagers:

The Outside Bet. In roulette, a wager made in the boxes surrounding the table’s numbers. Donald Trump, the field’s lead outsider, enters this debate as, per usual, the center of attention. For two reasons: his call to ban Muslim immigration into the U.S.; and this Fox News poll showing the bombastic billionaire giving way to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in Iowa. Trump knows his way around a casino, having wagered big on Atlantic City. Does he stick to a safe betting strategy – a voice for the disaffected slice of the GOP electorate – or does Trump gamble on more to be gained by deconstructing Cruz?

As for the Texas senator, he’s making . . .

The Color Bet. Red, black or green? Cruz is letting it ride on red – a red-state strategy that’s made him the field’s new alpha dog. Cruz may indeed prevail in Iowa; he’s planning on a big haul in the March 1 Super Tuesday across the Deep South. Cruz also is raking in endorsements from conservative stalwarts (veteran direct-mailer Richard Viguerie and Bob Vander Plaats, president and CEO of the Family Leader Organization). Betting on one color produces modest winnings – maybe not so for a candidate planning on hanging around the table until next July and the national convention in Cleveland.

There’s a void within the GOP field. That would be the space as yet unfilled by a candidate who can blend measured outrage at the thought of terrorism returning to U.S. soil with a concrete strategy of force and stick-to-itiveness.

The Straight-Up Bet. Wagering on a single number and hoping for a miraculous return (in roulette, a 35-1 payoff). This would be Jeb Bush, once a frontrunner who seemingly held all the chips (well, at least a lot of super PAC money) but now a candidate struggling for relevance (7%, or fifth place, in last weekend’s NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll). The problem: Bush has been anything but “money” in the four previous debates when he needed to shine among the contenders. If this keeps up: he’s the Vegas player who has little to show for his troubles, other than a free breakfast voucher.

The Corner Bet. Placing the chip on a “corner” where four numbers intersect, earning the better an 8-1 payoff. This is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s ploy, as he once again wagers on what’s paid off in this race: a four-fold appeal of youth, electability, stage presence and media buzz. If the polls are to be taken seriously, the smart parlay over at the Venetian’s race & sports book is Cruz-Trump-Rubio to win place and show in Cleveland – not necessarily in that order.

The Split Bet. Placing the chips on a line between two numbers, which seems appropriate for Dr. Ben Carson given that he’s talking about splitting from the GOP if the primary process gives way to a backroom-brokered national convention next summer. Carson’s dissatisfaction has fueled speculation of an independent run next fall. In which case, the house doesn’t win – but Hillary Clinton probably does.

The Line Bet. Made by playing chips on the vertical line separating the outside and inside betting areas. This would be Carly Fiorina, who straddles the line between political insider and outsider. Fiorina’s cleverly marketed herself as a campaign ingénue when in fact she’s a veteran of a California Senate race and stumping for John McCain in 2008. With that Fox News poll showing only 2% support in Iowa, Fiorina may soon run out of chips to bet.

There’s one other wager to mull: is this New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s time to shine?

In the aftermath of the San Bernardino mass shooting, President Obama’s underwhelming Oval Office speech and Trump’s dumpster-fire of an immigration ban, there’s a void within the GOP field. That would be the space as yet unfilled by a candidate who can blend measured outrage at the thought of terrorism returning to U.S. soil with a concrete strategy of force and stick-to-itiveness – all in a manner less nativist and more deduced than what Trump floated.

That sounds like an opening for Christie – actually, the first-term version of Christie that didn’t shy away from confronting entrenched obstacles. Or, for that matter, any other Republican who wants to bet on national security as foremost on Americans’ minds.

With less than seven week left until Iowa: go big or go home.

There’s a void within the GOP field. That would be the space as yet unfilled by a candidate who can blend measured outrage at the thought of terrorism returning to U.S. soil with a concrete strategy of force and stick-to-itiveness."

189,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/12/24/homeland-security-reportedly-readying-deportation-raids-early-next-year.html?intcmp=hplnws,2,"The Department of Homeland Security is planning deportation raids targeting hundreds of families who have entered the United States since the start of last year, according to a published report.

The Washington Post, citing officials familiar with the plan, reported that the raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would detain and deport adults and children who have already been ordered removed by an immigration judge. The targeted groups include illegal immigrants who failed to show up for court dates to hear their asylum applications after they were detained by federal agents.

The Post report noted that the raids have not been given final approval by DHS and have been a subject of fierce debate within the Obama administration. The report added that DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson has pushed for the operations after a fresh surge of families crossing the border this past October and November, as well as a federal judge's August decision ordering the administration to begin releasing immigrant families from specially-built detention centers.

An estimated 100,000 familes with adults and children have entered the U.S. since the start of last year, according to the Post, though this migration has been overshadowed by a similar surge of unaccompanied minors.

""If individuals come here illegally, do not qualify for asylum or other relief, and have final orders of removal, they will be sent back consistent with our laws and our values.” DHS spokesman Marsha Catron told the Post.

Those in favor of tighter immigration limits have expressed skepticism that the raids would deport sufficient numbers to discourage any further influx.

""It’s a drop in the bucket compared to the number they’ve admitted into the country,"" Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies told the paper. ""If you have photogenic raids on a few dozen illegal families and that’s the end of it, it’s just for show. It’s ... enforcement theater.""

Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign has been punished by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for improperly accessing voter data compiled by Hillary Clinton's campaign.

The Washington Post first reported late Thursday that Sanders' campaign manager had acknowledged a low-level staffer had viewed the information and was fired as a result. The Post reported that the DNC has told the Sanders campaign that it will not have access to the party's master list of likely Democratic voters until it provides an explanation and destroys any copies of Clinton campaign data that it posesses.

The DNC rents out the master list to national and state campaigns, which add their own information compiled by volunteers and field workers.

Being shut out of seeing the list for any length of time would be a major blow to Sanders, who is attempting to cut into Clinton's sizable lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

A Fox News poll released Sunday shows Clinton with a 14-point lead over Sanders among likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa, while a poll of New Hampshire primary voters released Thursday shows the two in a statistical tie.

The software vendor that handles the DNC master list told the Post that the breach occurred Wednesday while a patch was being applied to the software. The process briefly disabled the firewall surrounding the Clinton campaign's data.

Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs placed the blame for the incident in large part on the vendor, NGP VAN.

“Sadly, the vendor who runs the DNC's voter file program continues to make serious errors. On more than one occasion, the vendor has dropped the firewall between the data of different Democratic campaigns,” he said in a statement to Fox News. While saying it was “unacceptable” for a campaign staffer to access “some modeling data from another campaign,” he also said they want to work with the DNC and vendor to fix the “software flaws” that could make Sanders’ records vulnerable as well.

Another campaign official told the Post that the Clinton data was never downloaded or printed.

On Monday Obama will visit the Pentagon, where he is expected to further explain his plan to stop the extremist group. But he is not expected to announce any significant strategy changes.

The event follows his Dec. 6 Oval Office address that critics say didn’t reassure the public and failed to provide an updated strategy to stop ISIS.

The address came four days after the San Bernardino, Calif., terror attacks in which 14 people were shot and killed and 21 others were wounded.

The Obama administration says this week’s visits also will serve as further warning that the rhetoric of front-runner GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump could embolden extremists looking to pull the United States into a war with Islam.

""Terrorists like ISIL are trying to divide us along lines of religion and background,"" Obama said Saturday in his weekly radio and Internet address, using an acronym for the extremist group. ""That's how they stoke fear. That's how they recruit.""

In the coming week, he said, ""we'll move forward on all fronts.""

The visits also follow the Paris suicide bombing attacks last month, for which ISIS claimed responsibility and in which 130 people were killed.

Seven in 10 Americans rated the risk of a terrorist attack in the U.S. as at least somewhat high, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll.

That was a sharp increase from the 5 in 10 who said that in January. U.S. officials have insisted there are no specific, credible threats to the country.

But the apparent lack of warning before the San Bernardino attack has fueled concerns about whether the U.S. has a handle on potential attacks, especially during high-profile times such as the end-of-year holidays.

A Muslim husband-wife team carried out the deadly Dec. 2 attack at a holiday party.

FBI Director James Comey told Capitol Hill lawmakers Wednesday that each was radicalized on their own at least two years ago and bonded over online talk of ""jihad"" and ""martyrdom.""

Investigators originally suspected wife Tashfeen Malik, 29, radicalized her husband after she came to the U.S. in July 2014 on a fiancée visa. But they now believe Syed Farook, 28, was already committed to radical Islam before they met.

In addition, Malik got the visa despite apparently expressing her desire on social media to commit jihad.

Obama's trip to the Pentagon marks a rare meeting outside the White House by his National Security Council and will be followed by a public update about the fight against ISIS.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Obama does not intend to announce any major changes in approach.

""If there's an opportunity for us to intensify efforts behind one aspect of our strategy, then that is something that he wants his team to be prepared to do,"" Earnest said.

On Thursday, at the National Counterterrorism Center, which analyzes intelligence at its facility in suburban Virginia, Obama plans to address reporters after a briefing by intelligence and security agencies on threat assessments.

Obama receives a similar briefing each year before the holidays.

Concerns about extremism emanating from the Middle East have taken center stage in the presidential race.

Obama has tried to use his bully pulpit as a counterpoint to GOP front-runner Trump and his widely condemned proposal to bar Muslims from entering the U.S., and to push back on other politicians insisting on halting resettlement of Syrian refugees in the U.S.

The White House has also scheduled a conference call Monday with religious leaders about ways to fight discrimination and promote religious tolerance.

And Obama is to speak Tuesday at the National Archives Museum, where 31 immigrants from Iraq, Ethiopia, Uganda and 23 other nations will be sworn in as U.S. citizens. He plans to use that occasion to reframe the national conversation about immigrants around the country's founding values of tolerance and freedom.

Despite Obama's reassurances, Republicans say Obama has failed to grasp the severity of the risk.

Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, said the threat from ISIS and other terrorist groups presents ""a clear and present danger to the United States.""

""We can't contain this threat. We have to defeat it,"" Hurd said in the weekly GOP address. ""To defeat ISIS, we have to be in this for the long haul.""

192,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/12/29/affluenza-teen-and-his-mother-detained-in-mexico.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"Texas authorities may seek adult prison for Ethan Couch — the Texas teen who used affluence, or 'affluenza,' as a juvenile defense to skip jail time for a drunk-driving accident that killed four people — after they announced he was taken into custody with his mother, Tonya, by Mexican authorities Monday in Puerto Vallarta, nearly two weeks after the 18-year-old failed to show up for a probation appointment.

The announcement was made during a late-morning press conference where authorities laid out possible legal options for the state to pursue. Couch will have a court hearing on Jan. 19 where the district attorney will motion to move the juvenile case to adult court. The juvenile judge will make the decision on where the case will be heard.

Couch and his mother were located and arrested by Mexican authorities on a road in the resort city of Puerto Vallarta. Couch, who was previously known to have blond hair, had brown hair but authorities were able to make a positive identification.

Authorities said it appears that the two planned the escape.

""They even had something that was almost akin to a going-away party before leaving town,"" Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson said.

Anderson said an arrest warrant would be issued for Couch's mother, Tonya Couch, on charges of hindering an apprehension. A prosecutor says that during a hearing next month they plan to ask a judge to transfer Ethan Couch's case to adult court.

Couch's attorneys, Scott Brown and Reagan Wynn, said in a statement they won't comment on the case until they speak with their client, which likely won't happen before Couch reaches the U.S. The two were being held at immigration offices in the state capital, Guadalajara, and would be returned to the United States aboard a commercial flight to Houston sometime Tuesday.

""They are going to be sent back to their country, given that they were in Mexico improperly,"" Ariel Vera said. ""They would have had to enter, for example, as tourists, but they entered without registering.""

Mexico's Jalisco state prosecutors' office said its agents had been working with American authorities since Dec. 26 to track down and capture Couch and his mother.

They were found in a dowdy section of Puerto Vallarta's old town, far from the glitzy resorts, golf courses and high-rise hotels of the city's newer section. The street corner where they were found is dotted with a small sandwich shop, a taco stand, and a mom-and-pop corner store. A playground and a day-care center with a fence topped with razor wire stand nearby.

Couch was apparently trying to lie low; a photo distributed by the Jalisco state prosecutor's office show him in detention with his blond hair dyed black and his normally blondish beard a light brown.

Anderson has said he believes the two fled in late November after a video surfaced that appears to show Couch at a party where people were drinking. If found to be drinking, Couch's probation could be revoked and he could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.

Couch was driving drunk and speeding on a dark two-lane road south of Fort Worth in June 2013 when he crashed into a disabled SUV off to the side, killing four people and injuring several others, including passengers in Couch's pickup truck.

He pleaded guilty to four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault causing serious bodily injury. Because of his age, he wasn't certified as an adult for trial and a judge sentenced him in juvenile court to 10 years' probation and a stint in a rehabilitation center.

The U.S. Marshals Service had issued a wanted poster promising a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to Ethan Couch's whereabouts and capture.

193,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/12/28/week-severe-weather-leaves-at-least-43-dead-across-seven-states.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"Blizzard conditions and flash flood warnings hit the already-ravaged residents of the heartland Monday after a string of severe storms left at least 43 people dead across seven states during the previous four days.

Parts of 11 states were under a winter storm warning Monday morning as the weather system that spawned tornadoes in Texas and flooding in Missouri moved on.

The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings for southern and eastern parts of Missouri, including St. Louis, and a small section of northern Arkansas. Most of Arkansas, eastern Oklahoma, central Missouri and central Illinois were under a flood warning. Authorities said more than 180 Missouri roads and several bridges in the state were closed following heavy rainfall during the weekend, and more expected Monday.



Forecasters said Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and parts of Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas would see winter weather conditions ranging from heavy snow to ice, accompanied by gusty winds.

Parts of the Southeast would see rain, while more severe weather was possible in Mississippi.

The gloomy forecasts came as residents of the Dallas area began to assess the damage from Saturday's string of at least nine tornadoes that swept through the region, killing at least 11 people.

Local officials estimated as many as 1,450 homes were damaged or destroyed. Vehicles were mangled, power lines fell and trees were toppled. Heavy rain, wind and falling temperatures hampered cleanup efforts Sunday afternoon.

""This is a huge impact on our community, and we're all suffering,"" Garland Police Lt. Pedro Barineau said of the suburb about 20 miles northeast of Dallas, where eight people died, 15 were injured and about 600 structures, mostly single-family homes, were damaged.

The National Weather Service said an EF-4 tornado, which is the second-most powerful with winds up to more than 200 mph, hit the community at about 6:45 p.m. Saturday. It was near the intersection of Interstate 30 and George Bush Turnpike, which is a major route in the region. At least three people who died were found in vehicles, said Barineau, who also noted that some cars appeared to be thrown from the interstate, though it wasn't known whether that was how the people found in the vehicles died.

Barineu described the scene in the town to the Dallas Morning News as ""total devastation.""

The destruction in Garland was so overwhelming that Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins declared the city a disaster within mere minutes of seeing the toll firsthand.

""I don't declare local disasters lightly,"" Jenkins said. ""But I looked at the scene for 10 minutes, spoke to the incident commander and then called the lawyers to bring the paperwork.""

In the nearby town of Rowlett, City Manager Brian Funderburk said Sunday morning that 23 people were injured, but that there were no deaths and no reports of missing people. The weather service said damage indicated it was likely an EF-3 tornado, which has winds up to 165 mph.

Jenkins said in a statement Sunday night that as many as 600 homes were damaged in Rowlett.

Three other people died in Collin County, about 45 miles northeast of Dallas, according to sheriff's deputy Chris Havey, although the circumstances were not immediately clear.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott made disaster declarations Sunday for four counties — Dallas, Collin, Rockwall and Ellis — and warned that the number of victims could rise.

Meanwhile, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin declared a state of emergency as there were blizzard conditions and an ice storm warning out west and flood warnings in the east, where one community had received 9 inches of rain. The state Department of Emergency Management said eight storm-related injuries were reported. About 60,000 homes and businesses were without power.

In neighboring Arkansas, officials said it appeared that a tornado touched down in Bearden, tearing roofs off buildings and uprooting trees. There were no immediate reports of injuries.

Further north, rain caused dangerous driving conditions and flooding in Missouri, where Gov. Jay Nixon also declared a state of emergency, and Illinois.

Six people died overnight when two separate vehicles drove into flooded roadways in south-central Missouri, Pulaski County Sheriff Ronald Long said. Among them were four international soldiers based at Fort Leonard Wood, he said. Greene County authorities said two fatalities there were associated with the flooding.

In southern Illinois, authorities said three adults and two children drowned Saturday evening when the vehicle they were riding in was swept away and sank in a rain-swollen creek.

The death toll in the Southeast linked to severe weather rose to 19 on Sunday when Alabama authorities found the body of a 22-year-old man whose vehicle was swept away while attempting to cross a bridge; a 5-year-old's body was recovered for that incident Saturday. Ten people have died in Mississippi, and six died in Tennessee. One person was killed in Arkansas.

194,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/12/21/at-least-11-hurt-after-car-plows-into-crowd-on-las-vegas-strip.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"A 24-year-old homeless woman who cops said had been living in her car with her 3-year-old daughter in Las Vegas for about a week was charged Monday in the automobile rampage that killed one and wounded at least 35 others Sunday night.

Lakeisha N. Holloway appeared “stoic” when cops encountered her soon after the 1996 Oldsmobile sedan she was driving plowed into a crowd on the Las Vegas Strip multiple times – all while a young child was sitting in the backseat.

“She didn’t appear to be distressed due to her actions,” Sheriff Joe Lombardo said during a Monday news conference.

Holloway was booked Monday on charges including murder, first-degree child abuse or neglect and failing to stop at the scene of an accident, according to Clark County Detention Center records.

Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said he anticipated also filing numerous counts of attempted murder. The charge of fleeing the scene is a felony and, as of Oct. 1, is a non-probationable offense.

He said seeking the death penalty was “a consideration.”

Authorities said Sunday they “know this was not an act of terrorism,” though Lombardo did leave some wiggle room on Monday.

“As of now we do not believe it to be an act of terrorism,” he said, noting that officials were not “100 percent ruling out the possibility” and are working with the FBI.

“The act is going to be very hard to explain at face value,” said Lombardo, who reiterated that whatever the ultimate classification, cops believe the carnage was “an intentional act.”

Lombardo also suggested a falling out with the child’s father could be a possible motive, though he said authorities believed the father was living in Dallas.

“At some point we believe she was attempting to make her way that direction through Las Vegas,” Lombardo said.

But Holloway never made it out of the city following a horrific scene on the Strip that she’s accused of creating.

The driver “went up and off these streets, two or possible three times,” Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Lt. Dan McGrath said. The suspect then allegedly drove off before being apprehended outside the Tuscany Casino. After Holloway pulled into the casino lot, Lombardo said, she left her child in the car, approached a valet and told him “she ran over some individuals on Las Vegas Boulevard.”

Holloway did not demonstrate signs of being under the influence of alcohol, Lombardo said, though a police expert believed she was under the influence of “some sort of stimulant.” Results of a blood test are pending.

Part of the reason Lombardo said he can’t discount terrorism as a motive is Holloway’s murky background. Investigators believe she’s originally from the Oregon area, but otherwise have hit roadblocks.

Holloway was convicted of operating a vehicle without driving privileges and driving uninsured in December 2011, according to Oregon court records obtained by oregonlive.com.

A woman named Lakeisha Holloway, and fitting the description of the woman booked in Las Vegas, was profiled in an Oregon paper, The Skanner, in 2012 after she won a CARE Role Model award. That article details Holloway’s struggles in high school, including being homeless during her freshman year. Holloway also described her mother’s battles with alcohol. The Skanner piece noted that Halloway wanted to pursue a career in forestry service.

A Facebook page for a woman believed to be Halloway shows images of a newborn daughter in 2012 and a photo of the Paris Hotel & Casino in October 2012 – more than three years before she’s suspected of driving into a crowd of people outside that structure with that child in the vehicle.

The crash unfolded at around 6:40 p.m. local time (9:40 p.m. EST). A woman's car was in the northbound lanes of Las Vegas Boulevard near Bellagio Way when it drove up onto the sidewalk in front of the Paris and struck pedestrians, police Lt. Peter Boffelli said. Witnesses said the car appeared to be travelling about 30 to 40 mph.

The incident took place in one of the busiest areas of the Strip, across from the famous dancing water fountains of the Bellagio hotel-casino.

The woman who died was 32-year-old Jessica Valenzuela, according to Clark County Coroner John Fudenberg. Valenzuela, of Buckeye, Ariz., was visiting Las Vegas with her husband, Fudenberg said. An autopsy is scheduled for later Monday and the cause of death is pending.

195,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/12/23/washington-post-pulls-cartoon-depicting-ted-cruzs-daughters-as-trained-monkeys.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"The Washington Post removed an editorial cartoon from its website late Tuesday that depicted Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz's young daughters as trained monkeys.

As of midnight Wednesday, the webpage where the cartoon by Ann Telnaes had been shown was replaced by a note from the Post's editorial page editor, Fred Hiatt.

""It’s generally been the policy of our editorial section to leave children out of it,"" Hiatt wrote. ""I failed to look at this cartoon before it was published. I understand why Ann thought an exception to the policy was warranted in this case, but I do not agree.""

Politico reported the cartoon was in response to an online ad released by Cruz's campaign that depicted him reading politics-related Christmas stories to his daughters, 7-year-old Caroline and 4-year-old Catherine. Telnaes herself referenced the ad on Twitter earlier Tuesday.

Earlier Tuesday, the Texas senator criticized the Post on Twitter over the cartoon, which depicted him as an organ grinder dressed in a Santa Claus costume while two similarly-clad monkeys danced on leashes in front of him. The cartoon was captioned, ""Ted Cruz uses his kids as political props.""

Cruz was backed in his criticism by Republican rival and fellow Senator Marco Rubio, himself a father of four.

Cruz, though, is hardly the first candidate – of either party – to use his family and kids in a campaign ad.

Hillary Clinton’s first presidential campaign featured footage of daughter Chelsea in a 2007 ad, and her second showed a photo of she and Bill Clinton’s first grandchild in an ad earlier this year.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, released an ad featuring his daughters last year. And former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum likewise released an ad in 2011 featuring his family.

Telnaes, who won a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in 2001, had no immediate comment on the cartoon being pulled, but posted a link on Twitter late Tuesday to an article titled ""Organ Grinders and Their Monkeys Once Entertained on DC Sidewalks"""
196,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/12/23/what-homeless-woman-taught-me-about-christmas.html?intcmp=hphz05,2,"I ended up in that particular Starbucks by accident, really. I’m glad I did, because a homeless woman taught me a valuable lesson about Christmas.

It was a few weeks ago and I had just finished catching up with one of my good friends over breakfast on the east side of New York City. We started walking to his office building, and as we did we strolled past the Starbucks. It seemed like the perfect place to park myself for the next two hours and work before I had to go to the airport.

My friend and I parted ways, and I dodged the trendy business suits holding their red cups and started looking for a seat. There was one open. Yes, I thought. Winning.

Then I saw why.

Across from the open seat was a homeless man, mouth gaped open and a pea-sized amount of foamy saliva pooling at the corner of his lips. At any minute, gravity was going to win. He had his once-white socks pulled up over the outside of his sweatpants, and a tattered, black jacket with the hood pulled over the top of his head. He repositioned himself, and I caught a glimpse of days-old scruff that was clinging to remnants of what was likely someone else’s discarded meal.

I lived in New York City for six years. This type of scene isn’t new or abnormal for me. It’s life in the city. So I grabbed the seat.

I worked as the man slept. Tap, tap, tap on my keyboard. He barely flinched. People came and went. Baristas called out wrong names. Two hours later, he and I were the longest-tenured inhabitants, besides the employees behind the counter.

That’s when I caught a glimpse of an L.L. Bean-type man, a canvas messenger bagged draped over his shoulder.

“Sir. Sir! SIR!” He tried to wake the homeless man up, but nothing happened. He never touched him, just leaned in close. After a few unsuccessful attempts, he walked off.

Five minutes later, it happened again, but this time it was a small woman dressed in a Starbucks uniform. She approached the homeless man from the front, gently placing her hand on his knee.

“Sir. Sir!” His head finally moved. “You can’t be here anymore. You need to leave.”

She walked toward the man who had tried to do the same thing earlier and they began talking about inventory and product placement as they toured the store. A regional manager of some sort, I assumed.

At this point you’re probably wondering why I keep talking about a homeless man when I teased a lesson from a homeless woman. Well, here’s where she comes in.

Behind the homeless man, a disheveled woman in a grimy flannel had sidled her way up to the counter and taken a sideways seat on a stool. A red cart loaded with her possessions stood as a sentry. As she sat there, she put one elbow on the counter and rested her head on her hand, staring up at an angle like a teenage girl daydreaming about her crush.

As the man began stirring, he reached in his pocket and pulled out a yellow iPhone. It must have been charged and operational, because he did something on it for about three minutes. I could see about five sets of eyes cast glances. That’s when it happened.

“Sir. Sir.” The homeless woman from the counter was trying to get the man’s attention. He reluctantly looked up. “Would you like a cup of coffee?”

What? I thought to myself. Did I just hear that right? Did she offer to get him a coffee?

“Would you like a cup of coffee?” She asked again, a little louder but in a genuine way.

This is where I’m supposed to tell you that he graciously accepted; that he said “Merry Christmas;” that I learned the true spirit of the season is about giving not getting.

Nope.

He gave a simple, and somewhat terse, “No.” She smiled, said “OK,” and returned to daydreaming. She had a smile on her face.

And that’s when I realized I was envious of her.

See, she wasn’t offering a gift in order to make herself feel good. Sometimes what’s lost in the message that Christmas is about giving and not getting is that we still project the entitlement mentality on the former. We expect a certain reaction, a certain set of warm fuzzies to tickle us all over when we give a present, and the person opening it to light up and showers up with thanks. The homeless women offered her gift, was rejected, and still smiled. She didn’t find her worth in giving. She found it in genuinely caring for the man, which meant she wasn’t crushed when he rejected it.

She’s the opposite of Mrs. Fidget, the motherly character in C.S. Lewis’ classic “The Four Loves.” Mrs. Fidget gave to her children and husband in a manner that they despised. She did too much. She smothered them. She needed to be needed. She gave not for them, but for her.

“The proper aim of giving is to put the recipient in the state where he no longer needs our gift,” Lewis writes. “The hour when we can say, ‘They need me no longer,’ should be our reward.”

So when you give this Christmas season, don’t give with an expectation that the person receiving has to act a certain way, or that they have to meet a certain threshold of thankfulness. Don’t give because you’re looking to get something out of it. Give out of joy. Give because it’s the right thing to do. Give to honor the ultimate gift that the season is named after.

That’s what the homeless woman taught me.

197,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/12/31/sixteen-ways-to-improve-your-life-in-2016.html,2,"Last year, as 2015 debuted, I published, “15 ways to improve your life.” The tradition continues this year, with the addition of number 16. I’ve also added bits and pieces to some of the 15 items from last year, just to keep you on your toes.

New Year’s resolutions often lose their power so quickly and completely that they have become cliché. But there are real, easily achieved ways to positively impact your life beginning January 1.

Here’s your cheat sheet of 16 for 2016. They aren’t in any particular order, so you can pick any one to start with.

If you complete just five, you’ll notice a demonstrable improvement in your existence. But if you get through half of them, you could remake your life.

1. Try to recall one dream you had as a kid — whether it was being a poet or a rock drummer or a multimillionaire stock trader — and take just a single step in that direction. So often, the ideas we had as children were good ones, and we abandoned them out of fear. The step in the direction of your childhood dream can be very modest — signing up for a symposium on poetry, scheduling a single drum lesson, buying a DVD on stock trading. Even just telling two people about your quiet dream can move it forward. Frozen dreams have a way of thawing out rapidly when you warm them just a tiny bit.

2. Think of your life story, going all the way back to infancy, as an autobiographical book that you can hold in your hands. Now, imagine which page or paragraph you are tempted to tear out and remove from the story. That page or paragraph might be the one that makes you feel profoundly sad or powerless or guilty or ashamed. Next, share it with someone who knows you well but has never heard about that event or phase in your life. Being willing to disclose the events in life we want to turn a blind eye to takes away the power those events have over us.

3. Give a meaningful gift to a friend of yours on a random day — not his birthday or her anniversary or Christmas. Giving gifts on those days is fine, but that isn’t the same as an unexpected, unscheduled gift. Those are the ones that feel riskier to give and have more power to bond you to others who receive them. And that’s because they’re real and independent expressions of friendship, affection, admiration or love.

4. Send handwritten notes to three people you admire most in the world, no matter how powerful or famous, tell them sincerely exactly why you admire them and ask to meet for 10 minutes. There’s a real chance one of them will take you up on the offer. And that one meeting could change you, because great energy is contagious and being in the company of it can stay with you.

5. Give some amount (no matter how small) to the charity you care most about. Giving is a miracle, because it helps others while also telling your unconscious mind that yours is a life of abundance, not scarcity. And that invites more treasures into your existence. I suggest using this link to donate (since I co-founded the company).

6. Stop telling yourself you love people just because you grew up with them. This is a big one, but a really important one. Did your parents and siblings earn your love by unconditionally loving you as a child? If so, great. But if you’ve been wishing that had been the case and have felt unwilling to let the dream of having had unconditionally loving parents or siblings slip away, then loosen your grip. If the people you grew up with weren’t focused on helping you stay true to yourself, then admit it to yourself. You might stop unconsciously recruiting people just like them into your life.

7. Schedule an initial psychotherapy session. Psychotherapy is the gold standard way to begin to get to know yourself more deeply. In a world of distractions and depersonalization, it remains the technique most reliably focused on restoring your connection to your true self. Hopefully, that first session will convince you of the power of psychotherapy to change your life, and you’ll schedule more. No one with the financial ability to be in psychotherapy should deny himself or herself that transformational opportunity.

8. Get angry about something unfair, say so out loud and don’t stand for it. Anger gets a really bad rap in our culture; it’s accused of everything from destroying people spiritually to causing heart attacks. But suppressed anger can be more toxic. When you’re offended by something you hear about in the news or you see unfolding in your personal life, try saying so, in no uncertain terms, when you’re asked about it — or maybe even if you aren’t. For those of you who have been living lives of quiet frustration, letting yourselves be very direct and very mad about something that sincerely outrages you can start to crack the shell that has your most powerful self inside it.

9. Take two minutes to think about life as a labyrinth. Mazes are built to frustrate people and get them lost. They’re full of dead ends designed to make people give up and call for helicopters to pluck them out. Not so with labyrinths. Labyrinths may wind this way and that way. They may take you far from where you thought you were heading. But they always, always lead to the center. And that’s what life is like. Keep walking, keep your faith and life will take you where you are supposed to go. The turn toward the center could be just a few steps away, when you least expect it.

10. Try praying, at least once. If you haven’t prayed ever or haven’t prayed lately, you’ll discover that the act of praying for what you care deeply about has the effect of reminding you what that thing or those things really are. It also has the effect of reminding you that there is a great power in the universe that you are a part of. There’s something interesting about praying; even people who say they don’t believe in God are loathe to pray for the opposite of what they really want. How come? Is it because that, underneath all that cynicism, they actually do believe?

11. Read ""Franny and Zooey"" by J.D. Salinger, ""The War of Art"" by Steven Pressfield, “Self Creation” by the great psychologist George Weinberg (used copies available online) or ""Blue Dog"" by George Rodrigue (or, even better, all four). These four volumes have the power to transform people, and I keep handing them out to patients and friends (along with — please forgive the narcissism — my book, ""Living the Truth""). If you’re really short on time or intention, just read the Afterword to a later edition of “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,” by Robert Pirsig.

12. Buy one piece of art. It doesn’t need to be expensive. It just needs to appeal to you. Why? Because art is the antidote to our sometimes sterile, technologically driven culture. It makes humanity go viral in a way that YouTube can’t. It also confirms your connection to things that can’t be measured — like your personal vision of beauty. A good alternative is to create a piece of art. Just be sure to buy yourself the proper brushes or paints or glue or wood to create it. That will be a signal to yourself that you value what you are manifesting.

13. Watch the movie ""Miracle,"" with Kurt Russell. This film about the 1980 U.S. Olympic men’s hockey team defeating Russia’s team is so good, it can convince you to take on the next great challenge in your life. I don’t know anyone who has watched it and been unaffected by it. Also watch the closing argument by Paul Newman at the end of the film ""The Verdict,"" the scene of Sylvester Stallone and Talia Shire on the beach in ""Rocky III"" and the monologue by Al Pacino toward the end of the film ""The Scent of a Woman."" They can help make you a better person. No kidding.

14. Tell your romantic partner one thing you would find exciting that you have not yet told that person. In my experience as a therapist, I’ve found that people can remain strangers to one another, in terms of passion, even after 10 or 20 years of marriage. We keep sexual secrets. Let one out. You can write it down and pass it to your partner as a note, like we did back in grade school, before cell phones. You can text it using a confidential messaging app like Wickr. See what happens. Take the risk.

15. Stand up for someone else. You’ll have the opportunity in 2016. I promise. Maybe in your home. Maybe in your neighborhood. Maybe at work. Maybe online. Defending someone will reassure that person and empower you.

16. Take 16 minutes to pretend that you are speaking to yourself, from the heart, as though you are your own ideal parent. You can do this out loud, if you have the stage presence, or silently. An ideal parent is empathetic, but honest in assessing his child and giving that child advice. Sit yourself down, get very quiet and, then, tell yourself—with the same care you would summon for a son or daughter—two things you really admire about yourself and one very limiting, very disappointing thing about yourself you really wish you would try to change, because it could limit the whole rest of your life. That one thing should be so searingly on-target and so necessary that it has the power to make you angry, make you anxious, bring you to tears or bring you to your knees. Focusing about twice as long (say, 10 minutes) on the admirable qualities is something you’d do for your kid, to take the sting out of the next 6 minutes, so do that for yourself. And keep in mind that 16 minutes is a long time. You’ll be tempted to avoid it or shorten it. But, you shouldn’t.

So, there are your 16 keys to making 2016 a transformational year. I give them to you with the certain knowledge that you still have, inside you, all the wonderful potential you did the very first day you were born. You haven’t lost one bit of it. It’s all there, just waiting for you to discover it.

Don’t delay. Start on the list January 1, and by this time next year, God willing, you’ll be ready for the 17 steps for 2017. Like is life that: a never-ending process of self-improvement."
198,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/14/fight-night-why-south-carolina-showdown-could-turn-bloody.html?intcmp=hpbt2,2,"The Fox Business debate here in Charleston isn’t billed as a boxing match, but by the time it ends Thursday evening, viewers may not be able to tell the difference.

There is no question that punches will be thrown; the only question is how much blood they draw.

Based on what they did in Milwaukee, I expect Neil Cavuto and Maria Bartiromo to ask civil and substantive questions. Both anchors told me after that encounter, and Cavuto just repeated to the Hollywood Reporter, that debates aren’t about them but about eliciting important information from the candidates.

But this time, that won’t matter.

No matter what questions the moderators ask, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie and Jeb Bush will find ways to pummel each other. And the reason is simple: Each needs to become the so-called establishment alternative to Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Each would be badly wounded by lousy back-to-back showings in Iowa and New Hampshire. Each has been ramping up the rhetoric and unleashing harsh attack ads.

No way they pass up the chance to do that before an audience that could match or exceed the 14 million people who watched the last FBN debate.

Cruz, who tangled with Rubio at that debate over immigration and surveillance, will be in the mix as well. Given that he’s gently started to raise questions about Trump—as a man with “New York values,” for instance—there might be a jab or two in the direction of the man who keeps harping on his Canadian birth. But it’s more likely that the Texas senator will spar mainly with his fellow Cuban-American and the others.

Trump, if the past is any guide, will hang back a bit and engage mostly in counterpunching. But with Iowa polls now showing him either slightly ahead of Cruz or running neck and neck, we may hear him utter the word Canada once or twice.

For the middle-tier candidates, there’s no point in holding back. Bush, Christie and Rubio have an enormous amount invested in a strong New Hampshire finish.

The last FBN debate was unusually polite because it followed the CNBC debacle, with most of the candidates outraged by some condescending and opinionated questions from the moderators. But the 2016 race is in a very different phase now.

These debates, with their huge audiences, have become winnowing events like never before. That’s why Rand Paul is loudly denouncing the decision to knock him off the main stage and refusing to attend the undercard.

Network criteria can deflate candidates by keeping them out of prime time. Mike Huckabee and Carly Fiorina, who had been in prime-time debates, are in the early-evening faceoff here in South Carolina. Christie bounced back from one undercard appearance to the main stage, while Rand Paul is boycotting the 6 p.m. debate. But time is running short.

These debates have a magnified impact because they dominate the media coverage for as much as a week, with key sound bites endlessly replayed and pundits pontificating about the winners and losers. That echo chamber has helped good debaters such as Rubio, Cruz and Christie, and badly hurt Bush after what were seen as lackluster performances.

That’s why the Charleston debate, along with the Fox News debate in Des Moines later this month, looms so large: Some of the contenders could emerge badly bruised--or worse."
199,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/01/06/outrage-skepticism-greet-north-koreas-claim-hydrogen-bomb-test.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"The world reacted with outrage and skepticism Wednesday after North Korea claimed that it had successfully tested a ""miniaturized"" hydrogen bomb.

The announcement, which could not immediately be confirmed by outside sources, was made by a state television anchor who read a typically propaganda-heavy statement calling the test a ""perfect success"" that elevated the country's ""nuclear might to the next level"" and provided it with a weapon to defend itself against the United States and other enemies.

The United Nations Security Council quickly announced an emergency meeting scheduled for Wednesday morning.

However, Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert based in Seoul, South Korea, told Fox News he was ""seriously skeptical"" that Pyongyang had tested a hydrogen bomb. According to Lankov, North Korea would have needed to divert a large amount of scarce funds to construct such a device, saying it would have been ""mission overkill.""

""I believe it did not have the 'signature' of a Hydrogen bomb,"" said Lankov, who added that he had ""absolutely no doubt"" the blast was an atomic test, the fourth carried out since 2006 in definance of international and United Nations sanctions.

The reports fueled bipartisan calls on Capitol Hill for tightened sanctions and more pressure on North Korea.

“North Korea’s nuclear detonation claims are a grave provocation and threat to international peace and security, and must be met with firm action and a clear effort to halt Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions,” Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said in a statement. “I urge my colleagues to swiftly pass my legislation to tighten sanctions since it’s obvious the sanctions we have in place are all-too-often ignored and North Korea continues to get away with bad behavior.”

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., said “the answer to North Korea’s threats is more pressure, not less.”

South Korean lawmaker Lee Cheol Woo told the Associated Press that the country's National Intelligence Service had expressed in a private briefing that they believed North Korea had tested an atomic bomb, not a hydrogen bomb.

According to Lee, intelligence officials said that an estimated explosive yield of six kilotons and a magnitude-4.8 earthquake were detected Wednesday, a smaller blast than the estimated explosive yield of 7.9 kilotons and magnitude-4.9 quake that were reported after a February 2013 nuclear test by North Korea, and only a fraction of a typical successful hydrogen bomb test's explosive yield of hundreds of kilotons.



Lee says the agency told him that even a failed hydrogen bomb detonation typically yields tens of kilotons.

The United Kingdom also reacted with outrage. ""If a nuclear device has been detonated by North Korea, this is a grave breach of UN Security Council resolutions and a provocation which I condemn without reservation,"" British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said in a statement. ""It underlines the very real threat that North Korea represents to regional and international security.""

It could take weeks before the true nature of the test is confirmed by outside experts — if they are able to do so at all. North Korea goes to great lengths to conceal its tests by conducting them underground and tightly sealing off tunnels or any other vents though which radioactive residue and blast-related noble gases could escape into the atmosphere.

The U.S. Air Force has aircraft designed to detect the evidence of a nuclear test, and such aircraft could be deployed from a U.S. base on the Japanese island of Okinawa to search for clues. Japanese media said Tokyo has also mobilized its own reconnaissance aircraft for sorties over the Sea of Japan to try to collect atmospheric data.



The doubts didn't stop jubilation and pride in Pyongyang, where crowds dressed in thick winter coats gathered outside a large video screen near a train station to cheer and take video and photos on their mobile phones as the statement was delivered.

In Washington, State Department spokesman John Kirby warned ""we condemn any violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions and again call on North Korea to abide by its international obligations and commitments"", later adding ""we have consistently made clear that we will not accept [North Korea] as a nuclear state.""

In Seoul and elsewhere there was high-level worry. South Korean President Park Geun-hye ordered her military to bolster its combined defense posture with U.S. forces and called the test a ""grave provocation"" and ""an act that threatens our lives and future."" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said, ""We absolutely cannot allow this.""

""This is indeed a wakeup call,"" Lassina Zerbo, the head of the Vienna-based U.N. Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, which has a worldwide network of monitoring stations to detect nuclear testing, told AP by phone. ""I am convinced it will have repercussions on North Korea and international peace and stability.""

Washington and nuclear experts have been skeptical about past North Korean claims about H-bombs, which are much more powerful and much more difficult to make, than atomic bombs. A confirmed test would further worsen already abysmal relations between Pyongyang and its neighbors and lead to a strong push for tougher sanctions on North Korea at the United Nations.

Whatever the type of the test, North Korea's fourth nuclear explosion will likely push Pyongyang's scientists and engineers closer to their goal of building a bomb small enough to place on a missile that can reach the U.S. mainland.

A successful H-bomb test would be a big new step for the North. Fusion is the main principle behind the hydrogen bomb, which can be hundreds of times more powerful than atomic bombs that use fission. In a hydrogen bomb, radiation from a nuclear fission explosion sets off a fusion reaction responsible for a powerful blast and radioactivity.

Some analysts say the North hasn't likely achieved the technology needed to manufacture a miniaturized warhead that could fit on a long-range missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. But there is a growing debate on just how far the North has advanced in its secretive nuclear and missile programs.

Last month, Kim Jong Un said his country was ""ready to detonate a self-reliant A-bomb and H-bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation"". The comments were met with skepticism by North Korea watchers, who said it was unlikely that Pyongyang possesed the technology to develop such a weapon.

But nuclear expert Jeffrey Lewis wrote on the North Korea-focused 38 North website, ""The North has now had a nuclear weapons program for more than 20 years. This program has yielded three nuclear tests. North Korean nuclear scientists have access to their counterparts in Pakistan, possibly Iran and maybe a few other places. We should not expect that they will test the same fission device over and over again.""

North Korea's previous nuclear test was in early 2013, and Kim Jong Un did not mention nuclear weapons in his annual New Year's speech. Some outside analysts speculated Kim was worried about deteriorating ties with China, the North's last major ally, which has shown greater frustration at provocations and a possible willingness to allow stronger U.N. sanctions.

Ammon Bundy, a son of Cliven Bundy, who was involved in a standoff of his own against the federal government in 2014, spoke on behalf of the protesters. He said they asked Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward and federal agencies to put an end to what he called ""abuses"" against local ranchers Dwight and Steven Hammond.

The Hammonds were convicted of arson three years ago for fires that burned on federal land in 2001 and 2006. Though they served their original sentences for the conviction -- Dwight serving three months, Steven serving one year -- an appellate judge ruled in October that the terms were too short under federal minimum sentencing laws.

The Hammonds were ordered back to prison for four years each. They arrived at the Terminal Island Federal Correctional Institution Monday afternoon.

""Dwight and Steven Hammond respect the rule of law. They have litigated this matter within the federal courts for over five years and, in every instance, have followed the order of the court without incident or violation,"" the Hammonds' attorneys said.

Ammon Bundy accused federal officials of launching an ""attack"" on the Hammonds for refusing to sell their land. The protesters took over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge south of Burns on Saturday after participating in a peaceful rally.

Sheriff Ward said the protesters were no patriots. ""These men came to Harney County claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States,"" Ward said in a statement. ""We are currently working jointly with several organizations to make sure the citizens of Harney County are safe and this issue is resolved as quickly and peaceful as possible.""

FBI officials tried to calm the anger by calling for a ""peaceful resolution"" to the standoff. Still, the bureau did not give any specifics about its response in a statement Sunday, citing ""safety considerations for both those inside the refuge as well as the law enforcement officers involved.""

Ammon Bundy's brother, Ryan, said they planned on staying at the refuge as long as it takes. If the situation turns violent, he contends it will be because of the federal government's actions. ""I mean, we're here to restore order, we're here to restore rights and that can go peacefully and easily.""

Dwight Hammond Jr., 73, and his 46-year-old son, Steven, have claimed that they lit the fires in 2001 and 2006 to reduce the growth of invasive plants and protect their property from wildfires. However, prosecutors said the fires were set to cover up poaching.

The decision generated controversy and is part of a decades-long dispute between some Westerners and the federal government over the use of public lands. The issue traces back to the 1970s and the ""Sagebrush Rebellion,"" a move by Western states like Nevada to increase local control over federal land. Critics of the push for more local control have said the federal government should administer the public lands for the widest possible uses, including environmental and recreation.

201,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/11/obama-agenda-status-report-did-meet-state-union-goals.html,2,"As President Obama prepares to deliver his final State of the Union address on Tuesday, voters might want to know: What ever happened to the president's proposals from last year?

A look back shows the president has made headway toward fulfilling roughly half of his major goals from the 2015 address.

But some big ones remain unfulfilled, including enacting free community college and securing formal approval from Congress to use force against the Islamic State. And elsewhere, the president resorted to executive action when legislative proposals tanked.

The inbox is expected to pile up even more as the president delivers an address Tuesday expected to focus on gun control, national security and other final-year plans.

""The kinds of decisions that he will make over the course of next year, and that the next president will have to make during their tenure in office, will have a substantial impact on whether or not we pass on a country to the next generation of Americans that is ... as secure, that is as prosperous, and is as a fair as the United States has ever been,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday, previewing the speech.

One analysis by McClatchy, the details of which were confirmed by Fox News, shows the president so far has partly or fully achieved 11 of 20 major goals he outlined in his 2015 address. This includes big wins on identity theft, net neutrality, global warming and Iran, even as he fell short in other areas.

THE MISSES

Obama, though, missed the mark entirely on a $3,000 tax credit he said would make quality child care more affordable. Though he included an expansion of the Dependent Care Tax Credit in his budget proposal, and Democrats introduced a separate bill to do roughly the same thing, neither measure passed.

Obama also fell through on convincing Congress to approve an increase in the federal minimum wage, though various states and cities have done so on their own.

As for what was pitched as a “bold new plan” for free community college, Republicans didn't bite -- calling it an expensive proposal that didn’t have enough of a payoff.

Obama unveiled his America’s College Promise plan shortly after his State of the Union address last year and included it in his initial 10-year budget proposal. It did not pass. Instead, GOP leadership pushed for more access to Pell grants – money the government gives college students that, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid.

And on the push for an authorization to use force against ISIS, congressional leaders remain divided on whether to even take that up.

THE HITS

Obama did, however, score a partial victory on trade authority. Congress approved the “fast-track” authority which gives the president the power to negotiate big trade deals without lawmakers changing the details.

Despite this win, the president faces a steep challenge in passing the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade pact among the United States and 11 other countries.

Obama scored his biggest foreign policy win after negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran; and getting help from Senate Democrats blocking a Republican resolution rejecting it. The key provisions of the deal could be implemented in a matter of weeks.

And late last year, Obama helped secure a new international agreement on climate change, a goal he laid out in his January 2015 address.

THE EXECUTIVE ACTIONS

Where Obama struggled to pass legislation, he turned to executive actions.

For instance, when Obama vowed to make paying back student loans easier, Democratic lawmakers introduced bills aimed at reducing debt for loan borrowers. A majority of Republican lawmakers rejected them. So Obama, through executive action, expanded the federal pay-as-you-earn program which allows borrowers to cap their payment at 10 percent of their income.

Obama’s push for seven days of paid sick leave also was met with congressional resistance. So Obama issued an executive order in September requiring federal contractors to grant at least seven days of paid sick leave to their employees beginning in 2017. While some states have paid-leave laws, the U.S. is the only industrialized nation without a federal family-leave law allowing workers paid time off to take care of themselves or family members.

Prior to Obama’s executive action, federal laws required companies give leave to workers but did not require the time off to be paid.

Obama has also, in the course of the last week, turned once again to executive actions to address gun control, an issue he hammered in several past State of the Union speeches.

CLICK HERE FOR FULL COVERAGE OF THE 2016 STATE OF THE UNION

Obama’s 2013 speech -- which took place two months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings that left 20 children and six adults dead -- focused heavily on that issue.

Since then, Obama has received strong pushback from Republican lawmakers on universal background checks as well as other gun-related measures. Last week -- in a move widely criticized by House Speaker Paul Ryan and several 2016 presidential candidates -- Obama used his executive authority to ensure background checks cover forums like gun shows and Internet sales.

Obama is likely to tout gun control changes again during Tuesday night’s address. Obama will leave a seat open next to the first lady during the address to symbolize victims of gun violence.

Yet more substantive congressional action on the subject still eludes the president. The same is true when it comes to immigration.

During his 2011 address, Obama said he was prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats “to protect our borders, enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows.” After legislation stalled in Congress, Obama in November 2014 used his executive powers to defer deportation for an estimated 5 million people living in the U.S. illegally.

Many GOP lawmakers criticized the move as another example of executive overreach while 26 states challenged the plan in court. The Supreme Court could consider the case later this year."
202,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/01/04/president-obama-wants-to-disarm-america.html,2,"President Obama is plotting with his attorney general to get our guns.

The president will purportedly bypass Congress and crack down on small scale gun sellers. Fox News reports the plan would require gun sellers to order background checks on prospective buyers and tighten laws for gun sales to those who have committed domestic-abuse offenses.

Click here to sign up for Todd’s American Dispatch – a must-read for conservatives!

If the White House really wants to crack down on gun violence -- maybe they should enforce the laws that are already on the books.

But that's not the point. This president ultimately wants to disarm the nation.

The primary reason our Founding Fathers wrote the Second Amendment was to protect all the other amendments.

Just after the Muslim terrorist attack in San Bernardino the Washington Post found that 53 percent of voters oppose a ban on assault weapons -- a record high.

The American people seem to understand what the president does not -- guns keep our families safe.

So instead of declaring war on law-abiding gun owners -- maybe the president ought to declare war on the true threat facing our nation -- radical Islam.

The National Rifle Association accused the president of pulling a “political stunt” and Republican presidential candidates have widely condemned the president’s gun-control plans.

“The president is a petulant child,” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told ""Fox News Sunday."" “Whenever he doesn’t get what he wants…this president acts like a king.”

Carly Fiorina told CNN the president has “been a lawless president.”

“It is delusional, dangerous, not to mention unconstitutional,” she said. “We have a long list of criminals who own guns, who routinely purchase guns. We know who these people are, and we are not prosecuting any of them.”

Texas Governor Greg Abbott summed up it up best in a tweet:

""Obama Wants to impose more gun control. My response? COME & TAKE IT."""
203,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/15/fact-check-christie-denies-rubio-claim-on-sotomayor-support-who-s-right.html?intcmp=hpbt3,2,"Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie launched his campaign under the motto, “telling it like it is.”

But a review of some of the New Jersey governor's statements Thursday night during the Fox Business debate – particularly his stinging rebuttal of Marco Rubio's attack – shows he still may be bending the truth with his straight talk.

The two candidates’ testy exchange erupted on the FBN debate stage when Rubio accused the New Jersey governor of holding liberal views, “whether it is Common Core, or gun control, or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.”

Christie fired back by simply denying it.

“Let’s get the facts straight. First of all, I didn’t support Sonia Sotomayor,” he said of the Supreme Court justice.

Speaking on Fox News on Friday, Christie said Rubio’s allegations were “absolutely untrue.”

But a closer look at Christie’s past seems to suggest otherwise.

According to Politifact, Christie did initially say in 2009 -- when he was running for New Jersey governor -- that Sotomayor wouldn't have been his choice.

But he later issued a statement voicing support that same year, according to PolitickerNJ.

“After watching and listening to Judge Sotomayor's performance at the confirmation hearings this week, I am confident that she is qualified for the position of Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Christie wrote. ""Elections have consequences. One of those consequences are judicial appointments. While Judge Sotomayor would not have been my choice, President Obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the Supreme Court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability, competence and ability. I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination.”

Politifact rated Christie's denial as false.

Christie, though, argued Friday that his 2009 statements did not count as support and that he was only calling on the Senate to give the nominee a straight up-or-down vote.

""‎What I said about Sonia Sotomayor was that she deserved an up-or-down vote, but that she was not the type of justice I would select if I were president,"" he told MSNBC. ""That's hardly supporting someone.""



Christie also pushed back Friday on Rubio's claims that he once made a donation to Planned Parenthood, telling Fox News he did not.

But in a 1994 Newark Star-Ledger story, Christie is quoted saying, “I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution, and that should be the goal of any such agency, to find private donations.”

Now his camp says he never made the donation. Planned Parenthood, a non-profit, does not disclose its private donors’ information.

True or not, Rubio’s allegations nevertheless gave Christie an opening to land a memorable zinger Thursday night, as the governor accused Rubio of doing the same thing he once accused Jeb Bush of -- attacking a rival just to boost his own poll numbers.

“I stood on the stage and watched Marco … rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, ‘someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office,’” he said. “It appears that the same someone has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.”"
204,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/13/obama-downplays-isis-threat-defends-economic-record-in-state-union.html?intcmp=hpbt2,2,"President Obama, with an eye on cementing his legacy and countering the narrative on the Republican campaign trail, used his final State of the Union address Tuesday night to defend his economic record – and, in stark language, downplay the threat from the Islamic State.

“Over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands,” the president said, arguing that ISIS fighters “do not threaten our national existence.”

The remarks on ISIS are sure to rile Republican critics who say the president’s strategy for confronting the group is inadequate – particularly just hours after ISIS was blamed for another deadly attack, this time in Istanbul.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, one of the leading candidates for the GOP presidential nomination, tweeted afterward that the address was “less a State of the Union and more a state of denial.”

The backdrop of the address undeniably was election-year politics, though Obama is not on the ballot. Throughout the speech, the president took several implicit jabs at the GOP candidates competing for his job, and in doing so sought to shore up his own legacy.

His message to them seemed to be: The sky is not falling.

On the economy and on national security, Obama called the criticism “political hot air.” More broadly, the president sounded a call for “better politics” and bipartisanship, and cast the rancor directed at his administration’s policies as the product of an overheated political system.

“Let me tell you something, the United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period,” Obama said, to those who say America is getting weaker.

And to those who say the economy is just limping along, Obama countered: “Anyone claiming that America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction.” He said America’s is the “most durable economy in the world” and one that has improved on his watch.

The defiant remarks were met with skepticism from Republicans in the audience. House Speaker Paul Ryan’s office said the “lofty platitudes” still did not explain how to defeat ISIS and get the economy back on track.

In the official GOP response, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley challenged the president’s message on terror, saying the country is facing threats like few others in recent memory and the president is unwilling or unable to deal with it. At the same time, she urged Americans to avoid following the “angriest voices.”

On that, Haley and Obama had a common message. In his address, Obama returned repeatedly to a warning that the country faces a choice in a time of “extraordinary change” – between facing the future with “confidence” or with “fear.”

He decried politicians who “insult Muslims” or target people “because of race or religion,” an implicit reference to some of the comments made on the Republican campaign trail including from Donald Trump. And he made a reference to remarks from Cruz, saying the answer to threats “needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians.”

Cruz responded on Twitter, “We need a president who will defeat radical Islamic terrorism.”

But Obama delivered pointed remarks on the nature of the terror threat. He said the priority remains protecting the American people from terrorism, but went on to play down the ISIS problem.

“Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages, they pose an enormous danger to civilians. They have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence,” Obama said. “That is the story ISIL wants to tell; that’s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit.”

He also dug in on what effectively is an administration policy of not referring to the terror threat as radical Islam. He urged against “echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world’s largest religions,” and said: “We just need to call them what they are – killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.”

In a statement after the speech, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., accused him of “pushing these growing threats to the next administration.”

The president from the start was by turns combative and casual, delivering an unconventional address that avoided a detailed to-do list. From the outset, he said he’d “go easy” on the laundry list of proposals – and focus more broadly “on our future.”

“For this final one, I’m going to try to make it a little shorter. I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa,” he joked.

He also began, and closed, his address with a call for bipartisan cooperation on key issues, saying Washington “might surprise the cynics.” On issues ranging from criminal justice reform to prescription drug abuse, Obama suggested both parties can find common ground.

The president delivered his seventh and final State of the Union address as he faces an invigorated opposition in both houses of Congress and the prospect of his policies becoming unraveled if a Republican wins the White House in November.

His administration, though, is still trying to deliver on promises made since his first inauguration – most notably, the vow to close the Guantanamo Bay prison camp.

He renewed that vow Tuesday, saying he will “keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo.”

“It is expensive, it is unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies,” he said, without saying whether he might resort to executive action to achieve his goal.

Despite vowing to avoid the to-do list, Obama did tick off several other final-year goals: including raising the minimum wage, doing more on gun control and pushing for free community college – a proposal left over from last year’s agenda. He also tapped Vice President Biden to lead “mission control” in a new national effort to research a cure for cancer.

Hanging over Tuesday’s address, aside from the terror attack in Istanbul, was yet another diplomatic dispute involving Iran -- as it emerged Iran was holding 10 U.S. Navy sailors after they apparently drifted into Iranian waters.

Obama did not address the dispute in the State of the Union, though Republicans pointed to the incident in renewing their concerns about the Iran nuclear deal."
205,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/15/gloves-off-for-top-tier-in-gop-race-after-debate.html,2,"While the full field of Republican presidential candidates resumed campaigning Friday, it was Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio who emerged from last night's Fox Business debate the apparent main challengers to front-runner Donald Trump -- though New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's feisty exchanges may have left some thinking what was once a 17-candidate scramble, now is a four-man showdown.

Or, maybe five, as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who managed to get in a few shots at Trump, picked up the endorsement Friday morning of former candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham.

Trump, though, quickly dismissed the backing, tweeting that Bush’s “chances of winning are zero,” the same as Graham’s polling.

The exchanges all marked a newly aggressive campaign heading into the final stretch before Iowa.

For Trump and Cruz in particular, the Fox Business Network debate in South Carolina marked the first where real tensions showed through. Before, the two top-polling candidates essentially refused to attack each other, preserving a détente that extended to the campaign trail.

No more.

Trump, after the debate, acknowledged in one TV interview that their “bromance” is over.

The debate could set the tone for the final two weeks before the leadoff Iowa caucuses, with the leading candidates now searching aggressively for weak spots in each other’s records.

On Friday, the candidates spread all over the early-voting state map.

Trump is following on his strong performance with an Iowa rally Friday morning. Cruz is charging through South Carolina, while Rubio is in New Hampshire.

Trump also has rented out space at an Iowa theater and is giving residents free tickets to a showing of “13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi” Friday evening, according to The Des Moines Register. The movie depicts the 2012 terror attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, a topic that has haunted Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid.

With the polls tightening in the middle in the Granite State – and at the top in Iowa – nearly a half-dozen candidates are now firing at each other on a regular basis.

Rubio sustained his attacks going into Friday, launching a new TV ad that calls accusations from Bush “desperate” – and reprising his criticism on Cruz’ consistency in an interview with Fox News.

“I like Ted, we’re friends, but he campaigns as a consistent conservative. … That is not his record; he has flipped his position on birthright citizenship, on legalization of illegal immigrants,” he told Fox News.

When Rubio launched that same attack at Cruz Thursday night, though, Cruz deftly countered.

“I appreciate you dumping your oppo research folder on the debate stage,” Cruz said, maintaining that he opposes “amnesty” while Rubio backs citizenship for illegal immigrants.

Through most of the debate, Cruz showed off his skills as practiced debater. He employed this early on to fend off a challenge from Trump over the Canada-born senator’s eligibility to seek the presidency. He accused Trump of pushing “birther theories” because the polls are tightening.

Then, in a retort reminiscent of Reagan’s famous “youth and inexperience” quip, Cruz tried to flip the script by noting some “birther theories” say a candidate must have two parents born on U.S. soil to be eligible.

Pointing out Trump’s mother was born in Scotland, Cruz said: “On the issue of citizenship, I’m not going to use your mother’s birth against you.”

Trump said, “But I was born here … big difference.”

But Trump, though, was seen as landing a decisive retort when Cruz criticized him for “New York values.” Recalling memories from after 9/11, Trump passionately described the “horrific” clean up and the “smell of death” in the city.

“It was with us for months, the smell,” Trump said. “And everybody in the world loved New York, loved New Yorkers -- and I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement.”

Not to be overshadowed, Rubio and Christie both broke through on several occasions.

While Rubio and Cruz tangled over their immigration records and voting consistency, Rubio also accused Christie of endorsing “many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.”

Christie responded by invoking a moment from a previous debate.

“I stood on the stage and watched Marco … rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, ‘someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office,’” he said. “It appears that the same someone has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.”

Often left on the sidelines of the rhetorical battles were Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

Carson has seen his numbers steadily slide in Iowa, though Kasich is still polling strong in New Hampshire."

“Hopeful this long ordeal for our four Americans held hostage in Iran finally appears to be over,” tweeted GOP presidential candidate and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. “Praise God! Surely bad parts of Obama's latest deal, but prayers of thanksgiving that Pastor Saeed is coming home.”

The four Americans were released in an apparent prisoner-swap purportedly for as many as a dozen Iranians being detained in the United States. A fifth American was also released, but he was not part of first exchange.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said through a spokeswoman that he was “glad” about the Americans being released but is awaiting details on the “ransom paid for their freedom.”

The first four Americans released were Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati, pastor Saeed Abedini and Nosratollah Khosravi, whose name had not been previously made public.

They are being flown to Switzerland aboard a Swiss aircraft. And upon their arrival, they will be taken to a U.S. military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, for medical treatment, U.S. officials said.

The fifth American is being identified as student Matthew Trevithnick, and is already on his way home, the officials said. They spoke about the prisoner exchange on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

Secretary of State John Kerry is set to announce Saturday that Iran has complied with all of the requirement on curtailing it efforts to build a nuclear weapon, in exchange for getting back $100 billion in frozen assets.

Republicans and others critics of the deal say the United States and the five other world powers let Tehran off too easy, in part by failing to demand stricter inspections of nuclear-related facilities.

President Obama and others in his administration have argued that reaching a perfect deal would be nearly impossible and that this deal is better than no deal with a rouge nation that poses a regional and global nuclear threat.

""I am very pleased that four American citizens, who were illegally imprisoned by Iran in flagrant violation of longstanding international human rights norms, have finally been released,” said GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson. ""However, … president Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran is fatally flawed and gravely jeopardizes the national security interests of the American people, our ally Israel and other peaceful nations in the Middle East and around the world.”

He also said releasing the roughly $100 billion to Iran and allow the country to “continue exporting terrorism around the world.”

207,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/01/21/uk-judge-says-putin-probably-approved-poisoning-ex-russian-spy.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"The deadly poisoning of a former Russian spy in London a decade ago was ""probably approved"" by Vladimir Putin, according to a judicial report released Thursday, a conclusion that confirmed long-held suspicions that the high-profile case bore all the hallmarks of a Kremlin hit.

The Kremlin fired back, saying the report could ""still further poison the atmosphere of our bilateral relations.""

Alexander Litvinenko, who had turned on his former KGB colleague Putin, died three weeks after drinking tea laced with polonium-210 at a London hotel in November 2006. The cause of death was acute radiation syndrome, and his rapid decline touched off a frantic effort to find out if anyone else in the British capital was exposed to the deadly toxin.

There is a ""strong possibility"" that Russia's FSB security service, the successor agency to the notorious KGB, directed the killing, Judge Robert Owen wrote in his 326-page report. And the rubout would not have occurred without the likely approval of not only then-FSB head Nikolai Patrushev, but also Putin himself, the report stated.

The report named Russian politicians Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun as the suspects who carried out the poisoning. Both returned to Russia.

Putin even rewarded Lugovoi last year with a medal for ""services to the motherland,"" recognizing ""courage and bravery displayed in the performance of his professional duty under conditions fraught with risk for his life."" An attorney for Litvinenko's widow called it ""the clearest possible message"" Putin sided with Lugovoi.

Moscow has long denied a role in the murder of Litvinenko, who ""had repeatedly targeted President Putin"" with ""highly personal"" public criticism and charges of corruption, the report noted. Litvinenko had fled to Great Britain in 2000 and was granted asylum after breaking with Putin and his inner circle.

From his hospital bed, Litvinenko, who was 44, pointed a dying finger at Putin, but the new report marks the first time the Russian president has been officially linked to the killing.

""There can be no doubt that Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned by Mr. Lugovoi and Mr. Kovtun."" — Judge Robert Owen's report

Litvinenko's widow, Marina, said outside the High Court Thursday that she was ""very pleased that the words my husband spoke on his deathbed when he accused Mr. Putin have been proved by an English court.""

She called for British Prime Minister David Cameron to take urgent steps against Russian agents operating inside Britain in light of the report.

""I'm calling immediately for expulsion from the UK of all Russian intelligence operatives ... based at the London embassy,"" she said. ""I'm also calling for the imposition of targeted economic sanctions and travel bans against named individuals including Mr. (former FSB chief Nikolai) Patrushev and Mr. Putin.""

She said Britain's Home Office had written to her Wednesday night promising action. Home Secretary Theresa May, who is in charge of justice issues, said the British government would freeze the assets of Lugovoi and Kovtun.

Lugovoi is a member of the Russian parliament, which means he is immune from prosecution. In an interview with the Interfax news agency, he called the charges against him ""absurd.""

""As we expected, there was no sensation,"" he said. ""The results of the investigation that were announced today once again confirm London's anti-Russian position and the blinkered view and unwillingness of the British to establish the true cause of Litvinenko's death.""

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zhakarova said Thursday that the government does not consider Owen's conclusions to be objective or impartial.

""We regret that a purely criminal case has been politicized and has darkened the general atmosphere of bilateral relations,"" Zhakarova said in a statement. She said Britain's decision to hold a public inquiry on the case was politically motivated and that the process was not transparent for the Russian side or the public.

The British government appointed Owen to head a public inquiry into the slaying, which soured relations between London and Moscow. He heard from dozens of witnesses during months of public hearings last year, and also saw secret British intelligence evidence.

Announcing his findings at London's Royal Courts of Justice, Owen said that ""there can be no doubt that Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned by Mr. Lugovoi and Mr. Kovtun"" in the Pine Bar of London's luxury Millennium Hotel on Nov. 1, 2006. He also charged that the pair had failed in an attempt to poison Litvinenko weeks earlier.

Just last year, Kremlin involvement was suspected in the murder of an outspoken Putin critic in Russia and the near-fatal poisoning of another.



Boris Nemtsov was gunned down last February as he strolled near the Kremlin with a woman, and a close friend of his, Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr., a Washington resident who was in a hotel in Moscow when he suddenly lost consciousness May 26, was hospitalized with what his wife called ""symptoms of poisoning.""

Kara-Murza, who recovered, is a coordinator for Open Russia, a nongovernmental organization and had on the previous day released a documentary film accusing close Putin crony and Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov of human rights abuses including torture and murder.

208,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/01/25/grand-jury-indicts-leader-behind-planned-parenthood-videos.html?intcmp=hplnws,2,"A Houston grand jury investigating criminal allegations against Planned Parenthood stemming from a series of undercover videos on Monday instead indicted two of the anti-abortion activists who shot the footage.

In a stunning turn of events, the grand jury declined to indict officials from the abortion provider, and instead handed up a felony charges of tampering with a government record against Center for Medical Progress founder David Daleiden and center employee Sandra Merritt. Daleidon was also charged with a misdemeanor count related to purchasing human organs.

""We were called upon to investigate allegations of criminal conduct by Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast,"" Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said. ""As I stated at the outset of this investigation, we must go where the evidence leads us. All the evidence uncovered in the course of this investigation was presented to the grand jury. I respect their decision on this difficult case.""

The case sprang from a series of dramatic undercover videos in which Center for Medical Progress employees posed as prospective buyers of fetal tissue, and captured several employees of Planned Parenthood and its contractors appearing to discuss practices banned by law. However, when the videos were released online last year, Planned Parenthood claimed selective editing had created a misperception.

Anderson didn't provide details on the charges, including what record or records were allegedly tampered with and why Daleiden faces a charge related to buying human organs. Anderson's office said it could not provide details until the documents charging Daleiden and Merritt were formally made public.

""The Center for Medical Progress uses the same undercover techniques that investigative journalists have used for decades in exercising our First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and of the press, and follows all applicable laws,"" Daleiden said in a statement in response to the indictment.

""We respect the processes of the Harris County District Attorney, and note that buying fetal tissue requires a seller as well. Planned Parenthood still cannot deny the admissions from their leadership about fetal organ sales captured on video for all the world to see,"" the statement continued.

Planned Parenthood officials swiftly hailed the indictment as vindication.

""These anti-abortion extremists spent three years creating a fake company, creating fake identities, lying, and breaking the law. When they couldn't find any improper or illegal activity, they made it up,"" Eric Ferrero, vice president of communications for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement.

“As the dust settles and the truth comes out, it's become totally clear that the only people who engaged in wrongdoing are the criminals behind this fraud, and we're glad they're being held accountable,” Ferrero said.

The videos, some of which were shot in Texas, riled anti-abortion activists and prompted Republicans in Congress last summer to unsuccessfully called for cutting off funding for the organization.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has called footage from the Planned Parenthood clinic in Houston ""repulsive and unconscionable."" It showed people pretending to be from a company that procures fetal tissue for research touring the facility. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also opened his own investigation into the videos.

Abbott said the indictments will not impact the state's investigation

“The State of Texas will continue to protect life, and I will continue to support legislation prohibiting the sale or transfer of fetal tissue,” he said in a statement.

Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., author of the House-passed ""Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015,"" said the she was “profoundly disappointed” in the indictments.

“It is a sad day in America when those who harvest the body parts of aborted babies escape consequences for their actions, while the courageous truth-tellers who expose their misdeeds are handed down a politically motivated indictment instead,” she said.

Planned Parenthood says it abides by a law that allows providers to be reimbursed for the costs of processing tissue donated by women who have had abortions.

The Texas video was the fifth released by the group. Before its release, Melaney Linton, president of the Houston Planned Parenthood clinic, told state lawmakers last summer that it was likely to feature actors — pretending to be from a company called BioMax — asking leading questions about how to select potential donors for a supposed study of sickle cell anemia.

Linton said the footage could feature several interactions initiated by BioMax about how and whether a doctor could adjust an abortion if the patient has offered to donate tissue for medical research. She also said Planned Parenthood believed the video would be manipulated.

Earlier this month, Planned Parenthood sued the center in a California federal court, alleging extensive criminal misconduct. The lawsuit says the center's videos were the result of numerous illegalities, including making recordings without consent, registering false identities with state agencies and violating non-disclosure agreements.

After the lawsuit was filed, Daleiden told The Associated Press that he looked forward to confronting Planned Parenthood in court.

209,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/31/turnout-is-name-game-in-iowa-caucuses.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"The 2016 presidential contenders are begging their Iowa supporters to get to the caucuses Monday and Donald Trump, true to form, is in-your-face about it.

""You're from Iowa,"" Trump told a Dubuque crowd Saturday. ""Are you afraid of snow?""

A snowfall forecast to start Monday night appeared more likely to hinder the hopefuls in their rush out of Iowa than the voters who will be flocking to the caucuses in the first contest of the presidential campaign.

Still, there was every reason for candidates to be urgent about turnout in tight races on both sides.

Democrat Bernie Sanders called it a tossup with Hillary Clinton and said every caucus-goer counts.

Republican Ted Cruz directed much of his final advertising against Marco Rubio as the senators' feud grows even more bitter in the final days.

Texan Cruz, considered Trump's chief rival in Iowa, took to the airwaves to challenge the conservative credentials of Rubio, the Floridian who's running third in Iowa, according to the polls.

One ad said of Rubio: ""Tax hikes. Amnesty. The Republican Obama.""

""The desperation kicks in,"" Rubio said in response. ""From my experience, when people start attacking you it's because you're doing something right.""

Iowa offers only a small contingent of the delegates who will determine the nominees, but the game of expectations counts for far more than the electoral math in the state. Campaigns worked aggressively to set those expectations in their favor (meaning, lower them) for Iowa, next-up New Hampshire and beyond.

Rubio strategist Todd Harris said the Iowa goal is to end up behind the flamboyant Trump and the highly organized Cruz.

""There's no question we are feeling some wind at our back,"" Harris told The Associated Press. But, he added, ""It's very hard to compete with the greatest show on earth and the greatest ground game in Iowa history.""

In the last major preference poll before the caucuses, Trump had the support of 28 percent of likely Republican caucus-goers, with Cruz at 23 percent and Rubio at 15 percent. The Iowa Poll, published by The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg, also found Clinton with 45 percent support to Sanders' 42 percent in the Democratic race. The poll was taken Tuesday to Friday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

""I don't have to win it,"" Trump told CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" before adding that he believes he has ""a good chance"" of victory.

He said he was confident of taking the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9, and many others down the road. ""One of the reasons that I'll win and, I think, none of the other guys will win is because I'm going to get states that they'll never get."" Trump cited Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Florida, along with strong hopes for New York and Virginia.

Cruz's campaign was challenged by Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate over a mailer sent to potential voters that seemed designed to look like an official notice warning recipients about ""low expected voter turnout in your area."" The mailer refers to a ""voting violation"" and grades the recipient's voting history and that of several neighbors, citing public records.

Pate said Cruz's campaign ""misrepresents Iowa election law."" There's ""no such thing as an election violation related to frequency of voting,"" he said, and insinuating otherwise is ""not in keeping in the spirit of the Iowa caucuses.""

Cruz brushed off the fuss. ""I will apologize to nobody for using every tool we can to encourage Iowa voters to come out and vote,"" he said."
210,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/01/29/trump-free-debate-night-good-thing-for-candidates-country.html,2,"Well, that was different.

Thursday night’s Fox News debate – the last before Iowans go to caucus on Monday – was perhaps the most policy oriented that we’ve seen thus far. This was due, in large part, to the missing elephant in the room: Donald Trump.

It follows that the evening was the chance for all the other candidates to make their voices heard without Trump dominating, as he has in the past six debates. And while I wouldn't argue that there was a runaway winner this evening, it’s clear that the group benefitted from a Trump free night as he chose to skip the debate in favor of hosting a Wounded Warrior Project fundraiser.

Indeed, Trump could go down a bit because of his absence, but it doesn’t seem that Cruz did enough to displace him as the frontrunner.

As Trump’s main rival and closest competitor, Cruz didn’t have the night that he could’ve – and should’ve – in Trump’s absence. He began with great lines like “Iowa will not by flyover country, it will be fly to country” and that there’s a “difference between personal attacks and focusing on issues and substance,” drawing a clear line in the sand with Trump’s style. But besides a great answer to his position on ethanol subsidies, Cruz didn’t dominate the way he needed to. He may go up in the polls a little bit, but not the knockout he was looking for.

This left room for the rest of the group. Thursday night we heard from the “establishment” and the libertarian without any serious interruption. And they did well for themselves.

Jeb Bush was more energized than we’ve seen him before. He made a compelling case for his foreign policy vision and gave the proper level of defense for his brother’s decisions. The point that Bush made that got the most applause, and deservedly so, was about his consistent support for policies that produce consensus. This is something that governors need to be able to do and also a point that Christie and Kasich emphasized. It may well sway voters to the “executives” on stage.

Rubio performed well, as he always does. I don’t think it was his strongest debate and neither he nor Cruz looked good in their fight over immigration. It’s clear that both have flip flopped on the issue and if voters care about that – which it’s not entirely clear that they do – then this could hurt him.

That said, he had great lines about Hillary Clinton’s unfitness to be president as well as Bernie Sanders’s.

Rubio’s vision is fresh and hopeful and he knows the importance of talking often and decisively about the need to fight terrorism on every front and protect American lives. This no doubt resonates. It follows that he remains, in my view, the most electable candidate on the GOP side – something I have been arguing for months.

And there were two other candidates who stand to benefit from Thursday night’s debate. Rand Paul and Chris Christie were both on point the entire evening.

Christie touted his executive experience and ability to get things done with Democrats – something a president has to do. And Paul, who had many supporters in the audience, was finally able to showcase what a libertarian means without Trump’s attacks: someone who doesn’t want to police the world, someone wants to make federal issues states rights issues and someone who cares deeply about protecting our privacy.

For his part, John Kasich did well and clearly geared his answers toward New Hampshire voters where he has been gaining in the polls. He also rightly touted his ability to work with Democrats and make sure that we take care of those that “live in the shadows” and the mentally ill and drug addicted. The audience liked his ideas in these areas and he’s looking more and more like a legitimate candidate and as the governor of a crucial state like Ohio, he could be a very good vice presidential choice.

Dr. Ben Carson was, once again, a non-factor. Even as the only “outsider” on the stage he fell completely flat. There’s not much more to say.

So we survived our first Trump free debate – and in style. It wasn’t as loud, but it’s a good thing that we could hear everybody."
211,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/01/democrats-republicans-in-tight-races-as-iowans-prepare-to-caucus.html,2,"As Iowans prepare to cast the first votes in the presidential nominating process Monday, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hoped to defy the polls and pull off upset victories in Monday night's caucuses.

After months of campaigning and more than $150 million spent on advertising, the race for supremacy in Iowa is close in both parties.

Among Republicans, the latest polls show real estate billionaire Donald Trump holding a slim edge over Cruz. Cruz, who became the first major candidate from either party to enter the presidential race 315 days ago, has pinned his hopes to a sophisticated get-out-the-vote operation. Cruz has also modeled his campaign after past Iowa winners, visiting all of the state's 99 counties and courting influential evangelical and conservative leaders.

""If you had told me 10 months ago that the day before the Iowa caucuses we'd be in a statistcal tie for first place I would have been thrilled and exhilarated,"" Cruz told Fox News late Sunday.

The Republican caucus is also the first test of whether Trump can turn the legion of fans drawn to his plainspoken populism into voters. The scope of the billionaire's organization in Iowa is a mystery, though Trump himself has intensified his campaign schedule during the final sprint, including a pair of rallies Monday.



""I don't have to win it,"" Trump said on CBS' “Face the Nation"" Sunday. ""I'm doing really well with the evangelicals in Iowa. But I'm also doing tremendously well all over the country with the evangelicals. … I think we have a good chance of winning Iowa.""

By contrast, Cruz told Fox News, ""We're not finding Trump's troops on the ground. ‎They don't have an organization that is perceptible.""

Cruz has also spent the closing days of the Iowa campaign focused on Marco Rubio, trying to ensure the Florida senator doesn't inch into second place. Rubio is viewed by many Republicans as a more mainstream alternative to Trump and Cruz, though he'll need to stay competitive in Iowa in order to maintain his viability.



On the Democratic side, Sanders has rallied to close a 40-point polling deficit against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, reviving memories of her disappointing showing in Iowa eight years ago.

""Stick with me,"" Clinton said as she rallied supporters Sunday in Council Bluffs. ""Stick with a plan. Stick with experience.""

Sanders, whose crowds have been large and generally younger than Clinton's, urged voters to help him ""make history"". In a show of financial strength, Sanders' campaign announced Sunday it had raised $20 million in January alone. While Sanders has a large team in Iowa, his operation got off to a later start, particularly compared with Clinton, who has had staff on the ground in the state for nearly a year.

""I think we have a shot to win it, if people come out,"" Sanders told ABC's ""This Week."" The self-described democratic socialist's message that the U.S. economy is “rigged” against the middle class has appeared to resonate with an electorate that has grown frustrated with Washington and given rise to insurgent candidates like Sanders and Trump.



The campaigns were anxiously keeping an eye on the weather, but a snowfall forecast to start Monday night appeared more likely to hinder the hopefuls in their rush out of Iowa than any potential voters. Republican John Kasich already had decamped to New Hampshire Sunday, with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush scheduled to follow Monday afternoon, hours before the caucuses start.

The trio of governors has had a light footprint in Iowa, banking instead on strong showings in New Hampshire's Feb. 9 primary to jumpstart their White House bids. Yet some Republican leaders worry that if Trump or Cruz pull off a big victory in Iowa, it would be difficult to slow their momentum.



Unlike in primaries, where voters can cast their ballots throughout the day, the caucuses begin across Iowa at 7 p.m. CST.

Democrats will gather at 1,100 locations and Republicans at nearly 900 spots.



Turnout was expected to be high. The Iowa Republican Party expected GOP turnout to top the previous record of 120,000 people in 2012. Democrats also expect a strong turnout, though not nearly as large as the record-setting 240,000 people who caucused in the 2008 contest between Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards.



Iowa has decidedly mixed results in picking the parties' eventual nominees. The past two Republican caucus winners -- former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum -- faded as the race stretched on. But Obama's unexpected 2008 victory was instrumental in his path to the nomination, easing the anxieties of those who worried the young black senator would struggle to win white voters.



While both parties caucus on the same night, they do so with different rules.



Republicans vote by private ballot. The state's 30 Republican delegates are awarded proportionally based on the statewide vote.



Democrats take a more interactive approach, with voters forming groups and publicly declaring their support for a candidate. If the number of people in any group is fewer than 15 percent of the total, they can either choose not to participate or can join another viable candidate's group.



Those numbers are awarded proportionately, based on statewide and congressional district voting, as Iowa Democrats determine their 44 delegates to the national convention.

212,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/01/29/fox-news-republican-debate-trumps-absence-leaves-three-winners-and-two-losers.html,2,"The intentional winner of the Fox News Republican debate Thursday night was Marco Rubio. He had a really good debate. He was substantive and sharp, clear and polished. He came across as likable. He came across as someone who knows foreign policy.

The accidental winner, though, was Ted Cruz. The debate got off to a rough start with Cruz. The other candidates were piling on the man in the center seat. His campaign had expected it. His engagement with the moderators made him seem less likable. But the moderators, unintentionally and accidentally, solidified Cruz’s support for him and got fence sitters between Trump and Cruz off the fence.

“What about ObamaCare?” the moderators asked Cruz. He wanted it repealed and replaced.

“Why does Washington hate you?” they asked Cruz. That question let Cruz give a dissertation on his efforts to clean up and shrink Washington.

Then there was the issue of the ethanol lobby that gave Cruz a minute of clear answers on level playing fields and ending government subsidies.

Cruz could not have asked for a better set up of questions at a time when his favorables are vastly higher than other Republicans in Washington.

Without Donald Trump, the tone of the debate was lower energy, but filled with much more optimism.

The “Megyn Kelly Accountability Project” was a welcome addition to the debate and forced the candidates to own their records or flip-flops.

Jeb Bush had a far better night without Trump there. I was surprised there was not a clash with Kasich, given his rise in Iowa. But Bush held his own and Kasich annoyed as always.

The ultimate winner, however, was Megyn Kelly. After days of being beaten up by the Trump forces, she showed she is a sharp, credible journalist who is willing to ask tough questions and hold the candidates accountable for their prior statements.

The video montages and prior records of the candidates were fair game and she forced them to answer.

Overall, though the debate had lower energy than prior ones, it was wonderful to have the candidates have to own their records.

As for losers, that had to be Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, who had their “kneel before Zod” moment showing up at a Donald Trump rally where everyone treated Donald Trump as the conquering hero.

It was like conquered kings being traipsed before Rome. Their campaigns are over."
213,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/27/trump-stands-by-debate-boycott-decision-announces-veterans-event.html,2,"Donald Trump stuck by his decision to skip the upcoming Fox News/Google presidential primary debate, claiming in an interview Wednesday night with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly that he had been “used” and mistreated.

“I don’t like being taken advantage of,” the billionaire businessman and Republican primary front-runner said, repeatedly telling O'Reilly that he'll instead hold a veterans event at Drake University while his GOP rivals debate.

Trump has taken heat from conservative commentators as well as his Republican primary rivals for his decision to boycott the Thursday night debate. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz earlier said that if Trump is “afraid” to face questions, “that does not bode well for what kind of commander-in-chief you'd make.” Cruz also challenged Trump to a one-on-one debate, a suggestion Trump later brushed aside with a sarcastic tweet referencing Cruz's Canadian birth.

Trump rejected his rivals' criticism, insisting he’s won every debate to date and is willing to do more going forward.

“I’ll do other debates,” he told O'Reilly, but then complained that, “We’re going to go on forever with these debates.”

Despite O'Reilly's attempt to convince Trump to reconsider his debate boycott, Trump held fast to his decision while insisting, “I’m not walking away.”

The Republican candidate, meanwhile, announced the details of an alternative event he plans to host Thursday night, to raise money for veterans groups. He said he’ll host the event, being described as a “special event to benefit veterans organizations,” at Drake University in Des Moines.

Late Wedneday night, super PAC “Keep the Promise” — which supports Ted Cruz — offered to contribute $1.5 million to veterans’ charities if Trump accepts Cruz’s one-on-one debate challenge. There was no immediate response from the Trump campaign.

Trump’s comments are the latest in a fast-paced volley of accusations surrounding the upcoming debate.

For days, Trump has revived his criticism of one of the moderators, Fox News host Megyn Kelly, alleging that she had treated him unfairly at the Fox News debate in August.

That led to an exchange of media statements between Trump and Fox News representatives, after which Trump decided Tuesday night to boycott. Trump pointed to those media statements, as well, in explaining his decision not to attend Thursday’s debate.

He has continued to criticize both Kelly and Fox News itself in the wake of his decision.

Early Wednesday morning, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that the boycott had “nothing to do with Megyn Kelly.” But a half-hour later, Trump again went after Kelly on Twitter, calling her a “lightweight reporter.” And, he continued his attacks during his appearance on ""O'Reilly.""

Whether Trump’s decision helps or hurts his campaign in Iowa and beyond remains to be seen.

Other candidates suggested Trump’s absence might help give the rest of those on stage a better chance to be heard.

“It’ll give us more time to talk,” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told Fox News. “And that’ll be good for me and good for the other people on the stage.”

Christie, too, ripped Trump for his decision, saying: “You gotta show up.”

Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes has defended Megyn Kelly amid the criticism from Trump, saying she’ll “absolutely be on the debate stage.”

Fox News also issued a statement after Trump’s decision saying Lewandowski had threatened to ramp up the attacks.

“In a call on Saturday with a FOX News executive, Lewandowski stated that Megyn had a ‘rough couple of days after that last debate’ and he ‘would hate to have her go through that again,’” the Fox News statement said late Tuesday.

“Lewandowski was warned not to level any more threats, but he continued to do so. We can’t give in to terrorizations toward any of our employees,” the statement added.

The Fox News/Google prime-time debate is set for Thursday in Des Moines, Iowa, at 9 p.m. ET – the same time as Trump’s veterans event.

Addressing the matter on “The Kelly File” Tuesday night, Kelly said: “I’ll be there. … The debate will go on with or without Mr. Trump.”"
214,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/01/25/authorities-struggling-to-piece-together-daring-jail-escape.html,2,"An intensive manhunt was underway Monday for three inmates who pulled a “Shawshank”-style escape through a hole in their California jail cell -- and, who may have ties to notorious Vietnamese street gangs and Iran.



Investigators on Monday said Jonathan Tieu, 20, Bac Duong, 43, and Hossein Nayeri, 37, escaped from the Orange County Men’s Central Jail on Friday morning and may be armed. The three were awaiting trial for violent crimes at the time but their cases were unconnected.

The elaborate and daring escape – which included cutting through a metal vent, crawling through plumbing tunnels, climbing a roof and rappelling four stories to freedom – had some parallels to the popular film “The Shawshank Redemption.” In the movie, based on a Stephen King novel, a prisoner breaches his cell wall and climbs through a plumbing tunnel to freedom.

That fictional character is never found. Authorities hope the outcome is different for Tieu, Duong and Nayeri.

Both Tieu and Duong are suspected of being tied to gangs, though investigators wouldn’t name the groups during a Monday press conference. Tieu was charged with murder and attempted murder and Duong was charged with attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon.

During Monday’s press conference, a Vietnamese-speaking deputy from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office spoke to the local community to appeal for more information.

“We feel that they may be embedded somewhere in the community, and that’s why we’re reaching out to the community and letting them know we understand you’re fearful,” Lt. Dave Sawyer said.

He added: “We can only presume that these individuals wanted to get out of jail really bad, and they’ve more than likely armed themselves and are a danger to the community and any law enforcement officers that may come in contact with them.""



Investigators say they worry Nayeri may try to leave the country, possibly to go to his native Iran.

Nayeri is charged with kidnapping, torture, aggravated mayhem and burglary. He’s accused with three others of kidnapping a California marijuana dispensary owner in 2012.

After the crime, Nayeri fled the U.S. to Iran, where he remained for several months. He was arrested in Prague in November 2014 while changing flights from Iran to Spain to visit family.

A man identifying himself as Nayeri’s cousin stepped in front of the cameras before the press conference in an attempt to distance himself from Nayeri’s alleged crimes. The man, who never gave his name, said that Nayeri did not “represent the Persian community.” He also pleaded for Nayeri to turn himself in.

The nation’s two major political parties entrust Iowa with beginning the elimination process – that one Midwestern state representing just 1 percent of the nation’s population, with an electorate not reflective of America writ large (Iowa’s population is whiter, more Protestant and decidedly less black and Hispanic than the rest of the country).

Moreover, it’s not much of a political bellwether. Jimmy Carter won the Democratic caucuses in 1976, as did Barack Obama in 2008. In modern times, George W. Bush is the lone Republican to parlay a caucus win into the presidency.

Yet here we are in 2016, once again giving this under-populated state an oversized role in the nation’s future.

Some observations about what transpired in Iowa, on the Republican side, on Monday night:

Mister Trump, Meet Mister Tyson. The former boxer is credited with saying that “everyone has a plan ‘til they get punched in the mouth.”

On Monday night, Trump was on the receiving end of said punch.

Yes, the turnout turned out to be a record high, as Trump had promised. But not all the newcomers flocked in his direction, as he also prophesized.

According to Fox News entrance polls, the late-deciders broke first to Marco Rubio, then Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and then Trump – one reason why Rubio finished a close third (much closer than expected) to the flamboyant developer.

One way to look at Trump’s bad night: going into the caucuses, Trump stood at 28.6 percent in the Real Clear Politics Average. He finished with only 24 percent on Caucus night.

Cruz Was Everything – But Likeable. Cruz organized Iowa like few Republicans ever have – 12,000 volunteers, 1,000 precincts, a pair of old college dorms rented and renamed “Camp Cruz” to house that army. Unlike Trump’s calculation that star power was an irresistible force, it was sweat equity that paid off: Cruz bumped his RCP average by about 4 points.

Credit Cruz with standing his ground: he didn’t back down on opposing the ethanol subsidy. He didn’t deviate from his game plan of courting evangelicals.

However, the game plan wasn’t glitch-free: three out of five GOP caucus-goers identified as evangelicals in this year’s Republican caucuses – a higher percentage than in 2012. Yet, per the Fox News entrance polls, this portion of the vote didn’t break as heavily for Cruz as anticipated.

This suggests a core problem for Cruz moving forward: he’s bright, organized and a methodical strategist. But he’s just not likeable beyond that base of religious and constitutional voters. He’ll be hard-pressed to finish second in New Hampshire, where the electorate is less devoutly Protestant and less conservative – and Trump may be particularly vengeful.

The Rubio Expectations Game. One other way the Iowa night seem alien to alien visitors: the ability for a non-winner to claim victory. And In 2016, that’s Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whose surprisingly strong third-place finish confirms him as the biggest fish in the so-called “establishment lane.”

Rubio was a non-factor in Iowa as recently as a few weeks ago. But then he worked the state in person, invested heavily late in television on the eve of the vote, and profited handsomely from the one-fifth of the GOP voters for whom electability was the prime concern.

Armchair quarterbacks will debate how much Rubio benefitted from Trump’s debate snub (didn’t work for Reagan in 1980, maybe also backfired on The Donald in 2016) plus Cruz’s controversial mailer.

Rubio won the expectations game. Let’s see if that translates into votes in New Hampshire and, more immediately, an influx of cash as donors contrast his over-performance to the anemic showing of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (at 2 percent, just a percentage point behind Jeb Bush).

Left Behind. Dr. Ben Carson finished fourth – a better showing than he might have anticipated a month ago when his campaign cratered.

Carson’s free-fall led to Cruz’s December surge; Carson’s slight recovery on Monday night – his core being evangelicals – likely kept Cruz from a bigger win.

To the adage that elections reflect change and turnover: Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum won the last two GOP caucuses. On Monday night, neither cracked 3 percent. Huckabee quickly put his campaign on hiatus; Santorum likely won’t be far behind.

Change Gives Us . . . Continuity. For all the talk these past few months of how Iowa would be an opening salvo in a Trump-fueled revolution, reality proved otherwise.

Yes, a historically large GOP electorate struck a blow against Washington experience: Cruz, Trump and Rubio combined have all of ten years in federal government between them; they cornered three-fourth of Iowa’s vote.

However, the Iowa results were also a vote for more of the same.

Since 1988, the GOP caucuses have followed a familiar pattern – Iowans siding with a Republican who embodied the concept of “one of us.” Bob Dole, a son of Kansas, was a fellow Midwesterner. He was Iowa’s winner in 1988 and 1996. George W. Bush, Huckabee and Santorum all ran campaigns in which their personal faith and public policy ideas were DNA strands.

Given the choice of voting for Cruz, who worked the evangelic crowd in no uncertain terms (“Father God, Please . . . Awaken the Body of Christ”), Iowans went with the purer social conservative – not the wealthy guy from New York running as a born-again conservative, trying to win over the Midwestern crowd with his celebrity persona and flashy plane.

In the end, Cruz simply out-organized and out-thought Trump. Which is why Trump Fever is over – at least, until next week’s vote."

THE EDGE: IOWA LOSS TURNS DOWN TRUMP’S VOLUME IN N.H.

We know that Iowa caucus results can change the discussion in New Hampshire and here’s the proof. Prior to Monday night, Donald Trump dominated media mentions within the state of New Hampshire the same way he dominated polls. But, according to research by The New Analytics Company, Trump’s lead in mentions has been cut in half.



Second-place Marco Rubio slipped a fraction of a point but Trump’s share of media time was robbed by a host of other candidates, especially those who are placing long-shot bets on the Granite State. Trump’s slippage brings him nearly into parity with Rubio in the New Hampshire media.



Iowa winner Ted Cruz got a boost and now the overall discussion in the first-in-the-nation primary state reflects what polls have been showing: a three-man race with no one else even close.



The team at New Analytics has built The Edge, a unique tool to measure which candidates are being talked about the most, and provided the first look to Fox News First.



Here are the rankings for the candidate’s shares of media mentions in New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses. Points gained or lost from before Iowa are listed in brackets. See the full results here.



Donald Trump, 31.67 [-7.35]; Marco Rubio, 26.09 [-.45]; Ted Cruz, 21.58 [+1.48]; Jeb Bush, 7.28 [+3.77]; Chris Christie, 5.61 [+5.22]; John Kasich, 5.27 [-4.88]; Ben Carson, 13.97 [+2.21]



Q Poll shows three-man race - Fox News: “A new national poll shows Republicans continue to back Donald Trump for a White House bid but believe Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has the best shot of beating a Democratic candidate in the general election. Trump leads the GOP pack with 31 percent, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz with 22 percent and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with 19 percent, according to the Quinnipiac University National poll released Friday…The poll found that the strongest candidates to go head-to-head in a general election match-up would be Sanders and Rubio.”



JEB SAYS PLAN WAS TO DEPLOY DUBYA ‘NEARING THE END’

MSNBC’s morning show has become something of a therapy session by those upset by the rise of Marco Rubio. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush joined host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican Florida congressmen famous for his Rubio resentments, for some therapeutic venting this morning. Bush and Scarborough commiserated about the success of a candidate whom they both deem unworthy, but Bush slipped a bit when talking about his own campaign.



Bush was asked by another host why it took him so long to deploy his brother, former President George W. Bush, in the primary race. The super PAC trying to keep Jeb Bush’s campaign afloat unveiled an ad featuring the 43rd president, a sharp departure from the original campaign strategy of distancing him from his older brother. The struggling presidential contender explained the timing by saying that the “intention was to do it nearing the end.”



Who would have thought that the end would be near for former frontrunner Bush even before the first primary was held?



Righteous brother - “We are righteous in making sure there’s no coordination [with the super PAC he founded to back his campaign]. But I knew [George W. Bush] was going to campaign for me in South Carolina, for which I’m grateful…I love my brother and a lot of Republicans do as well.” – Jeb Bush on “The Kelly File” Watch here.



Bush, Christie camps coordinate to kill off Rubio - NYT: “Members of the Bush and Christie campaigns have communicated about their mutual desire to halt Mr. Rubio’s rise in the polls, according to Republican operatives familiar with the conversations. While emails, texts and phone calls between operatives in rival campaigns are not uncommon in the tight-knit world of political strategists, the contact among senior aides in the two campaigns has drifted toward musings about what can be done to stop or at least slow Mr. Rubio, the operatives said. In a sign of a budding alliance, the aides have, for example, exchanged news articles that raise potential areas of vulnerability for Mr. Rubio. There is no formal coordination, the operatives stressed, but rather a recognition of a shared agenda. ‘We do have similar goals,’ an adviser to Mr. Christie said.”



[The Hill: “Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) will endorse Chris Christie in the Republican presidential race, a new report says.”]



Jeb & Co. focus on Santorum ‘accomplishments’ stumble - USA Today: “The intra-party battle against Marco Rubio is focusing on his Senate experience — or lack thereof…Bush told MSNBC’s Morning Joe, ‘and the net effect is that we’re languishing as a nation.’ Christie has leveled similar criticisms, noting that one of Rubio’s new endorsers — former presidential candidate Rick Santorum — couldn’t cite any specific Rubio accomplishments in the Senate. The New Jersey governor also describes Rubio as a ‘bubble boy’ who avoids tough questions. Rubio’s poll numbers in New Hampshire are rising in the wake of his strong finish in Iowa. Christie and Bush are looking to bring down those numbers, seeking to become the main establishment alternative to Iowa winner Ted Cruz and the still-well-polling Donald Trump.”

The ethics of animal conservation can be tricky. Sometimes conservation of one species requires the elimination of another. The New Yorker brings us the tale of the Channel Island Turkeys, which were eradicated from the islands to save the native foxes, but the story goes deeper than that: “The sheep on Santa Cruz Island, off the coast of Southern California, were the first to go. They had been imported by schooner in the mid-nineteenth century, and, beginning in the early nineteen-eighties, tens of thousands of their feral descendants were eradicated. Later it was the hogs’ turn to face the gun. Between 2005 and 2006, more than five thousand were killed. By the following year, Santa Cruz was certified pig-free—a boon, perhaps, for the island’s oak trees, whose acorns the animals particularly loved. The next round of exterminations targeted several hundred turkeys.”

DEBATE, POLL FORETELL LONG SLOG FOR HILLARY

A contentious, sometimes nasty, Democratic debate between presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton and her rival, socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., foreshadowed a long, ugly march to victory for Clinton. And a new poll out today shows just how long it might be.



The Quinnipiac University national poll shows Clinton’s support has collapsed since the last survey in December, losing nearly 20 points to fall into a statistical tie with Sanders. Clinton is still popular with Democrats, but hard sentiment seems to be growing. Some 22 percent of Democrats hold unfavorable views of Clinton, more than double Sanders. The Vermont senator also holds the highest overall favorability among any candidate in either party at 44 percent and performs better in the general election matchup against all Republicans than Clinton. That’s strong evidence that her electability argument isn’t working.



Clinton’s battering of Sanders in Thursday’s debate suggests she is aware of her predicament. But she likely worsened her plight as she not only went scorched earth after Sanders but also made several head-scratching claims including that she was not part of the Democratic establishment.



She can still be considered a lock for the nomination but it is almost as if her preparations for a long, ugly process was a prediction rather than a precaution.

Baxter says the mousetrap, which was on display at the museum captured a mouse…The trap was manufactured by Colin Pullinger & Sons’ in 1861. It’s a time when Queen Victoria was on the throne, the U.S. Civil war had just started and Canada was still ‘British North America.’ They also had mice. ‘Let’s pay tribute to the Victorians, and how wonderfully they managed to make things,’ Baxter says.”

217,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/05/sparks-fly-at-clinton-sanders-debate-over-who-is-more-progressive.html?intcmp=hpbt3,2,"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed sharply Thursday over who is more progressive, at a debate that saw the former secretary of state ratcheting up her criticism of the Vermont senator on several fronts – even accusing him of engineering an “artful smear” with suggestions she could be “bought” by donors.

The debate, the first since the Iowa caucuses and last before next week’s critical New Hampshire primary, was by far the most confrontational of the Democratic primary race.

Clinton, coming off a narrow Iowa win and trying to shrink Sanders’ huge lead in Granite State polls, stayed on offense for most of the night. She slammed Sanders’ campaign promises as too costly, while standing firm in claiming she’s a true “progressive” despite Sanders’ comments to the contrary.

Sanders, meanwhile, dug in as he questioned whether Clinton really “walks the walk” of the progressive cause – and described her as the candidate of the “establishment.”

“Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment. I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans,” he said, stressing that he, unlike Clinton, doesn’t enjoy super PAC backing and is funded in large part by small-dollar donations.

The verbal jabs flew quickly, and Clinton left few allegations unchallenged, visibly fed up with a campaign trail narrative that has painted her as the candidate of Wall Street. She rebutted Sanders’ “establishment” charge by questioning whether someone running to be the first female president can carry that label.

The most heated moment at the MSNBC-hosted debate in Durham, N.H., came when Clinton told Sanders she rejects the suggestion that anyone who takes donations or speaking fees from interest groups can be bought.

“Enough is enough,” Clinton said, telling Sanders the “attacks by insinuation” are not “worthy” of him. Clinton said if Sanders has something to allege, “say it directly,” but: “You will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.”

She closed: “I think it’s time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeks.”

That line earned a groan from Sanders and some boos from the audience.

Sanders went on to link Wall Street deregulation with billions spent on lobbying and campaign contributions.

“Some people think, yeah, that had some influence,” he said.

Clinton, meanwhile, described herself as a “progressive who gets things done,” and ripped Sanders for suggesting Clinton cannot be a “moderate” and a “progressive” at the same time. She teased Sanders as being the “self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism” and said she doesn’t know anyone who fits his definition.

The fireworks underscored the tight state of the race going into New Hampshire’s contest next Tuesday. Clinton arrived on the debate stage clearly ready to rebut Sanders’ proposals and accusations – notably his oft-repeated criticism that she, as senator, erred by voting to authorize the use of force in Iraq.

“A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS,” she countered.

Yet as Clinton stressed her secretary of state experience and Sanders said that factor is “not arguable,” the Vermont senator noted experience is not the only point.

“Judgment is,” he said, again pointing to the 2002 Iraq vote. “One of us voted the right way, and one of us didn’t.”

As she has at prior debates, Clinton also challenged the senator’s proposals for free college and universal health care. “The numbers just don’t add up,” Clinton said.

She questioned how the country could, for instance, pay for free tuition at public colleges, as Sanders wants, and accused him of wanting to effectively scrap ObamaCare – a charge he denied.

Sanders defended his plans, particularly for universal health care.

“I do believe we should have health care for all,” he said.

The former secretary of state met the Vermont senator on stage in Durham, N.H., after eking out a narrow victory in Monday’s caucuses. While her campaign celebrated the win, Sanders’ strong showing in the state nevertheless has helped boost his fundraising – and he heads into New Hampshire with a steady double-digit lead in the polls.

There remains an ongoing dispute, however, over the Iowa results. The Des Moines Register editorial board earlier Thursday called for an audit of the Democratic caucus results, citing problems and confusion at polling sites.

Asked at Thursday’s debate about the editorial, Sanders said, “I agree with the Des Moines Register.”

He said after speaking with precinct captains, the campaign believes they may have “at least two more delegates.”

Yet Sanders, who has complained how some local delegates were allocated based on coin tosses, also said they should not “blow this out of proportion. “

“This is not the biggest deal in the world,” Sanders said.

Asked if she’d participate in an audit, Clinton said, “Whatever they decide to do, that’s fine.”

Clinton, separately, said she's ""100 percent confident"" nothing will come of the FBI probe into her personal email use as secretary of state.

The Democratic debate on Thursday was the first to feature Clinton and Sanders one-on-one, with former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley now out of the race following his distant third showing in Iowa.

The debate was one of four added to the calendar earlier this week, after the Democratic National Committee and the two campaigns agreed to the terms. The party had come under criticism for its sparse schedule, and was accused of trying to shield Clinton from debates."
218,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/01/msnbc-dnc-reach-deal-to-host-democratic-debate-in-new-hampshire.html,2,"The tentative deal reached this weekend between the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders includes a debate Thursday at the University of New Hampshire in Durham.

MSNBC announced Sunday it will host the debate, scheduled for 9 p.m. Eastern with Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow moderating. New Hampshire's first-in-the nation primary is Feb. 9.

Clinton and Sanders are in a tight race before Monday's Iowa caucuses, and Clinton trails the Vermont senator in New Hampshire, raising the possibility that the Democratic front-runner could lose the first two contests. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley has trailed them by wide margins.

The Democratic National Committee says it's reached an agreement in principal to have the party sanction and manage more debates during the primary schedule, including the New Hampshire debate."
219,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/02/08/what-marco-rubio-needs-to-do-now-to-win.html,2,"A few days before the Iowa caucuses, Ted Cruz called Marco Rubio a “Republican Obama.” It was intended to be an insult. Rubio should take it as a compliment.

Like Barack Obama eight years ago, Rubio is a young and handsome first-term U.S. senator, an eloquent speaker with a compelling personal story who is a candidate for the presidency of the United States.

And like Obama eight years ago, Rubio is in a horse race. And despite his stumble in Saturday night’s debate in New Hampshire, he nonetheless is sitting comfortably behind the leaders and ready to make his move. Once he sees his opening, he could sprint all the way to the White House.

In many ways, America is back where it was eight years ago. Voters are looking for renewed hope and a sense of identity, and they want their country to regain its pride and stature in the world. There is a current of anger in the campaigns of Cruz, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, but strip away the veneer and you find an undercurrent that has always driven America: optimism for a better future and for a leader who will represent the dignity, the decorum and the exceptional qualities of the greatest nation in the world.

I’ve had the opportunity to get to know Marco Rubio. I’ve lived in Miami, so I understand his roots and the people he represents. I have no doubt that he can be a great president – but first he has to win the race.

I’m a big fan of thoroughbred racing, and I’ve always been fascinated by the sport’s great champions. There have been horses like Secretariat and Ruffian who charged out of the gate, took the lead and never looked back. And there have been others like Seabiscuit, who stuck comfortably to his pace a few lengths back and then charged out of the pack to win.

In this horse race, Rubio is like Seabiscuit. He’s in third place right now, but the leaders – Cruz and Trump – are well within his sights. And he knows that the winner isn’t the candidate who jumps into the lead. It’s the one who finishes first at the national convention.

For Rubio, winning the Republican nomination could be as easy as 3-2-1: Finish third in Iowa, second in New Hampshire and first in South Carolina, then keep the pedal to the metal all the way to Cleveland. And if his performance in Saturday’s debate lands him lower than second in New Hampshire, he has more than enough time to get back his stride and overtake the leaders.

With that in mind, there are a number of things that Rubio and his team need to emphasize as the race kicks into high gear:

1. Diversity

This is not the America of 200 years ago. We are the sons and daughters of immigrants from everywhere in the world, and as the son of Cuban-Americans, Rubio knows this as well as anyone. His parents’ struggle and his rags-to-riches story should be an inspiration to all ethnic groups, not just Latinos, much as President Obama’s was eight years ago. Rubio is smart to appeal to the religious Right, and reaffirming his faiths and beliefs is commendable. But going forward, he’d be wise to address the equality of all ethnic groups and religions in our country.

2. Data

One of the things Cruz did well in Iowa was to invest in the infrastructure and resources needed to compile big data that could be analyzed to give his campaign direction. It mirrored a tactic that Obama mastered in 2008, and nobody has ever done it better. Super PACs are great at buying advertising time, but they should play an equally important role in making sure Rubio has the best data-crunching capabilities available.

3. Delegates

Rubio finished third in Iowa, behind Cruz and Trump, but closer to Trump than anyone expected. Now he hopes to finish second in New Hampshire Tuesday, behind Trump, who is the heavy favorite, and ahead of Cruz. That could give him the momentum to come in first on Feb. 23 in Nevada, where he’s been endorsed by Sheldon Adelson’s powerful Las Vegas-Review, and then on Feb. 27 in South Carolina, where several key members of his team – including Terry Sullivan, the director of his PAC, Reclaim America – have powerful roots. Just three days later, on March 1 – Super Tuesday – when voters in 14 states go to the polls, he could already be in the lead.

4. Details

Rubio has been articulate in laying out how he would deal with issues like immigration, health care and national security, and he’s provided more substantive details on his website than any of his opponents. Cruz has given him a lot of flak for his involvement with the “Gang of Eight,” but when did seeking bipartisan support to solve a problem become a bad thing? Rubio should use that to his advantage, because working with both parties to find solutions is the mark of a great president. Rubio is one of the best communicators in politics today, and he has the ability to explain his positions clearly, providing details on how to improve our health care system, protect our country, defeat ISIS and stop illegal immigration without alienating legal immigrants.

Marco Rubio is a compassionate, brilliant, articulate, focused leader who can rally America to a new era. Now is his time to sharpen his focus, take the lead at the end of the first turn, pace himself in the backstretch and leave the others in his dust as he sprints to the finish line."
220,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/27/trump-campaign-says-candidate-won-t-participate-in-fox-newsgoogle-debate.html?intcmp=hpbt2,2,"Donald Trump’s campaign said Tuesday night that the Republican presidential primary front-runner does not plan to participate in the upcoming Fox News/Google debate, shortly after the debate lineup was announced.

Trump’s campaign confirmed the decision to Fox News.

The Republican presidential candidate already had said he probably would not be going, accusing Fox News of “playing games” with him. Trump has cited concerns with one of the debate moderators, Megyn Kelly – but apparently made his decision not to attend following press statements from Fox News.

Trump, though, took heat for his decision from his closest rival in the polls, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who accused Trump of being ""afraid of Megyn Kelly.""

“If Donald is afraid to defend his record, it speaks volumes,” Cruz said in a radio interview with Mark Levin, challenging Trump to a one-on-one debate.

Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Wednesday that the boycott had “nothing to do with Megyn Kelly.”

But a half-hour later, Trump again went after Kelly on Twitter, calling her a “lightweight reporter.”

The Fox News/Google debate is set for this Thursday in Des Moines, Iowa. It would mark the first GOP presidential primary debate that Trump has not attended.

His campaign put out a statement Tuesday night confirming the candidate “will not be participating in the Fox News debate and will instead host an event in Iowa to raise money for the Veterans and Wounded Warriors.”

Addressing the matter on “The Kelly File,” Kelly later said: “I’ll be there. … The debate will go on with or without Mr. Trump.”

Despite his complaints, he had easily qualified as one of the eight candidates in the prime-time event.

Fox News announced the candidate lineup for that debate earlier Tuesday evening, and the qualifying participants were:

Trump; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz; Florida Sen. Marco Rubio; retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Ohio Gov. John Kasich; and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.

The participants qualifying for the earlier, 7 p.m. ET debate were:

Former HP CEO Carly Fiorina; former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee; former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum; and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore.

The lineup reflects a polling boost for Paul, who did not qualify for the most recent Fox Business Network prime-time debate earlier this month, and declined to participate in that program’s evening event.

This time, Paul suggested he’ll attend, saying the campaign is “very excited” about qualifying for the main stage.

Meanwhile, Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes has defended Megyn Kelly amid the criticism from Trump. He issued a statement earlier to The Washington Post saying, “Megyn Kelly is an excellent journalist, and the entire network stands behind her. She will absolutely be on the debate stage on Thursday night.""

Kelly has withstood Trump’s attacks since the August debate, when he accused her of purposely attacking him. As part of Trump’s explanation for not participating in Thursday’s debate he called the ""Kelly File"" host a ""lightweight"" and ""third-rate reporter.""

Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski even threatened to ramp up the verbal attacks Trump has repeated since the first August debate.

“In a call on Saturday with a Fox News executive, Lewandowski stated that Megyn had a ‘rough couple of days after that last debate’ and he ‘would hate to have her go through that again,’” a Fox News statement said late Tuesday.

“Lewandowski was warned not to level any more threats, but he continued to do so. We can’t give in to terrorizations toward any of our employees,” the statement added.

Trump, speaking earlier in Iowa, said he’d probably raise money for veterans instead of doing the event. And speaking with Fox News’ Bret Baier, Trump said he “didn’t like the press releases Fox put out.”

The Fox News/Google debate in Des Moines this Thursday will be the candidates’ last before next week’s Iowa caucuses – which kicks off the Republican presidential nominating process.

In the run-up, the candidates are ramping up their ad spending and shoe-leather campaigning, while going after each other in the process.

After clashing at the most recent GOP debate, Iowa front-runners Trump and Cruz have only turned up their attacks in recent days – particularly as Trump regains his Iowa lead over Cruz in most polls. The race, though, remains close. The latest Quinnipiac University poll showed Trump leading Cruz just 31-29 percent in Iowa.

Cruz said Tuesday that “no state is a must-win for us.” But the reality is his campaign is fighting hard for an Iowa victory, as Trump maintains a huge polling lead in the next contest: the New Hampshire primary.

One new ad from a Cruz-supporting super PAC is accusing Trump of being aligned with Democrats on “government-run health care.” Another from the Cruz campaign returns to the well of criticizing Trump’s “New York values,” while playing a clip of him saying, “How stupid are the people of Iowa?”

Trump, meanwhile, called Cruz a “liar” in an MSNBC interview Tuesday.

“Nobody likes him,” Trump said, attempting to draw a contrast with his own business experience by saying Cruz can’t make a deal with anybody.

The debate on Thursday will be moderated by Fox News anchors Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace.

The candidate lineup was decided based on the results of national, New Hampshire and Iowa polling – released before 5 p.m. ET on Tuesday.

To qualify for the prime-time debate, a candidate had to place in the top six in an average of recent national polls, or in the top five in an average of recent Iowa or New Hampshire polls. ‎The evening debate features other candidates who received a minimum 1 percent in at least one recent national poll."
221,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/09/sanders-republican-governors-eye-comeback-in-new-hampshire-primary.html,2,"Residents of three small New Hampshire towns cast their ballots in the Granite State's first-in-the-nation presidential primary just after midnight Tuesday, kicking off a contest‎ where several candidates are eyeing a comeback.

On the Democratic side, Sen. Bernie Sanders of next-door Vermont is looking to rebound from his narrow Iowa loss with a big victory over Hillary Clinton. And on the Republican side, nearly a half-dozen candidates are battling for position behind Donald Trump, with the race's governors – Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and John Kasich -- looking for redemption after missing the leaderboard entirely last week.

With votes in from residents of Dixville Notch, Millsfield and Hart's Landing, Trump, Ohio Gov. Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz shared the Republican lead with nine votes each. New Jersey Gov. Christie followed with three votes, while Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida governor Bush each had two. Retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson and former HP CEO Carly Fiorina each garnered one vote.

On the Democratic side, Sanders led Clinton by 17 votes to 9.

In a statistical oddity, the candidate who receives a plurality of the Republican vote in Dixville Notch (population: 12) has been the GOP nominee in every election cycle since 1968. This year, Kasich won the town's vote, 3-2, over Trump.

With Trump leading the Republican race by double digits in most polls, the big question entering Tuesday's primary was whether the relentless attacks against Rubio during and after Saturday night’s Republican debate would be enough to bring the surging freshman Florida senator back to the pack in the race for second place.

In the two-person Democratic race, Sanders has held an advantage over Clinton in New Hampshire for weeks. The state is friendly territory for the Vermont senator and a must-win if he's to have a chance of staying competitive with Clinton as the race moves to more diverse states that are seen as more hospitable to the former secretary of state.

Christie has been unrelenting in questioning Rubio’s readiness and authenticity. At Saturday’s debate, he slammed the senator for repeatedly reciting anti-Obama “talking points.” He repeated the criticism Monday night in an appearance on Fox News' ""The Kelly File.""

""You can't repeat the same thing over and over again,"" Christie said. ""[Is Rubio] going to do that sitting across from [Russian President] Vladimir Putin? There's no substance there.""

""He's a nice guy, he has talent,"" Christie continued,"" [But] he's too young, too inexperienced and he has served not one day in a position of management in his entire life.""

Rubio, though, has dug in and continued to repeat his criticism of President Obama that drew Christie’s scorn.

""People said, 'Oh, you said the same thing three or four times.' I'm going to say it again,"" Rubio said Monday in Londonderry.

“As far as that message, I hope they keep running it. And I'm going to keep saying it because it's true,"" Rubio said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” ""Barack Obama … said he wanted to change the country. He's doing it in a way that is robbing us of everything that is special.”

Speaking on Fox News, Bush said he’s also going to continue taking on front-runner Trump, as he did during Saturday’s debate.

“He’s not a conservative; he doesn’t have the temperament to be president and whenever I have the chance to describe what I think about him, I’m gonna do it,” Bush said Monday.

Bush hammered Trump on Saturday for his broad support of eminent domain – and Trump's past attempt to use it to take a woman’s property for a project in Atlantic City. During that dispute, Trump tried to “shush” Bush, but was booed by the audience.

Bush pointed to that exchange in questioning how Trump would do in a general election race.

“You think he’s gonna shush Hillary Clinton?” Bush said. “He would lose.”

Trump saved his harshest attacks Monday for Bush as well as Cruz, who bested him in Iowa. When an audience member at a rally in Manchester shouted out an insult directed at Cruz — a vulgar term for ""coward"" — Trump repeated the term and jokingly reprimanded the woman.

Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler responded to the Associated Press via email, saying, ""Let's not forget who whipped who in Iowa.""

""Jeb is having some kind of a breakdown, I think,"" Trump told CNN Monday, calling Bush, the son and brother of presidents, a spoiled child and an embarrassment to his family. ""I think it's a very sad situation that's taking place.""

Kasich, meanwhile, has taken a less confrontational approach in the race, casting himself as a uniting force and touting his economic record as governor. The Ohio governor has seemingly pinned his hopes on New Hampshire and said Sunday he’s going in strong – while stressing he also has substantial resources on the ground in states like South Carolina and Nevada.

Kasich also criticized Bush over an online video that hit Kasich for expanding Medicaid and what the Bush campaign called his ""liberal record"" in Ohio compared to Bush's two terms as Florida governor.

""I'm really disappointed in Jeb,"" Kasich told ""The Kelly File."" ""Look, I mean, he's taken the very low road to the highest office in the land, and he's been negative all along, but that's okay.""

Carson and Fiorina also are looking to do better than they did in Iowa, but have struggled to even break into the middle tier in Granite State polling.

222,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/10/christie-fiorina-suspend-2016-campaigns.html,2,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie suspended his Republican presidential bid Wednesday afternoon, joining former HP executive Carly Fiorina in exiting the 2016 race after a disappointing finish in the New Hampshire primary.

Sources say Christie met with staff in person Wednesday in Morristown, N.J., and also held a conference call to announce his decision to his campaign team.

The announcement was widely expected, after the two-term governor returned home after his loss Tuesday night to weigh his options.

Christie had finished sixth in the primary contest, while Fiorina finished seventh.

In a statement on Facebook, Christie said, ""I ran for president to say that the government needs to once again work for the people, not the people work for the government. And while running for president I tried to reinforce what I have always believed - that speaking your mind matters, that experience matters, that competence matters and that it will always matter in leading our nation…. And so today, I leave the race without an ounce of regret.""

The decision to drop out immediately kicks off the race in the rest of the still-crowded GOP field to scoop up their support. And it marks the end of the 2016 road for two candidates who showed political promise earlier in the race – only to watch their support fade as the elections themselves neared.

Christie was banking on a solid performance in the New Hampshire contest, seen as more friendly territory for the Northeast governor who did poorly in Iowa. But even as he touted his executive experience, the other current and former governors in the race outflanked him Tuesday night.

While the tough-talking Christie received widespread attention for his aggressive criticism of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at Saturday’s debate, that spat seemed to hurt Rubio more than it helped Christie. Rubio finished fifth, but Christie ended up well behind the freshman senator, pulling just 7 percent in the state.

His exit from the race completes a drastic turnaround in the governor’s political fortunes. In 2012, he delivered the keynote address at the Republican National Convention, after having gained national political fame for taking on the state’s public employee unions and his no-nonsense approach to governing. His periodic confrontations with hecklers captured on film also made him somewhat a YouTube star.

But he was politically damaged by the scandal in his administration over subordinates blocking traffic on the George Washington Bridge, in a seeming act of political retribution against a local mayor. Christie has denied knowledge of the decision, but has struggled ever since to get out from under the cloud of controversy.

His persona as the “telling it like it is” candidate also seemed to take a backseat last year to Donald Trump, who if anything was more brash, more unscripted, more confrontational than Christie. In the crowded field, he struggled to break through.

For a time in late 2015, Christie looked like he could be in contention for second place in New Hampshire. He was devoting time and resources to the state, and gaining attention for his impassioned and personal remarks on drug addiction – in a state where heroin addiction and treatment is a major election issue.

But in the end, voters gravitated more toward Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who finished second Tuesday. Trump easily won the Republican contest, while Texas Sen. Ted Cruz finished third.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Rubio finished fourth and fifth, respectively, followed by Christie.

Meanwhile, Fiorina, who was the only female GOP candidate in the 2016 running, called it quits Wednesday after failing to crack the top five in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday night.

“While I suspend my candidacy today, I will continue to travel this country and fight for those Americans who refuse to settle for the way things are and a status quo that no longer works for them,” Fiorina said in a written statement.

She added, “I will continue to serve in order to restore citizen government to this great nation so that together we may fulfill our potential.”

Fiorina entered the tumultuous Republican primary in April. She promoted herself as an outsider with business experience and argued that as the lone woman in the GOP field she was best positioned to oppose likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. After a standout performance in the first undercard debate, Fiorina rose to the mainstage and soared in the polls in the fall. But her momentum quickly stalled and by the end of the year she had dropped back down.

Fiorina's first major foray in to politics was in 2010, when she ran for Senate in California and lost to incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer by 10 points.

Throughout her presidential bid, Fiorina emphasized her meteoric rise in the business world. A Stanford University graduate, she started her career as a secretary, earned an MBA and worked her way up at AT&T to become a senior executive at the telecom giant.

But she was also dogged by questions about her record at Hewlett-Packard, where she was hired as CEO in 1999. She was fired six years later, after leading a major merger with Compaq and laying off 30,000 workers.

223,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/11/clinton-sanders-clash-over-obama-more-at-testy-debate.html,2,"Hillary Clinton launched her harshest attacks yet on Bernie Sanders during their debate Thursday night in Milwaukee, in a clear attempt to define their differences on major issues and win over black voters — but they had their most heated exchanges over campaign financing, who was the stronger supporter of President Obama — and who was a friend of Henry Kissinger.

The debate fell at a time when Sanders is trying to build his momentum after his big New Hampshire win, while Clinton is trying to regain hers.

As Sanders pointedly reminded her, “You’re not in the White House yet.”

But the candidates at times offered a similar message. This was evident as they vociferously called for an overhaul of local police departments that they suggested are unfair to black people.

“We need fundamental police reform,” Sanders said, adding he’s “sick and tired” of seeing unarmed black people shot by police. He likened heavily equipped police departments to “occupying armies.”

Clinton, meanwhile, echoed those themes, joining Sanders in calling for sentencing reform while saying the country’s “systemic racism” goes deeper and must be addressed – in education, housing and the job market.

“We are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we need to root out,” she said.

The comments were part of each candidate’s revived appeal to minority voters, a key voting bloc as the Democratic presidential primary heads to South Carolina.

But even as they stressed those issues, differences were laid bare at the PBS-hosted debate in Milwaukee. And Sanders came prepared to counter Clinton’s attacks, showing a feistier side than he did at their last showdown.

When Clinton used her closing remarks to suggest Sanders was taking shots at President Obama, Sanders called it a “low blow” and countered: “One of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate.”

He even underscored his critique of Clinton’s foreign policy by pointing to a book where Clinton said she was mentored by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

“I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend,” Sanders said, calling him “one of the most destructive” American diplomats.

Clinton fired back that “we have yet to know” who Sanders listens to on foreign policy.

“Well, it ain’t Henry Kissinger,” Sanders said.

The two also clashed sharply over Sanders’ high-cost, big-government plans.

“We are not England. We are not France,” Clinton said.

Clinton accused Sanders of pushing programs that would grow the federal government by 40 percent. She suggested his health care promises “cannot be kept “and will be far more costly than he admits.

“We should level with the American people,” she said.

She also said Sanders’ plans would upend ObamaCare – though Sanders said he would not “dismantle” it.

“That is absolutely inaccurate,” he said, when she claimed his plans would leave many people worse off.

“In my view, health care is a right of all people … and I will fight for that,” Sanders said, adding it would take “courage.”

Clinton also criticized Sanders for voting against a 2007 immigration reform bill backed by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy.

Sanders explained that the bill had a guest-worker program that progressive groups opposed.

“I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea of what needed to be done,” Clinton said.

Yet the candidates agreed in their joint criticism of the Obama administration’s recent deportation raids.

Sanders, meanwhile, once again hammered Clinton for her Wall Street ties, suggesting the financial sector’s big donations are meant to buy influence.

“Let’s not insult the intelligence of the American people. People aren’t dumb,” Sanders said. “Why in God’s name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it.”

They sparred on the issue as Sanders touted the fact he’s “the only candidate up here” who has no super PAC supporting him. A super PAC backing Clinton, he said, recently raised $15 million from Wall Street.

Clinton countered by noting that Obama took Wall Street donations too, but “when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.”

“Let’s not in any way imply here that either President Obama or myself would in any way not take on any vested interest,” she said, calling for more regulation of the financial sector.

The showdown comes as Clinton tries to reset the race, which heads next to Nevada and South Carolina. Her narrow victory in Iowa and resounding defeat in New Hampshire have raised fresh questions about her candidacy, which at one point was seen as a sure thing for the Democratic nomination.

Publicly, the Clinton campaign is voicing confidence. The campaign has been refocusing on the battle to lock down minority voter support, asserting that with their help, the former secretary of state can easily make gains against Sanders. But Sanders is at the same time making a bid to expand his own support beyond rural, white voters -- who largely decide Iowa and New Hampshire.

While the Clinton campaign is banking on minority voters as it heads into South Carolina and other delegate-rich states down the primary calendar, Tuesday’s contest exposed serious problems for her. She lost in New Hampshire across almost every demographic, including women.

Overall, she lost to Sanders by more than 20 points."
224,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/14/fireworks-erupt-between-trump-and-bush-rubio-and-cruz-at-gop-debate.html?intcmp=hpbt2,2,"Sparks flew at the toughest and liveliest GOP primary debate yet Saturday night, as Donald Trump and Jeb Bush clashed over the Middle East and George W. Bush’s legacy, trading insults at a rapid clip – and the two Cuban-American senators in the race accused each other of lying on immigration and even questioned each other’s Spanish-speaking skills.

And just when it seemed Trump and Ted Cruz might steer clear of each other, the two leading Republican candidates entered the ring toward the end of the debate when the Texas senator questioned the billionaire businessman’s pro-life credentials.

“You are the single biggest liar. You’re probably worse than Jeb Bush,” Trump said.

Cruz stood his ground, charging that Trump would “appoint liberals” to the Supreme Court if elected.

The issue of judicial appointments was front and center at the CBS News-hosted debate in Greenville, S.C., in the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, with candidates like Cruz saying it underscores the high stakes in this election. Several candidates called for a delay in any high court appointment or confirmation.

But the barbed and often personal exchanges Saturday marked a new phase of the race, as the candidates charge into next week’s critical South Carolina primary. The clashes left Ohio Gov. John Kasich – the affable, second-place finisher in the New Hampshire primary – making an appeal for peace in the GOP field, albeit one unlikely to be heeded.

“I think we’re fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we don’t stop this,” Kasich said.

Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, too, warned about the coming general election and said, “We cannot be tearing each other down.”

The appeals came shortly after Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio accused each other of being soft on illegal immigration. It’s an argument they’ve had before – Cruz faults Rubio for backing a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included a path to legal status, and Rubio says Cruz was on board with that effort – but this time, it became more heated. And after Cruz accused Rubio of saying on Univision he wouldn’t rescind President Obama’s immigration executive orders on day one, Rubio quipped:

“I don’t know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn’t speak Spanish,” Rubio said.

Cruz, then, immediately began debating Rubio in Spanish. Rubio continued, saying Cruz “lies about all sorts of things” and indeed supports legalizing illegal immigrants.

“Simply false,” Cruz said.

As the Rubio-Cruz battle heated up, so did the long-simmering feud between Trump and Bush.

“This is a man who insults his way to the nomination,” Bush said of Trump.

With Bush attempting a comeback in the race after a fourth-place finish in New Hampshire, Trump faced a feistier debate rival on stage Saturday night than he has before – boosted in part by what seemed to be a sympathetic audience.

The audience often booed Trump when he took on Bush, though Trump once again accused them of representing Bush’s “special interests and lobbyists.”

Their most personal dispute came when Trump accused Bush of promoting a policy that would get the U.S. mired more deeply in the Middle East – and blamed the former Florida governor’s brother for the problems there.

Trump initially took issue with Jeb Bush’s call to confront ISIS while also taking on Syria’s Bashar Assad and sidelining Russia.

“Jeb is so wrong,” Trump said. “You have to knock out ISIS. .... You decide what you have to do after. You can’t fight two wars at one time.”

Bush, though, said Russia is not a U.S. ally, and Assad’s hold on power prevents a resolution in the war. Trump then went on to repeatedly slam the decision under the George W. Bush administration to enter Iraq in the first place, calling it a “big fat mistake” that “destabilized the Middle East.”

“They lied” about WMDs, he said.

“I am sick and tired of him going after my family,” Jeb Bush countered, saying he’s proud of his brother’s efforts to keep the country safe.

Trump then invoked 9/11: “The World Trade Center came down … That’s not keeping us safe.”

Rubio, who has often been at odds with Bush, leapt to his brother’s defense, saying the Bush administration “kept us safe.”

Jeb Bush joked that he was rescinding Trump’s invitation to an upcoming rally with George W. Bush on the campaign trail.

The fireworks flew after the debate started on a somber note, discussing the legacy of Supreme Court Justice Scalia and the impact his death Saturday will have.

Several candidates urged President Obama to refrain from nominating anybody to fill the vacancy, and wait for the next president to make that decision. Trump, though, said he doesn’t expect Obama to wait, and called on Senate Republicans to hold up any nomination.

“It’s called delay, delay, delay,” Trump said.

Trump called Scalia’s death a “tremendous blow to conservatism.”

Kasich urged Obama to put the “country first” and not move forward with a nomination, a plea echoed by Rubio. Obama, though, said minutes before the start of the debate that he indeed plans to nominate a successor.

The GOP candidates, meanwhile, used opening remarks to honor Scalia’s legacy.

Cruz called him a “legal giant” who “changed the arc of American legal history.” He said Scalia’s death also “underscores the stakes of this election.”

“We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion” by states, threaten gun rights and “undermine” religious liberty, Cruz said. He said he would appoint a strict constitutionalist if elected.

Scalia’s death thrusts the issue of judicial appointments into the 2016 race, raising the possibility that the next president immediately will have to fill a high court vacancy. While Obama vowed Saturday to nominate a successor, it’s unclear whether he can get any appointee confirmed in the Republican-led Senate.

While the prospect of a Supreme Court vacancy now looms over the race, the South Carolina primary already was heating up on several fronts in recent days, with the candidates trading accusations on immigration and other issues.

The debate Saturday reflects that tougher tone, in a state notorious for bare-knuckle primary battles. Trump at one point accused Cruz of trying to spread rumors in the state that he’s not running in South Carolina – likening that to his campaign’s actions in Iowa, where representatives spread false rumors that Carson was dropping out.

“Nasty guy, now I know why he doesn’t have one endorsement from any of his colleagues,” Trump said.

Even Kasich struggled to avoid the fray, as Bush criticized him for expanding Medicaid under ObamaCare and said that would create more debt.

“He knows that I’m not for ObamaCare,” Kasich said, before vowing to stay “positive. “

The GOP field is now down to six candidates -- after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Hewlett Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina dropped out following low finishes Tuesday in the New Hampshire primary.

A big question Saturday night, and going forward, was whether Rubio could regain his momentum – following last weekend’s lackluster performance. A withering attack by Christie on Rubio, which had the Florida senator repeating himself, appeared to hurt him in the New Hampshire primary. Rubio himself blamed his debate performance in part for his fifth-place finish in the state. He finished behind Trump, Kasich, Cruz and Bush. Christie, though, is no longer on stage or in the race.

Most polling in South Carolina still shows Rubio third, with Trump and Cruz in the top two positions, respectively."
225,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/02/17/apple-to-fight-order-to-help-hack-san-bernardino-shooters-phone.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"Apple will fight a federal magistrate's order to help the Obama administration break into an encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the shooters in last December's deadly San Bernardino terror attack.

In a statement posted on Apple's website early Wednesday, CEO Tim Cook said the order by U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym ""has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.""

""We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good,"" Cook's statement read in part. ""Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.""

Cook's statement was published hours after Pym's first-of-its kind ruling, a significant victory for the Justice Department in a technology policy debate that pits digital privacy against national security interests.

“Nobody can build a phone that we cannot get in under unique circumstances. Why should Apple be allowed to build a phone that does that?” a federal agent involved in the San Bernardino terror investigation told Fox News. “The right should not supersede our ability to keep people safe. It’s why we are not finding others, encryption, and, specifically in this case, we cannot connect the dots.”

The agent said the phone’s carrier, Verizon, wouldn’t be able to provide authorities with the necessary information.

“The information we need is on that phone and cannot be accessed by Verizon,” the agent said.

FBI Director James Comey told members of Congress last week that encryption is a major problem for law enforcement who ""find a device that can't be opened even when a judge says there's probable cause to open it.""

The ruling Tuesday tied the problem to the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil since the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in a Dec. 2 shooting at a holiday luncheon for Farook's co-workers. The couple later died in a gun battle with police.

Federal prosecutors told the judge in Tuesday's court proceeding — which was conducted without Apple being allowed to participate — that investigators can't access a work phone used by Farook because they don't know his passcode and Apple has not cooperated. Under U.S. law, a work phone is generally the property of a person's employer. The judge told Apple to provide an estimate of its cost to comply with her order, suggesting that the government will be expected to pay for the work.

In his statement, Cook said, ""this moment calls for public discussion, and we want our customers and people around the country to understand what is at stake.""

Apple has provided default encryption on its iPhones since 2014, allowing any device's contents to be accessed only by the user who knows the phone's passcode. Previously, the company could use an extraction tool that would physically plug into the phone and allow it to respond to search warrant requests from the government.



The ruling by Pym, a former federal prosecutor, requires Apple to supply highly specialized software the FBI can load onto the county-owned work iPhone to bypass a self-destruct feature, which erases the phone's data after too many unsuccessful attempts to unlock it. The FBI wants to be able to try different combinations in rapid sequence until it finds the right one.

""The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake,"" Cook wrote. ""Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.""

It was not immediately clear what investigators believe they might find on Farook's work phone or why the information would not be available from third-party service providers, such as Google or Facebook, though investigators think the device may hold clues about whom the couple communicated with and where they may have traveled.

The couple took pains to physically destroy two personally owned cellphones, crushing them beyond the FBI's ability to recover information from them. They also removed a hard drive from their computer; it has not been found despite investigators diving for days for potential electronic evidence in a nearby lake.

Farook was not carrying his work iPhone during the attack. It was discovered after a subsequent search. It was not known whether Farook forgot about the iPhone or did not care whether investigators found it.

The phone was running the newest version of Apple's iPhone operating system, which requires a passcode and cannot be accessed by Apple, unlike earlier operating systems or older phone models. San Bernardino County provided Farook with an iPhone configured to erase data after 10 consecutive unsuccessful unlocking attempts. The FBI said that feature appeared to be active on Farook's iPhone as of the last time he performed a backup.

The judge didn't spell out her rationale in her three-page order, but the ruling comes amid a similar case in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.

Investigators are still working to piece together a missing 18 minutes in Farook and Malik's timeline from Dec. 2. Investigators have concluded they were at least partly inspired by the Islamic State group; Malik's Facebook page included a note pledging allegiance to the group's leader around the time of the attack.

226,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/02/12/does-bernie-sanders-really-want-to-win-three-observations-from-democratic-debate.html,2,"To understand what ails Hillary Clinton, let’s rewind past Iowa and New Hampshire – two years back, in fact, to a speech in New Orleans before the National Auto Dealers Association and these words:

“The last time I actually drove a car myself was 1996. I remember it very well. Unfortunately, so does the Secret Service, which is why I haven't driven since then.”

That one passage underscores three of Clinton’s present-day woes: she’s lived in a cocoon for well over two decades; she’s not all that entertaining; there may be no limit to what she and her husband will do for a quick buck (that one appearance earned Hillary a $325,000 honorarium).

Speaking of Clinton’s motoring skills, there’s a fourth problem: rather than turn into the skid caused by alarming droves of young and women voters jilting her for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, she’s overcorrected – trying too hard to pawn herself off as a feverish progressive; leaning too hard on “Lean In” adherents to stay true to the sisterhood.

It’s one way to parse Thursday’s Democratic debate in Milwaukee: would Clinton continue her February fishtailing, or find a smarter way to pull out of the skid?

Here are three observations.

1. Did Hillary Alter Her Message? Yes – and it began with her opening statement.

Clinton noted voters’ anger toward the economy (isn’t it more like frustration?), singling out “young people” as those most furious, and sounded Bernie-lite in calling for “unaccountable money” to be taken out of the system and claiming that America’s economy is rigged “for those at the top” (but certainly not those industrious souls giving six-figure speeches).

Credit Clinton with waking up to 2016 reality. Which didn’t come easy – not until New Hampshire’s gobsmacking.

In 1992, Bill Clinton had the luxury of running in a pre-digital time when the Democratic hard left, beaten down after three presidential meltdowns, offered little in the way of resistance. In 2008, having voted for the Iraq war, Hillary was too late to wake up to liberal Sturm und Drang.

In 2016, Clinton understands the kooky old guy to the right of her on the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee stage (physically, not philosophically) is on to something – and she wants in on his act.

And so it’s official: Hillary Feels the Bern . . . until Bernie’s out of the race.

2. Is Bernie Serious About Winning This? We can quibble over the small stuff – like the batch of spending ideas doubling the national debt. Or how he’d win a single vote in Congress.

Not unlike Donald Trump, Sanders is an implausibly electable candidate who’s cornered the market on “you’re being ripped off” simplicity: “The American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. . .”

The problem: preaching the (Democratic) socialist gospel isn’t a blueprint for victory beyond the most lilywhite of Democratic electorates. Sanders needs to call out Clinton in more glaring terms. Otherwise, he’s gum on her shoe – a protest vote that won’t win many states and, as we’ve already seen post-New Hampshire, will get rolled in the contest that counts most: the delegate count.

Take the issue of illegal immigration as an example of how Sanders falls short. In trying to clarify his 2007 Senate vote against a Senate reform plan, he opted to get all prickly about children’s lives rather than prick holes in Clinton’s record – beginning with not being consistent on immigration.

It wasn’t the only opening he missed.

Sanders could have asked how Clinton could credibly bemoan the state of Black America, having watched her husband sign welfare reform and federal sentencing laws, or why she now espouses gay rights having opposed same-sex marriage in 2008.

Sanders’ trump card – and Hillary’s Achilles heel – is authenticity; he believes what he says; she says what she believes will win the moment.

If Sanders wants to prevail beyond a random few states, he has to drive home that argument. Waiting until the debate’s closing minutes to remind Democrats that she ran against Obama, not him, doesn’t cut it.

3. On, Wisconsin . . . To Nevada and South Carolina. The drinking game only a fool would have accepted: imbibing whenever Clinton tossed a line to those voters she most immediately needs (well, that and Bernie saying “billionaires” or “Wall Street”).

For a Nevada that’s almost 28 percent Latino (50 percent above the national average) and votes on the Democratic side a week from Saturday: “[H]ard-working immigrant families, living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future”.

For a South Carolina that’s almost 28 percent black (compared to 1% in New Hampshire) and holds its Democratic primary the following Saturday: “African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing and the criminal justice system”.

Toss in a shout-out here or there to women (equal pay for equal work) and Hillary was the grizzliest of pander bears. Her jacket may have been acid-yellow; her intentions were transparently black and brown.

Milwaukee lays claim to several innovations – the first steel automobile frame and outboard gasoline engine (the latter courtesy of a local named Ole Evinrude), not to mention the ice-cream sundae.

The city’s also home to “sewer socialism” and the idea that the natural counter to the Industrial Revolution was to spruce up society with new sanitation systems, municipally-owned utilities, and better schools and parks.

Hillary Clinton’s challenge moving forward: convincing her party that Bernie’s socialism is a losing proposition for her party, even with the “Democratic” modifier.

And if that doesn’t work in Nevada and South Carolina?

This race will wind up in the sewer."
227,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/19/cruz-camp-responds-to-rubio-photoshop-flap-brushes-off-criticism.html,2,"Sen. Ted Cruz’s national spokesman Rick Tyler doubled-down on Friday following accusations that the campaign Photoshopped an image of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and President Obama.

“Every picture in a political campaign is Photoshopped,” Tyler told Fox News. “It is absolutely true.”

When pressed repeatedly by host Martha McCallum about why the campaign Photoshopped a picture of Rubio and Obama shaking hands in a picture on a website produced by the Cruz campaign, Tyler instead took aim at Rubio’s record.

“Marco Rubio and Barack Obama have shaken hands. There are plenty of photos of him shaking hands,” he said. “If they don’t like the picture we picked, then send me a picture they like of Marco Rubio shaking hands with Barack Obama and we’ll swap it out.”

The website, which features other digitally altered images of the Florida senator, offers visitors the chance to take a “stand against Rubio,” with a link to Ted Cruz’s get-out-the-vote site.

""This is a disturbing pattern, they are making stuff up every day,"" Rubio told reporters Thursday.

Rubio senior advisor Todd Harris said the body shown in the image in question is ""not Rubio.""

“This person, we don’t know who that is, but they Photoshopped Marco’s face onto somebody else. This is how phony and how deceitful the Cruz campaign has become.”

The campaign says the original image, apparently reversed, was from a stock photograph."
228,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/18/republicans-have-weapon-to-stop-obama-recess-appointment.html,2,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is bent on refusing to consider any nominee President Obama may submit to succeed late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. And if he doesn’t give ground, Obama may have only one option for an end-run: a recess appointment.

But Republicans can rest easy: GOP leaders have an ace up their sleeve.

The truth is, it doesn’t take much to prevent a recess appointment, as long as congressional leaders are watching the calendar. Closely.

If you’re trying to block the president from making one to the Supreme Court, all the Senate has to do is commence a session every three days. Because the Senate is only truly in recess after that three-day period.

The Constitution actually requires the House and Senate to meet every three days unless there’s an agreement between the two bodies to skip, and go on recess. With the battle over a Supreme Court pick heating up, don’t expect that to happen in the near future.

All McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., have to do is schedule what are called “pro-forma” sessions at three-day intervals for the rest of the year. Pro-forma sessions are brief meetings of the House and Senate, lasting but a minute or two – and sometimes, a matter of seconds. They help the House and Senate comport with the constitutional mandate of huddling every three days – even if they aren’t really doing anything.

The House and Senate don’t conduct any business during these confabs. In congressional parlance, they’re sometimes referred to as just “gavel-in, gavel-out.” No votes. No speeches. Few words are uttered at all.

The phrase “pro-forma” is derived from Latin, meaning “formality.”

Congress doesn’t consider itself adjourned or on recess if it’s “meeting” every three days. And that’s all it takes to block a recess appointment for the rest of the president’s term.

In 2011 and 2012, Democrats still controlled the Senate. But Republicans ran the show in the House. The GOP-controlled House refused to agree to an adjournment resolution in an effort to block Obama from scuttling a Senate filibuster of his nominees to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Thus, the House and Senate met every three days.

In early 2012, the president made four recess appointments in the window between the three-day pro-forma sessions. But the Supreme Court later voided those appointments. The court said that was the point of the three-day sessions. The Senate was indeed in session. The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 against the administration’s brazen attempt to slip in appointments between the sessions every three days.

Ironically, Scalia, Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito wrote a concurring opinion to the NLRB case. They argued “that recess appointments will remain a powerful weapon in the President’s arsenal.” They added it was “unfortunate because the recess power is an anachronism.”

When the roles were reversed, Democrats used the same tool.

For much of the final two years of President George W. Bush’s term, the Democrat-controlled Senate met every few days to block him from making a recess appointment.

In 2003, Senate Republicans blasted minority Democrats for holding up a number of judicial nominations. Democrats had particular trouble with the nomination of Judge Bill Pryor to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Georgia. Democrats didn’t like Pryor’s views on women’s issues and homosexuality. So they filibustered Pryor.

During a summertime adjournment (not amid the three-day, pro-forma theater discussed here), Bush went around the Senate and appointed Pryor without its advice and consent.

Democrats may try to force Republicans to take that vote this summer, too. But Republicans know that the best way to prevent a recess appointment later this year is to just meet every three days.

ROMNEY’S TIMELY TRUMP TROLLING

Donald Trump argues that Mitt Romney is in no position to be asking for the 2016 Republican frontrunner’s tax returns on the grounds that Romney lost the 2012 general election. Romney is also, Trump wrote, a “dope.”

But Romney is arguably the very best Republican to be asking Trump about his tax returns given how successfully Democrats exploited Romney’s filings to alienate potential voters. Democrats essentially called Romney a tax cheat for his low rates and the attack stuck. And it is a line, in some form or another, which Democrats will be sure to repeat against the billionaire Trump if he becomes the Republican nominee.

Romney began releasing his tax returns amid pressure from his rivals in early Republican primaries in 2012. But because Trump’s rivals have neglected to actually attack the frontrunner very much, Trump is only just now being pressed on this crucial general election issue.

Romney’s troll timing is perfect. Trump is either less than a week away from starting to put the Republican nomination in the bag or facing lengthening odds in his unlikely but so-far successful quest. He is also facing tonight what promises to be his most challenging debate yet.

Trump’s detractors to this point have mostly knocked Trump for insufficient conservativeness, or flip flopping, or being of poor character. But voters primarily interested in conservative orthodoxy and personal virtue are probably not part of Trump’s long-term coalition. Trump’s voters don’t seem to care about his politics. They just want a winner.

What few have hit the frontrunner on are his business failures and the unhappy chapters of his career. His business troubles and his finances have been a long-running part of Trump’s media feuds in the past but have oddly not been part of the political discussion. It is particularly odd given how much of a focus Romney’s relatively tame business record was four years ago.

Romney’s mischievous speculation is using Trump’s tactics against Trump. When the celebrity billionaire speculated about Sen. Ted Cruz’s nativity, Sen. Marco Rubio’s sweat glands, or Ben Carson’s gifts as a teenaged knife fighter, he was doing exactly what Romney is doing now.

Whether Trump can manage to lock up his party’s nomination – which could come as soon as March 15 – without divulging his tax returns will depend on the press and his competitors. Neither has shown themselves to have much snap in their noodles when it comes to taking on Trump so far, but the hour is late and the stakes are high.

Rubio, Cruz sharpen attacks on Trump - Fox News: “Speaking at a special forum in Houston hosted by Fox News’ Megyn Kelly, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called on Republican voters Wednesday to unite around his campaign, saying that his was ‘the only campaign that can beat Donald [and] has beat Donald,’ a reference to his win in last month's Iowa caucuses…Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has finished second in each of the last two nominating contests, acknowledged that Trump was ‘the frontrunner and I’m the underdog, but I’ve been an underdog my entire life.’ Rubio added that his campaign ‘would not allow the conservative movement to be defined by a nominee who isn't a conservative.’ Rubio also took a shot at Trump, though he did not mention that candidate's name, for his remarks on Muslims.”

Trump’s resort spurned American applicants for foreign workers - NYT: “Since 2010, nearly 300 United States residents have applied or been referred for jobs as waiters, waitresses, cooks and housekeepers [at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla.]. But according to federal records, only 17 have been hired. In all but a handful of cases, Mar-a-Lago sought to fill the jobs with hundreds of foreign guest workers from Romania and other countries.”

White nationalists plump for Trump in robocalls - Daily Beast: “A xenophobic pro-Donald Trump robocall urges voters in Vermont and Minnesota not to vote for a ‘Cuban’ like Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz. The call comes from the American National PAC and is voiced by its founded William Daniel Johnson, the leader of the white nationalist American Freedom Party. ‘The white race is dying out in America and Europe because we are afraid to be called ‘racist,’ the call said. ‘I am afraid to be called racist. Donald Trump is not a racist, but Donald Trump is not afraid. Don’t vote for a Cuban. Vote for Donald Trump.’ Trump had previously disavowed the super PAC that released controversial robocalls on his behalf in Iowa.”

Why it’s still a race - RCP’s Lou Cannon explains why Trump isn’t the inevitable nominee writing that Trump’s unfavorable rating and loss of late-breaking voters means Trump still faces competition heading into Super Tuesday.

March 15: ‘Day of Reckoning’ - FiveThirtyEight: “March 15 is truly the GOP’s ‘day of reckoning,’ and Florida may be the most pivotal state on the entire calendar. If Trump defeats Rubio in his winner-take-all backyard, it would be game over. But if Rubio wins over enough of Jeb Bush’s old supporters to claim Florida’s 99-delegate jackpot, it could mark a long-awaited turning point in the race. At the very least, he could leverage such an outcome to try to prevent Trump from winning a majority of delegates by June.”

Carson wonders whether his campaign ripped off donors - The Atlantic: “For months, reporters and political operatives…have been pointing out that Ben Carson’s campaign bears many of the hallmarks of a political scam operation. Now Carson seems to agree. On CNN on Tuesday, Carson discussed his year-end staff shake-up: ‘We had people who didn't really seem to understand finances,’ a laughing Carson [said] adding, ‘or maybe they did—maybe they were doing it on purpose.’ It’s a remarkable statement—especially because he’s so blithe about it… First, many of the companies being paid millions and millions of dollars are run by top campaign officials or their friends and relations, meaning those people are making a mint. Second, many of the contributions are coming from small-dollar donors. If that money is being given by well-meaning grassroots conservatives for a campaign that’s designed not to win but to produce revenue for venders, isn’t it just a grift?”

[GOP delegate count: Trump 82; Cruz 17; Rubio 16; Kasich 6; Carson 4 (1,237 needed to win)]

Ed Note: Wednesday’s Fox First incorrectly listed Cruz’s delegate count. His number today is actually unchanged since the final tabulation of the Nevada Caucus results.



WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE

In a coral reef near Tahiti one photographer set out to capture as many species as he could in a single photograph. Smithsonian has the story: “What if you sifted through every last little organism that lives or passes through a single cubic foot of space in a day? On a coral reef? In a forest? How many species would you find? This was the question that [photographer Michael] Liittschwager wanted to answer—and photograph. He came up with the idea of a biocube; his proposed standard for sampling biodiversity. A 12-inch cube that he would set in one place and observe long enough to catalog everything within it. He started on Mo’ore’a [an island off Tahiti], but has since brought his biocube method to many locations around the world.”

HILLARY KNOCKS BERNIE ON GUNS IN FIGHT FOR BLACK VOTES

USA Today: “Hillary Clinton’s gun-control offensive against Bernie Sanders in South Carolina will provide the template she follows in upcoming state contests with sizable African-American electorates. Two days in a row this week, Clinton campaigned with mothers who’ve lost children to gun violence, including Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin. Her campaign also cut a new web video and held a conference call highlighting Sen. Bernie Sanders’ record on guns, including his support of the so-called Charleston loophole, which allowed Dylann Roof to acquire a firearm before completing a background check.”

Colorado caucus good for Bernie, superdelegates to Hillary - Denver Post: “The stakes in Colorado are significant for both campaigns, offering Sanders an opportunity to showcase the energy behind his campaign and giving Clinton a chance to demonstrate that her sizable organization can deliver votes…The caucus system mostly favors Sanders, as it gives an outsized voice to the most motivated party activists, who will gather at 7 p.m. for 3,010 precinct meetings that start the delegate-selection process…In the end, at the state and congressional district conventions in April, Colorado will award 66 delegates — in addition to the 12 superdelegates, most of whom are committed to Clinton.”

[Democratic delegate count: Clinton 505; Sanders 71 (2,382 needed to win)]

THE JUDGE’S RULING: APPLE VS. DOJ

Fox News’ Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano argues that the Department of Justice has no authority to force Apple to give them the ability to unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino terrorists, and says DOJ already has the information they’re seeking: “The DOJ knows where this data on this killer’s cellphone can be found, but if it subpoenas the NSA, and the NSA complies with that subpoena, and all this becomes public, that will put the lie to the government’s incredible denials that it spies upon all of us all the time. Surely it was spying on the San Bernardino killers.” Read here.

Cambridgeshire pair Gerry Cannings, 63, and wife Lisa, 48, matched their numbers in the draw held on 13 February but delayed the collection of their winnings for a week…Mrs Cannings, a school teacher, explained why the couple took a week to come forward to claim the prize. She said: ‘I know it sounds mad but we had a guy in to paint the whole house. We’d been planning it for ages and had packed everything into boxes. We just thought it would be easier to wait, although it did mean that Gerry had to carry round the winning ticket in his wallet all week. It was very nerve-wracking.’”

Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and John Kasich all pledged to support the eventual nominee. And Trump, who has occasionally threatened to mount an independent bid, also vowed, “Yes, I will” support the nominee.

The moment of unity in Detroit was a break from the otherwise tense and personal debate. At other times, the Republican front-runner repeatedly was challenged, by the moderators and his rival candidates, on his alleged inconsistencies.

Trump defended his statements, one after another – for instance, saying “I changed my tune” from welcoming Middle East refugees to suggesting the U.S. can’t take them, after learning new information.

“I have a very strong core,"" he said, while adding: “I have never seen a successful person who wasn’t flexible.”

But his rivals argued this “flexibility” raises questions about whether Trump really would deliver on his promises.

“There’s a difference between flexibility and telling people whatever you think you need to say to get them to do what you want them to do,” Rubio charged, claiming once again that Trump is “trying to con people.”

Ohio Gov. Kasich, without naming Trump directly, suggested voters are tired of politicians telling them “what they want to hear” and not delivering.

At other times, Trump was kept busy swatting down attacks on his character, his readiness to be president and his business record.

“He has spent a career convincing Americans he’s something that he’s not in exchange for their money,"" Rubio said of the front-runner.

“This little guy has lied so much about my record,” Trump answered. “... You haven’t employed in your life one person. I’ve employed tens of thousands of people.”

The sustained attempt by the three other candidates to challenge Trump’s authenticity comes as they scramble to disrupt his march to the nomination – following the Super Tuesday contests where Trump padded his sizeable delegate lead.

Once again, the debate saw Cruz and Rubio hitting Trump from both sides – including pressuring him to release a reportedly secret tape of him speaking bluntly about his immigration policies to the New York Times editorial board.

Trump said he’s not going to release the tape. He admitted he’s “changing” and “softening” his position on certain visas for highly skilled workers, but said he’s also “not very flexible” on his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Cruz called the Times tape issue “troubling” and questioned whether he told the editorial board he doesn’t believe what he says on immigration.

“You can resolve this issue very quickly by simply releasing the New York Times tape,” he said, questioning whether he’s “lying” to the public.

“You’re the liar,” Trump said. “I’ve given my answer, lyin’ Ted.”

Trump also tangled with Cruz after accusing Cruz of being the primary supporter of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.

Cruz rejected the claim, and when Trump tried to interrupt, said, “Breathe, breathe, breathe.”

Rubio quipped, “When they’re done with the yoga” -- and when brushed off by Cruz, added: “Well, [Trump is] very flexible, so you never know.”

Trump also moved to deflect criticism about his former Trump University, which is the subject of several court cases. He called them a “minor civil case” he could settle.

This led to another tense exchange with Cruz, who said, “Donald, learn not to interrupt … count to 10.”

Kasich, meanwhile, defended his campaign, claiming he’ll turn it around soon – and would earn “crossover votes” in a general election.

Cruz also confronted Trump over his past financial contributions to Hillary Clinton’s campaigns – challenging his decision to send four checks for her 2008 presidential bid.

“Why did you write checks to Hillary Clinton to be president in 2008?” Cruz asked. “It wasn’t for business.”

Trump countered, though, that “it was for business.”

“We’re doing many, many deals outside of the United States,” Trump said, justifying his donations to Clinton’s 2008 campaign.

But he said he also supported Ronald Reagan and other Republicans and maintained that the “last person” Clinton wants to face in November is him.

Trump faced off Thursday against a narrowing field of Republican rivals, as his battle with the GOP ‘establishment’ hit new levels of intensity. Just hours earlier, 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney ended any semblance of sitting this one out and delivered a scathing speech against Trump’s candidacy. The address, in which Romney called Trump a “phony” who would sink the country into recession, underscored how divided the party truly is over Trump’s rise.

Trump, at the top of the debate, hit back at Romney,, calling him an “embarrassment” and asserting he’s just trying to get “back in the game.”

“He was a failed candidate. He should have beaten President Obama very easily,” Trump said. “I guess he wants to be relevant.”

Rubio, meanwhile, defended his shift to leveling personal attacks at Trump – which he started doing at the most recent debate.

“Donald Trump has basically mocked everybody with personal attacks,” he said. “If there’s anyone who’s ever deserved to be attacked that way, it’s Donald Trump.”

Rubio, though, said he’s ready to get back to the issues.

Trump then made an off-color joke when responding to Rubio’s jab at his supposedly small hands.

“He hit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. .. If they’re small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there’s no problem.”

Despite resistance to Trump from senior GOP figures, Super Tuesday showed primary voters once again breaking in huge numbers for Trump’s campaign – delivering him seven state victories out of 11 and building his already-substantial delegate lead over his rivals.

The field thinned again after Super Tuesday, with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson saying he sees no path to the nomination and – while stopping short of suspending his campaign – sitting out Thursday’s debate in Detroit.

Each of the remaining candidates is continuing to campaign, undeterred by Trump’s dominance on Super Tuesday and his delegate lead.

Cruz won three states, including his home state of Texas, on Tuesday. Rubio won his first, in Minnesota. Kasich has not won any, but is banking on his home state’s primary on March 15.

Cruz has openly applied pressure on the two other candidates to consider dropping out, arguing that he is the only candidate who can take on Trump in the remaining primary contests.

Rubio, though, has enjoyed substantial support from fellow GOP lawmakers and is banking on a comeback in his home state on March 15 as well."

Republicans are caucusing in Kansas, Kentucky and Maine, while Democrats are caucusing in Kansas and Nebraska. Republicans and Democrats also are voting Saturday in the Louisiana primary.

Maine Democrats caucus on Sunday, while voters in both parties go to the polls in the Puerto Rico primary.

Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz is hoping to do well in Kansas, Kentucky and Maine caucuses, and the Louisiana primary. A good showing would help him secure his position as the No. 2 GOP candidate ahead of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. But neither appears to have a path toward winning enough delegates or the nomination.

""Being a conservative cannot just be about how loud you're willing to scream ... or about how many names you call people,"" Rubio said Saturday at CPAC, the annual gathering of conservatives, just outside of Washington.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s only primary competitor, is favored to win the Kansas and Nebraska caucuses.

Clinton’s campaign manager braced supporters for the potential setback in a memo Wednesday that suggested the former secretary of state may lose the caucus states this weekend.

“Sen. Sanders has clear advantages and is investing heavily in two upcoming caucuses (Kansas and Nebraska),” Robby Mook wrote in a memo.

In total, 109 Democratic delegates are up for grabs, while Republicans are competing for 155.

Clinton leads Sanders 1,066 to 432 in the delegate race. Either needs 4,763 to win the party nomination.

On the Republican side, Trump leads with 329 delegates, followed by 231 for Cruz, 110 for Rubio and 25 for Kasich. The GOP canidate needs 2,472 to win the nomination, with increasing talk, particularly within the GOP establishment, about having a so-called “broker convention” to stop Trump’s insurgent candidacy.

Trump has won in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia.

Cruz has won in Iowa, Alaska, Oklahoma, Texas and now Kansas. Rubio won Minnesota on Super Tuesday earlier this week.

Republican candidate Ben Carson, meanwhile, suspended his campaign on Friday.

""We are going to make America great again,"" Trump said at a rally Saturday afternoon in Wichita, Kansas, sticking with his signature campaign slogan.

He also tried to appeal to heart land voters with his so-far wining message of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, restoring America's military might and repealing and replacing ObamaCare.

""You premiums are going up like a rocket ship,"" Trump said to cheers from the packed rally.""

Trump late went to north Orlando, Florida, for a rally ahead of the state’s March 15 winner-take-all primary that is considered a must-win for Rubio. A win in Florida and Ohio, another take-all March 15 primary, would be a huge step toward Trump winning the nomination.

On Friday, Trump pulled out of CPAC. Trump had been scheduled to speak at the four-day gathering but said he would be campaigning instead in Kansas and Florida. Florida holds its primaries on March 15.

CPAC organizers suggested they cancelled Trump’s appearance because he wouldn't take questions, a format all invited candidates were asked to follow.

“Guess what, tomorrow is an election,” a Trump spokeswoman said Friday, giving her explanation about why the candidate won’t attend the event.

The CPAC controversy follows a raucous Fox News Republican debate Thursday night in Detroit in which Cruz, Rubio and Kasich teamed up against Trump to cast him as a political salesman willing to say anything and take any position to win the nomination.

They hammered him on alleged inconsistences on his policy details and business dealings, including the now-defunct Trump University, which is being sued for scamming students out of thousands of dollars."
232,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/03/05/trump-cruz-keep-on-winning-four-reasons-why-super-saturday-matters.html,2,"After Super Tuesday and Thursday’s candidate brawl at the 11th GOP presidential debate, let’s call this latest experiment in democracy “Stop-by Saturday” – four states in the northeast, southeast and Midwest holding GOP primaries and caucuses.

A very big vote awaits the four remaining Republican candidates Tuesday in Michigan, followed a week later by winner-take-all primaries in Florida and Ohio. The field may be down to just two candidates after that.

Still, what transpired Saturday in Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Maine mattered for these four reasons:

1. Trump’s Fertile(?) Ground. One thing we’ve learned about Donald Trump and his flying circus: there are plenty of states amenable to his message of economic frustration and rage against the political machine.

That includes Maine, which caucused on Saturday – and, going into Saturday, was presumably Trump Territory.

After years of economic decline in the form of a shrinking manufacturing base, Down Easterners now face the question of whether to encourage immigration to meet growing employment demands.

Twice in the last six years, the state’s chosen the bombastic Paul LePage as its governor. He has a Chris Christie-like style of bully politics and a Trump-like way with political incorrectness (for example, earlier this year blaming Maine’s heroin epidemic on “guys by the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty”).

The point: the seeds for Trump’s success may have sown well before he plowed the 2016 field.

However, in Maine, Trump came a cropper (though he did claim Kentucky and Louisiana, for a split decision on the night). Credit Texas Sen. Ted Cruz with out-organizing Trump in yet another small, rural-tinged caucus.

But with primaries now taking over from caucuses, are these latest returns a sign of coming attractions or just a bad stretch of road for the Trump Express?

2. Trump’s a Frontrunner, but not a Conservative Favorite. All four states on Saturday had closed primaries or caucuses, which meant that only Republicans were eligible to vote (in Maine, independents could do same-day GOP registration; otherwise, voters had to come over to the Republican side weeks before the polls opened).

Before Saturday, Trump had dominated in a February and Super Tuesday heavy with states employing “open” voting rules. Iowa, Nevada, Alaska and Oklahoma were the only closed affairs – Trump’s batted one-for-four (you can expect talk about frontloading more closed primaries and minimizing if not eliminating open primaries when the GOP turns to 2020 planning).

This made Kansas, in particular, worth watching as both Trump and Cruz worked the state hard immediately after Super Tuesday.

Going into the Jayhawk caucuses, this Trafalgar Group poll had Trump up by 6 points over Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (35.2percent-29.3 percent), with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio a distant third (16.6 percent).

Saturday’s results: Cruz 48percent, Trump 23 percent.

Granted, Stop-by-Saturday polling was scarce, but this time the swollen turnout (in Kansas it was up by 50 percent over 2012), absent Democratic and independent crossovers, didn’t break Trump’s way.

Between Trump’s setbacks in Kansas and Maine and Cruz’s victory in the CPAC straw poll, we seem to have a paradox: the Republican frontrunner is not a conservative favorite.

3. The Delegate Math. The four states offered a combined 155 delegates – that’s the same exact number as Texas, 10 fewer than Florida/Ohio and 17 fewer than California. Moving forward, fewer than 1,600 of the GOP’s 2,474 delegates are still up for grabs.

Saturday’s results aren’t a game-changer, but they do factor into a Trump march to the nomination that’s long or short depending on the candidate’s ability to gobble up winner-take-all states and increase his delegate share in proportional outcomes (that may increase if it’s just Trump and Cruz going at it).

And there’s one other GOP convention equation. Which would be . . .

4. Adding Up To Eight. The other reason why Kansas and Maine mattered for Cruz: the GOP rule that only candidates with a majority of delegates in a minimum of eight states can qualify for the convention’s nominating ballot (the party can always change this before the nominating begins, but to do so would be contentious – if not downright ugly).

Cruz now has six such states. The better question, how the math adds up for Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

If Rubio wins Florida, that brings his total to two states (he won Minnesota on Super Tuesday). If Kasich carries his home state, that brings his total to…one.

How does either candidate get to eight, given that only 19 states remain after March 15?

That’s not the only question after Saturday’s vote. Here are four more:

- Will this soon be a two-man race between Trump and Cruz?

- Does that improve or harm Trump’s chance of a first-ballot win in Cleveland?

- Do Rubio and/or Kasich find redemption on their home turf?

- The more Republicans flail about, is Hillary Clinton suddenly living a charmed political existence?

On a Saturday night like March 5, when the race takes yet another odd twist, those answers still seem far away."

But the Democratic front-runner fought back, blasting him for voting against the auto bailout, dismissing him as a “one-issue candidate” and hitting him once again for his stance on guns.

The Vermont senator reached back to the 1990s as he went after Clinton’s support for “disastrous trade agreements” like NAFTA. His rhetoric was notably more pointed and, reflecting the tension in the race, Sanders even cut her off at times as she tried to speak over him.

“Excuse me, I’m talking,” Sanders snapped, during one feisty exchange on the economy.

But Clinton pushed back, and defended the country’s economic progress during her husband’s administration.

“If we’re going to argue about the ‘90s, let’s try to get the facts straight,” she said, touting the jobs and income growth that came with the era.

Sanders also tried to cast Clinton as soft on climate change, while declaring he unequivocally does not support fracking. Clinton maintained she has the “most comprehensive plan to combat climate change.”

The clashes came after Sanders won the Maine Democratic caucuses, adding to wins the night before in Nebraska and Kansas — by far the most successful two days of his campaign.

But Sanders remains significantly behind in the race for delegates, with Clinton having won more – and more valuable – state contests, as well as enjoying the overwhelming support of so-called “superdelegates.” Sanders is looking for a game-changer as the race heads next to states like Michigan this coming Tuesday, and Ohio and Florida the week after that.

Sanders cited his most recent wins at the end of Sunday’s debate, in arguing he would be the better candidate to go up against Republican front-runner Donald Trump.

He began to joke he’d give his “right arm” to run against the billionaire businessman and then cited polls saying, “Sanders versus Trump does a lot better than Clinton versus Trump.”

But while Sanders said he’s “exciting” working-class and young voters, Clinton pointed to the raw numbers.

“There’s only one candidate [in either primary campaign] who has more votes than [Trump], and that’s me,” Clinton said. “I will look forward to engaging him.”

With the CNN-hosted debate held in Michigan, the state’s economic and crime problems were front and center.

On gun control, the two candidates sparred sharply, with Clinton using the Sandy Hook massacre to make a point about holding gun makers responsible for crimes – and Sanders arguing that position would effectively mean an America without guns.

The dispute started when Sanders defended his past support for a bill to help protect gun manufacturers and sellers from lawsuits. He said if gun sellers and makers are held liable in many of these cases, “What you’re really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America.”

Clinton countered that no other industry in America has “absolute immunity,” and invoked the Sandy Hook mass shooting.

The Democratic rivals were most heated when talking about their respective records on the economy. Sanders went after Clinton over what he called “disastrous trade agreements” like NAFTA.

She countered by pointing out he opposed the auto industry bailout. He tried to describe it as the Wall Street bailout, and got a little feisty when she started to speak over him.

“Excuse me, I’m talking,” he said. “Your story is for voting for every disastrous trade agreement.”

Clinton then called him a “one-issue candidate.” And on the auto bailout, she said, “If everybody had voted the way he did, I believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking 4 million jobs with it.”

“My one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class. That’s my one issue,” Sanders said.

Meanwhile, at the top of the debate, Clinton and Sanders momentarily set aside their differences, to lament the plight of the people in the host city of Flint, and call for the governor’s resignation over the toxic water crisis.

Sanders said there’s “blame to go around” but Republican Gov. Rick Snyder should resign.

Clinton echoed the remarks, saying, “Amen to that.”

“The governor should resign or be recalled,” she said, while also calling on the federal and state governments to send more money to the city.

The city’s water crisis started when the city switched to the Flint River in 2014 while under a state-appointed emergency manager. While the state has taken much of the blame, officials with the city and federal government – as well as the state – have also resigned.

Clinton faced Sanders on the debate stage as she fights to shake her lone primary rival, who keeps notching just enough primary and caucus wins to keep his campaign alive, and a threat to her bid.

Sanders rode to victory in Maine in part on a huge turnout — Sanders beat Clinton by a ratio of nearly 2-to-1. The turnout was so big Sunday that some voters had to wait in line for more than four hours in Portland.

The victory gives Sanders a total of three victories over the weekend to Clinton’s one, in the Louisiana primary.

The results from Maine Sunday aren't binding, but will be used to select a slate of delegates to the state convention, where national delegates will be elected. Maine will send 25 delegates and 30 superdelegates.

On Super Tuesday last week, Clinton won seven states to Sanders’ four. She maintains a sizeable delegate lead – which before the Maine contest stood at 1,121 to 481. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the nomination.

But Sanders, even by winning lower-profile contests, has managed to at least demonstrate lingering weaknesses in the front-runner’s campaign as he draws an enthusiastic response in the grassroots-driven caucus states. Sanders sees upcoming Midwestern primaries as a crucial opportunity to slow her momentum by highlighting his trade policies – though Clinton has led in the polls in Michigan.

“Geographically, we’re looking good,” Sanders said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “We have a path.”

Sanders acknowledged his campaign has yet to connect with African-American voters, which hurt him badly in his South Carolina loss last month to Clinton.

However, he told ABC, “I think you’re going to see those numbers change.”

Squeezed between high-profile Super Tuesday and high-stakes primaries next week in Florida and Ohio, Tuesday's contests are unlikely to dramatically reshape either party's primaries. But with 150 Republican and 179 Democratic delegates at stake, the races offer an opportunity for the front-runners to pad leads and rivals to catch up.

In addition to Michigan's primaries, both parties will hold their primary in Mississippi Tuesday, with Republicans also caucusing in Idaho and voting in the Hawaii primary.

But Michigan is the night's crown jewel in terms of delegates. Fifty-nine are at stake in the Republican race, while 130 will be awarded on the Democratic side.

While Trump has stunned Republicans with his broad appeal, he's forged a particularly strong connection with blue-collar white voters. With an eye on the general election, he's argued he could put Midwestern, Democratic-leaning industrial states such as Michigan and Wisconsin in play for Republicans.

A Monmouth University poll released Monday showed Trump winning 36 percent of likely GOP primary voters, 13 percentage points ahead of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who said Michigan was part of his ""home court"" last week, polled a close third with 21 percent of the vote, while Florida Sen. Marco Rubio placed fourth with 13 percent of the likely vote.

Victories by Cruz in Kansas and Maine have threatened to make the Republican race a two-man sprint to the finish. But Kasich and Rubio are holding out hope they can win their winner-take-all home states March 15.

Entering Tuesday, Trump leads the Republican race with 384 delegates, followed by Cruz with 300, Rubio with 151 delegates and Kasich with 37. Winning the GOP nomination requires 1,237 delegates.

""It's not just the whole country that's watching Michigan — now the world's beginning to watch,"" Kasich said Monday during a campaign stop in the state. ""You can help me send a message about positive, about vision, about hope, about putting us together.""

Rubio sought a boost in Tuesday's contests from Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. Romney has recently become an outspoken critic of Trump and recorded a phone call on Rubio's behalf in which he warns Republicans that if the real estate mogul wins the nomination, ""the prospects for a safe and prosperous future would be greatly diminished.""

Romney has not endorsed a candidate in the GOP primary, but clearly says in the phone recording that he's speaking on behalf of the Rubio campaign. A Romney spokeswoman said the former Massachusetts governor has offered to help Rubio, Kasich and Cruz in any way he can.

During a stop at a catfish restaurant on Monday in Mississippi, Cruz said the current vacancy on the Supreme Court means Republicans can't take a chance on Trump.

""He's been supporting left-wing politicians for 40 years,"" Cruz said.

On the Democratic side, Clinton boosted her delegate lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders over the weekend, as a win in Saturday's Louisiana primary canceled out wins for Sanders in the Kansas, Nebraska and Maine caucuses. The Monmouth University poll gave Clinton a 13-percentage point lead over the self-described democratic socialist among likely voters.

Ahead of Tuesday's two Democratic contests, Clinton had accumulated 1,130 delegates and Sanders 499, including superdelegates. Democrats need 2,383 delegates to win the nomination.

In an effort to boost his standing in Michigan, Sanders has repeatedly accused Clinton of being disingenuous when she asserted that he opposed the bailout of carmakers General Motors and Chrysler during the Great Recession.

Sanders defended his voting record on the issue again during a Fox News town hall in Detroit Monday night.

""What I did not vote for was the bailout of Wall Street. … She did vote for that,” Sanders said, referring to Clinton’s time as a New York senator.

Sanders and Clinton both voted in favor of an auto bailout bill in 2008, but it failed to clear the Senate, prompting then-President George W. Bush to announce about a week later that the federal government would step in with $17.4 billion in federal aid to help the carmakers survive and restructure. The last $4 billion was contingent on the release of the second installment of the Wall Street bailout funds.

Sanders did vote for a 2009 motion to block the release of those funds, though the measure was defeated by 45 Democrats, including Clinton, and a handful of Republicans.

235,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/14/new-polls-show-rubio-trailing-in-florida-kasich-in-dogfight-to-win-ohio.html,2,"New polls show Sen. Marco Rubio trailing Donald Trump badly in his home state of Florida – even dropping to third place behind Ted Cruz in one – while Ohio Gov. John Kasich, too, is locked in a dogfight with the Republican primary front-runner in his home state ahead of crucial primaries Tuesday.

The latest Marist/NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump dominating Rubio with a double-digit lead in Florida, 43-22 percent. The same poll shows Cruz essentially tied with Rubio, at 21 percent. A separate CBS News 2016 Battleground Tracker poll shows Rubio slipping behind Cruz.

Meanwhile, in Ohio, a Marist survey shows Kasich holding the edge in the Buckeye State with 39 percent to Trump’s 33 percent. The latest Quinnipiac poll shows Trump and Kasich tied in Ohio, with 38 percent each.

The primaries in Ohio and Florida, among five Tuesday, are essentially a must-win for both Kasich and Rubio, respectively – both of whom significantly trail front-runner Trump and Texas Sen. Cruz in the delegate count.

Rubio’s drop in the polls appears to be another indication that his campaign might soon come to an end.

On Sunday, he continued to criticize the violence at Trump rallies, saying the candidate and protesters share the blame.

""You have a leading contender for president telling people in his audience, ‘Go ahead and punch someone in the face. I'll pay your legal bills,’ ” Rubio said in Florida. “That's wrong if our kids did it. That is disastrous if a president does it.” He has also acknowledged that some of the protesters appeared to be paid.

The CBS News 2016 Battleground Tracker poll showed Rubio falling even further.

It showed Trump -- who has several, popular golf-resort properties in Florida -- maintaining his lead in the state’s winner-take-all primary, in which 99 delegates are at stake.

The billionaire businessman has 44 percent of the vote among registered voters in the state, compared with Cruz at 24 percent and Rubio at 21 percent.

At a rally Sunday in Ohio, Trump tried to portray Rubio as an unpopular senator who was elected in 2010 to go to Congress but has since repeatedly missed votes to instead campaign and further his political career.

The poll, conducted by the YouGov an online polling group, shows Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the remaining GOP presidential candidate, in a dead heat in Ohio, at 33 percent. They are followed by Cruz at 27 percent and Rubio at 5 percent.

On Sunday, Trump hit Kasich at rallies, including one in the Cincinnati area, for voting as a congressman in favor of the roughly 20-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement that critics say has taken away millions of manufacturing jobs, especially ones in so-called Rust Belt states such as Michigan, Illinois and Ohio.

Kasich faces a similar situation as Rubio, needing to win in his home state to keep his campaign headed toward the GOP convention in July.

The popular governor has repeatedly vowed that he will win Ohio and that he will drop out if he loses the primary, in which the winner gets all 66 delegates.

Trump leads the delegate count 460, followed by Cruz with 370, Rubio with 163 and Kasich, who has yet to win a primary or caucus, with 63.

The three other states on Tuesday also holding primaries are North Carolina (72 delegates), Missouri (52 delegates) and Illinois (69 delegates.)

Trump also leads in Illinois -- 38 percent, followed by Cruz at 34 percent, Kasich at 16 percent and Rubio at 11 percent.

CBS said the numbers suggest Cruz is “emerging more generally in the minds of many non-Trump voters as the alternative to the frontrunner.”

While an “overwhelming number” of Trump supporters described him as “authentic and not beholden to big donors,” backers also described him as “too extreme at times,” according to the poll.

On the Democratic side, frontrunner Hillary Clinton has a big lead in Florida over rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 62-to-34 percent, according to the CBS poll.

However, she leads Sanders by single-digits in Ohio, 52-to-43 percent, the poll show. And Sanders has a narrow 48-46 percent lead in Illinois.

Early voting in Florida's primary comes to an end Sunday, with more than 1.9 million voters having already made their presidential choice.

Republican voters far outnumber Democratic ones, according to the latest figures released Sunday by the state Division of Elections.

Republicans account for more than 1.1 million early voters, while about 819,000 Democrats have cast ballots.

Early voters are projected to account for at least half the total number expected to vote in Tuesday's primary.

Florida's closed primary is open only to those registered to one of the major parties.

237,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/17/moving-pieces-gop-alliances-shift-in-bids-to-block-boost-trump.html?intcmp=hplnws,2,"Donald Trump’s emergence as the big fish in a now-tiny pool of three remaining Republican presidential candidates has touched off a remarkable scramble by political powerbrokers to quickly choose sides, all while talk of a potential independent run isn’t going away.

The feverish effort to either boost or block Trump is leading to unexpected alliances as some hitch their name to the GOP front-runner, and others do whatever they can to try and thwart him. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a former candidate who previously had backed Jeb Bush, was the latest surprise, announcing Thursday he’s now banking on Ted Cruz.

Graham bluntly acknowledged he prefers Ohio Gov. John Kasich – but said only Texas Sen. Cruz has a path to defeating Trump in the primary.

“If we give the banner of the Republican Party to Donald Trump, we tarnish it, maybe, forever. That might be the end of the Republican Party as we know it,” warned Graham, who plans to hold a fundraiser for the Texas senator.

On the sidelines, a trio of conservative leaders also held a meeting in Washington Thursday to discuss a “stop-Trump” strategy. As first reported by Politico, Erick Erickson, the founder of RedState.com, was joined by former adviser to President George. W. Bush Bill Wichterman, and South Dakota businessman Bob Fischer.

Erickson told Fox News on Thursday the meeting was attended by conservative activists who see the Trump candidacy as a threat to the conservative cause. “Contrary to what the Trump campaign says, it wasn’t the elite. … It was the guys who have been knocking on doors for Republican candidates for decades – people who are actually committed to conservative principles ahead of the party,” he said.

This chaotic phase of the primary race is making for some strange bedfellows.

Graham, for instance, previously had taken to trashing Cruz in interviews. He told CNN last month the senator might be worse than President Obama and if the GOP choice is between Trump and Cruz, ""it's the difference between poisoned or shot -- you're still dead.""

Now, Graham is setting those misgivings aside as the prospect of Trump winning the nomination becomes increasingly likely.

Even Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, while stopping short of an endorsement, reportedly said Wednesday that Cruz is the “only conservative left in the race.” Back on Capitol Hill Thursday, Rubio said “there is still time to stop a Trump presidency.” Meanwhile, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who had backed Rubio, says she’s now rooting for Cruz.

At the Erickson meeting, among the options reportedly being discussed was sending a last-minute candidate to the convention in Cleveland if no candidate reaches the coveted 1,237 delegates and the convention is deadlocked.

He told Fox News the biggest consensus point was that both Trump and Hillary Clinton are unacceptable candidates for the presidency. Regarding a strategy to defeat Trump, he said “the consensus was that everyone would rather settle this on the convention floor at the Republican convention in Cleveland.”

Though the main strategy is to use convention rules and delegate math to deny Trump the nomination, Erickson did not rule out a last-minute effort to run an independent candidate if Trump ultimately wins the nomination in Cleveland.

The meeting comes just days after Trump won at least three states, including Florida’s 99 delegate winner-take-all contest, and declared victory in a fourth, Missouri.

Before Tuesday, Cruz also had ex-candidates Rick Perry and Carly Fiorina in his corner.

But even as Cruz gains additional support, Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are gaining new backers.

Trump already had the endorsements of former candidates Chris Christie and Ben Carson. He added to that the support this week of Florida Gov. Rick Scott.

“Donald Trump is clearly the will of the voters. We need to listen to them, coalesce behind him,” Scott told Fox News.

And Kasich has picked up support from Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, as well as from former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt. Utah votes next week, alongside Arizona.

“Governor John Kasich had a decisive and critical win in Ohio,” Leavitt said in a statement. “I trust his temperament and the tone of his campaign. I worked closely with Governor Kasich over many years and I have witnessed his ability to bring people together to get things done. I think he has the best opportunity to beat Hillary Clinton.”

While Trump vows he will eventually win the nomination, party leaders are unsure whether he might enter the convention with the requisite 1,237 delegates. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday it’s becoming more likely that the convention will be open.

But Trump could still emerge the nominee at a contested convention.

Former Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News on Thursday that the talk of a contested convention is only complicating the process. He said Trump and Cruz have 80 percent of the delegates and any insurgent candidate from the establishment would be taken down by the two.

“It’s an amusing parlor game, it has no meaning in the real world,” Gingrich said. “If they want to form the let’s elect Hillary Clinton club, fine.”

There was yet another reported plot to thwart Trump. Earlier in the month, it was reported that Bush met with Rubio, Cruz, and Kasich individually before last Thursday’s debate in Miami. Rubio’s spokesperson then urged his supporters to vote for Kasich in Ohio, a state he won.

Additionally, Cruz pulled advertising and campaign staffers from both Florida and Ohio.

Trump, meanwhile, continues to face a string of controversies. He was scolded by Ryan on Thursday after saying there could be “riots” if he’s not chosen at the convention. The Daily Caller also reported that a Trump op-ed published in a Guam publication appeared to be partly plagiarized from an op-ed from Carson published in a Northern Mariana Islands publication."
238,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/16/obama-reportedly-to-make-supreme-court-nomination-as-early-as-wednesday.html?intcmp=hpbt2,2,"President Obama named federal appeals judge Merrick Garland on Wednesday as his pick to succeed Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court – setting up a showdown with Republicans who have vowed to block the choice.

Obama, who said he went through a rigorous and comprehensive screening process, said Garland would bring “integrity, modesty and an even-handedness” to the Supreme Court.

“I said I would take this process seriously, and I did,” Obama said at the Rose Garden ceremony.

Yet within minutes, Republicans doubled down on their opposition to confirming any nominee in an election year, insisting that the vacant seat not be filled until a new president is sworn in.

“It is a president’s constitutional right to nominate a Supreme Court justice and it is the Senate’s constitutional right to act as a check on a president and withhold its consent,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor.

Obama, anticipating the swift resistance, urged Republicans to reconsider, adding it would be unprecedented for Garland not to at least get a hearing.

“I hope they’re fair. That’s all,” Obama said. “To give him a fair hearing and up or down vote.”

Obama said earlier Wednesday that it was both his “constitutional duty to nominate a justice and one of the most important decisions that I – or any president – will make.”

He added, “I’m doing my job. I hope that our senators will do their jobs, and move quickly to consider my nominee.”

A Senate confirmation is required for any nominee to join the bench.

Before the announcement, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, also told Fox News that neither he nor his GOP colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee would back down and declared once more he would stop the nomination from going forward.

Data curated by InsideGov

“We’ve been clear,” Lee said of his plan to reject Garland’s nomination.

Garland has served under both Republicans and Democrats. He clerked for the court’s liberal icon, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. In 1997, 32 Republicans voted in favor of his nomination, including seven who are still members of the Senate.

Garland was mentioned as a possible nominee when Justice Paul Stevens retired in 2010.

The vacancy ultimately went to Justice Elena Kagan.

Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democratic leader, called Garland's section, ""a bipartisan choice,"" adding: ""If the Republicans can't support him, who can they support?""

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who spoke to Obama Wednesday morning, said in brief remarks on the Senate floor that Republicans must act on the president's choice. ""He's doing his job this morning, they should do theirs,"" said the Nevada Democrat.

If confirmed, Garland would be expected to align with the more liberal members, but he is not viewed as down-the-line liberal. Particularly on criminal defense and national security cases, he's earned a reputation as centrist, and one of the few Democratic-appointed judges Republicans might have fast-tracked to confirmation -- under other circumstances.

But in the current climate, Garland remains a tough sell. Republicans control the Senate, which must confirm any nominee, and GOP leaders want to leave the choice to the next president, denying Obama a chance to alter the ideological balance of the court before he leaves office next January. Republicans contend that a confirmation fight in an election year would be too politicized.

Ahead of Obama's announcement, the Republican Party set up a task force that will orchestrate attack ads, petitions and media outreach. The aim is to bolster Senate Republicans' strategy of denying consideration of Obama's nominee. The party's chairman, Reince Priebus, described it as the GOP's most comprehensive judicial response effort ever.

On the other side, Obama allies have been drafted to run a Democratic effort that will involve liberal groups that hope an Obama nominee could pull the high court's ideological balance to the left. The effort would target states where activists believe Republicans will feel political heat for opposing hearings once Obama announced his nominee.

For Obama, Garland represents a significant departure from his past two Supreme Court choices. In nominating Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the president eagerly seized the chance to broaden the court's diversity and rebalance the overwhelming male institution. Sotomayor was the first Hispanic confirmed to the court, Kagan only the fourth woman.

Garland -- a white, male jurist with an Ivy League pedigree and career spent largely in the upper echelon of the Washington's legal elite -- breaks no barriers. At 63 years old, he would be the oldest Supreme Court nominee since Lewis Powell, who was 64 when he was confirmed in late 1971.

Presidents tend to appoint young judges with the hope they will shape the court's direction for as long as possible.

Those factors had, until now, made Garland something of a perpetual bridesmaid, repeatedly on Obama's Supreme Court lists, but never chosen.

But Garland found his moment at time when Democrats are seeking to apply maximum pressure on Republicans. A key part of their strategy is casting Republicans as knee-jerk obstructionists ready to shoot down a nominee that many in their own ranks once considered a consensus candidate. In 2010, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch called Garland ""terrific"" and said he could be confirmed ""virtually unanimously.""

The White House planned to highlight Hatch's past support, as well as other glowing comments about Garland from conservatives.

A native of Chicago and graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, Garland clerked for two appointees of Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower -- the liberal U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan Jr. and Judge Henry J. Friendly, for whom Chief Justice John Roberts also clerked.

In 1988, he gave up a plush partner's office in a powerhouse law firms to cut his teeth in criminal cases. As an assistant U.S. attorney, he joined the team prosecuting a Reagan White House aide charged with illegal lobbying and did early work on the drug case against then-D.C. Mayor Marion Barry. He held a top-ranking post in the Justice Department when he was dispatched to Oklahoma City the day after bombing at the federal courthouse to supervise the investigation. The case made his career and his reputation. He oversaw the convictions of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, and went on to supervise the investigation into Unabomber Ted Kaczynski.

President Bill Clinton first nominated him to the D.C. Circuit in 1995.

His prolonged confirmation process may prove to have prepared him for the one ahead. Garland waited 2 1/2 years to win confirmation to the appeals court. Then, as now, one of the man blocking path was Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, argued he had no quarrel with Garland's credentials, but a beef with the notion of a Democratic president trying to fill a court he argued had too many seats.

Grassley ultimately relented, although he was not one of the 32 Republicans who voted in favor of Garland's confirmation. Nor was Sen. Mitch McConnell, the other major hurdle for Garland now. The Republicans who voted in favor of confirmation are Sen. Dan Coats, Sen. Thad Cochran, Sen. Susan Collins, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Sen. Jim Inhofe, Sen. John McCain, and Sen. Pat Roberts.

Morrocan-born Najim Laachraoui, 24, was identified by law enforcement sources as one of two Islamic terrorists seen pushing suitcase bombs and wearing single ""dead man's hand"" black gloves - in a surveillance photo. The gloves are believed to have hidden detonators. A third man seen in the photo is believed to have escaped the scene and is being hunted.



Laachraoui is suspected of also making the bomb used in a blast 79 minutes later at a Brussels Metro station, as well as the explosives used to kill 130 in the the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris.

ISIS has claimed credit for Tuesday's carnage in Brussels.

The announcement came following a day of uncertainty regarding the explosives mastermind. At a midday news conference, Belgian authorities appeared not to know of his fate and he was believed to be the subject of a nationwide dragnet.

Raids on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning uncovered his suspected factory, turning up bomb-making materials in a Schaerbeek apartment, including detonators, nails and 15 kilos of acetone peroxide, a highly unstable chemical which is favored by Islamists because it's easy to make. The chemical also was found in the explosives used in the Paris attack.

Laachraoui was raised in Brussels' Schaerbeek neighborhood, a predominantly Muslim area, according to The Washington Post. He's believed to have attended a local Catholic high school where he studied electro-mechanical engineering.

Laachraoui traveled to Syria in February 2013, prosecutors said, and it was not clear when he returned to Europe.

Prosecutors have said Laachraoui played a key role in recruiting and training attackers for ISIS, according to The Wall Street Journal. He was checked by guards at the Austria-Hungary border on Sept. 9 while driving in a Mercedes with Abdeslam and one other person, Belgium's federal prosecutors said in a statement.

Using a false identity, Laachraoui also rented a house under the name of Soufiane Kayal in the Belgian town of Auvelais. That residence was allegedly used as a safe house, where prosecutors said traces of his DNA were found. That same DNA was later found on the Paris explosives. The house was searched Nov. 26.

On Monday, Van Leeuw said officials wanted to interview Laachraoui, who was ""someone who must explain himself.""

On Tuesday, coordinated terror attacks ripped through Brussels. Investigators reportedly believe attacks already being plotted were expedited in light of Abdeslam's arrest -- and word that he is cooperating with authorities.

Earlier Wednesday, two men suspected of taking part in Tuesday’s bombings were identified as Khalid and Ibrahim El-Bakraoui.

Khalid is believed to have blown himself up on the Metro, an attack which killed at least 20 and injured more than 100, while Ibrahim is believed to have been the other airport bomber. The fourth bomber, the man in the far left of the airport photo pushing a cart next to Ibrahim, has not yet been identified.

The brothers were well-known to police. In a raid Tuesday at Ibrahim's address, Van Leeuw said ""there was a paper where he described that he is insecure, that he is lost and he does not know what to do and he might end up in jail.""

Both Ibrahim and his brother were Belgian citizens and born in Brussels, authorities said.

A March 15 raid on an apartment rented by Khalid, 27, led to Friday's arrest of Paris attack suspect Salah Abdeslam after one of Abdeslam's fingerprints was discovered in the apartment. Politico Europe, citing a senior Belgian official, reported that Abdeslam was supposed to take part in Tuesday's attacks. The report did not specify what role Abdeslam would have played.

DH reported that in October 2010, Ibrahim, 30, was convicted of shooting at police with a Kalashnikov during an attempted robbery. He was sentenced to nine years in prison. In February 2011, the paper reported, Khalid was sentenced to five years' probation in connection with a string of carjackings.

Turkey said Wednesday that Ibrahim had been detained on the Syrian border last summer, and that Ankara warned Brussels officials that he was a militant before sending him home.

240,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/15/trumps-super-night-now-gop-is-betting-on-convention-chaos.html,2,"There is no longer any doubt that Donald Trump will be close to clinching the nomination by the time he arrives in Cleveland and that only an orchestrated party effort will be able to stop him.

That’s why the debate has been gradually shifting to whether Trump can be deprived of the nomination without blowing the party to smithereens.

Trump emerged from Super Duper Tuesday in a commanding position after taking Florida, knocking Marco Rubio out of the race. Rubio was a press favorite who never quite managed to get traction this year.

Trump lost Ohio to John Kasich, of course, but he is way behind in delegates. And Trump beat Ted Cruz in Illinois and North Carolina, blunting whatever momentum the senator has gotten from his occasional victories.

Trump has now won states as diverse as New Hampshire and Mississippi, Michigan and South Carolina, Ohio and Massachusetts and Nevada. He leads by 20 points in the national polls. And he had a very big day yesterday.

Yet many of the people who run and finance the Republican Party, along with many in the media, are determined to stop him.

Now it’s true that party conventions have rules, and Trump has to play by those rules if by July he has fewer than 1,237 delegates. It’s also true that there is a long history in this country of horse-trading and multiple ballots at the conventions of both parties—although it hasn’t happened since the Ford-Reagan showdown of 1976.

So you are going to hear far more than you ever wished about parliamentary procedures and Rule 40b as the various factions jockey for position.

It seems fairly evident to me that if the guy who won the most states and the most delegates is deprived of the nomination, his supporters are going to be furious. A good number of them may just stay home, and some may even vote Democratic in protest.

That’s why we’re seeing signs of a debate-within-a-debate from pundits who believe a Trump nomination would be disastrous for the GOP. They are laying the groundwork for a last-ditch defense.

Conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat takes a whack at this argument, saying the “officially neutral press” will warn about the “bad optics” of denying Trump the nomination and the “backlash” to follow.

“The less-than-democratic side of party nominations is a virtue of our system, not a flaw, and it has often been a necessary check on the passions (Trumpian or otherwise) that mass democracy constantly threatens to unleash.”

Douthat compares Trump to Barry Goldwater and George McGovern, who led their parties to historic defeats, but says The Donald is different because he’s “an authoritarian, not an ideologue.”

“So in Cleveland this summer, the men and women of the Republican Party may face a straightforward choice: Betray the large minority of Republicans who cast their votes for Trump, or betray their obligations to their country.”

Nice bit of footwork there: Yes, the GOP power brokers would anger millions of people who turned out to support Trump, but they have a higher duty to America.

I guess you could say that wheeling and dealing at a political convention is a form of democracy. But it’s a form that many voters could find abhorrent."
241,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/27/sanders-sweeps-wins-alaska-hawaii-washington-democratic-caucuses.html,2,"Sen. Bernie Sanders won nearly three dozen delegates more than Hillary Clinton Saturday in sweeping the Alaska, Washington and Hawaii Democratic presidential caucuses, but the strong, comeback victories failed to cut substantially into the front-runner's big lead.

Sanders needs to win 67 percent of the remaining delegates and uncommitted super-delegates through June to clinch the Democratic nomination. And so far he's winning only 37 percent.

There were 162 delegates at stake Saturday -- Washington with 101, followed by Hawaii with 25 and Alaska with 16.

The Vermont senator won 55 delegates, compared to 20 for Clinton. However, more will likely be allocated to Sanders in several weeks, when the Washington state Democratic Party releases vote shares by district.

Still, Clinton still maintains a wide advantage in delegates, winning 1,243 to Sanders' 975 based on primary and caucuses to date.

Her lead is even bigger when including super-delegates, or party officials who can back any candidate they wish. Clinton has 1,712 to Sanders' 1,004, with 2,383 needed to win.

Still, Sanders sounded optimistic Sunday about his chances.

“Our calculations are that in fact we can win the pledge delegates,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “We have the momentum. We have won five out of the six last contests in landslide fashion. … And the reason is the issues that we are talking about -- a corrupt campaign finance system, the disappearance of the American middle class, … kids graduating college $50,000 in debt.”

To be sure, Sanders had a good Saturday, which he hopes will give him some momentum as the primary-caucus season moves to the Midwest, Northeast, then to the West Coast, including California with 546 delegates at stake in June.

Sanders won Alaska 81-to-18 percent over Clinton; 68-32 in Hawaii and 73-26 in Washington, with all precincts having reported.

The self-described democratic socialist on Saturday night acknowledged his struggles in earlier contests across the South, with its strong conservative voting bloc, but struck an optimistic tone.

""We knew things were going to improve as we headed west,"" he said at a rally in Madison, Wis. ""We are making significant inroads in ... Clinton's lead. ... We have a path toward victory.""

The next Democratic and Republican primaries are April 5 in Wisconsin. Other big, upcoming primaries include Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York, Clinton’s home state.

Sanders is popular among younger and more progressive Americans but continues to struggle to connect with Hispanic and African-American voters.

He was expected to do well in Washington, considering residents of Seattle, the biggest city in the Pacific Northwest, are among the most liberal in the country and major campaign contributors.

He drew more than 10,000 supporters at an outdoor rally Friday evening in Seattle. And the state appeared to have a record voter turnout, similar to others that have helped keep alive Sanders’ insurgent campaign.

Most of Washington’s Democratic leadership endorsed Clinton, including Gov. Jay Inslee, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell.

Still, Sanders entered Saturday’s contests optimistic after winning more delegate than Clinton in three contests earlier last week -- nearly 20 in the Idaho and Utah caucuses, despite losing the marquee Arizona primary to the former secretary of state.

Sanders has done significantly better in caucus contests, now winning 10 of the last 12.

Most of his 15 primary-season wins have been in states with largely white populations and in the caucus contests, which tend to attract the most active liberal Democrats.

While Sanders faces a steep climb to the nomination, Clinton’s recent losses highlight her persistent vulnerabilities, including concerns about her trustworthiness and weak support among younger voters.

Clinton has been looking past the primary contests and aiming at potential Republican challengers.

She did not hold a public event after the Saturday’s results were announced.

But in interviews, rallies and speeches last week, she largely focused on Tuesday's deadly attacks in Brussels, casting GOP front-runner Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as unqualified to deal with complicated international threats.

Her campaign sees the April 19 contest in New York as an important one, not just because of the rich delegate prize but because losing to Sanders in a state she represented in the Senate would be a psychological blow.

She hopes to lock up an even larger share of delegates in five Northeastern contests a week later.

The woman's name was not revealed. In all, 31 people were killed in coordinated bombings Tuesday at Zaventem Airport outside Brussels and a metro station in the city, Belgian officials say.

""The United States is praying and grieving with you for the loved ones of those cruelly taken from us, including Americans, and for the many who were injured in these despicable attacks,"" Secretary of State John Kerry told Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel in Brussels Friday.

""The United States is praying and grieving with you for the loved ones of those cruelly taken from us, including Americans, and for the many who were injured in these despicable attacks."" — Secretary of State John Kerry

Relatives of siblings Sascha and Alexander Pinczowski, Dutch nationals living in New York known to have been at the aiport, issued a statement Thursday confirming that the pair was not on a list of survivors.

""Sadly, our beloved Alexander and Sascha were not among them,"" the family said in a statement Thursday. ""We ask for continued prayers and privacy during this time of grieving as we await final closure.""

""The State Dept Friday confirmed that two Americans have died in the Brussels attacks. Others remain in critical condition.""

The Islamic State terror group has claimed credit for the attacks, which were carried out by as many as five bombers, three of which are believed to have died and two who are being sought. Authorities believe the bombers used suitcases packed with explosives and nails, producing blasts so devastating that identifying bodies has been difficult, and sending deadly shrapnel hurtling through the airport terminal and metro station.



Summary

What is known of the men suspected of direct involvement in Tuesday’s attacks:

- Ibrahim El Bakraoui, one of two brothers involved, is believed to be one of two suicide bombers who died at the airport.

- Najim Laachraoui, an ISIS explosives expert believed to have built the bombs used in both the Paris and Brussels attacks, was the other suicide bomber who died at the airport. He and Ibrahim El Bakraoui are believed to be the men seen in a surveillance photo pushing luggage carts and wearing solitary black gloves that may have masked detonators.

- A mystery man dressed in white, wearing a dark hat and possibly a disguise who has not been identified was also seen pushing a cart in the surveillance photo. He is believed to have placed a bomb at the airport and fled the scene. Authorities are looking for him.

- Khalid El Bakraoui, the brother of Ibrahim El Bakraoui, is believed to have died in a suicide blast at the Maelbeek Metro station 79 minutes after the airport attack.

- A second man seen with Khalid El Bakraoui and carrying a large bag at the Metro station is believed to have been an accomplice. Police are trying to determine if he is a suspect who was arrested Thursday night. His identity has not been revealed.

About a dozen Americans were known to be injured in the attacks, and several stateside families had not been able to contact relatives that were known to be at the airport, but Friday's development marked the first confirmation of American deaths.

The State Department said among those still unaccounted for were two ""official Americans,"" meaning they were U.S. government employees or their family members. That description could include both State Department employees, military employees or others, he said.

Also among the U.S. citizens still unaccounted for were Justin and Stephanie Shults, originally from Tennessee and Kentucky but now living in Belgium. Adding to their relatives' anxiety, the couple was wrongly said to have been located on Wednesday.

Justin Shults' brother, Levi Sutton, said a State Department official told his mother the couple had been found, but that an hour later a social worker called the mother to say the information was incorrect.

Counted among the Americans confirmed injured in the bombings were three missionaries from the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as well as a U.S. Air Force airman and four members of his family.

Kerry, who arrived at the still-closed airport Friday for a brief unscheduled stop on his way home from Moscow, pledged U.S. support for Belgium in the wake of the attacks, even as President Obama was criticized for appearing at a baseball game in Cuba and dancing the tango in Argentina during a previously scheduled tour earlier this week.



""We - all of us representing countless nationalities - have a message for those who inspired or carried out the attacks here or in Paris, or Ankara, or Tunis, or San Bernardino, or elsewhere: We will not be intimidated,"" Kerry said. ""We will not be deterred. We will come back with greater resolve - with greater strength - and we will not rest until we have eliminated your nihilistic beliefs and cowardice from the face of the Earth.""

Michel thanked Kerry for his visit, calling it a powerful message of solidarity. ""It is very important for us today to receive your support,"" he said. He offered condolences for the American victims and vowed to step up counter-terrorism cooperation with the U.S. and others.

Kerry said he offered the prayers of the American people for ""these people who have suffered inconceivable losses.""

""Those whose lives were torn apart this week were not combatants in any conflict,"" the secretary said.

The Belgian Embassy, not long after Kerry's arrival, sent a Twitter message calling his stop here an example of ""the solidarity of the American people which goes right to our heart.""

All three GOP contenders appeared at a CNN town hall in Milwaukee one week before Wisconsin's April 5 primary.



When asked if he would keep the pledge he signed last September, Trump responded ""No, I won’t."" The real estate mogul explained that he was taking back the pledge because, ""I have been treated very unfairly,"" and listed the Republican National Committee and party establishment among those he believes have wronged him.

Cruz, who is running second to Trump in the delegate race, shrugged off the question of whether he would support Trump in November, saying ""Donald is not going to be the GOP nominee. We're going to beat him."" The Texas senator added that nominating Trump ""would be an absolute train wreck"" and ""would hand the general election to Hillary Clinton.""

Trump, who followed Cruz on the town hall stage, said he didn't need a promise of support from Cruz.

""He doesn’t have to support me,"" he said.

Ohio Gov. Kasich, who has vowed to keep his campaign going until this summer's convention in Cleveland despite being a distant third in the delegate count, also didn't say whether he'd stand by the pledge.

""If the nominee is somebody I think is really hurting the country, and diving the country, I can't stand behind them,"" Kasich said.

Trump has 736 delegates and is the only candidate with a realistic path to clinching the nomination by the end of the primaries on June 7. However, a Cruz win in Wisconsin would narrow Trump's already tight path to the nomination and raise the prospect of a contested convention in Cleveland.

Trump told supporters at a rally that ""if we win Wisconsin, it's pretty much over,"" noting his significant delegate lead over both Cruz and Kasich. Trump held the rally in Janesville, Wis., hometown of House Speaker Paul Ryan — who last week called for more civility in politics even as the Republican presidential race grew more personal and nasty.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a former GOP presidential contender, endorsed Cruz Tuesday, saying he believes the Texas senator is best positioned to win the GOP nomination and defeat Clinton.

244,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/03/24/second-suspect-reportedly-sought-in-brussels-subway-bombing.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"A second terrorist took part in the subway bombing Tuesday in Brussels and authorities believe he may have survived the blast, meaning there are potentially two ""mystery bombers"" from the twin attacks on the run, according to reports.

The development means there is an unidentified bomber in both the attack at the Maelbeek Metro station, which killed 20, and the earlier blasts at Zaventem Airport, which killed 11. Both unidentified suspects were captured by surveillance cameras with known suicide bombers.

The French newspaper Le Monde and the Belgian public broadcaster RTBF reported that a man carrying a large bag was seen on CCTV walking with Khalid El Bakraoui, whom authorities believe blew himself up on a train at the Maelbeek station. That possible accomplice also was seen talking to El Bakraoui and did not get on the train that was bombed, police sources told AFP.



What is known of the men suspected of direct involvement in Tuesday’s attacks:

- Ibrahim El Bakraoui, one of two brothers involved, is believed to be one of two suicide bombers who died at the airport.

- Najim Laachraoui, an ISIS explosives expert believed to have built the bombs used in both the Paris and Brussels attacks, was the other suicide bomber who died at the airport. He and Ibrahim El Bakraoui are believed to be the men seen in a surveillance photo pushing luggage carts and wearing solitary black gloves that may have masked detonators.

- A second man seen with Khalid El Bakraoui and carrying a large bag at the Metro station is believed to have been an accomplice and either died in the blast or is on the run.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks in Brussels, which have laid bare European security failings and prompted calls for better intelligence cooperation.

Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, in a national mourning speech Thursday, said the attacks targeted the ""liberty of daily life"" and ""the liberty upon which the European project was built.""

""The cries of distress, the cries of pain, the scream of sirens, the apocalyptic images will remain engraved"" on memories, he said.

Security experts have told Fox News the bombers were likely targeting Americans, because the airport blast happened near the American Airlines desk, and the Metro station is near the U.S. Embassy.

In Brussels, authorities were still sifting through evidence gathered in a series of raids immediately following the attacks, which came during rush hour Tuesday morning.



RTBF also reported Thursday that a message found on Ibrahim El Bakraoui's computer Tuesday night does not name Paris attack suspect Salah Abdeslam, as had previously been suspected.

According to the broadcaster, El Bakraoui referenced Mohammed Bakkali, who was arrested last November following the Paris attacks and is suspected of renting out two hideouts to the ISIS cell in Belgium. He is also accused of spying on a top Belgian nuclear official.

""I don't know what to do, I'm in a hurry, people are looking for me everywhere,"" chief prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw quoted the message as saying. ""If I give myself up I'll end up in a cell next to him.""

The message points to a rising sense of panic among the three suicide bombers.

Police were drawn to the brothers' apartment Tuesday night thanks to a tip from a taxi driver who had unwittingly delivered them to the airport, Van Leeuw said. Inside the northeast Brussels residence they found an apparent bomb-making factory, including 33 pounds of homemade explosives and nails for use as shrapnel.

Neighbors told The Associated Press they had no idea of the brothers' activities and barely saw them until the taxi collected them and their visibly heavy bags Tuesday morning.

One neighbor, who was willing to give only his first name of Erdine, said he was about to drive his son to school when he saw the two men carrying their bags out of the building.

""The taxi driver tried to get the luggage,"" he said. ""And the other guy reached for it like he was saying: 'No, I'll take it.'""

245,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/06/cruz-sanders-pick-up-convincing-wins-over-trump-clinton-in-wisconsin.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders scored big victories in Wisconsin's presidential primaries Tuesday, dampening Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's hopes of wrapping up the race any time soon -- and putting heavy pressure on the front-runners to recapture the momentum in contests later this month.

Both Cruz and Sanders charged out of Wisconsin claiming momentum was turning in their favor. Sanders, who notched his sixth victory in the last seven state contests, won all but three of the Badger State's 72 counties.

“And we have won almost all of them with overwhelming, landslide numbers,” Sanders told an ebullient crowd of supporters Tuesday night.

Sanders was speaking in Wyoming, which holds a caucus contest this weekend. But the next big primary will be in New York on April 19, and Sanders has vowed to take on Clinton in her adopted home state.

Cruz also pointed to his win Tuesday as a sign the tides are turning against Republican front-runner Trump, who faced one of the roughest weeks of his campaign going into the primary.

""Tonight is a turning point,"" Cruz declared at a rally in Milwaukee. ""It is a rallying cry. It is a call from the hard-working men and women of Wisconsin to the people of America: we have a choice. A real choice.""

Yet Cruz, despite winning in Wisconsin and outmaneuvering Trump lately in the grueling battle for delegates, still faces challenging terrain in the weeks ahead. Trump has a clear lead in New York polls, and his campaign claimed ""total confidence"" they would win that race.

Trump's campaign also put out a biting statement Tuesday night that said Cruz was ""worse than a puppet--- he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump.""

Even if Trump holds his ground in New York, however, Cruz's Wisconsin win only increases the odds that the Republican Party will hold its first open convention in four decades this July, a scenario Trump seemed to be referring to.

Any candidate would need 1,237 delegates to clinch the nomination before then, and Cruz's Wisconsin victory makes that number very difficult for Trump to obtain.

With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Cruz led with 48 percent of the vote to Trump's 35 percent. Ohio Gov. John Kasich was trailing far behind on 14 percent of the vote.

Exit polls showed disquiet about Trump among Wisconsin Republicans. In the Fox News survey of 1,532 primary voters, 58 percent of respondents said they were either concerned or scared about the prospect of Trump being elected president. More worryingly for the Trump campaign, 37 percent said they would not vote for him if he faced Clinton in November's general election.

On the Democratic side, returns showed Sanders with 56 percent of the vote to Clinton's 43 percent with 99 percent of precincts reporting.

The victory helps fuel Sanders' argument that the Democratic primary is far from over, even as front-runner Clinton tries to turn her attention to the general election.

Exit polls in the Democratic race show Sanders won in part with the help of independent voters, 72 percent of whom broke for the Vermont senator.

While the Cruz and Sanders wins in Wisconsin won't necessarily shorten the odds on either winning their party’s nomination, the losses by the front-runners keep an aura of uncertainty hanging over both races.

Cruz, enjoying the support of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, campaigned harder than anybody in the Midwestern state. Buoyed by conservative talk show hosts and others opposed to a Trump bid, the Texas senator led in most GOP polls leading up to Tuesday’s primary.

For Trump, the long lead-up to Wisconsin's contest has included one of the worst stretches of his candidacy. He was embroiled in a spat involving Cruz's wife, which he now says he regrets, was sidetracked by his campaign manager's legal problems after an altercation with a female reporter, and stumbled awkwardly in comments about abortion.

Still, Trump made a spirited final push in the state. His campaign said Tuesday night he withstood an ""onslaught of the establishment"" in Wisconsin.

Complicating the primary landscape for both Cruz and Trump is the continuing candidacy of Kasich. The Ohio governor's only victory has come in his home state, but he's still picking up delegates that would otherwise help Trump inch closer to the nomination or help Cruz catch up.

Trump has joined Cruz in calling for Kasich to end his campaign. But Kasich cast Trump's focus on him as a sign that he's best positioned to win over the businessman's supporters.

For Republicans, 42 delegates were at stake Tuesday. According to an Associated Press count late Tuesday, Cruz won 33 of 36 allocated Wisconsin delegates, with Trump winning the other three and six delegates still outstanding. With the latest results factored in, Trump has 740 delegates to Cruz's 514. Kasich is a distant third with 143 delegates.

For Democrats, 86 delegates were on the line Tuesday in Wisconsin. With his victory, Sanders won 45 delegates to Clinton's 31, with 10 delegates outstanding, according to an Associated Press count. When including superdelegates, the party officials who can back any candidate, Clinton holds 1,743 delegates to Sanders' 1,056. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the Democratic nomination.

On the eve of voting in Wisconsin, Clinton's campaign manager argued that Sanders' only path to victory ""relies on overturning the will of the voters."" In a memo to supporters, Robby Mook wrote that Sanders' strategy now is ""a combination of trying to flip pledged delegates at state and county conventions, while also convincing superdelegates that he deserves their support.""

246,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/29/political-hatefest-why-media-and-candidates-are-dragging-down-campaign.html?intcmp=hplnws,2,"We are now at the point in this political season where everyone is hating on everyone else.

Think about it: When was the last time you saw a piece or watched a segment in which a candidate was portrayed positively?

Presidential campaigns are a tough business where every contender gets roughed up as the price of admission. But the level of vitriol—the pundits against Donald Trump and his rivals, and the candidates sliming each other—has spiraled way out of control.

It hasn’t been Morning in America for a long time. In fact, it’s pretty close to a dark and stormy midnight.

And the hyperspeed news cycle has all this unfolding at a head-snapping pace, like an endless feed of Twitter taunts.

In the deafening din of the media echo chamber, it sometimes seems like these are the sounds that break through:

--Donald Trump is a fascist threat to our way of life, says racist things and loves to attack women over their looks.

--Ted Cruz is the most unlikable man in Washington, maybe the world, and such a nutty right-winger he’d probably like to shut down the government forever.

--John Kasich is a cranky spoiler impersonating a nice guy who is staying in the race out of pure ego.

--Hillary Clinton is a deceitful woman who gets on everyone’s nerves, keeps lying about her email server and is lucky she’s not in jail.

The “war over the wives” controversy is perhaps the perfect encapsulation of the gutter campaign, with Trump blaming Cruz for the posting of a nude magazine photo of his wife, Cruz blaming Trump for unsubstantiated mistress allegations in the Enquirer, and the media breathlessly following each twist and tweet.

It’s a chicken-and-egg game to assign blame for the campaign’s locker room tone to either the politicians or the journalists. Perhaps it reflects the crude and often mean-spirited tone of our culture.

Here, among thousands of possible selections, is a sampling. Let’s start with Sunday’s New York Times op-ed page, where everyone gets whacked.

Ross Douthat, a thoughtful conservative voice, says Ted Cruz looks like he’s faking it:

“The fact that he seems so much like an actor hitting his marks fits with the story of how he became Mr. True Conservative Outsider in the first place. Basically, he spent years trying to make it in Washington on the insider’s track, and hit a wall because too many of the insiders didn’t like him — because his ambition was too naked, his climber’s zeal too palpable. So he deliberately switched factions, turning the establishment’s personal disdain into a political asset, and taking his Ivy League talents to the Tea Party instead.”

On such issues as the government shutdown over ObamaCare, an exercise in “self-serving cynicism…Cruz has proceeded with several fingers in the wind; every time the conservative mood has shifted even a little, he’s shifted quickly too.” He accuses Cruz of first being obsequious toward Trump, but turning to self-righteousness now that “the name-calling and scandal-mongering have been turned against his reputation and his family.”

After that, and with a parting shot that “his cynicism can be repellent,” Douthat allows that the hard-working Cruz has earned his standing in the primaries.

On the liberal side, I have a lot of respect for Nick Kristof, but in his Times column he buys into an increasingly common myth. The headline is “My Shared Shame: The Media Helped Make Trump”:

“Although many of us journalists have derided Trump, the truth is that he generally outsmarted us (with many exceptions, for there truly have been serious efforts to pin him down and to investigate Trump University and his various business failings). He manipulated television by offering outrageous statements that drew ever more cameras — without facing enough skeptical follow-up questions.

“It’s not that we shouldn’t have covered Trump’s craziness, but that we should have aggressively provided context in the form of fact checks and robust examination of policy proposals.”

While the press could always do a better job, I’d argue that there has been endless fact-checking and it hasn’t hurt Teflon Trump.

The second “failure” is that “we wrongly treated Trump as a farce.” Not all of us, Nick, but that is especially true among the Huffington Post liberal crowd (though plenty of conservative pundits fell into this trap).

But I strongly agree with Kristof’s last point: “We failed to take Trump seriously because of a third media failing: We were largely oblivious to the pain among working-class Americans and thus didn’t appreciate how much his message resonated….We inhabit a middle-class world and don’t adequately cover the part of America that is struggling and seething. We spend too much time talking to senators, not enough to the jobless.”

Also on the op-ed page, Maureen Dowd looked at President Obama “tangoing into history”—that is, enjoying his trip to Argentina and Cuba and failing to reflect the public alarm over the Brussels bombings:

“Barack Obama started off as a man self-consciously alone on stage and that’s how he is exiting. He is, for better and worse, too cool for school. His identity is defined by his desire to rise above the fray. Unfortunately, he is in politics, which is the fray…

“The president has a bristling resistance to what he sees as cheap emotion. (See: flag pin, 2008.) That has led him, time after time, to respond belatedly or bloodlessly in moments when Americans are alarmed, wanting solace and solutions.”

Well, how about John Kasich? He hasn’t offended too many people, right?

National Review Editor Rich Lowry is in the #NeverKasich camp:

“This truly is a year when the rules don’t apply. If they did, John Kasich would be back in Columbus trying to figure out whether he sells his soul to Donald Trump or endorses Ted Cruz.

“Instead, the Ohio governor is still out on the trail running a delusional vanity project masquerading as a presidential campaign. There is no appetite for his pragmatic, ‘can’t we all get along’ campaign among Republican-primary voters, who have made that abundantly clear.”

Oh, and the Times news section joins the fray by quoting Kasich associates who “recall a three-decade career in government punctuated by scolding confrontations, intemperate critiques and undiplomatic remarks.”

I could go on and on. Slate says Trump “seeks to destroy people who stand in his way, especially women, even if he looks disgusting doing it.”

New York magazine says that “unfortunately for Cruz, his logic backfires. Because if real men do not attack women, Cruz is fake as hell. In fact, he might be faker than Trump.”

Maybe, on some level, we get the elections we deserve.

This is a reality show campaign in which reality, perhaps in the form of terror attacks, sometimes intrudes. It is endlessly entertaining, but often feels like tragicomedy with no heroes."
247,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/04/sanders-campaign-accuses-clinton-ducking-debates-as-wisconsin-battle-looms.html,2,"Bernie Sanders’ campaign accused Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton of “playing silly political games” with debate dates as both candidates readied their final appeals to Wisconsin voters ahead of Tuesday’s critical primary.

“I want it,” Clinton told NBC’s “Meet the Press,” in response to suggestions that she is avoiding a debate with Sanders in her adopted home state of New York ahead of its April 19 primary.

Sanders, a Brooklynite who has won five of the last six primaries or caucuses, has challenged Clinton to a debate in delegate-rich New York.

The Clinton campaign has offered a few dates -- including a weekday morning and at the same time as Monday night’s NCAA men’s basketball champions -- that the Sanders campaign and others see as less than optimal for viewership.

Still, Clinton said she was “confident” about the debate happening.

Late Sunday, the Sanders campaign countered by saying the candidate is available to debate April 10, 11, 12 or 13.

Sanders campaign spokesman Michael Briggs also said the Clinton campaign “disingenuously” announced that it had agreed to a debate on a day when it knew Sanders already had locked in park permits for a major rally in New York City.

""Let’s stop the silly political games,” Briggs said. “Let’s get on with debating the candidates’ stands on serious issues affecting New York and the United States.”

Briggs said in a statement late Sunday that Sanders accepted an invitation for a prime-time debate on April 10 on NBC News.

""We hope the Clinton campaign also accepts. The April 10 debate date is one of four dates that the Sanders campaign had proposed for a debate with Secretary Clinton before the New York primary election,"" he said.

Clinton had no public events Sunday in Wisconsin, where some polls show Sanders with a slight lead.

Though she has attempted to focus her resources of late on a general election race with GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Clinton also made clear Sunday that Sanders remains a political threat.

“I certainly haven't moved on,” she told NBC. “I know that I still have work to do to win the nomination.”

She also repeated her regret for using a private email server for official communications while secretary of state, amid nagging concerns about her trustworthiness, and said the FBI had not contacted her about being interviewed regarding its investigation of the email matter.

Sanders and the top two GOP presidential candidates, Trump and Cruz, were campaigning Sunday in Wisconsin.

Trump, the Republican front-runner, doubled-down Sunday night on his comments that the US should “do a better deal” with Japan, South Korea and other allies, saying they should pay more for America’s protection while taking a greater role in their defense — including building their own nuclear weapons.

Responding to questions at a Fox News Channel “On the Record” town hall two days before the Wisconsin primary — where polls show he trails Cruz — Trump also said that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour wasn’t good for business or jobs creation.

""If you start raising that minimum wage, you're going to make a lot of our companies even more non-competitive,"" he said.

Trump also delved into his plans to change the nation's tax code by ""simplifying"" it.

""The very rich are probably going to end up paying more, but there's an incentive for them to invest and create jobs in the country,"" he said.

The other Republican candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, told ABC’s “This Week” that the Republican convention -- which could happen in July without a clear nominee based on delegate wins -- could be a civics lesson for the country.

“Kids will spend less time focusing on Bieber and Kardashian and more time focusing on how we elect presidents,"" said Kasich, who has won only Ohio. ""It will be so cool.""

Trump on Sunday called for Kasich to drop out of the race, arguing he shouldn't be allowed to continue accumulating delegates if he has no chance of being the nominee — a call repeated during Sunday night’s Fox News town hall.

Trump has 736 pledged delegates, followed by Cruz with 463, then Kasich with 143 -- with 1,237 needed to secure the nomination.

Trump, however, after a difficult week, now trails Cruz in Wisconsin, after some polls showed him leading by double-digits several weeks ago.

Trump said Sunday that Kasich could be considered as a nominee at the GOP convention in July even without competing in the remaining nominating contests.

Trump told reporters at a Milwaukee diner that he had relayed his concerns to Republican National Committee officials at a meeting in Washington this past week.

""He's taking my votes,"" Trump said about Kasich.

The Kasich campaign tried to flip the script, contending that neither Trump nor Cruz would have enough delegates to win the nomination outright going into the convention.

""Since he thinks it's such a good idea, we look forward to Trump dropping out before the convention,"" said Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf.

Trump's declaration came as Republican concerns grew about the prospect of convention chaos if Trump fails to lock up his party's nomination -- or even if he does.

Speaking to thousands packed in a frigid airport hangar in western New York, Trump argued anew that the person who wins the most votes in the primary process should automatically be the GOP nominee.

""What they're trying to do is subvert the movement with crooked shenanigans,"" Trump said. The real estate mogul compared himself to Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, who is well behind Hillary Clinton in that party's delegate race despite a string of state wins.

""We should have won it a long time ago,"" Trump said. ""But, you know, we keep losing where we're winning.""

Trump was introduced at the rally by Buffalo real estate developer and 2010 New York gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino, who said that talk of a brokered Republican convention ""suggests that they can take that right away from the American people to choose their leader.""

Manafort, a veteran GOP strategist who worked on White House campaigns for President Gerald Ford in 1976 and Kansas Sen. Bob Dole in 1996, told NBC's ""Meet The Press"" that the Cruz campaign was using a ""scorched earth"" approach in which ""they don't care about the party. If they don't get what they want, they blow it up.""

Manafort added that the Trump campaign is filing protests because the Cruz campaign is ""not playing by the rules.”

“You go to his county conventions and you see the gestapo tactics,"" he said.



Trump has a 743-to-545 delegate lead over the Texas senator, with the end of the primary/caucus season fast approaching. Over the weekend, Cruz completed his sweep of Colorado's 34 delegates by locking up the remaining 13 at the party's state convention in Colorado Springs. He already had collected 21 delegates and visited the state to try to pad his numbers there.

Cruz came out ahead in the Colorado contest, though, after dedicating resources to the convention process and putting in personal face time on the day of the final vote, something Trump did not do. The Trump campaign’s flyers in Colorado naming their preferred delegates were also riddled with errors. While Trump aides blamed the state party for giving them bad information, the party pushed back.

And on Twitter, the Colorado GOP retweeted a message, saying: “You may not like CO's caucus system, but it's representative, and claiming delegates were 'stolen' insults the Republicans who participated.”

Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier also retweeted a message saying the rules “were publicly available for months to people who know how to read and understand words.”

Polls show Trump holding a sizable lead in the next big state contest, New York's April 19 primary, but Cruz is trying to chip away at Trump's home-state advantage in conservative pockets of the Empire State.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich is third with 143 delegates, behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who ended his campaign March 15 with 171 committed delegates.

Manafort insisted Sunday that he’s still connected enough to wrangle delegates.

""You would be surprised who's been calling me over the last week and where they're from,"" he said. ""Do I know the 25-, 30-year-old delegates? No. Do I know the people who push buttons in a lot of these states? Yes.""

However, Manafort made clear the Trump campaign won’t use strong-arm tactics.

“That’s not my style,” he told NBC. “That’s not Donald Trump’s style. That’s Ted Cruz’s style.”

Manafort also dismissed the notion that the Trump campaign has missed opportunities to get delegates through insider tactics and boasted that Cruz has and will continue to lose that way.

He said the Trump campaign has gotten all of the committee spots in Alabama and that it “wiped [Cruz] out"" in a similar effort in Michigan.

“You’re going to see Ted Cruz get skunked in Nevada,” Manafort added.

Manafort made clear the race to get 1,237 delegates will likely extend until early June, which includes California’s GOP primary, with 172 delegates, and the New Jersey primary with 51 at stake.

“I’m confident there are several ways to get to 1,237,” he said.

Trump would need to win nearly 60 percent of all the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination before this summer's convention in Cleveland. So far, he's winning about 45 percent.

Manafort insisted being hired by the Trump campaign was not a shakeup, particularly amid Cruz’s come-from-behind win last week in Wisconsin.

He argued the campaign season is entering its end stages and that Trump must move from the free-wheeling, free-media style that made the first-time candidate the GOP presidential front-runner.

“Donald Trump has recognized that,” Manafort said, while arguing Trump still runs the campaign.

249,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/14/trump-campaign-manager-wont-be-prosecuted-over-battery-claim.html?intcmp=hpbt2,2,"A Florida prosecutor announced Thursday that his office will not pursue a misdemeanor battery charge against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign manager over allegations he grabbed the arm of a reporter.

Palm Beach County State Attorney David Aronberg confirmed the decision at a press conference, saying there was not sufficient evidence to pursue the charge against Corey Lewandowski. Local police had charged him last month after reporter Michelle Fields accused him of grabbing her as she tried to speak to Trump.

Aronberg said the police were “well within their authority” to bring that charge but there is a “higher” standard for his office to pursue it.

“It is not strong enough to meet the legal burden of a reasonable likelihood of conviction,” he said.

Further, he said that Fields, at the time of the incident, had been directed toward the back of the room along with other media members. She later approached the candidate and “brushed or touched” Trump’s arm, he said. It was at this point that Lewandowski “grabbed” Fields’ arm and pulled her away, he said.

Trump campaign social media director Dan Scavino earlier had posted on his Facebook page that the charge would not be pressed against Lewandowski.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

The Trump campaign said the matter was now ""concluded.""

""Corey Lewandowski is gratified by the decision to drop the misdemeanor charge and appreciates the thoughtful consideration and professionalism by the Palm Beach State Attorney and his staff who carefully reviewed this matter, as well as Mr. Trump’s loyalty and the support of his colleagues and family during this time,"" the statement said. ""The matter is now concluded.""

The decision not to prosecute Lewandowski was first reported by Politico.

The incident occurred after a March 8 press conference at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Fla., where Lewandowski was accused by Fields, a reporter for Breitbart at the time, of grabbing her arm as she asked the Republican front-runner a question.

Lewandowski initially denied the incident had taken place.

However, the Jupiter Police Department obtained video from the ballroom that it said paralleled Fields' version of events, and subsequently charged Lewandowski.

The police report says Lewandowski ""grabbed Fields left arm with his right hand, causing her to turn and step back.""

Fields told Fox News' Megyn Kelly in a ""Kelly File"" interview Wednesday night that she is planning to pursue a civil case against Lewandowski for defamation.

She also responded in a series of tweets on reports that Lewandowski won't be charged.

Lewandowski, speaking with Fox News' Sean Hannity, expressed appreciation for Trump's ""loyalty"" throughout the case.

It was ""a three-second incident that I don't recall that has really taken over a big piece of my life,"" Lewandowski said.

He also said he would forgive and be open to meeting with Fields in the future, when asked by Hannity.

Trump has staunchly defended his campaign manager after he was charged, as the Republican front-runner suggested the reporter could have been perceived as a threat.

“She's grabbing my arm. She's not supposed to. She broke through Secret Service, she is asking questions,” Trump told Fox News last month. “She's got a pen in her arm, which she's not supposed to have. It shows that she's a very aggressive person who is grabbing at me and touching me. Maybe I should file charges against her.”

If reporter Michelle Fields really had fallen, Trump said, “He would have been fired before she even got up.”"
250,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/15/sparks-fly-over-wages-wall-street-and-war-at-heated-clinton-sanders-debate.html,2,"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders shelved the niceties and went right after each other’s perceived weak spots at a must-win Democratic primary debate Thursday night where the front-runner challenged her rival’s grasp of complex policy issues – and the insurgent senator hammered her as a Wall Street pal just now talking the talk of working Americans.

The charge crystallized when Clinton seemed to surprise Sanders by declaring she’d back legislation for a $15 federal minimum wage.

“To suddenly announce now you’re for 15, I don’t think is quite accurate,” Sanders said, noting Clinton previously has pushed for increasing the hourly wage to $12. “I think the secretary has confused a lot of people.”

However, Clinton said while she supports the goal of raising the wage to $12, she would sign legislation raising it to $15 if a Democratic Congress passes it.

“I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for 15,” Clinton insisted.

The heated dispute, in which the candidates frequently interrupted each other, was one of many at a CNN-hosted debate heavy on populist rhetoric – and personal attacks.

Sanders at one point went as far as to suggest Clinton’s labeling of certain criminals as ""superpredators"" when she was first lady was ""a racist term and everybody knew it was a racist term.""

The two faced off in Brooklyn, for their first debate in more than a month, at a critical time. The campaign heads soon into the final stretch with the upcoming New York primary seen as a determining factor. While Sanders trails badly in delegates, he is pointing to his recent winning streak in insisting he can still “win this nomination.”

“Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the deep South. We got murdered there,” he conceded, before adding. “We’re out of the deep South now.”

“I’m not taking anything for granted, or any voter or any place,” Clinton said, while noting she’s gotten millions more votes and saying the party will eventually have to unite.

Eyeing the contest ahead, both candidates courted Empire State voters Thursday by stressing their New York ties – and more broadly, hitting working-class themes.

At the same time, the debate veered heavily into foreign policy in the second half, with Sanders using the issue to challenge Clinton’s judgment while she questioned his experience.

“Describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it,” Clinton said at one point, challenging Sanders as he laid out his goals for achieving Middle East peace.

Sanders also took heat from Clinton for describing Israeli military action as at times disproportionate. “They do not invite rockets raining down on their towns and villages,” she said. Sanders said Israel has a right to defend itself, but the U.S. needs to be even-handed in peace talks.

Sanders, as he has before, hammered Clinton for supporting regime change in Libya and Iraq, warning that it has “unintended consequences.” He said the former secretary of state’s continued support for a no-fly zone in Syria – which he noted President Obama does not support – “runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.”

But Clinton defended her stance, and argued: “Nobody stood up to Assad and removed him and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria.”

Earlier, Sanders also pointed to Clinton’s support for the Iraq war, as well as “virtually every disastrous trade agreement,” in challenging her “judgment” to lead.

However, Clinton fired back, pointing to an editorial board meeting Sanders had with the New York Daily News where he seemed to struggle to explain his plan to break up the banks and various foreign policy positions.

“He could not explain how” he would break up the banks, Clinton said. She defended her own judgment and said: “I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.”

While the tone was tougher than past face-offs, the candidates hit several familiar themes. Clinton suggested Sanders is too closely aligned with the gun industry. Sanders knocked Clinton for not releasing transcripts of her past paid speeches (while saying he would soon release a new batch of tax returns).

On that point, Sanders said that despite the financial industry-fueled recession, “Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech.”

Clinton, though, denied that any of that money influenced her decisions in office. Further, she said, “I stood up against behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.”

Sanders gave a sarcastic retort: “Oh my goodness. They must have been really crushed by this.”

As he did on the minimum wage, Sanders also seemed to accuse Clinton of shifting her position when it came to Social Security taxes, though Clinton again claimed she’s been consistent.

Sanders has been on an election roll lately, winning seven of the last eight state contests, most recently in Wyoming over the weekend. On stage Thursday, he touted his “landslide victories” in recent contests.

But analysts note the primary map could soon be turning back in the front-runner’s favor, not only in New York but other Eastern primary states.

With the stakes getting ever-higher, the tone of the contest had sharpened well before Thursday’s debate. Sanders recently alleged Clinton may not be qualified for president, before walking back the remark. And the Clinton campaign has criticized Sanders for the aggressive efforts by some of his supporters to persuade so-called superdelegates to back the Vermont senator.

Superdelegates are elected officials and other party insiders free to support whomever they want. Most of them are siding with Clinton, giving her an even wider delegate lead. But Clinton noted Thursday night that she holds the pledged delegate lead as well.

Going into the Empire State primary on Tuesday, Clinton so far has held the lead in most polls. Clinton spent eight years as a New York senator.

But Sanders, a Vermont senator who was born in Brooklyn, has been touting his local roots as he seeks to upset Clinton in the state.

While Sanders is on a winning streak in primaries and caucuses, he desperately needs a big victory in New York if he hopes to cut into Clinton's delegate lead and slow her march to the nomination. To date, Clinton has accumulated 1,758 total delegates, compared with Sanders’ 1,069. It takes 2,383 to win.

251,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/20/trump-clinton-cruise-to-new-york-wins-cruz-must-rely-on-contested-convention.html,2,"Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton regained their stride in the presidential race Tuesday night, winning their respective primaries in New York — and sending a message to their rivals that their campaigns are back on track after recent stumbles.

Trump, in his home state, notched what appeared to be his biggest victory yet. Speaking to cheering supporters Tuesday night at Trump Tower, he declared: “We don’t have much of a race anymore.”

“[Texas] Senator [Ted] Cruz is just about mathematically eliminated,” Trump claimed. “We’re really, really rockin’.” Indeed, Cruz's poor showing left him with no mathematical chance of clinching the nomination before the Republican convention in July, though Trump could still end up short of the needed 1,237 needed to seal victory before the gathering.



With 94 percent of precincts reporting, Trump had garnered 60 percent of the vote, his highest total in any state. He had claimed at least 89 of New York's 95 Republican delegates.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich finished second in the state with 25 percent of the vote, leaving Cruz to finish third with 15 percent. Kasich was awarded at least three delegates, leaving Cruz in danger of getting shut out.

As of Tuesday night, Trump had 845 delegates. Cruz had 559, and Kasich had 147.

Cruz, who infamously panned Trump's ""New York values"" earlier in the primary, had been bracing for a tough showing in the Empire State and showed no signs of throwing in the towel. The Texas senator was already looking ahead, turning his attention to Pennsylvania, where he delivered a speech calling on Americans to join together to move the country forward.

""It is time for us to get up, shake it off and be who we were destined to be,” he said.



In the Democratic race, Clinton soundly defeated Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in her adopted home state, which she represented in the Senate for eight years. Despite the Brooklyn-born Sanders’ hard-fought attempt at an upset, the former secretary of state successfully staved off that possibility Tuesday night. With 94 percent of precincts reporting, Clinton had 58 percent to Sanders’ 42 percent.

“There’s no place like home,” Clinton said at her victory rally.

Clinton claimed the race for the Democratic nomination is now entering the “home stretch” and “victory is in sight.” In an apparent bid to bridge divides in the party amid an increasingly bitter primary, she directed a message to Sanders voters: “There is much more that unites us than divides us.”

Clinton and Trump both were seeking rebound victories Tuesday after recent setbacks. Cruz had complicated Trump's path to the nomination by winning recent contests like Wisconsin and getting allies elected to state delegate slates. On the Democratic side, Sanders had been on a winning streak up until Tuesday – winning seven of the eight prior contests.

Whether Trump and Clinton's performance Tuesday will help either wrap up the race in the coming weeks remains an open question. The campaigns head next to five Eastern states that vote next Tuesday: Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware.

It’s potentially friendly territory for the front-runners. But unless Trump can drive Kasich and Cruz out of the race, the billionaire businessman still may have to fight all the way to the final primary contests on June 7 – including delegate-rich California, which may end up being the deciding race – to see if he can clinch the nomination.

On the Democratic side, Clinton could easily attain the necessary 2,383 delegates to win by June. The question is whether Sanders would accept it – as her tally includes the support of party insiders known as “superdelegates,” and the Sanders campaign has suggested they shouldn’t count toward that 2,383-delegate threshold.

As of Wednesday morning, Clinton had 1,893 total delegates, compared with Sanders’ 1,180.

Sanders also campaigned in Pennsylvania Tuesday. He hammered his campaign themes about a “rigged” economy and “corrupt” campaign finance system, while urging voters to join him in challenging the status quo.

“We’re gonna win this election,” Sanders vowed. However, his senior adviser Tad Devine told the Associated Press that the campaign planned to ""sit back and assess where we are"" after a next week's contests.



According to an Associated Press tally, Clinton won at least 135 of New York's 247 delegates. Sanders had won 104, with eight delegates outstanding.

The importance of every last delegate has increased in recent weeks as Cruz has appeared to outmaneuver Trump’s campaign in the behind-the-scenes preparations for July’s convention.

Cruz has been laying the groundwork for a contested convention – one in which where no candidate has the required number of delegates – by getting allies elected as delegates. That way, if voting extends to a second round, some of those pledged to Trump on the first round could peel off and support Cruz. This has heightened the pressure on Trump to clinch the nomination before the convention.

A Kasich campaign memo, meanwhile, touted the Ohio governor’s chances in the upcoming state contests – and his prospects for securing delegate support in the event of a contested convention.

“The next 7 days are absolutely critical,"" the memo concluded. ""It’s now or never to stop Trump and save the Republican Party.""

The primary-day voting was not without its problems in New York. Voters ran into an array of polling-site glitches earlier Tuesday as they tried to cast ballots – with some locations opening late and others using broken machines.

The Wall Street Journal reported that some voters waited hours to cast ballots at a site in Brooklyn, where workers apparently did not have the keys when it was supposed to open Tuesday morning. Elsewhere in the borough, voters reportedly were turned away due to technical problems.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also responded Tuesday to reports that thousands of registered Democrats have been dropped from the rolls, especially in Brooklyn. In a statement, the mayor called for major reforms to the election board and voiced support for an audit -- which the city comptroller has ordered.

“It has been reported to us from voters and voting rights monitors that the voting lists in Brooklyn contain numerous errors, including the purging of entire buildings and blocks of voters from the voting lists,” he said in a statement. “I am calling on the Board of Election to reverse that purge and update the lists again …”

252,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/04/20/trump-triumphs-two-big-takeaways-after-donald-wins-new-york.html,2,"There are two ways to analyze Donald Trump’s decisive win in New York’s presidential primary.

First, it’s the acknowledgment of a big run for Trump this week and next during which the GOP frontrunner will amass delegates at a faster clip than any of the other three Republicans in the race – in the process, stretching his lead over Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and pumping up the volume that the Republican nomination is deservedly The Donald’s regardless of where the delegate tally stands going into July’s national convention in Cleveland.

Trump’s argument will look good – on paper, at least.

After New York, he’s two-thirds of the way to the 1,237 delegates required by the GOP and a guaranteed first-ballot win in Cleveland.

If he’s smart, Trump will use the rest of April and May to keep driving home one word: “inevitability.”

For argument’s sake, let’s give Trump roughly 100 of the 172 delegates up for grabs next Tuesday (all the action occurring in his mid-Atlantic backyard of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island).

Once the five states holding GOP contests in May apportion their combined 199 delegates, Trump’s total should enter four-digit territory. Per this Associated Press breakdown, a first-ballot scenario remains feasible.

If he’s smart, Trump will use the rest of April and May to keep driving home one word: “inevitability”. Backed up by this exit poll data showing that an overwhelming number of New York Republicans saying the candidate with the most primary votes should be the party’s nominee.

Now, the other takeaway from New York: “the Sinatra question”.

To paraphrase that other “Chairman of the Board”, if Trump can make it there – winning big in the Empire State in a closed Republican primary – can he make it anywhere with three-fifths of a primary electorate that hasn’t bought into his candidacy?

The answer: no (not in every primary, at least) . . . and stay tuned.

May will not be the friendliest of months for Trump, what with a first-Tuesday primary in Indiana that could spell more Midwestern trouble (perhaps a repeat of his meltdown in Wisconsin).

After that: a winner-take-all contest in Nebraska that likely will go to Cruz (draw a line from Texas to North Dakota and it runs through states Cruz has won). Finally, Oregon and Washington awarding their delegates proportionally.

Not much of a buzz there.

However, there is an opportunity for Trump to take a major step forward – in a way having nothing to do with bean-counting and convention arcana. And that would be courting those skeptical Republicans still waiting for a Trumpian “pivot” from angry rhetoric and juvenile social-media insults to a more dignified tone and statesmanlike persona.

The news that broke on the same day as New York’s results – that Trump is shaking up his senior campaign staff and empowering his team to spend aggressively to win in May and June – is a first step in that direction.

The next step: breaching divides within the GOP.

According to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 63 percent of Republican primary voters say they could be satisfied with Trump as the GOP nominee.

The good news: it’s better than the 49 percent Trump received back in the March exit polls.

Not so good: it cries of work to be done – specifically, shoring up support among conservatives uneasy of Trump’s past policy inconsistencies and his unwilling in this campaign to take on entitlement spending and the federal budget dragon.

Four years ago, conservatives accounted for 35 percent of that year’s presidential turnout, the highest share since pollsters first began recording that statistic back in 1976; 82 percent of them voted for Mitt Romney. Four years previously, conservatives were 34 percent of the turnout; only 78 percent voted for John McCain.

In theory, Cruz has a chance of repeating those percentages, if not improving on them. Can Trump? Only if he starts speaking the language.

Such is the unusual nature of this Republican contest. In late April of 2012, after 43 Republican primaries and caucuses had voted, Romney had distanced himself from the field to the point where he could travel to New Hampshire and deliver this speech with an eye on the general election. Romney promised “a new campaign to unite every American who knows in their heart that we can do better . . . the beginning of the end of the disappointments of the Obama years and the start of a new and better chapter that we will write together.”

Trump’s not in that position at present – and he may not be until the final night of the Republican National Convention.

Then again, he’s not the only candidate going through hard times these days.

The same NBC/WSJ poll that gave Trump a historically awful 24 percent positive/65 percent negative approval rating and had Hillary Clinton weighing in at 32 percent positive/56 percent negative. Cruz recorded a 26 percent positive/49 percent negative: Kasich came in at 31 percent positive; 19 percent negative.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist and Clinton’s chief tormentor these days, received grades of 45 percent positive/36 percent negative, suggesting that the American electorate is not only sour on the political class, but sorely in need of a week in Caracas for a reality check on how a socialist county fares under Bernie Vision.

Will Trump take advantage of May’s light pace to transition from temper tantrums to a style more tempered? It’s the practical thing to do. Especially when confronted with national poll numbers that, for now at least, are practically awful."
253,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/04/20/mr-obama-should-have-stayed-home-your-trip-to-saudi-arabia-europe-signals-weakness.html,2,"President Obama faces contentious meetings with European and Gulf state leaders during his trip this week to Europe and Saudi Arabia. Why? Because of his continuing refusal to adopt a serious strategy to defeat ISIS, confront Iran’s increasingly belligerent behavior, and his inexplicable comments published in an April 2016 Atlantic article that blamed Europe and Gulf states for his administration’s growing list of foreign policy failures.

The Atlantic article will lead to some awkward questions for Mr. Obama from the leaders of America’s closest allies.

For example, the president will undoubtably be asked by European and Gulf state leaders to explain how, after his administration ignored the growing crisis in Libya for the past four years and his 2011 “leading from behind” strategy during the Libyan civil war, he can criticize European and Gulf states of being “free riders” and not having “skin in the game” in the Libyan situation.

I imagine British Prime Minister Cameron will say to the president, “But Mr. Obama, France and the United Kingdom took the lead in fighting that war because you refused to.”

Saudi leaders are more concerned about Obama’s comment in the Atlantic article that Saudi Arabia needs to find a way to “share the neighborhood” with Iran and “institute some sort of cold peace.” These incoherent remarks must have enraged Saudi officials in light of the July 2015 nuclear deal with Iran which they strongly oppose and a recent surge in Iranian missile tests.

Obama’s tin-eared comments about Saudi Arabia may be why Saudi King Salman was not there to greet him when the president’s plane landed in Riyadh Wednesday. The King did greet other heads of state when they arrived, according to Reuters.

Given the way he has ignored Saudi security concerns and tilted toward Iran during his presidency, I assume the Saudis have written off Mr. Obama and recognize that most experts in Washington – Republican and Democrat – do not share his radical and disjointed foreign policy views. The Saudis know their strong relationship with the United States will survive Barack Obama’s presidency. But even if they do understand this, Saudi leaders also know that this president’s failed Middle East policies did enormous damage to Middle East security that they will have to live with for many years to come.

Aside from Obama’s Iran policy – which is making Iran a regional hegemon – Riyadh is worried about the Syria/Iraq situation and the absence of a serious U.S. strategy to defeat ISIS and restore stability to the region.

Although Mr. Obama recently said the U.S. has “momentum” in its effort to defeat ISIS, the truth is that although ISIS has lost some ground in Iraq and Syria, it has expanded its reach in North Africa, Afghanistan and Europe.

The president also has been criticized for his refusal to provide more financial and military support to the Iraq Kurds.

When Gulf state leaders press President Obama for a bigger U.S. commitment to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria, he is likely to ignore their request and claim his strategy is working.

European and Gulf state leaders are certain to be frustrated with President Obama’s visit. In his mind, this trip is a victory lap. Mr. Obama does not plan to do anything meaningful for the rest of his presidency to defeat ISIS or promote stability in Syria and Iraq. He intends to defend the Iran nuclear deal as a legacy achievement of his presidency regardless of how badly the Iranians behave.

President Obama’s trip will not further damage America’s relations with European and Gulf states because they know he is a lame duck and expect the next president will be a stronger leader who will adopt a tougher and more sensible foreign policy, especially if a Republican wins the White House this fall.

The problem with this trip is that it will telegraph American weakness and divisions between the U.S. and its allies to our enemies who may try to exploit this weakness before the end of the Obama presidency. Any perception of American weakness endangers global security.

Mr. President, you should have stayed home."

TRUMP ADVISORS TRY TO PIVOT NOT FISHTAIL

HOLLYWOOD, FLA. – It’s a fine line between a general election shift and the dreaded ‘Etch A Sketch.’

Donald Trump’s supporters give him broad latitude on issues and even his promise of an attitudinal change. For example, his suggestion that the Republicans should become a pro-choice party likely wrinkled few brows among his core supporters.

The idea that Trump would change his attitude and approach along with his opinions wouldn’t trouble many who have faith in him as a man and a leader. For those who believe the Trump is the only person who can make America great again, putting on a new guise for the general election would be nothing troubling.

Remember, these are people who believe him when he describes himself as the new Reagan and the person more presidential than anybody since Lincoln.

But can Trump create a habitat that is healthy for both his backers and the kinds of folks that his newly expanded campaign are schmoozing here in Hollywood without further antagonizing the substantial chunk of his party that ranges from resentful to outright outraged about Trump’s surprising success in overtaking the GOP?

Trump had a very good day here Thursday. Aside from turning back a Rules Committee vote that might’ve helped Sen. Ted Cruz win a floor fight at the convention, delegates and other members of the establishment were very impressed by Trump’s campaign’s effort to start sucking up to them.

Promises of Trump’s flexibility when served alongside seafood platters and open bars from his new K Street handlers went a long way toward convincing the GOP elite that Trump is ready to play ball.

Little could be more comforting to them than the pledge from Trump’s campaign boss that the wildness of the frontrunner to this point has been a put on.

Consultants and party elders are not uncomfortable with the idea of tricking rubes or profit and or patriotism. And for those facing general election oblivion, anything that sounds like avoiding a savage showdown in Cleveland and not losing the general election by 40 states sounds good.

But even if Trump and his new handlers can keep the GOP elite and his existing populist base happy, the current maneuvers do pose a risk.

The most important thing for the Republican frontrunner right now is for his detractors and enemies on the conservative side of the party to just give up.

There are enough Republicans who loathe Trump to still stop him. But they have to go vote and they have to be willing to blow up their conventions to do it.

When Trump’s new Sherpa suggests that it has all been a fake so far, that gives new cause for alarm to the conservatives who already deeply mistrust Trump and see him as more of a Democrat than Republican.

All Trump needs in order to win is for the resistance to just lay down for a couple of weeks. When they wake up it will all be over.

But if Trump starts fishtailing in his turn towards conventionality it will reinvigorate the #NeverTrump movement.



It’s great to suck up to the party, even belatedly, but doing in such a transparent manner could be hazardous to Trump’s nomination.

Indiana shaping up as do or die for Cruz - RCP: “Due to a dearth of public polling in Indiana, however, it’s not clear how large Cruz’s advantage might be, if he indeed has one. One recent private poll not affiliated with any of the presidential campaigns showed Cruz leading in two congressional districts, Kasich in one, and Trump dominating in two more. Three other congressional districts, meanwhile, showed Cruz and Kasich essentially tied…Although there are just 57 delegates at stake in Indiana, the contest is one of the few remaining wild cards on the primary map. If Cruz or Kasich do not win, the Republican race could quickly spiral out of their control. If Trump does not win Indiana, however, his delegate math becomes exceedingly difficult to win the nomination before Cleveland.”

The Lynx won, 69-52, to clinch the series. The pop icon…approached a Lynx staffer with an incredible offer. The players, plus a guest, were invited to his Paisley Park compound for a private concert…He played ‘Purple Rain,’ ‘When Doves Cry,’ ‘1999,’ and some new stuff. He played different instruments throughout the evening — guitar, keyboards, drums. He played until 4 am; a few Lynx players and coaches danced on stage.”

WHAT HAPPENED TO WORKING MAN’S LIBERALISM?

Vox’s Emmet Rensin takes a deep dive into a concept he dubs “smug style” liberalism in America and how the political concept changed from an ideology of the working class to that of the elite. How did this happen and what has the smug style done to American liberalism? This lengthy piece goes into the origins and results of the shift in American political thought:



“The smug style is a psychological reaction to a profound shift in American political demography. Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, the working class, once the core of the coalition, began abandoning the Democratic Party…In 1964, it was 55 percent of working-class voters. By 1980, it was 35 percent…The smug recognize one another by their mutual knowing…It is the smug style’s first premise: a politics defined by a command of the Correct Facts and signaled by an allegiance to the Correct Culture…So long as liberals cannot find common cause with the larger section of the American working class, they will search for reasons to justify that failure. They will resent them. They will find, over and over, how easy it is to justify abandoning them further. They will choose the smug style.”



Pro-Clinton PAC spends $1 million to fight online trolling - Daily Beast: “Citing ‘lessons learned from online engagement with ‘Bernie Bros,’ a pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC is pledging to spend $1 million to ‘push back against’ users on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Instagram.

255,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/25/cruz-kasich-campaign-announce-collaboration-to-deny-trump-delegates.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"The presidential campaigns of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich announced late Sunday that they were coordinating their efforts in three upcoming primary states in an extraordinary attempt to prevent Republican front-runner Donald Trump from clinching the GOP nomination before this summer's convention.

In a pair of simultaneously released statements, the campaigns announced that Kasich would pull out of Indiana to give Cruz ""a clear path"" ahead of that state's winner-take-all primary May 3, while the Cruz campaign will ""clear the path"" for Kasich in Oregon, which votes May 17, and New Mexico, which votes June 7.

""Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans,"" Cruz's campaign manager, Jeff Roe, said. ""To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov. Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead.""

The arrangement marks a sharp reversal for Cruz's team, which aggressively opposed the idea of a coordinated anti-Trump effort as recently as late last week. Yet it underscores a bleak reality for the billionaire businessman's Republican foes: Time is running out to stop him.

Trump responded on Twitter shortly before midnight Monday.

A statement from the Trump campaign called the move ""a horrible act of desperation from two campaigns who have horribly failed.""

The Kasich campaign confirmed to Fox News that it had canceled two Indiana campaign events scheduled for Tuesday. As recently as three days ago Kasich's campaign announced investments in Indiana, including the opening of two offices and the creation of a campaign leadership team.

Campaign manager John Weaver said in his statement that the Kasich team hoped to perform well in Oregon and New Mexico, which Weaver said were ""structurally similar"" to northeastern states where Kasich performed well earlier in the cycle.

""Our goal is to have an open convention in Cleveland,"" Weaver added, ""where we are confident a candidate capable of uniting the party and winning in November will emerge as the nominee.""

The announcement came less than 48 hours before voting begins across five Northeastern states where the New York billionaire is poised to add to his already overwhelming delegate lead. Trump campaigned Sunday in Maryland, which will vote on Tuesday along with Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Delaware.

Trump needs 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination. If he falls short, the national Republican gathering in July will evolve into a rare contested convention.

At a rally in Hagerstown, Md., Trump stressed repeatedly that he expects to win the 1,237 delegates needed in the first round of voting to stave off a contested convention.



""I only care about the first. We're not going for the second and third and fourth and fifth,"" said Trump.



Even before the plan was announced, Cruz had all but abandoned the Northeastern states in favor of Indiana, which holds its primary on May 3. Both Cruz and Kasich had cast the state as a critical turning point.



""Keeping Trump from winning a plurality in Indiana is critical to keeping him under 1,237 bound delegates before Cleveland,"" Kasich's campaign said Sunday. ""We are very comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already, and given the current dynamics of the primary there, we will shift our campaign's resources west and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana.""

Indiana will award 57 delegates to the winner of its primary. Oregon and New Mexico have 28 and 24 proportionately awarded delegates at stake, respectively.

256,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/04/27/four-big-takeaways-from-trumps-acela-primary-triumph.html,2,"Whoever dubbed Tuesday, April 26 the “Acela Primary” (because the five states that held primaries on that day coincide with the route of Amtrak’s fastest carrier) needs a refresher in how trains and Republican presidential hopefuls run.

The Washington-to-Boston Acela service is known for the three things: speed, “quiet cars” and higher fares.

You won’t find those first two traits – swiftness and silence – in this boisterous, time-consuming GOP affair. Expensive, yes, but not a joy ride.

Here are four takeaways, now that the Republican local has completed its northeastern course.

Trump Towered. I’ve kept struggling with a way to best characterize Donald Trump’s roll – New York last week; Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island all this week.

One thought: Trump 2016 looks a lot like the American map circa the mid-1700’s. He’s conquered 12 of the 13 original colonies (New Jersey votes on June 7), plus most of the southeast. Except for a few states here and there, Trump controls the American continent east of the Mississippi River.

But now the race moves west. First up: Indiana, on May 3 (more on that in a moment). A week later: West Virginia and Nebraska.

After that, the GOP field spends quality time on the West Coast – two weeks in Oregon and Washington – before a final push in California, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and the aforementioned New Jersey.

The question: Trump has momentum as he steps off the Acela. Then again, so too did Texas Sen. Ted Cruz after he rolled Trump in Wisconsin’s April 5 primary.

From this point forward to California, will it be “nomemtum” or “big mo” for The Donald?

Isn’t It Bromantic? You’ve heard of Rudolph Valentino, but maybe not Jean Acker. She was Valentino’s first wife – best known for supposedly locking him out of the bedroom on their wedding night, never consummating the marriage, yet suing for the legal right to “Mrs. Rudolph Valentino”.

The political marriage between Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (quicker even than Valentino and Acker’s two-month courtship) may not turn out to be as cinematic.

But there is the matter of consummation.

Cruz thinks Kasich intends to cede Indiana to the more conservative Texan; Kasich has told reporters he’s not instructing his followers to switch to Cruz.

It’s anyone’s guess as to whether Cruz and Kasich much care for each other. What I don’t understand: why they felt the need to go public with their hasty nuptials. Other than the obvious reason: they both realize the urgency of the moment – far behind in delegates, needing to defeat Trump soon before he salts away the GOP nomination.

It’s funny how fast things can change in politics: we entered April with Trump looking wobbly; we’ll exit the month with Cruz and Kasich resorting to a bromance that reeks of desperation.

Hoosier Daddy. A word about campaigning in Indiana, home to a pivotal presidential contest and a contentious GOP Senate primary both of which are playing out along “establishment/outsider” lines: if I were working the basketball-crazy state, I’d want one of three individuals by my side – basketball legend Larry Bird, former Indiana University Coach Bobby Knight, or the kid who drained the jumper at the end of “Hoosiers”.

OK, Jimmy Chitwood doesn’t exist in real life and “Larry Legend” isn’t all that political (though he once snubbed Ronald Reagan). That leaves us with Coach Knight, who’s appearing with Trump at a Wednesday evening rally in Indianapolis.

It’s not the first sports endorsement to come Trump’s way – Buffalo Bills Coach Rex Ryan warmed up the crowd for him at a rally the day before New York’s primary. And it begs the question of pro-Trump star power other than the “Apprentice” and Gary Busey, Wayne Newton and Jon Voight.

With polls showing Trump holding a narrow lead among Hoosiers, Cruz could use some star-power of his own – better yet, maybe a Gene Hackman pep talk.

California. The Chicago Cubs have waited 71 years for a World Series appearance; 108 years for a title. California’s absence from the national political picture seems just as pronounced.

Post-Acela Primary, Trump’s delegate count has risen well into the 900’s. That puts him three-fourths of the way to 1,237, which is now officially out of reach for Cruz (until after a first ballot in Cleveland, when pledged delegates can begin switching their votes).

Here’s why California matters more with each passing week: Trump can’t win without taking a gluttonous portion of the Golden State’s 172 GOP delegates (to get to 1,237 on June 7, I’m guessing he’ll have to score 140 delegates); as such, it’s the #nevertrump movement’s last chance to derail him.

In California Amtrak parlance, that primary would be a ticket on the Coast Starlight – a three-day ride along the West Coast that isn’t fast and isn’t cheap.

And unlike Tuesday’s Acela experience: maybe the only real hope of throwing Trump from the train."
257,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/04/27/judith-miller-it-s-what-was-left-unsaid-in-trump-s-speech-that-matters-most.html,2,"What was important about Donald Trump’s much anticipated foreign policy speech Wednesday is what he didn’t say. There was no mention by the self-declared Republican Party’s presumptive presidential nominee of his determination to build a wall between Mexico and the United States and get the Mexican government to pay for it.

There was only a passing reference to his frequent criticism of illegal immigrants, the theme that helped launch his presidential campaign last summer.

There was no mention of letting South Korea and Japan acquire nuclear weapons, or of walking away from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the organization which protected Europe from Soviet aggression which he said earlier had outlived its usefulness.

Though he called the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran a “disaster,” he did not say that he would tear it up on day one or insist that it be renegotiated. He simply declared that Iran would not be permitted to get a nuclear weapon, which is precisely what President Obama said prior to signing his controversial agreement with Teheran.

One of the toughest sections of Mr. Trump’s speech was his withering critique of Hillary Clinton’s expertise and performance as Mr. Obama’s secretary of state.

Mr. Trump did not say he would defend Israel at all costs, though he called the Jewish state “our great friend and the one true democracy” in the Middle East.

He condemned the Obama administration’s abandonment of Middle Eastern Christians, but said nothing about how he would protect them from what he called the “genocide” being perpetrated by ISIS and other jihadi groups.

While he vowed to destroy the Islamic State “very, very quickly,” he gave no clue as to how he would defeat the group which now has billions of dollars in its coffers, tentacles in nine states, and tens of thousands of Arab and foreign fighters battling to build an Islamic caliphate in Syria and Iraq and spread the group’s perverse interpretation of Islam throughout the world. And he did not repeat his claim that President Bush “lied” about Saddam’s having WMD to invade Iraq.

The tone of the billionaire real estate developer’s remarks at Washington’s Mayflower Hotel was also a departure from his often stream-of consciousness diatribes masquerading as speeches.

Mr. Trump read the carefully crafted, but still emotional 40-minute speech on a TelePrompter, inserting some of his trademark verbal grace notes on an impromptu basis.

The speech, his first serious attempt to ally foreign and American concerns about his knowledge of foreign affairs – contained almost none of his earlier jaw-dropping prescriptions for restoring America’s economic and military greatness.

It is unclear whether the speech will reverse the perception abroad of Mr. Trump as a foreign policy amateur, a businessman too ignorant of world affairs and ill-disciplined to learn about them – “Berlusconi with nukes,” as one foreign pundit called him, a reference to Italy’s flamboyant, controversial ex-prime minister.

Mr. Trump mainly repeated his populist themes and his determination to pivot from what he called the “Obama-Clinton” foreign policy, which he said had alienated traditional allies and friends and led the nation’s foes to loose respect for the U.S.

While many Republicans and even some Democrats would agree with his stark critique of some the administration’s contradictory, sometimes too-little, too-late initiatives – a “complete and total disaster,” Mr. Trump called Mr. Obama’s foreign policy – he offered few concrete remedies for restoring the economic strength which he said underpins America’s ability to project power abroad. “I’m on the only one, believe me, I know them all,” he said of his rivals, “who knows how to fix it.” Or, in other words, trust me.

Again and again, he vowed to move toward an “America first” model in domestic and foreign policy, seemingly unaware that “America First” was the slogan of the isolationists who fought to prevent Roosevelt from aiding Britain and other allies threatened with Nazi and Japanese aggression prior to World War II.

His pledge to prevent American companies from moving abroad – how legally he would do that he did not say – and force America’s allies to pay more for their own defense by tougher negotiations with them suggested there remain similar gaps in his knowledge of American law and foreign affairs. Studies have shown that it is cheaper to base the 28,000 American troops in South Korea there than it would be to keep them at home; and South Korea already pays half of those costs.

But critics of President Obama’s foreign policy are likely to dismiss Mr. Trump’s gaffes and contextual omissions as quibbles, and welcome his call for a more robust military, a tougher stance against Islamic radicalism at home and abroad, and an America-centric foreign policy. Republican ""realists"" will also welcome his call to deploy force ""when there is no alternative,"" a pledge which mirrors the isolationist mood of part of his party and the country.

One of the toughest sections of Mr. Trump’s speech was his withering critique of Hillary Clinton’s expertise and performance as Mr. Obama’s secretary of state.

Predictably, he criticized her record of having supported the war in Iraq and other military interventions abroad -- an implicit criticism of President George W. Bush as well. He also accused of her of having “misled” the nation about the attack on America’s consulate in Benghazi, where the U.S. ambassador and “three brave Americans” were killed. Instead of “taking charge” that night, he said, “Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep. Incredible,” he said. “She was not awake to take that call at 3 o’clock in the morning.”

That was not only vintage Trump, but a precursor of what lies ahead if Mr. Trump, indeed, wins the nomination."
258,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/27/cruz-announces-fiorina-as-choice-for-running-mate.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"Ted Cruz, looking for a shake-up in the 2016 race as Donald Trump moves steadily closer to the Republican nomination, on Wednesday announced former GOP primary rival Carly Fiorina as his choice for running mate should he win the party nod.

The move was immediately dismissed as an act of “desperation” by the Trump team, but Cruz – while acknowledging it is “unusual” to announce a running mate so early – defended the decision. He claimed “nobody is getting to 1,237 delegates,” the number needed to clinch the nomination, and voters should “know what [they] will get.”

“After a great deal of time and thought, after a great deal of consideration and prayer, I have come to the conclusion that if I am nominated to be president of the United States that I will run on a ticket with my vice presidential nominee, Carly Fiorina,” Cruz said.

Cruz, together now with Fiorina, was trying to fight Trump's narrative that the race is effectively ""over,"" after the front-runner swept five primary states on Tuesday. But Fiorina, in accepting Cruz's offer, said she's ready to ""fight.""

“I’ve had tough fights all my life,"" Fiorina said. ""Tough fights don’t worry me a bit.”

Cruz made the announcement in the critical primary turf of Indiana, which votes next Tuesday. Speaking at an afternoon rally in Indianapolis, Cruz announced his decision to cheers and chants of “Carly! Carly!” while touting the former HP CEO’s credentials and life story.

The theoretical pairing represents a diverse ticket – offering the possibility of electing the first Hispanic president and first female vice president.

“This is a choice that you are telling the American people that ‘This is an individual that I trust and, more important, this is an individual that you can trust to lead this country, no matter what might happen,’” Cruz said.

But for the time being, Fiorina will hold the odd position of being a vice presidential candidate-in-waiting – as Cruz continues to lag far behind Trump in the battle for the GOP nomination.

Even Fiorina would have to be elected by delegates at the convention. As for Cruz, he’s already been mathematically eliminated from clinching the nomination before the convention, and is relying on the prospect of a Cleveland floor fight.

A highly visible Cruz surrogate, the former HP CEO recently handed over her tax returns to the Cruz campaign for vetting, CNN reported Tuesday, and her name immediately surfaced when Cruz teased a “major announcement” Wednesday morning.

Cruz said Wednesday that he and his family had grown so close to Fiorina that she often sings to his young daughters -- a skill she showed off during her speech -- and also exchanges texts with the young girls.

“And Carly may be the first vice president in American history to have an impressive fluency with hearts and smiley face emoticons,"" Cruz said.



Trump leads Cruz in pledged delegates, 954-562, but Cruz’s strong ground operation has elected many delegate allies to the Republican Convention in July. Cruz believes the battle will proceed to a contested convention, where he hopes to triumph once some pledged delegates become unbound and are free to switch their votes.

Trump on Wednesday morning dismissed the notion of Cruz tapping a running mate.

""First of all, he shouldn't be naming anybody because he doesn't even have a chance,"" Trump said. ""Naming Carly's dumb, because Carly didn't do well. She had one good debate -- not against me by the way, because I had an unblemished record of victories during debates -- but she had one victory on the smaller stage and that was it.""

In a statement later Wednesday, Trump criticized the move as Cruz ""only trying to stay relevant.""

While most presidential candidates wait until they have the nomination sewn up to announce a running mate, Cruz's selection of a vice presidential candidate in April – while he’s well behind in delegates – followed a pattern of somewhat unconventional campaigning including an early embrace of Trump and kicking off his campaign without first forming an exploratory committee.

Fiorina began her career working as a secretary and receptionist but quickly rose up the business ranks and was named in 1999 as the chief executive officer for Hewlett-Packard, becoming the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company.

""Of all the people who didn't make it far in the race, she was one of the best about laying out her plan, talking about who she is and her accomplishments,"" said Doug De Groote, a fundraiser for Cruz based near Los Angeles.

On her website, Fiorina describes her tenure at HP as having “saved 80,000 jobs” during “the worst technology recession in 25 years.” But her time at the helm also drew criticism for alleged deals with Iran brokered through a subsidiary and the laying off of 30,000 employees. In 2004, Fiorina left the company after the board of directors forced her resignation.

Her career as a political candidate began when Fiorina tried to unseat California Sen. Barbara Boxer during an unsuccessful 2010 bid. Boxer on Wednesday mocked the suggestion of Fiorina as Cruz's running mate.

""The best way to describe that ticket is mean and meaner,"" she said. ""He wants to throw people out of the country and she threw thousands of jobs out of the country. Perfect match.""

In May 2015, Fiorina announced her candidacy for president and quickly became known as a feisty critic of Hillary Clinton and a strong defender of the pro-life community. Planned Parenthood immediately panned Fiorina's Wednesday pairing with Cruz as ""the most loathsome pair of anti-abortion extremists in America.""

Her early debate performances were lauded by many critics; however, she never gained traction and suspended her campaign after single-digit finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire. She endorsed Cruz in early March and has appeared often with him on the campaign trail.

When asked about being Cruz’s vice president in early March, Fiorina replied, “Let’s win the nomination first.”

Though she eventually threw her support behind Cruz, Fiorina also attacked him when she was still a competing candidate. She termed him one of the “ultimate insiders” and called him “too divisive” in January.

259,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/29/indiana-gov-pence-backs-cruz-for-president-ahead-state-primary.html,2,"Indiana Gov. Mike Pence on Friday backed Ted Cruz for president, days ahead of the state’s vital Republican primary contest.

The Republican governor announced his choice in an interview on WIBC radio. He prefaced his announcement by saying he likes and respects – and has met with – all three of the Republican presidential candidates.

“I’m not against anybody but I will be voting for Ted Cruz,” Pence said. “I see Ted Cruz as a principled conservative who’s dedicated his career to advocating the Reagan agenda.”

The announcement is a setback for Trump, who has been barnstorming Indiana – with famed Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight by his side – trying to rally voters ahead of Tuesday’s election and sideline Cruz for good.

Cruz is desperately seeking momentum in his fight to block Trump from claiming the delegate majority before the GOP's national convention in July.

Trump swept all five Northeastern primary elections earlier in the week and enjoys a massive delegate advantage over his Republican rivals. Cruz has been mathematically eliminated from earning the 1,237 delegate majority, but insists he can block Trump from the majority as well, as the 2016 contest shifts to ""friendlier terrain"" in the West and Midwest. The Texas senator declared he is ""all in"" on Indiana.

Cruz said earlier Friday he would ""enthusiastically welcome"" Pence's support.

Pence, who faces his own re-election this year, had been under enormous pressure from pro- and anti-Trump factions. Although he is more closely aligned with Cruz, he risks voter backlash in the fall if Tuesday's primary contest shows Indiana is filled with Trump voters.

Pence, though, made sure to praise Trump during his remarks Friday. He commended Trump for giving “voice to the frustration of millions of working Americans with the lack of progress in Washington, D.C.”

260,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/26/trumps-big-sweep-why-winners-aura-matters-more-than-math.html,2,"Presidential campaigns are about media, math and momentum. But in the wake of Donald Trump’s five-state sweep in the Northeast yesterday, it’s time to add another measure.

And that is psychology.

Which may be his biggest advantage.

By adding Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island to his New York landslide, Trump is clearly riding a wave of momentum and positive media coverage.

But when you get to math, the journalistic nitpickers come up with various scenarios in which Trump may not get to 1,237, leaving him vulnerable to a contested convention. Fair enough. (Yes, any other front-runner would have been declared the de facto nominee, but The Donald is a rather controversial fellow.)

Which brings us to the psychology surrounding a candidate who has won state after state in all regions of the country—from Alabama to Massachusetts, from Georgia to New Hampshire, from Florida to Nevada, from South Carolina to Illinois. And look at the margins: 46 percent in Arizona, 46 percent in Florida, 47 percent in Mississippi, 60 percent in New York.

Ted Cruz won Wisconsin by an impressive 48 percent, but outside of his 44 percent victory in Texas, and nearly matching Trump with 41 percent in Missouri, most of his wins have come in caucus states where he has outperformed his rival at the inside game.

Cruz pivoted to a different target last night, saying the media were having ""palpitations"" over Trump's expected big night and that he is the fourth estate's ""chosen"" candidate. That's become a standard Cruz riff, even as Trump gets more than his share of bad press and biting commentary and himself complains about the ""dishonest"" media.

What's true is that as Trump continues to pile up primary wins, the psychology shifts, and most of the media and political establishments now expect him to be the nominee—whether they regard that prospect with excitement or loathing. Six in 10 Republicans say in a recent poll that the candidate with the most votes should be the party’s standard-bearer, magic number or not. Two-thirds of Connecticut Republicans said the same in an exit poll yesterday.

That leaves Cruz, who has way exceeded expectations in this campaign, in the position of arguing that he should be the alternative to Trump, even as he loses state after state. (Yes, Cruz could win Indiana next week, but that doesn’t change the overall equation.)

And it leaves John Kasich, who has won exactly one state—his own—arguing that a fractured convention should turn to him.

The Cruz-Kasich non-aggression pact quickly fizzled, and not just because the two rivals said they still wanted votes in the three states where they are not campaigning in deference to the other guy. It was because their supporters don’t have much in common, and they handed Trump the argument that his opponents are playing insider games to deprive him of the prize.

Psychology isn’t everything. Trump could hit a rough patch as he toggles between appearing more presidential and mocking Kasich’s eating habits. He could underperform in California and New Jersey on June 7.

But the mindset of Trump’s supporters will be anger and disgust if they feel he’s been cheated out of the nomination. And that may matter as much as any numbers.

261,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/05/01/trump-replays-clinton-woman-card-defends-pull-out-middle-east-strategy.html,2,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Sunday defended his criticism that Hillary Clinton’s campaign success is based largely on her being a female candidate and dismissed assertions about him having a soft foreign policy.

“The only card she has is the woman card,” Trump told “Fox News Sunday.” “Even women don’t like her. If she were not a woman, she would not even be in this race.”

The billionaire businessman resumed his Clinton attack following

his sweep in five Northeast primary contests, saying Tuesday that “the only card she has is the woman's card. And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote.”



The front-running Trump also dismissed criticism that he sounded like a liberal Democrat in his foreign policy speech last week by suggesting the United States scale back in the Middle East and focus on domestic spending.

“We need to knock off ISIS and get out of there,” said Trump, who nevertheless continues to argue that overthrowing dictators has been a failed foreign policy strategy that has led to instability in the Middle East.

“Every move we've made in the Middle East has been wrong,” he said, arguing other countries should pay more to protect the world and that more taxpayer money must go to U.S. infrastructure.”

“We can’t have this anymore,” he said. “We are spending all of our money in the Middle East. We need to strengthen our military and pull back … In the meantime our country is becoming Third World. … I will be tougher than” Clinton.

GOP primary rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told ABC’s “This Week” that Trump's policy speech “reflects a weak and naive approach to foreign policy.”

Trump also argued that his attacks on Clinton are no worse than those of her primary challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has questioned the former secretary of state’s qualifications.

While both Clinton and Trump’s favorability ratings among women are low, Trump’s are worse, especially among female general election voters.

However, Trump argued Sunday that his numbers will improve if and when he faces Clinton in the general election.

“Once I start on Hillary, the numbers will change,” he said. “Watch what happens with Hillary. Watch what happens with her numbers.”"
262,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/05/06/trump-really-surprised-by-ryan-holding-back-endorsement.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"Donald Trump said Friday he was “really surprised” by House Speaker Paul Ryan declining to endorse him, telling Fox News he has brought “millions” into the party and is getting endorsements “left and right” – except from Ryan.

Despite the presumptive Republican nominee’s claims, he still faces resistance from some senior GOP figures, including Ryan’s 2012 running mate Mitt Romney, a vocal Trump critic who plans to skip the July convention.

But Trump, speaking on “Fox & Friends,” took a shot at the Romney-Ryan ticket, saying the 2012 election was “a race that should have easily been won.” As for Ryan’s reservations about him, the presumptive nominee said he plans to meet with Ryan next week.

“I was very, very surprised [by his comments],” Trump said. “He talks about unity but what is this about unity?”

Ryan’s office later put out a statement saying he’s invited Trump to meet with House GOP leaders in Washington next Thursday “to begin a discussion about the kind of Republican principles and ideas that can win the support of the American people this November.” The statement said Ryan also will meet separately with Trump, along with Republican Party head Reince Priebus.

Ryan, speaking earlier on CNN, said Thursday he’s not “ready” at this point to support or endorse Trump. He suggested he wants the billionaire businessman to do more to unify the party first, while leaving himself wiggle room to endorse Trump later on.

Trump swiftly fired back in a statement, saying, ""I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda.""

Ryan’s remarks could also cause friction with Trump supporters on Capitol Hill.

Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions told Fox Business Network Ryan’s stance is a “big mistake.”

Republican National Committee Chairman Priebus told Fox News on Thursday that he thinks “it’s going to work out” in the end.

""In some cases people are not going to be instantly on board, and I know that can be frustrating for some people. But I think everyone has to ... allow a little bit of the steam to get out and get everybody settled down. And I think this is going to come together.""

The Ryan comments, though, underscored the lingering tensions within the GOP over Trump’s presumed primary victory, with some continuing to question his conservative credentials and at times taking issue with his tone.

Speaking with Fox News on Friday, Trump did, however, put to rest speculation that he might look outside the party and choose a Democrat for running mate. Trump said he would not do that.

“We want to have a great ticket. The Democrats have been in there for a long time, the economy is terrible,” Trump said. “I’m going to pick a great Republican, and we’re going to have a tremendous victory.”

Trump was asked about whether he might look outside the party for a VP choice after former 2016 candidate Ben Carson – who is involved in the search process – initially told The Wall Street Journal that Trump could look at Democrats and independents.

A spokesman later clarified that Trump plans to pick a Republican."
263,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/05/05/martha-maccallum-its-donald-trumps-moment-and-this-is-how-got-here-america.html,2,"And then there was one.

There is an expression on Wall Street for a stock that just keeps moving up and up, while everybody is scratching their heads trying to figure out what’s going on.

They put their hands up and say “Don’t fight the tape.”

It comes from back in the day when there actually was ticker tape, and when Wall Street wasn’t everyone’s favorite punching bag.

But it helps explain what is going on right now in the mind bending age of Donald Trump.

You can’t fight the tape and you can’t fight a phenomenon. Donald Trump is a phenomenon. Barack Obama was a phenomenon. A phenomenon is a “happening” or an “experience.” It doesn’t happen much folks, but it’s happening now. So get ready for the ride of a lifetime.

The point is all the wise old men and naysayers and chart readers in the world can’t stop a political phenomenon when it’s pulling out of the Trump Train station.

All the wise old men and naysayers and chart readers in the world can’t stop a political phenomenon when it’s pulling out of the Trump Train station.

Nobody was going to beat Barack Obama in 2008. That’s a fact. It was his moment. It wasn’t that John McCain ran a bad campaign, or picked the wrong VP. It was just that it didn’t matter, it was over when it started. It has to do with understanding your moment, reading the populace, knowing that they want exactly the opposite of what they’ve had in the White House. They want a charismatic candidate to match what they are feeling and promise to give them exactly the big fat cheeseburger they’ve been wanting ever since they went on that awful diet.

Michelle Obama told her husband it was Iowa or bust for them. She knew that if they couldn’t win Iowa, they couldn’t win America, but if they could – there would be no stopping them. She told her husband it was now or never and that she would only do this thing once. Even though he was a new senator, she correctly assessed this was their “Moment” and they would not get a redo. She was absolutely right on.

The country was war weary and the handsome young Senator promised “Hope and Change.” Political pendulums swing hard and feed on stark contrast. He was not a Bush and not a Clinton. Not at all. In fact, he was Barack Hussein Obama. He was Kennedy-esque, with a young attractive family. He was Bobby Kennedy’s dream of how the Civil Rights movement crescendos. He was the man who perfectly matched the mood, and he grabbed it. That’s what it’s all about.

Just ask Governor Chris Christie, who missed his moment. Had he run against Barack Obama in 2012, he would have won. The tough talking New Jersey Governor was getting a ton of attention in 2011. He’d shockingly won a blue state governor’s race when the odds were stacked against him. He was “telling it like it is” to anybody who crossed him. He shouted down Teacher’s Unions for depriving kids of the education they deserved. He told firefighters and policeman that the pensions they’d been promised would never arrive, if they weren’t willing to give back a little to keep the programs solvent. These YouTube hits were going viral, getting coverage. The portly governor with his tie askew was the opposite of the snappily dressed lean and eloquent president, who’d lost his shine a bit, four years in.

But while GOP leaders begged Christie to run, he demurred. He said he wasn’t ready. It wasn’t his time. But as it turns out, it was. And he never got it back.

So now we have had 8 years of ObamaCare and Obamanomics. Eight years of promising to end the “Era of War”.

Still we are mired in rising costs, stunted economic growth and an epic battle with an enemy that is a “He Who Shall Not be Named.” Except that everybody knows his name is Radical Islamist Terrorist.

In fairness, the president’s approval numbers have risen of late to 51 percent, many are satisfied. However, it may have something to do with the tenor of the sloppy primaries that have given him almost “former president” nostalgia points already. Still there is an undeniable restlessness in the country. We see it in the crowds who turn out in droves for Bernie and Donald.

As long as it took for Republicans to see, Donald Trump is the perfect storm of message “Make America Great Again” (genius simplicity) and Man. This brash businessman, Anti-Obama sold his brand brilliantly with his huge success on “The Apprentice.” Now Reality TV meets politics. I bet Mark Burnett wishes he’d thought of it. He was from the beginning the guy we all already knew. Love him or hate him, he leapt over the ‘name recognition’ hurdle like it was a parking curb. And it didn’t even cost him a dime.

But surely he would not abide the rigor and tedium of the Campaign Trail. What would he do fly his jet all around the country? Yes. Stay at Holiday Inns in places that don’t have Trump Hotels, um yes.

Surely this rich guy, wouldn’t have a way with voters. He’d rather be in his Tower, as his beautiful wife sips champagne (he doesn’t drink), not out there in flyover state diners and arenas pressing the flesh. Wrong. He would say scandalous things! Yes. Just think of all the tape and tabloid that already existed on this guy? There would be no way he’d get away with it. Wrong again.

Besides, the republicans had the deepest bench they’d had in a long time. Superstars. Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina the list went on. And on, actually. It even spilled across two debate stages, there were so many bright and talented options. All they had to do was nominate the most conservative, electable one, as Bill Buckley had instructed. (See Mitt Romney, John McCain, Bob Dole). And they must remember as Ronald Reagan warned, no shooting inside the tent guys. Well, without apologies to Buckley or Reagan, the guy who beat them all was not your textbook conservative to be sure and he shot up the tent until it fell down on top of them, as he slipped out the back flap and dusted off his suit.

Here’s the thing. His message was right on for his audience. He talked to them about what he felt was wrong with the country and how he wanted to fix it. Too many illegals stealing your jobs and committing crimes? Build a wall. Your company went under? We will get you a better job! Sick of everything being so damned PC? Me too! He said. Don’t worry, we are going to win again. You’ll be so tired of winning. That sounds awesome, they cried! And then -- to top it all off -- he made them laugh. He made them howl actually, at the off-color jokes and “craps” and “hells” he sprinkled in with his happy warrior rants.

The pundits scoffed. It’ll be over by summer… make that fall… The Super Bowl? The Conventions? Forget it guys.

Trump’s son Don Jr. nailed it. He said my Dad is a “blue-collar billionaire” “a common sense conservative,” none of this highfalutin panel jibber jabber. Gimme Trump, the GOP voters said.

The guy gets me.

Donald has wanted this shot at the White House since the early ‘90’s when he took out full page ads and wrote letters railing against Japan and how they were eating our lunch and it needed to stop. Now his handsome, well-educated and well-liked kids are taking the weight off him at the office, and he knows, this is his time. It’s now or never. And one other thing. Don’t look for Mr. Trump to get all presidential on you any time soon. Why would he? As any good businessman knows, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. And like he says, it’s too soon for that.

“I haven’t even started on Hillary….”

But can he seal the deal?

Buckle your seat belts, America. It’s going to be a bumpy ride."
264,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/05/12/trump-ryan-meet-amid-growing-republican-calls-to-unify.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"Donald Trump and Paul Ryan might not have built the bridge but they at least may have established the framework toward presenting a unified front against Democrats in November, after their sit-down Thursday morning on Capitol Hill.

Following a bruising primary season where Trump and House Speaker Ryan were publicly cool toward one another, the two met at Republican Party headquarters in downtown Washington, and later described it as a “great conversation.”

Much was at stake for the presumptive nominee, for Ryan and for the party itself. The meeting was called after Ryan last week declined to endorse Trump – at a press conference following the meeting, Ryan still would not publicly do so.

Reprising comments from a day earlier, Ryan said: “This is a process. It takes a little time. You don’t put it together in 45 minutes. … I don’t want us to have a fake unification process here.”

At the same time, Ryan said he was “very encouraged” and they are “planting the seeds” to get unified.

Trump on Thursday had lined up three meetings with members of the Republican establishment he’s spent much of his campaign railing against. He met first with Ryan and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, who also tweeted that the meeting was a “very positive step toward party unity.” He then sat down with House GOP leaders, followed by a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other top Senate Republicans.

“While we were honest about our few differences, we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground,” Trump and Ryan said in a joint statement. “We will be having additional discussions, but remain confident there’s a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall, and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goal. … This was our first meeting, but it was a very positive step toward unification.”

Trump tweeted afterward:

Great day in D.C. with @SpeakerRyan and Republican leadership. Things working out really well! #Trump2016 pic.twitter.com/hfHY9MdAc7 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2016

A source inside the first meeting also described it as “very positive” and a “good step toward achieving party unity.” According to the source, Trump and Ryan discussed a range of policy issues. The source would not characterize, though, whether Ryan was “there” yet on Trump himself.

But the source provided an unvarnished assessment to Fox News: “No B.S. Very helpful.”

On the sidelines, lawmakers had conflicting views over how to handle Trump as their party nominee.

Pro-Trump Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., told Fox News he’s “baffled” by colleagues who won’t get behind Trump.

Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., though, said he’s among those “who would love to see [Trump] tone it down.”

On Wednesday, explaining his hesitation about outright endorsing Trump, Ryan said he wanted to pursue ""real unification"" among Republicans after a hotly contested primary campaign.

""We cannot afford to lose this election to Hillary Clinton,” Ryan said at a news conference Wednesday.

In a closed-door GOP meeting Wednesday, a number of Republicans stood up and argued in support of Trump, with one saying that anyone who cares about ""unborn babies"" should get behind him because of the likelihood the next president will make Supreme Court appointments, and Trump's would be better than Clinton's, lawmakers who were present told the Associated Press.

Others expressed reservations, and asked Ryan to raise concerns with Trump about where he really stands on social issues and budgetary policies, including changes to Social Security and Medicare. Trump has said in the past that he doesn't want to touch Social Security or Medicare, whereas Medicare cuts have been a centerpiece of GOP budgets Ryan has shepherded over the years.

Earlier Wednesday, Trump sought to downplay the stakes of his visit with Ryan, telling ""Fox and Friends"", ""If we make a deal, that will be great. And if we don't, we will trudge forward like I've been doing and winning all the time.""

Trump's allies and advisers have repeatedly insisted that he can claim the White House with or without leading congressional Republicans. Additionally, Trump's team doesn't believe Ryan or the GOP's other congressional leaders have any significant influence on the majority of general election voters.

Some congressional Republicans have made clear that they would like to see Ryan come around to supporting Trump sooner rather than later.

""Donald Trump is unifying the party already,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., Trump's chief Washington ally. ""The party is the people who vote.""

Another Trump supporter, Rep. John Fleming, R-La., predicted it was ""very unlikely"" that Ryan would not ultimately back the Republican nominee.

Wednesday night, Trump's campaign released an endorsement signed by the chairs of seven House committees. ""It is paramount that we coalesce around the Republican nominee, Mr. Donald J. Trump,"" the GOP lawmakers wrote.

While Trump's team is prepared to shrug off much of the party's establishment, that does not include the RNC.

The political novice plans to rely heavily on the committee's expansive political operation to supplement his bare-bones campaign, which has so far ignored seemingly vital functions such as voter data collection, swing-state staffing and fundraising infrastructure.

""As we turn our focus toward the general election, we want to make sure there's the strongest partnership,"" said Sean Spicer, the RNC's chief strategist.

Absent a viable Republican alternative, there were new signs on Capitol Hill that Trump's conservative critics were beginning to fall in line.

""As a conservative, I cannot trust Donald Trump to do the right thing, but I can deeply trust Hillary Clinton to do the wrong thing every time,"" said Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., adding that he would vote for Trump if that's the choice he has.

Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho., said he will support Trump, although ""I'm not enthusiastic about it.""

""He can get us enthusiastic if he comes to talk to us,"" continued Labrador.

Meanwhile, more Republican voters appear to be moving behind Trump, despite big-name holdouts such as Ryan, both former president Bushes and the party's 2012 nominee Mitt Romney.

Almost two in three Republican-leaning voters now view Trump favorably, compared to 31 percent who view him unfavorably, according to a national Gallup Poll taken last week. The numbers represent a near reversal from Gallup's survey in early March.

265,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/05/19/wreckage-from-egyptair-flight-possibly-found-as-officials-probe-links-to-terror.html,2,"An intense search continued Thursday in the Mediterranean Sea off Greece for wreckage of an EgyptAir flight that went down earlier in the day with 66 people on board, as multiple U.S. officials told Fox News that no explosion was detected by infrared satellites in the vicinity of the crash area.

There were conflicting reports throughout the day as to if any debris from the plane was spotted by search crews.

Officials from EgyptAir initially said debris from the plane was found off the Greek island of Karpathos. Athanassios Binis, head of Greece's Air Accident Investigation and Aviation Safety Board, later told state ERT TV that ""an assessment of the finds showed that they do not belong to an aircraft,"" The Associated Press reported. Binis added that this has been confirmed by Egyptian authorities.

Later in the day, Ahmed Adel, Vice President of EgyptAir, told CNN the debris found Thursday was not from Flight 804.

""We stand corrected on finding the wreckage because what we found was not parts of our plane,"" he said. Adel added the search for wreckage will continue on Friday.

Several U.S. officials told Fox News that spy satellites used to detect missile launches and explosions around the world did not detect an explosion in the area where the EgyptAir flight crashed.

Cairo-bound EgyptAir Flight 804 dropped from the sky hours after departing from Paris. The plane banked and spun sharply before plunging less than an hour before it was due to land in Cairo at 3:15 a.m. local time, according to aviation officials. Authorities have said terrorism was a more likely cause of the crash than technical failure.

Greek military officials said a Greek C-130 military transport plane is still participating in the search for debris from the EgyptAir jet, but a frigate initially sent to the area has been recalled.

A Greek military official told The Associated Press planes had earlier spotted debris 230 miles south-southeast of the island of Crete but still within the Egyptian air traffic control area. Two other floating objects, colored white and red, were spotted in the same area, Greek defense sources told Reuters.

Speaking from Cairo, Egyptian Minister of Aviation Sherif Fathy said the AirBus 320, which left Charles de Gaulle Airport at 11:09 p.m. local time Wednesday and was due in Cairo at 3:15 a.m., ""vanished.""

""I'm not excluding any theory,"" said Fathy, who responded to a reporter’s question by saying that the possibility of a terror attack as the cause of the crash is ""stronger"" than technical failure.

Greek officials say the plane banked and spun sharply just before dropping.

""The plane carried out a 90-degree turn to the left and a 360-degree turn to the right, falling from 37,000 to 15,000 feet and the signal was lost at around 10,000 feet,"" Greece’s Defense Minister Panos Kammenos told a news conference Thursday.

Greek air traffic controllers tried to make contact as the plane left Greek airspace, but the pilot did not respond, he said. They continued to try to reach the pilot until 2:29 a.m. Cairo time, when the plane disappeared from the radar 7 miles southeast of the island of Crete.

What is unknown about the plane's final moments in the air could be consistent with terrorism, David Learmount, a leading British air analyst, told Fox News.

""All this says is that the plane was destabilized . . . it doesn't say why,"" Learmount said.

Learmount said it is possible that a bomb or someone with a gun or knife entering the cockpit could de-stabilize a plane, but also pointed out that a mechanical or technical defect, as well as human error, could also de-stabilize the aircraft.

Congressman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told reporters Thursday he spoke with the head of the Transportation Security Administration.

McCaul added that there are indicators of an event similar to that in October when a Russian passenger plane was blown out of the sky over the Sinai Peninsula using a timed bomb.

Sen. Diane Feinstein, top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters Thursday she hasn't been briefed on the EgyptAir crash but that there was ""strong probability that the plane went down with an act of terror.""

Flight 804 was carrying 56 passengers, including one child and two babies, three security staff and seven crew members, officials said. Fathy said identities would not be released until relatives could be contacted, but described those on board as including 15 French passengers, 30 Egyptians, one Briton, two Iraqis, one Kuwaiti, one Saudi, one Sudanese, one Chadian, one Portuguese, one Algerian and one Canadian.

Among passengers on missing EgyptAir Flight 804 was a student training at a French military school who was heading to his family home in Chad to mourn his mother.

The protocol officer for Chad's embassy in Paris, Muhammed Allamine, said the man ""was going to give condolences to his family."" Allamine said the man, who wasn't identified, was a student at France's prestigious Saint-Cyr army academy.

Another passenger on the flight was an Egyptian man returning home after medical treatment in France, according to two shocked friends who turned up at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport.

""It breaks my heart,"" said one friend, Madji Samaan.

Kuwait's Foreign Ministry identified a Kuwaiti feared dead in the crash as Abdulmohsen al-Muteiri, but offered no other details.

In Paris, relatives started arriving at De Gaulle Airport outside the French capital.A man and a woman, identified by airport staff as relatives of passengers, sat at an information desk near the EgyptAir counter.

The woman sobbed, holding her face in a handkerchief. The pair were led away by police.

Officials offered conflicting reports of an emergency beacon being picked up two hours after the plane had dropped off from radar. The Egyptian military said that no such distress call was received, but didn’t specify whether they were confirming an initial report or dismissing an EgyptAir statement.

Defense officials told Fox News Thursday that the U.S. Navy is flying P-3 reconnaissance aircraft to assist in the search effort.

Another U.S. government official said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has been briefed at least twice on the missing plane, and that at this early stage, everything is on the table as the government is “tied in tight” with French and Egyptian investigators.

The White House also said in a statement that President Obama has been briefed on the crash.

Greece's defense minister, Panos Kammenos, said Greece has a submarine on standby which is participating in a NATO exercise about 100 miles away from the presumed crash area, while F-16 fighter jets stationed on Crete could also be used if necessary. The country already has a navy frigate, two military transport planes and a radar plane participating in the search operation, while he said Egypt had sent a C-130 military transport plane and two F-16s.

Hollande and French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault offered to send military planes and boats to join the search for wreckage.

""We are at the disposition of the Egyptian authorities with our military capacities, with our planes, our boats to help in the search for this plane,"" Ayrault said. He spoke as Hollande held an emergency meeting at the Elysee Palace.

Later, the French military said a Falcon surveillance jet monitoring the Mediterranean for migrants had been diverted to help search for the EgyptAir plane. Military spokesman Col. Gilles Jaron told The Associated Press that the jet is joining the Egypt-led search effort, and the French Navy may send another plane and a ship to the zone.

Hours after the plane disappeared on Thursday, Fathy told reporters in Cairo that the diameter of the search area will widen, moving further south of the island of Karpathos.

Hollande spoke with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on the phone earlier Thursday and agreed to ""closely cooperate to establish as soon as possible the circumstances"" in which the EgyptAir flight disappeared, according to a statement issued in Paris.

In Cairo, el-Sissi convened an emergency meeting of the National Security Council, the country's highest security body. The council includes the prime minister and the defense, foreign and interior ministers, in addition to the chiefs of the intelligence agencies.

The Airbus A320 is a widely used twin-engine, single-aisle plane that operates on short and medium-haul routes. Nearly 4,000 A320s are currently in use around the world. The versions EgyptAir operates are equipped to carry 145 passengers.

The French Prosecutor’s Office said they will launch an investigation into the EgyptAir crash. The country remains under a state of emergency after terror attacks by the Islamic State killed 130 people in November.

The Associated Press reported that around 15 family members of passengers on board the missing flight had arrived at Cairo airport Thursday morning. Airport authorities brought doctors to the scene after several distressed family members collapsed.

The incident renewed security concerns months after a Russian passenger plane was blown out of the sky over the Sinai Peninsula. The Russian plane crashed in Sinai on Oct. 31, killing all 224 people on board. Moscow said it was brought down by an explosive device, and a local branch of ISIS has claimed responsibility for planting it.

In 1999, EgyptAir Flight 1990 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, killing all 217 people aboard. U.S. investigators filed a final report that concluded its co-pilot switched off the autopilot and pointed the Boeing 767 downward. But Egyptian officials rejected the notion of suicide altogether, insisting some mechanical reason caused the crash.

In March, an EgyptAir plane was hijacked and diverted to Cyprus. A man who admitted to the hijacking and was described by Cypriot authorities as ""psychologically unstable"" is in custody.

Sanders easily beat Clinton in the Oregon Democratic primary, and was running neck-and-neck with her in Kentucky, though Clinton claimed victory with less than 2,000 votes separating them and not all precincts counted.

“I say to the leadership of the Democratic Party, open the doors, let the people in,” Sanders said, alluding the Kentucky's voting format which allowed only registered Democrats to vote.

Should Clinton pull out a win in Kentucky, the closeness of the race and her loss in Oregon still prevents her from doing a full pivot to a November general election matchup with Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.

With 99 percent of the precincts reporting in Kentucky, Clinton led Sanders by just over 1,900 votes out of more than 423,000 that were cast.

“We just won Oregon, and we’re going to win California,” the Vermont senator told supporters in Carson, Calif., where he vowed to “take our fight” to July's Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.

Sanders' victory was his 21st of the election cycle and his 11th in the past 17 contests. The win also broke Sanders' streak of eight straight losses in so-called ""closed primaries"", where only registered Democrats can vote.

The Kentucky Secretary of State's office reported that Clinton led Sanders 46.8 percent to 46.3 percent with 100 percent of the votes in. The Sanders campaign did not immediately say whether it will challenge the results in Kentucky, which does not have an automatic recount.

According to an Associated Press tally, Clinton and Sanders each received 27 of Kentucky's 55 Democratic delegates, with one delegate to be awarded to the statewide winner. In Oregon, Sanders had won at least 28 of the Beaver State's 61 Democratic delegates, with Clinton winning at least 24 and nine other delegates outstanding.

Clinton currently has 2,291 pledged delegates and superdelegates to Sanders' 1,528. She requires a total of 2,383 to clinch the Democratic nomination.

Clinton repeatedly tried to turn the focus to Trump while campaigning in Kentucky over the weekend, calling the billionaire real estate mogul a ""loose cannon"" and saying she had ""never heard such reckless, risky talk from somebody about to be a nominee for president than I’ve heard from Donald Trump when it comes to nuclear weapons.""

For his part, Trump taunted Clinton on Twitter shortly after the polls closed in Kentucky Tuesday night.

In Oregon's Republican primary, Trump faced no active opposition in winning 67 percent of the vote. Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz received 17 and 16 percent of the vote respectively, as more than 104,000 ballots were cast for Trump's former rivals.

Trump won at least 17 of Oregon's 28 Republican delegates, with Cruz and Kasich each receiving at least three and five other delegates outstanding. Trump now has 1,160 delegates, just 77 away from the threshold needed to clinch the GOP nomination.

David Learmount said the fire could have started in the plane's avionics compartment. Such a scenario could indicate an electrical fire, and not terrorism, brought down EgyptAir flight 804 on Thursday.

The first physical clues to the crash of flight 804, which carried 66 passengers, crew and security officers, surfaced about 190 miles off the coast of the Egyptian city of Alexandria. Reports of debris being found on Thursday proved false, but the verified debris field could bring authorities closer to the all-important flight data recorder, which could provide insight into what caused the crash.

An EgyptAir official said midday Friday that wreckage of the missing plane has been found, including body parts, luggage and passengers' seats. The announcement came hours after a Greek official also reported evidence being found.

""A short while ago we were briefed by the Egyptian authorities... on the discovery of a body part, a seat and baggage just south of where the aircraft signal was lost,"" Defense Minister Panos Kammenos told reporters in Athens, according to Reuters.

The Cairo-bound flight had left Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris late Wednesday night, and disappeared from radar as it neared its destination. Authorities have said terrorism is more likely than technical failure, but the investigation is still in the early stages.

A flotilla of international ships and boats were searching a wide swath of the sea Thursday and during the night for debris from the ill-fated Airbus 320. The mile-long oil slick was identified from satellite images from the European Space Agency, which cautioned that there was no guarantee the slick was from the missing aircraft. The agency said the slick was about 25 miles southeast of the plane's last known location, and passed the information to relevant authorities late Thursday.

The Egyptian presidency Friday expressed its ""deep sadness and extreme regret"" over the deaths of the passengers and crew members aboard the flight -- the first official recognition of the tragic crash. Egypt’s military also confirmed for the first time Friday that plane debris and passengers’ personal belongings were found in the Mediterranean Sea.

Egyptian army spokesman Brig. Gen. Mohammed Samir wrote on his Facebook page that Egyptian jets and naval vessels participating in the search for the missing plane had found ""personal belongings of the passengers and parts of the plane debris.""

Egyptian airport officials said Friday that three French and three British investigators and an AirBus technical expert had arrived in Cairo to join the investigation.

No terror groups had taken credit for the disaster as of Friday morning, and authorities were going through the passenger manifest, crew members' backgrounds and airport staff for possible links to terror. Authorities said the plane swerved and spun wildly before plummeting into the sea. The Egyptian military said that no distress call was received from the pilot.

In Paris, French authorities scoured Charles de Gaulle Airport, the country's main hub, for any sign of a security breach prior to the flight's departure. Reuters reported that investigators were interviewing officers who were on duty at the airport Wednesday night to determine whether they heard or saw anything suspicious.

""We are in the early stages here,"" a police source told Reuters about the investigation.

The Wall Street Journal reported that French investigators were poring over surveillance footage from the airport, as well as performing background checks of those on board the plane and anyone who may have had ground access to the aircraft.

Flight 804 was carrying 56 passengers, including one child and two babies, three security staff and seven crew members, officials said. Egypt's aviation minister, Sharif Fathy, described those on board as including 15 French passengers, 30 Egyptians, one Briton, two Iraqis, one Kuwaiti, one Saudi, one Sudanese, one Chadian, one Portuguese, one Algerian and one Canadian.

Families of the victims spent the night in a hotel in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, while they awaited the news of their loved ones. Egyptian officials said some arrived from Paris late Thursday, among them eight relatives of the 15 French passengers on board the missing jet.

Later Friday, the relatives of those killed held prayers for the dead at Sultan Hussein mosque in Cairo. Some of them cried as they prayed.

Among those killed were Salah Abu Laban, his wife Sahar Qouidar, their son Ghassan Abu Laban and daughter-in-law Reem al-Sebaei

The relative, Abdel-Rahman al-Nasry, told The Associated Press, ""I ask God for forgiveness. This is very hard for the family.""

Magdi Badr, a family friend, said, ""we pray for the victims.""

In the U.S., Los Angeles International Airport announced Thursday that it was stepping up security in the wake of the EgyptAir disappearance. A statement from airport authorities said they were eliminating or restricting airport worker access to 150 doors in the terminals. The statement also said additional airport police officers had been assigned to monitor employee access points and conduct random screenings.

268,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/05/09/former-facebook-staffers-say-conservative-news-is-deliberately-suppressed.html,2,"Facebook is being accused of fiddling with its formulas to suppress conservative news.

That’s what some unnamed former Facebook contractors told the tech site Gizmodo—and it’s an accusation that strikes at the heart of the social network’s credibility.

Facebook relies on computer algorithms to determine what is “trending,” an influential designation that inevitably boosts traffic for what are deemed the hottest topics. But unbeknownst to much of the public, Facebook hires journalists to tweak these formulas, and this is where the question of political bias has erupted.

Gizmodo reports that Facebook “routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers,” according to a former journalist who worked on the trending designations. And several former Facebook “news curators” told the website that they were told to “inject” certain topics into the trending list, even if they weren’t popular enough to warrant making the crucial list.

Depending on who was on duty, said the unnamed conservative ex-curator, citing fear of retribution from the company, “things would be blacklisted or trending … I’d come on shift and I’d discover that CPAC or Mitt Romney or Glenn Beck or popular conservative topics wouldn’t be trending because either the curator didn’t recognize the news topic or it was like they had a bias against Ted Cruz.”

Facebook denies any political bias. A spokesperson said in a statement: “We take allegations of bias very seriously. Facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum. Trending Topics shows you the popular topics and hashtags that are being talked about on Facebook. There are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality. These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives.”

The Gizmodo account is based on interviews with a handful of ex-employees who chose to remain anonymous and could be pushing their own views. Other former curators told Gizmodo they did not consciously make biased judgments on trending topics, and no one is alleging that Facebook management ordered such actions.

But as Facebook has mushroomed into a mighty media force, one that has content-sharing arrangements with major news organizations, Mark Zuckerberg has always cast his global operation as a neutral platform. If there is a cooking of the digital books that penalizes conservatives, Facebook could face a considerable backlash.

A former curator gave Gizmodo notes he had made of stories that were omitted from trending topics. These included the allegations that former IRS official Lois Lerner improperly scrutinized conservative groups, and stories involving Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the Drudge Report and Chris Kyle, the former Navy SEAL who was killed three years ago.

All this, said the unnamed curator, “had a chilling effect on conservative news.”

The sources also told Gizmodo that stories reported by such conservative-leaning news outlets as Breitbart, the Washington Examiner and Newsmax, which were trending enough to be picked up by Facebook’s algorithm, were excluded unless so-called mainstream sites like the New York Times, CNN and the BBC followed up on those stories.

Facebook’s political stance has been called into question during the presidential campaign.

Zuckerberg, the company’s founder and CEO, took an obvious shot at Donald Trump last month, saying: “I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as ‘others.’ I hear them calling for blocking free expression, for slowing immigration, for reducing trade, and in some cases, even for cutting access to the Internet.” Zuckerberg has also signed a legal brief asking the Supreme Court to uphold President Obama’s executive action limiting deportation of illegal immigrants.

And in March, as part of a weekly internal poll, some Facebook employees asked Zuckerberg: “What responsibility does Facebook have to help prevent President Trump in 2017?”

That prompted a statement from Facebook: “We as a company are neutral — we have not and will not use our products in a way that attempts to influence how people vote.”

With more than 1 billion users worldwide, Facebook wields tremendous influence. The controversy over trending topics could cause some users to question whether the social site is subtly tampering with people’s news feeds to promote or minimize certain political stories or viewpoints."
269,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/05/23/us-lifts-vietnam-arms-embargo-in-move-to-counter-china.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"President Obama lifted the decades-long U.S. arms embargo against Vietnam on Monday in an apparent effort to shore up the communist country's defenses against an increasingly aggressive China – though he faced criticism that the move takes away U.S. leverage to press for human rights freedoms.

Obama announced the full removal of the embargo at a news conference in Hanoi alongside Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang. The president said the move was intended as a step toward normalizing relations with the former enemy and to eliminate a ""lingering vestige of the Cold War.""

The embargo was imposed in 1984. The United States partially lifted the ban in 2014, but Vietnam pushed for full access as it tries to deal with China's land reclamation and military construction in nearby seas.

Obama, in announcing the agreement Monday, said every U.S. arms sale would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis going forward. Vietnam has not bought anything, but removing the remaining restrictions shows relations are fully normalized and opens the way to deeper security cooperation.

""At this stage both sides have developed a level of trust and cooperation, including between our militaries, that is reflective of common interests and mutual respect,"" Obama said.

U.S. lawmakers and activists, though, had urged Obama to press for greater human rights freedoms in the one-party state before lifting the embargo. Vietnam holds about 100 political prisoners and there have been more detentions this year.

""In one fell swoop, President Obama has jettisoned what remained of U.S. leverage to improve human rights in Vietnam -- and (has) basically gotten nothing for it,"" Phil Robertson, with Human Rights Watch, said.

In Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry outwardly praised the move, with a spokeswoman saying China hoped ""normal and friendly"" relations between the U.S. and Vietnam would be conducive to regional stability. China itself remains under a weapons embargo imposed by the U.S. and European Union following 1989's bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square.

Obama said the United States and Vietnam had mutual concerns about maritime issues and the importance of maintaining freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. He said that although Washington doesn't take sides on the territorial disputes, it does support a diplomatic resolution based on ""international norms"" and ""not based on who's the bigger party and can throw around their weight a little bit more,"" a reference to China.

Lifting the arms embargo will be a psychological boost for Vietnam's leaders as they look to counter an increasingly aggressive China, but there may not be a big jump in sales.

Obama was greeted Monday by Quang at the Presidential Palace, where Obama congratulated Vietnam for making ""extraordinary progress."" Quang praised the expansion in security and trade ties between ""former enemies turned friends"" and called for more U.S. investment in Vietnam.

Obama also made the case for stronger commercial and economic ties, including approval of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that is stalled in Congress and facing strong opposition from the 2016 presidential candidates. The deal, which includes Vietnam, would tear down trade barriers and encourage investment between the countries that signed it.

Critics worry it would cost jobs by exposing American workers to low-wage competition from countries such as Vietnam.

Obama and Quang earlier attended a signing ceremony touting a series of new commercial deals between U.S. and Vietnamese companies valued at more than $16 billion. The deals included U.S. engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney's plans to sell 135 advanced engines to Vietnamese air carrier Vietjet, and Boeing's plans to sell 100 aircraft to the airline.

Obama is the third sitting president to visit Vietnam since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Four decades after the fall of Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh City, and two decades after President Bill Clinton restored relations with the nation, Obama is eager to upgrade relations with an emerging power whose rapidly expanding middle class beckons as a promising market for U.S. goods and an offset to China's growing strength.

The United States is eager to boost trade with a fast-growing middle class in Vietnam that is expected to double by 2020. That would mean knocking down auto, food and machine tariffs to get more U.S. products into Vietnam.

270,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/05/27/spotlight-on-libertarian-convention-amid-voter-unease-over-trump-clinton-race.html?intcmp=hpbt2,2,"In a confounding election season where voters hold deep reservations about the likely Republican and Democratic nominees, the third-party Libertarian ticket has a rare chance this year to be more than a footnote in the presidential race.

And that chance – to absorb disaffected voters who have little interest in picking ‘Trump’ or ‘Clinton’ this November – is raising the stakes for the national convention starting Friday where activists with the oft-sidelined movement will choose their nominee.

“There is a huge opportunity in this election cycle,” Libertarian Party Chairman Nicholas Sarwark told FoxNews.com.

Former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, heavily favored to win the Libertarian nomination, has been enjoying the spotlight lately as at least two recent polls have put him in double digits in a three-way race against Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. One Fox News poll showed Johnson pulling 10 percent against the two titans – not exactly in contention, but nevertheless impressive for a party that’s never garnered more than 1 percent of the vote in a presidential election.

Whether Johnson’s numbers reflect growth among libertarians or simply a none-of-the-above choice, the candidate acknowledged in an interview with FoxNews.com, “It’s a combination of both.”

But, presuming he can snag the nod at the Memorial Day weekend convention, which starts Friday and wraps up Monday in Orlando, Johnson indicated he’ll happily fill the role of Trump/Clinton alternative at a time when some voters are seeking out a third-party option. Delegates will nominate a candidate Sunday.

“The nominee for the Libertarian Party is going to be the only third party candidate on the ballot in all 50 states,” he said. “I jokingly say that if Mickey Mouse were [the] third name in any polls, the recognizable figure that he is, [he] would be at 30 percent. But Mickey is not on the ballot in all 50 states.”

While prominent conservatives have floated the idea of a new third party, state ballot access will indeed be a challenge. As Johnson says, the Libertarian Party – already on 32 state ballots – will likely be on all 50 state ballots by November.

Upping his potential appeal to #NeverTrump Republicans, Johnson tapped another former GOP governor, William Weld of Massachusetts, to be his running mate, both fiscal conservatives and social liberals.

“If conservative means smaller government, I think we are the proven commodity,” Johnson said.

He is still short of the needed 15 percent to qualify for the presidential debates. But he believes if he’s in the debates, the ticket could collect electoral votes.

“I would not be doing this if there wasn’t the opportunity to actually win,” Johnson said. “New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska, there are some real opportunities.”

The 15 percent debate threshold may be reachable. His standing in the Fox News poll was consistent with a Monmouth University poll in March that showed him at 11 percent. If the numbers hold, Johnson would far exceed third-party candidate Ralph Nader’s 3 percent in 2000, but still lag behind Ross Perot’s 19 percent in 1992.

Johnson’s optimism about actually winning is tempered by reality and history. Not only does the party have a poor track record in general elections, but Johnson’s poll numbers haven’t always held up either. In the 2012 general election – when Johnson initially ran as a Republican and later as a Libertarian -- he polled at about 4 percent during the campaign but ended up getting less than 1 percent of the popular vote.

Still, the 1.2 million votes represented a record for a Libertarian, and if the party can build on that this year, it could be enough to at least influence the outcome in November – though whether the candidate draws votes away from the GOP or Democratic nominee remains to be seen.

Sarwark suggested they’ll pull from both sides.

“A group of Republicans feel their party’s nomination was stolen from them by a reality TV star. A group of Democrats that supported Bernie Sanders don’t want to support a war hawk, who supports the racist war on drugs and has been a corporate shill,” he said.

Last week, Weld made waves by comparing Trump’s deportation policy to Nazi tactics. But Johnson said they were not holding back on Clinton either, and are reaching out to disaffected Sanders supporters.

“I don’t think there is any question that if Hillary is elected, government is going to expand. With regard to military and foreign policy, she has been an architect,” Johnson said. “Is anything going to change with regards to foreign policy? No.”

There could still be some drama this weekend.

About 1,000 delegates are expected to gather in Orlando. The top contenders are Johnson, anti-virus software developer John McAfee and libertarian media publisher Austin Petersen, and 15 other candidates.

“If Johnson does not win on the first round, it will be mine,” McAfee told FoxNews.com in an email.

Johnson likely isn’t guaranteed a first ballot victory, said William Irwin, the chairman of the philosophy department at King’s College, who has written books on libertarianism, most recently “Free Dakota.”

“Some predicted the libertarian moment has passed. I think the libertarian moment is now,” Irwin told FoxNews.com. “But just like there are Never-Trump and Never-Hillary voters, there are some libertarians who are Never-Johnson. He was sort of an accidental Libertarian who came to the party after he couldn’t get into the [2012] Republican primary debates.”

Johnson, if nominated, could run into trouble with some conservatives – yet attract liberals – as a supporter of abortion rights and marijuana legalization. He also favors military cuts and a reserved foreign policy, while backing sweeping entitlement reforms, changes to the tax code and term limits for members of Congress.

Johnson and Weld, both two-term governors in the 1990s, were given A’s in the libertarian Cato Institute’s Fiscal Policy Report Card for cutting spending and taxes.

“Two governors running against a candidate that has never held office and another who has not held executive office -- the Libertarians would be the most experienced ticket,” Cato Institute Executive Vice President David Boaz told FoxNews.com.

He added, “But this year, experience isn’t what people are looking for.”"
271,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/05/09/iran-carries-out-new-ballistic-missile-test.html,2,"Iran successfully test-fired a medium-range ballistic missile capable of striking U.S. forces in the region as well as Israel, the third such test since the nuclear agreement with Western nations took effect in January, multiple defense officials confirmed to Fox News.

The rogue nation conducted the test in defiance of a United Nations resolution that calls on Iran to cease work on its ballistic missile program.

“Iran has to abide by U.N. resolutions with regard to ballistic missiles tests, and if they have violated or not been consistent with those resolutions, that clearly would be a concern for us,” Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said.

Any ballistic missile launch by Iran is tracked by U.S. military spy satellites which pick up the flash during launch. This case was no different, according to officials.

Gen. Ali Abdollahi, deputy chief of the armed forces' headquarters, said the latest missile tested is very accurate, within 8 meters. ""Eight meters means nothing, it means it's without any error,"" he said. He did not elaborate.

In March, Iran test-fired two ballistic missiles -- one emblazoned with the phrase ""Israel must be wiped out"" in Hebrew -- that set off an international outcry.

Since December, Iran has shipped out its low-enriched uranium, disabled its heavy water reactor in Arak, and weeks ago sold more than $8 million worth of heavy water to the U.S. in compliance with the nuclear deal. However, Iran has ignored separate U.N. resolutions barring the Islamic republic from ballistic missile tests. Fox News was first to report a secret Iranian ballistic missile launch in November.

The test-firing was carried out two weeks ago, Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted Abdollahi as saying. Tasnim is close to the country's powerful Revolutionary Guard, which is in charge of Iranian ballistic missiles program.

The agency said the missile has a range of 1,250 miles -- enough to reach much of the Middle East. Iranian military commanders have described them as a strategic asset and a strong deterrent, capable of hitting U.S. bases or Israel in the event of a strike on Iran.

Analysts say Iran is likely seeking to demonstrate it is making progress with its ballistic program, despite scaling back on the nuclear program following the deal that led to the lifting of international sanction on Tehran.

Last month, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, chief of the Guard's airspace division, said a new, upgraded version of the Sajjil -- a solid fuel high-speed missile with a range of 1,200 miles that was first tested in 2008 -- would soon be ready.

But it was not immediately clear if the missile Abdollahi referred to was the new Sajjil.

The landmark deal does not include provisions against missile launches and when it came into effect on Jan. 16, the Security Council lifted most U.N. sanctions against Tehran, including a ban it had imposed in 2010 on Iran testing missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.

To deal with the restrictions in the nuclear agreement, the council adopted a resolution last July, which only ""calls on"" Iran not to carry out such tests.

Meanwhile, a U.S. official briefed on the latest intelligence told Fox News, ""All signs continue to point to terrorism.""

The official who spoke to the AP claimed he personally examined the remains of some of the plane's 66 passengers and crew at a Cairo morgue. He said all 80 pieces brought to Cairo so far are small and that ""there isn't even a whole body part, like an arm or a head.""

He added that at least one part of an arm had signs of burns -- an indication it might have ""belonged to a passenger sitting next to the explosion.""

The U.S. official speaking to Fox News said American satellites could have missed a potential explosion over the eastern Mediterranean. ""Contrary to popular belief, we cannot see every part of the earth all the time.""

The official said most U.S. satellites would be trained to positons on land and known areas of interest and not focused over an empty part of the sea, particularly the eastern Mediterranean.

The official would not rule out an explosion took place. To date, no terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the EgyptAir disaster.

The Airbus A320 crashed early Thursday morning near the end of a fight from Paris to Cairo.

An independent Cairo newspaper, al-Watan, quoted an unnamed forensics official Tuesday as saying the plane blew up in midair, but that it was unclear whether the blast was caused by the an explosive device or something else. The official also said the remains retrieved so far are ""no larger than the size of a hand.""

But Egypt’s head of forensics denied the statements Tuesday, Reuters reported, citing state news agency MENA.

""Everything published about this matter is completely false, and mere assumptions that did not come from the Forensics Authority,"" MENA quoted Hesham Abdelhamid as saying.

Analysts who spoke to Fox News also said the body parts could have been broken up in a similar way upon impact with water.

Family members of the victims arrived Tuesday at a Cairo morgue’s forensics department to give DNA samples to help identify the remains of their kin, a security official said. The official also spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.

An international effort to hunt for the plane's cockpit voice and data recorder resumed Tuesday, with ships and planes from Britain, Cyprus, France, Greece and the United States taking part in the search.

The search area is roughly halfway between Egypt's coastal city of Alexandria and the Greek island of Crete, where the water is 8,000 to 10,000 feet deep.

The head of Egypt's state-run provider of air navigation services, Ehab Azmy, told The Associated Press Monday that the plane did not swerve or lose altitude before it disappeared off radar, challenging an earlier account by Greece's defense minister.

Azmy, head of the National Air Navigation Services Company, said that in the minutes before the plane disappeared, it was flying at its normal altitude of 37,000 feet, according to the radar reading. ""That fact degrades what the Greeks are saying about the aircraft suddenly losing altitude before it vanished from radar,"" he added.

""There was no turning to the right or left, and it was fine when it entered Egypt's FIR (flight information region), which took nearly a minute or two before it disappeared,"" Azmy said.

Greece's defense minister, Panos Kammenos, had said the plane swerved wildly and dropped to 10,000 feet before it fell off radar.

Greek civil aviation authorities said the flight appeared normal until air traffic controllers were to hand it over to their Egyptian counterparts. The pilot did not respond to their calls, and then the plane vanished from radars.

It was not immediately possible to explain the discrepancy between the Greek and Egyptian accounts of the air disaster.

A 2013 report by the Egyptian ministry of civil aviation records that the Airbus 320 in the crash made an emergency landing in Cairo that year, shortly after taking off on its way to Istanbul, when one of the engines ""overheated.""

It said that the EgyptAir A320 GCC took off from Cairo airport heading to Istanbul at 2:53 and that when it reached an altitude of 24,000 feet, the pilot noticed that one engine had overheated. A warning message appeared on the screen reading, ""engine number 1 stall."" After checking on best measures to take, the pilot headed back to Cairo’s airport where a maintenance engineer inspected the engine, disconnected it, and sent it to be repaired.

There were no injuries, no fire, and no damage to the plane, the report read, adding that the engine had a technical problem.

The report is one of over 60 reports classified by the ministry as incidents, serious incidents and accidents that took place between 2011 and 2014. Among them, 20 involved A320 Airbus planes, the highest among any other aircraft.

Experts contacted by AP said that while an overheated engine is not a common problem, it is unlikely to cause a crash.

David Learmount, a widely respected aviation expert and editor of the authoritative Flightglobal magazine, said, ""engine overheat is rare but it happens.""

He said that the pilot can shut down the engine and aircrafts can operate with a single engine.

""I don't think engine overheat alone has ever caused an aircraft to crash. An engine fire could cause a crash but has not done so in the modern aviation era,"" he added.

273,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/05/29/sanders-tries-to-get-clinton-aggressive-attack-surrogates-off-key-campaign-committees.html,2,"Bernie Sanders is attempting to wage a fight to the finish for the Democratic presidential nomination -- and to upend the party’s “rigged” system -- by trying to remove key convention officials.

The Sanders campaign has called former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank and Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy “aggressive attack surrogates” for Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton.

And it formally requested that Frank and Malloy be removed as co-chairmen, respectively, of the Rules and Platform committees at the Democratic National Convention.

The Democratic National Committee on Saturday rejected the request, saying Frank and Malloy were elected under party rules and that Sanders wasn't alleging any violations of that process.

Frank and Malloy have been “aggressive attack surrogates for the Clinton campaign,” Sanders campaign counsel Brad Deutsch wrote in a letter Friday to the party leaders. “Their criticisms of Sen. Sanders have gone beyond dispassionate ideological disagreement and have exposed a deeper professional, political and personal hostility toward the senator and his campaign.”

The committees are two of the three most-influential committees at the convention in July, helping shape the party’s agenda and message for the general election into November. The other committee is the credentials committee.

“Two of the three Convention Standing Committees are (apparently) being constituted in an overtly partisan way designed to exclude meaningful input from supporters of Sen. Sanders' candidacy,” the letter also stated.



Sander and his supporters from essentially the start of the primary season have accused Democratic National Committee Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and others in the party of playing favorites with Clinton, the establishment candidate.

Sanders says Wasserman Schultz limited the number of primary debates to protect Clinton.

Under party rules, Wasserman Schultz also made roughly two dozen appointments to the three committees.



Meanwhile, Sander supporters allege party leaders have manipulated the process by which delegates are appointed to the convention, creating chaos over such concerns earlier this month at the Nevada state Democratic convention.

Sanders continues to stay in the primary race, despite facing very long odds of winning the nomination. And while party officials seem eager for Sanders to drop out, the self-described democratic socialist continues to try to win delegates in the few remaining state contests to try to exert some influence over the party platform being rolled out at the convention.

“Clinton received the support of over 400 super-delegates before anybody else announced for the race. That’s called an anointment,” Sanders said in a recent Time magazine interview, arguing about an unfair primary system.

“It is clearly undemocratic. It is a way for the establishment to push their candidate forward.”

Even presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, albeit with the likely motive of hurting Clinton’s campaign, has come to Sanders’ defense.

“The Democratic nominating process is totally rigged and Crooked Hillary Clinton and Deborah Wasserman Schultz will not allow Bernie Sanders to win,” Trump said Friday."
274,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/02/state-department-admits-briefing-footage-on-iran-deal-intentionally-deleted.html,2,"The State Department, in a stunning admission, acknowledged Wednesday that an official intentionally deleted several minutes of video footage from a 2013 press briefing, where a top spokeswoman seemed to acknowledge misleading the press over the Iran nuclear deal.

“There was a deliberate request [to delete the footage] – this wasn’t a technical glitch,” State Department spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday, in admitting that an unidentified official had a video editor “excise” the segment.

The State Department had faced questions earlier this year over the block of missing tape from a December 2013 briefing. At that briefing, then-spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked by Fox News’ James Rosen about an earlier claim that no direct, secret talks were underway between the U.S. and Iran – when, in fact, they were.

Psaki at the time seemed to admit the discrepancy, saying: “There are times where diplomacy needs privacy in order to progress. This is a good example of that.”

However, Fox News later discovered the Psaki exchange was missing from the department’s official website and its YouTube channel. Eight minutes from the briefing, including the comments on the Iran deal, were edited out and replaced with a white-flash effect.

Officials initially suggested a ""glitch"" occurred.

But on Wednesday, current State Department spokesman Kirby said someone had censored the video intentionally. He said he couldn't find out who was responsible, but described such action as unacceptable.

While saying there were “no rules [or] regulations in place that prohibited” this at the time, Kirby said: ""Deliberately removing a portion of the video was not and is not in keeping with the State Department's commitment to transparency and public accountability.”

Kirby said he learned that on the same day of the 2013 briefing, a video editor received a call from a State Department public affairs official who made ""a specific request ... to excise that portion of the briefing.""

Kirby says he has since ordered the original video restored on all platforms and asked the State Department's legal adviser to examine the matter. He said no further investigation will be made, primarily because no rules were in place against such actions.

Kirby said he has ordered new rules created to prevent a recurrence.

Speaking Thursday with Fox News, Kirby did not rule out looking further into who might have been behind the request, but said right now: “We just don’t know who made the request or why.”

Kirby also said Psaki, in the 2013 briefing, was not trying to say anybody at the department lied about the Iran deal. “We don’t lie,” he said.

One of the toughest congressional critics of the Iran deal, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, called Thursday for the administration to find who was responsible.

“The Administration must start dealing in the truth. One place to start is to identify the official who ordered the manipulation of the video and impose appropriate discipline,” he said in a statement.

In a statement issued late Wednesday aftrnoon, Psaki, now White House Communications Director, said, ""I had no knowledge of nor would I have approved of any form of editing or cutting my briefing transcript on any subject while at the State Department.""

The Psaki footage took on new significance last month on the heels of a New York Times Magazine profile of Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, who boasted of creating an “echo chamber” to sell the Iran deal.

Rhodes later claimed they did not mislead the public and “confirmed publicly” there were “discreet channels of communication established with Iran in 2012.”

Yet in a February 2013 briefing, then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland claimed there were no secret, direct talks with Iran at the time. It was Psaki’s explanation of that briefing, months later in December, that was later scrubbed from the footage archives.

275,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/05/31/former-state-dept-watchdog-debunks-central-clinton-email-claim.html,2,"EXCLUSIVE: The State Department’s former top watchdog, in an interview with Fox News, rejected Hillary Clinton’s repeated claims that her personal email use was in line with her predecessors’ – while saying he would have immediately opened an investigation if he caught wind of a secretary of state using such an account.

Howard Krongard, a George W. Bush administration appointee who served as the State Department inspector general from April 2005 to January 2008, cited his own experience in challenging Clinton’s insistence that her practices were nothing out of the ordinary.

“Certainly to my knowledge at least, Secretary [Condoleezza] Rice did not have a personal server. I certainly never either sent an email to one or received an email from one,” said Krongard, who served during Rice’s tenure.

Further, he said, “I would have been stunned had I been asked to send an email to her at a personal server, private address. I would have declined to do so on security grounds and if she had sent one to me, I probably would have started an investigation.”

Krongard noted that during Clinton’s four-year term, from January 2009 to January 2013, there was no Senate-confirmed inspector general in place. Suggesting the Clintons show a pattern of avoiding oversight, Krongard indicated that Hillary Clinton benefited from the fact there was no IG during her term.

""I would’ve been the most unpopular person in that building [had I been there],"" Krongard said, emphasizing that the inspector general has broad powers and the ability to rein in even the most senior political appointees. ""They are the people who enforce the rules, and there was no one enforcing the rules during that time.""

Krongard spoke with Fox News before the current State Department inspector general’s office, led by Steve A. Linick, issued an extensive report on email practices of previous secretaries of state.

The day that report was issued, Clinton said in an interview that her use of personal email was consistent with predecessors Colin Powell and Rice.

""Just like previous secretaries of state, I used a personal email. Many people did. It was not at all unprecedented,"" she said.

But, as Krongard indicated, the May 25 IG report clearly stated that Rice did not use personal email for government business. It said Powell used personal email on a limited basis to connect with people outside the department, and he worked with the State Department to secure the system. The report found Clinton did neither.

The report concluded Clinton’s use of a private server and account was not approved, and broke agency rules. The report said by the time she became secretary, the rules had repeatedly been updated, and were “considerably more detailed and more sophisticated.”

Krongard resigned from the IG position in December 2007 after accusations he blocked Iraq-related investigations, charges he denied.

Regarding the 2,100 emails on Clinton’s server found to have contained classified information -- and another 22 “Top Secret” messages containing intelligence deemed too damaging to national security to make public – Krongard questioned how that material got there. He said it would take a deliberate act for the intelligence to ""jump the gap"" between the classified computer networks and Clinton's personal server.

""It could be done by taking a screen shot with … a camera of a classified email, take a screen shot and send it to an unclassified network. It could be copied, but there are restrictions in the State Department and elsewhere as to what copiers can work from a classified network and it can only be a secure copier. So that may not have been easy,"" Krongard said.

Asked if it could happen by accident, Krongard simply said, ""No.""

He also challenged Clinton and State Department claims that the emails in question were “retroactively classified.”

""I don't understand it, because it was either classified by the creator or it was classified by reason of where it came from or what network it was on,” Krongard said.

Clinton consistently has claimed nothing she sent or received was marked classified at the time. While technically correct, this distinction also appears misleading. A January 2009 non-disclosure agreement signed by Clinton confirms her understanding that ""classified information is marked or unmarked.”

Rather, it is the content and source that determine classification. Former intelligence officials say the emails were improperly handled by Clinton and her team and, once reviewed by the authority that originated the information, the emails were given proper classification markings.

While there is no public confirmation the Clinton server was breached, former senior military and intelligence officials -- including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, and former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Mike Flynn – have said they believe foreign intelligence services targeted Clinton's email system.

In a recent interview with Fox News, the Romanian hacker who goes by the name Guccifer said he accessed the Clinton server with ease in March 2013. Anonymous government officials were quick to dismiss the hacker's claims, while admitting he was very skilled and breached the accounts of 100 Americans, including Powell."
276,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/06/as-clinton-moves-to-brink-nomination-sanders-eyes-california-upset.html,2,"While Hillary Clinton moved to the brink of clinching the Democratic presidential nomination with weekend wins in Caribbean contests – and could pass the milestone with a victory Tuesday evening in New Jersey – polls show Bernie Sanders still could deliver a symbolic wound by taking the Democratic stronghold of California.

Several recent polls have shown the Vermont senator closing Clinton’s lead in California and bringing the race into toss-up territory. The latest, from CBS News, showed Clinton up just 2 points over Sanders, 49-47 percent.

The same poll gave Clinton a comfortable double-digit lead in New Jersey, which is voting Tuesday alongside California and four other states in the last major primary day of the year.

Thanks to strong victories for the Democratic front-runner over the weekend in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, she is now in striking distance of the nomination -- 26 delegates short of the 2,383 needed to win, according to an Associated Press count. New Jersey could put her over the top Tuesday evening, before California even wraps up.

But an after-the-fact victory for Sanders in the Golden State would nevertheless be a blow to Clinton, who is trying to not only clinch the nomination but unify the party and nudge Sanders out of the race for good. A California win could energize Sanders and his supporters and encourage him to follow through on vows to take his fight all the way to the convention.

In a sign of what’s at stake, both candidates were barnstorming California ahead of Tuesday’s elections.

As the Puerto Rico race was called, Clinton was on stage in Sacramento, rallying voters in California.

Clinton captured at least 33 of the 60 delegates at stake in Puerto Rico. Sanders garnered at least 20, with seven outstanding. Clinton has 1,809 pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses; Sanders has 1,520. When including superdelegates, her lead over Sanders is substantial -- 2,357 to 1,566.

The former New York senator and secretary of state is all but certain to secure the Democratic nomination Tuesday, when six states hold primaries in which a total of 694 delegates are available.

Like Clinton, Sanders made little mention of the outcome in Puerto Rico's primary. He said during an evening rally in San Diego that Democratic leaders should take notice that the ""energy and grassroots activism"" that will be crucial to the party in the fall ""is with us, not Hillary Clinton.""

He pointed to polls showing him faring better than Clinton in head-to-head matchups with Trump and his strength among Democratic voters under the age of 45.

""If the Democratic leadership wants a campaign that will not only retain the White House but regain the Senate and win governors' chairs all across this country, we are that campaign,"" he said.

While those watching the results in Puerto Rico focused on their impact on the race for the Democratic nomination, the focus of many voters on the island was its ongoing economic crisis.

Both Sanders and Clinton had pledged to help as the island's government tries to restructure $70 billion worth of public debt the governor has said is unpayable.

Two weeks before the primary, Sanders criticized a rescue deal negotiated by U.S. House leaders and the Obama administration as having colonial overtones. In a letter to fellow Senate Democrats, Sanders said the House bill to create a federal control board and allow some restructuring of the territory's $70 billion debt would make ""a terrible situation even worse.""

He later promised to introduce his own legislation to help the island. Campaigning on the island last month, Sanders promised to fight against ""vulture funds"" on Wall Street that he said would profit off the fiscal crisis.

""That bill is anti-democratic and it's not in the best interest of Puerto Rico,"" said Jorge Gaskins, a 67-year-old farmer who supports Sanders and opposes a control board.

Clinton has said she has serious concerns about the board's powers, but believes the legislation should move forward, or ""too many Puerto Ricans will continue to suffer.""

277,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/06/06/muhammad-alis-hometown-remembers-champ-at-interfaith-services.html,2,"Muhammad Ali's younger brother wept, swayed to hymns and hugged anyone he could reach. He raised his hands to the sky, eyes closed, surrounded by congregants at the church where their father once worshipped.



Rahaman Ali took center stage at the two-hour service at King Solomon Missionary Baptist Church, sitting in a front-row pew with his wife, Caroline. The church is not far from the little pink house in Louisville's west end where the Ali brothers grew up.



It was one of several emotional remembrances Sunday as the city joined together to mourn its most celebrated son, the Louisville Lip. Later this week, politicians, celebrities and fans from around the globe are expected for a Friday memorial service that Ali planned himself with the intent of making it open to all.



An airplane carrying the boxing great's body landed in his grieving hometown Sunday afternoon.



At services all over town, they recited Ali's words on religion: ""Rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, oceans all have different names, but they all contain water,"" Ali once said. ""So do religions have different names, and they all contain truth.""



At a Sunday evening memorial at the Louisville Islamic Center, speakers from many faiths -- Muslims, Christians, Catholics, Jews -- lamented that Ali's death came at a time when political rhetoric is getting more divisive.



They did not mention Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump by name, but the reasons for the theme were clear. The Republican presidential candidate said he would temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States, a proposition Ali used one of his last public statements to rebuke.



""When the clamor of the disaffected targets those considered other we need someone to cry out that people are not born other -- we make them other, through our fear, through our prejudice, our hatred, our desire to grasp for more than is rightfully ours,"" said Rev. Derek Penwell, who leads a Christian church in Louisville. ""We need a voice who knows that true power is to help us to see that our determination to love in spite of our fear is the greatest expression of power that human beings can muster.""



Ali famously converted to the Islamic faith and refused to fight in the Vietnam War, though it cost him years of his boxing career. He insisted throughout his life that people of all faiths and colors should come together in peace, and the speakers at the Islamic Center pondered whether anyone else has the strength or statute to take on the fight.



""Now who will push back the agents of hatred and watch our back?"" asked Dr. Muhammad Baber. ""When we fight these demons of Islamophobia, who will show the light to our youth surrounded by traitors of terror? ... Who will testify for our innocence in this season of witch hunting?""



Even after his conversion, Ali sometimes attended King Solomon Missionary Baptist Church. Ali's father, Cassius Clay Sr., a painter, was an active member of the congregation before his death decades ago. He painted a mural of Jesus' baptism that still hangs behind the pulpit.



""There is no greater man that has done more for this city than Muhammad Ali,"" the church's assistant pastor, Charles Elliott III, said Sunday morning, drawing a round of ""amens"" and prolonged applause from the congregation.



Elliott recalled the comical side of the former boxing champion and global humanitarian, who died Friday night at an Arizona hospital.



Elliott said his grandmother was once a nanny to Ali's family. He visited as a wide-eyed young boy, he said, and recalled the house had an elevator and a parrot who called out: ""Here comes the champ, here comes the champ.""



His father, the Rev. Charles Elliott Jr., knew Ali for decades and remembered his generosity. He recalled when he was raising money in the 1960s to keep a program running to feed the city's hungry, and Ali cut him a check. At the time, the program offered food twice a week, he said.



""He came in and he said, `Reverend, let's feed `em every day. I'll give you a check.""'

""I know how hard this job can be. That’s why I know Hillary will be so good at it,"" the president said, in the video posted on Clinton's campaign site. ""In fact, I don’t think there’s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office.""

The president made clear he would no longer stand on the sidelines, even as Vermont Sen. Sanders vows to stick out the race at least through the final primary in Washington, D.C., next Tuesday.

The Clinton campaign separately announced that she and Obama would campaign together June 15 in Green Bay. Clinton tweeted that she's ""fired up.""

Honored to have you with me, @POTUS. I'm fired up and ready to go! -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 9, 2016

Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump immediately fired back.

To which the Clinton campaign tweeted: ""Delete your account.""

Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden voiced his support of Hillary Thursday evening at the American Constitution Society's national convention.

""Anybody who thinks that whoever the next president is -- and God willing, in my view, it will be Secretary Clinton.""

The White House, meanwhile, said Obama recorded the video on Tuesday, the day Clinton effectively wrapped up the nomination.

The video was released shortly after Obama met in the Oval Office with Sanders.

Sanders afterward struck a conciliatory tone Thursday, saying he plans to meet soon with Clinton to discuss how they can “work together to defeat Donald Trump.”

The Vermont senator said he still plans to compete in next Tuesday’s Washington, D.C., primary, the final contest on the calendar. And he said he plans to take his message “to the Democratic National Convention” in July.

He did not, however, say specifically whether he would still be an active candidate by then, taking no questions from the press before heading over to a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.

The meeting with Obama was private. They met for over an hour, and Fox News is told no staff or aides were present.

But his tone, compared with his defiant speech early Wednesday after Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination, appeared to soften.

While offering no endorsement himself, Sanders said he spoke with Clinton and congratulated her “on her very strong campaign.”

And Sanders thanked Obama for his “impartiality” throughout the process. He said he and Vice President Biden lived up to their pledge not to put their “thumb on the scales.”

White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said Sanders has the right to make campaign decisions on his own timeline. Another former primary candidate, ex-Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, did endorse Clinton, saying ""it is time now to unite our party.""

Clinton and Obama, along with other party leaders, are eager to bring Sanders – and his supporters – into the fold.

The president's endorsement reflects their desire to unify as the general election battle between Clinton and presumptive rival Trump intensifies.

Sanders acknowledged a common political enemy, railing against Trump in his brief remarks to reporters Thursday afternoon and saying he’ll do everything in his power to prevent Trump’s election.

As for what he wants, Sanders said he’ll continue to fight what he called the “drift” toward an oligarchic society. He lamented childhood poverty rates, crushing college debt, crumbling infrastructure and other woes and said these are the issues he’ll bring to the Philadelphia convention.

Whether that means a fight to overhaul the party platform – or a last-ditch bid to somehow deny Clinton the nomination – remains to be seen.

One demand Sanders was thought to be considering – as part of a party-unity deal -- is the removal of Democratic boss Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Sanders and the DNC chairwoman have been at odds for months, with Sanders’ team long accusing her of helping now-presumptive nominee Clinton.

Whether Sanders sought – and the president would even consider – a Schultz sacrifice is unclear.

“I don’t see how she makes it through the convention,” one Democratic lawmaker told Fox News. “The key to Hillary winning is getting Sanders supporters on board.”

Speculation over Wasserman Schultz’ position has swirled for months, however, and so far she has retained the public support of the White House. Obama also endorsed her earlier this year in her House primary battle.

Asked Wednesday about the possibility of Sanders seeking her removal, Wasserman Schultz said she’s not worried about her job.

“I'm going to be remaining as the chair of the Democratic National Committee as President Obama has asked me to do until January 21, 2017, and I appreciate the president’s support,” she said."
279,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/07/clinton-has-delegates-to-win-dem-nomination-ap-reports-sanders-questions-tally.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"Hillary Clinton has earned enough delegates to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination, according to an Associated Press count released Monday night – an assessment swiftly challenged by primary rival Bernie Sanders and his campaign.

The AP released its updated tally, showing the former secretary of state winning enough delegates to become the first woman to top a major party’s presidential ticket, on the eve of the last major day of primary voting.

The AP said Clinton reached the 2,383 delegates needed to become the presumptive Democratic nominee with a weekend victory in Puerto Rico and late burst of support from superdelegates. Those are party officials and officeholders, many of them eager to wrap up the primary, free to support whichever candidate they want.

""We really need to bring a close to this primary process and get on to defeating Donald Trump,"" said Nancy Worley, a superdelegate who chairs Alabama's Democratic Party and provided one of the last endorsements to put Clinton over the top.

""It's time to stand behind our presumptive candidate,"" said Michael Brown, one of two superdelegates from the District of Columbia who came forward in the past week to back Clinton before the city's June 14 primary. ""We shouldn't be acting like we are undecided when the people of America have spoken.""



Clinton touted the news at a Long Beach, Calif., campaign event, saying the campaign is now on the “brink of a historic … unprecedented moment.” But even she stressed that six states are yet to vote on Tuesday and urged supporters to cast their ballots for her in those contests.

The six states to vote Tuesday include New Jersey, North Dakota, New Mexico, Montana, California, and South Dakota.

Campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement: “This is an important milestone, but there are six states that are voting Tuesday, with millions of people heading to the polls, and Hillary Clinton is working to earn every vote. We look forward to Tuesday night, when Hillary Clinton will clinch not only a win in the popular vote, but also the majority of pledged delegates.""

The Sanders campaign rejected the declaration that Clinton had clinched the party nod, citing its longstanding position that the superdelegates should not count until they actually vote at the convention – as they are free to switch sides before then.

""There is nothing to concede,"" Sanders told KTVU late Monday at a rally in San Francisco. ""Secretary Clinton will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to win the Democratic nomination. She will be dependent on superdelegates. They vote on July 25th so right now our goal right at this moment [is to] do everything we can to win the primary tomorrow.""

Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs accused the media of “a rush to judgement"" and ""ignoring the Democratic National Committee’s clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer.""

""Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump,"" Briggs said.

On Monday, Sanders' supporters expressed disappointment that the calls were made before California's primary and urged the senator to continue on despite the pronouncements. ""We're going to keep fighting until the last vote is counted,"" said Kristen Elliott, a Sanders' supporter from San Francisco who attended the rally.

Said another attendee, Patrick Bryant of San Francisco: ""It's what bookies do. They call fights before they're over.""

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi endorsed Clinton during an interview on “Good Morning America” before her home state’s primary.

""I'm a voter in California and I have voted for Hillary Clinton for president of the United States and proud to endorse her for that position,"" Pelosi said, though adding ""it's not over until it's over.""

Clinton has won 1,812 pledged delegates in primaries and caucuses. She also has the support of 571 superdelegates, according to an Associated Press count. The AP surveyed all 714 superdelegates repeatedly in the past seven months, and only 95 remain publicly uncommitted.

All the superdelegates counted in Clinton's tally have unequivocally told the AP they will back her at the convention and not change their vote. Since the start of the AP's survey in late 2015, no superdelegates have switched from supporting Clinton to backing Sanders.

Clinton’s presumptive victory Monday came nearly eight years to the day after she conceded her first White House campaign to Barack Obama. Back then, she famously noted her inability to ""shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling.""

Campaigning this time as the loyal successor to Obama, Clinton fended off a surprisingly strong challenge from Vermont Sen. Sanders. He mobilized millions with a fervently liberal message and his insurgent candidacy revealed a deep level of national frustration with politics-as-usual, even among Democrats who have controlled the White House since 2009.

Clinton outpaced Sanders in winning new superdelegate endorsements even after his string of primary and caucus wins in May. Following the results in Puerto Rico, it is no longer possible for Sanders to reach the 2,383 needed to win the nomination based on the remaining available pledged delegates and uncommitted superdelegates, according to the AP.

Clinton leads Sanders by more than 3 million cast votes, by 291 pledged delegates and by 523 superdelegates. She also won 29 caucuses and primaries compared to his 21 victories.

Echoing the sentiments of California Gov. Jerry Brown, who overcame a decades-long rivalry with the Clinton family to endorse her last week, many superdelegates expressed a desire to close ranks around a nominee who could defeat Trump in November.

Beyond winning over millions of Sanders supporters who vow to remain loyal to the self-described democratic socialist, Clinton faces challenges as she turns toward November, including criticism of her decision to use a private email server run from her New York home while serving as secretary of state. Her deep unpopularity among Republicans has pushed many leery of Trump to nevertheless embrace his campaign.

""This to me is about saving the country and preventing a third progressive, liberal term, which is what a Clinton presidency would do,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan told the AP last week after he finally endorsed Trump, weeks after the New Yorker clinched the GOP nomination.

Yet Clinton showed no signs of limping into the general election as she approached the milestone, leaving Sanders behind and focusing on lacerating Trump. She said electing the billionaire businessman, who has spent months hitting her and her husband with bitingly personal attacks, would be a ""historic mistake.""

""He is not just unprepared. He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,"" Clinton said last week in a speech that was striking in its forcefulness, previewing a brutal five-month general election campaign to come.

Even without the nomination, Sanders can claim ideological victory. His liberal positions pushed the issue of income inequality into the spotlight and drove Clinton to the left on issues such as trade, Wall Street and campaign finance reform.

But she prevailed, in part, by claiming much of the coalition that boosted Obama. She won overwhelming support from women and minorities, catapulting her to decisive victories in diverse, delegate-rich states such as New York and Texas.

When Clinton launched her campaign last April, she did so largely unopposed, having scared off more formidable challengers by locking down much of the party's organizational and fundraising infrastructure. Vice President Joe Biden, seen as her most threatening rival, opted not to run in October.

Of the four opponents who did take her on, Sanders was the only one who emerged to provide a serious challenge. He caught fire among young voters and independents, his campaign gaining momentum from a narrow loss in Iowa in February and a commanding victory in New Hampshire. His ability to raise vast sums of money online gave him the resources to continue into the spring.

But Clinton vowed not to repeat the failings of her 2008 campaign and focused early on winning delegates, hiring help from Obama's old team before launching her campaign. They pushed superdelegates into making early commitments and held campaign appearances in areas where they could win the most pledged delegates.

Her victory in Nevada in late February diminished concerns from allies about her campaign operation. Decisive wins in Southern states on Super Tuesday and a sweep of March 15 contests gave her a significant delegate lead, which became insurmountable by the end of April after big victories in New York and in the Northeast.

She now moves on to face Trump, whose ascent to the top of the Republican Party few expected. The brash real estate mogul and reality TV star has long since turned his attention from primary foes to Clinton, debuting a nickname — ""Crooked Hillary"" — and arguing she belongs in jail for her email setup.

After a long primary campaign, Clinton said this past weekend in California she was ready to accept his challenge.

""We're judged by our words and our deeds, not our race, not our ethnicity, not our religion,"" she said Saturday in Oxnard. ""So it is time to judge Donald Trump by his words and his deeds. And I believe that his words and his deeds disqualify him from being president of the United States.""

The Massachusetts senator, who at one time was under pressure from progressive groups to run herself, met with the now-presumptive nominee at her Washington, D.C., home for about an hour.

She did not take questions from the press.

A Clinton official later told Fox News Clinton thanked Warren for her endorsement, and they talked about working together over the course of the campaign to advance a progressive agenda.

The meeting comes after Warren on Thursday threw her support behind Clinton, following President Obama in sending a signal to progressive voters now backing Bernie Sanders that it's time to unite around the presumptive nominee.

""I am ready to get in this fight and work my heart out for Hillary Clinton to become the next president of the United States and to make sure that Donald Trump never gets anyplace close to the White House,"" the Massachusetts senator said on MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show.""

Warren was the only holdout among the Senate's Democratic women and, given her stature among liberals, her endorsement was seen as a potentially important boost for Clinton.

Moreover, signing on Warren as a running mate could energize a base that has its reservations about Clinton.

In an interview with Politico, Clinton said earlier this week that Warren is “qualified” for any role including VP. It’s unclear how seriously she may be under consideration.

But she already has taken on the role of lead attack dog for the Democrats against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Amid the buzz Friday morning, Trump said on Twitter he hopes Clinton does pick her as running mate.

The liberal lawmaker increasingly has tangled with Trump, at times more effectively than other Democrats, including Clinton herself. Trump has lashed back, labeling her ""Goofy Elizabeth Warren"" and ridiculing her claims to Native American heritage.

Ahead of her endorsement Thursday, Warren spoke to the American Constitution Society and attacked Trump as a ""loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud.""

Trump headlined the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s “Road to Majority” summit while Clinton addressed a Planned Parenthood national conference.

Trump, looking to solidify his standing with evangelical Christians, offered assurances Friday that he would “restore respect for people of faith” -- and stressed the “sanctity and dignity of life.”

If there was any doubt he wanted to throw Clinton's Planned Parenthood speech into sharp relief, he took on his presumptive rival later in his remarks. Trump warned Clinton would ""appoint radical judges,"" eliminate the Second Amendment, ""restrict religious freedom with government mandates,"" and ""push for federal funding of abortion on demand up until the moment of birth.""

He also cast her support for bringing in Syrian refugees as a potential clash of faiths. ""Hillary will bring hundreds of thousands of refugees, many of whom have hostile beliefs about people of different faiths and values,"" he said.

Clinton, meanwhile, in her first speech as the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee, said a Trump presidency would take the country back to a time “when abortion was illegal … and life for too many women and girls was limited.”

Clinton thanked the nonprofit women’s health group and abortion provider for their support in the Democratic primary race. In January, Planned Parenthood backed Clinton, offering its first-ever primary endorsement in the group’s 100-year history.

Clinton made it clear that women’s issues would be a staple of her campaign, promising abortion rights supporters that she would “always have your back” if elected president.

Clinton repeated claims that Trump wants to “take America back to a time when women had less opportunity” and freedom.

“Well, Donald, those days are over. We are not going to let Donald Trump -- or anybody else -- turn back the clock,” she told the cheering crowd.

Before arriving at the event, Clinton held a private meeting at her D.C. home with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been rumored to be a consideration for running mate.

Echoing some of the attacks Warren has made in recent days, Clinton attempted to elevate the importance of this election.

“We are in the middle of a concerted, persistent assault on women’s health across the country,” warned Clinton, who said the 2016 election was “profoundly different” than previous elections.

In what is a campaign trail staple of hers, Clinton highlighted Trump’s insults toward women and asserted that it would be “hard to imagine depending on him to defend the fundamental rights of women.”

Trump, meanwhile, continued calling Clinton, “crooked Hillary” and referred to her ongoing email scandal. He took her to task on her domestic and foreign policy stances.

Trump was interrupted by protesters at the annual gathering of evangelical Christians. The protesters shouted “Stop hate! Stop Trump!” and “refugees are welcome here.”

Trump called the chants “a little freedom of speech” but added it was also “a little rude, but what can you do?”"

A gunman who pledged allegiance to ISIS opened fire early Sunday morning in a packed Orlando nightclub, killing 50 people and wounding at least 53 more in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack Sunday afternoon via its Amaq news agency, Reuters reported. Amaq said an ""Islamic State fighter"" carried out the assault. It was not clear, however, if the shooting was actually directed by the terror group or only inspired by it.



The attack in Orlando at Pulse, which bills itself as ""the hottest gay bar"" in the city and was packed with more than 300 people for ""Latin Night,"" was reported minutes after 2 a.m. Sunday.

It ended hours later when police stormed the building and killed the shooter.

Dozens of partygoers remained hostage in the club for several hours after the initial shooting, prompting SWAT teams to rush inside. Shortly after 6 a.m. local time, Orlando police tweeted that the gunman had been killed. Authorities said there was not believed to be any further threat to the area.

""We know enough to say this was an act of terror and an act of hate,"" President Obama said in a speech from the White House on Sunday, cautioning that it was still early in the investigation.

House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Rep. Adam Schiff said in a statement that the timing and location of the attack and information coming from local authorities indicated ""an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism.""

Thank youu i jumped out theres people still hiding inside the closets that the shooters dont know theyre in there https://t.co/NoOIud4Hxe — Juan Rivera (@InfamousJuan_) June 12, 2016

""The fact that this shooting took place during Ramadan and that ISIS leadership in Raqqa has been urging attacks during this time, that the target was an LGBT night club during Pride, and – if accurate – that according to local law enforcement the shooter declared his allegiance to ISIS, indicates an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism,"" Schiff said. ""Whether this attack was also ISIS-directed, remains to be determined. I’m confident that we will know much more in the coming hours and days.""

The gunman, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, was heard shouting ""Allah Akbar"" while engaging officers, law enforcement sources told Fox News. Mateen also called 911 during the shooting to pledge allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Fox News reported.

Mateen was interviewed three times by FBI agents -- twice in 2013, once in 2014 -- as part of two separate investigations, FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ron Hopper said. However, both inquiries proved inconclusive and the cases were closed.

UPDATE: Chilling text exchange between mother and son. His condition is not yet know #Pulse pic.twitter.com/tslcUYvenf — Rav Vadgama (@TVRav) June 12, 2016

Mateen was not under surveillance or the subject of an active investigation at the time of the shooting, Hopper said.

The 2013 investigation was related to comments Mateen allegedly made to a co-worker ""alleging possible terror ties."" FBI agents were unable to ""verify the substance"" of his comments, Hopper said.

Mateen was also interviewed in 2014 due to his ties to an American man who later drove an explosive-laden truck into a restaurant in Syria for an Al Qaeda affiliate. Mateen and the suicide bomber, Monar abu Salha, attended the same mosque, however, the FBI determined their contact ""was minimal,"" Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Mike

McCaul told Fox News.



Mateen was a U.S. citizen, Rep. Alan Grayson said during a Sunday morning news conference, though that was ""not true of other family members of his."" Mateen, 29, lived in Fort Pierce, Fla. He was born in New York to parents of Afghan origin and was a Muslim, Fox News confirmed.

Mateen was married in 2009 to a woman who was born in Uzbekistan, according to the couple's marriage license, but the two divorced in 2011.



""He was not a stable person,"" the ex-wife, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Washington Post. ""He beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that.""

A mortgage form from 2013 lists Noor Salman as his wife and Mateen also had a 3-year-old son. Mateen appears to have had no criminal record.



A licensed security officer, Mateen also had a statewide firearms license. He purchased two guns -- a handgun and a long gun -- legally during the week before the shooting, an ATF official said.

The FBI was scouring Mateen's cellphone and electronic devices on Sunday afternoon to identify any possible terrorist connections. This includes searching for any traces of propaganda, scrubbing of his web browsing history, and running down communications with individuals via social media and mobile messaging apps.

As victims poured through their doors, Orlando Regional Medical Center officials called in six trauma surgeons, including a pediatric surgeon, Dr. Michael Cheatham said. Many of the wounded were ""critically ill"" due to their injuries, Cheatham said, and the hospital was trying to reach out to their families.

""I think we will see the death toll rise,"" Cheatham told The Associated Press.



Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in Orange County following the attack and asked for a moment of silence throughout the country at 6 p.m. on Sunday.



""This is an attack on our people,"" Scott tweeted around 11:40 a.m. ""It's an attack on Orlando. It's an attack on FL. It's an attack on America. It's an attack on all of us.""



Chief John Mina of the Orlando Police Department said officers were initially engaged in a gun battle outside the club before the suspect, armed with a handgun and ""assault-type rifle,"" went back into the building, where more shots were fired. He said the gunman then took several hostages.

""It appears he was organized and well-prepared,"" Mina said.

Officials said Mateen had some communication with police during this standoff, though they did not reveal what was said.



Eleven officers were involved in raiding the nightclub, and one officer was injured, according to Banks. The injured officer was hit by a bullet and his Kevlar helmet saved his life, Banks said.

A hotline for victims' families was set up at 407-246-4357. Identities of victims were being released at cityoforlando.net/victims after family members had been notified.



Witnesses in the club reported mass chaos after hearing several shots ring out inside the nightclub.

Pulse posted on its own Facebook page around 2 a.m.: ""Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.""

It's owner later said in statement that she was ""devastated by the horrific events that have taken place today.

Pulse, and the men and women who work there, have been my family for nearly 15 years. From the beginning, Pulse has served as a place of love and acceptance for the LGTQ community. I want to express my profound sadness and condolences to all who have lost loved ones,"" Barbara Roma.



Mina Justice was outside the club early Sunday trying to contact her 30-year-old son Eddie, who texted her when the shooting happened and asked her to call police. He told her he ran into a bathroom with other club patrons to hide. He then texted her: ""He's coming.""

""The next text said: 'He has us, and he's in here with us,'"" she said. ""That was the last conversation.""

Jon Alamo said he was at the back of one of the club's rooms when a man holding a weapon came into the front of the room.

""I heard 20, 40, 50 shots,"" Alamo said. ""The music stopped.""

Club-goer Rob Rick said it happened around 2 a.m., just before closing time.

""Everybody was drinking their last sip,"" he said.

The all-hands-on-deck probe is aimed at determining whether Omar Mateen acted alone when he gunned down 49 patrons in a gay nightclub or others knew of his deadly plans and possibly aided him. A federal law enforcement source told FoxNews.com Tuesday that prosecutors have convened a grand jury to investigate Mateen's wife, Noor Salman, who could be charged as an accessory.

FBI agents have interviewed Omar Mateen's wife, Noor Salman, in the days since Sunday's massacre that also wounded 53 more. She is reportedly cooperating, but formal charges could help ensure she told the feds all she knows.

Multiple reports said the Rodeo, Calif., home where Salman grew up was visited by the FBI Tuesday. The FBI has refused comment to the press outside of official media briefings.

A federal law enforcement source additionally told Fox News that Salman knew of her husband's deadly plans and did nothing to stop him.

Mateen died in a shootout with police early Sunday morning. While Salman has been widely referred to as Mateen's wife, the only proof of their marriage is her listing as his wife on a 2013 mortgage document and family members who said the two were married and had a 3-year-old son.

On a separate front, the FBI is piecing together Mateen’s radical Islam roots, and two trips to Saudi Arabia could be a sign of his growing religious devotion. His stated reason for both the 2011 and 2012 trips was umrah, a Muslim pilgrimage to the Kingdom that is not as significant as the hajj, a trip all Muslims must make to Mecca at least once in their lives. Either or both of the trips could also have included a deadly diversion for terror training, according to experts who are dubious that a working-class Muslim-American would make the pilgrimage twice in two years.

The FBI took a computer, camera and other equipment from Mateen's two-bedroom condominium in Fort Pierce, some 120 miles from the scene of the shooting and hours-long hostage situation that culminated in his death.

Although ISIS has taken credit for the attack and lavished praise on Mateen, it is still unclear whether he received direction, or simply inspiration, from the terrorist group. However, Fox News reported Tuesday that Mateen was more than just an acquaintance of another radicalized terrorist who left Florida for Syria where he blew himself up in 2014.

Fox News was told the relationship between Mateen and American suicide bomber Moner Abu-Salha -- who drove 16 tons of explosives into a Syrian government facility on behalf of Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, was ""complex."" The two frequented the same Fort Pierce mosque.

Authorities are also probing Mateen's ties to Dwayne Robertson, a onetime New York gang leader who resurfaced in Orlando as an imam and is suspected by federal authorities of radicalizing Americans and sending them abroad to kill. Robertson, who was released from prison last year, denies inciting violent jihad.

Finally, more information from relatives and people who knew Mateen in prior years continued to bring into focus a portrait of an angry and volatile bigot with conflicted feelings toward gays. His massacre is being treated as both an act of terror and a hate crime directed at the LGBT community, yet hist first wife reportedly believes Mateen himself was a closeted gay man.

Patrons at Pulse, the nightclub where he killed dozens, say he had been seen there many times and one reportedly said Mateen had contacted him using a dating app popular with the gay community."
284,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/14/trump-clinton-trade-blows-on-terror-and-guns-in-wake-orlando-attack.html,2,"While investigators try to piece together what led the Orlando gunman to carry out an unspeakable act of terror, the attack is upending the 2016 campaign debate as the two presumptive rivals go toe-to-toe on terror with two very different messages.

In back-to-back speeches Monday, Donald Trump doubled down on his call for a Muslim immigration ban while decrying what he described as a ""deadly ignorance"" that is hurting the country -- and Hillary Clinton renewed her call for an assault-weapons ban while vowing to stop ""lone wolf"" terrorists.

Trump, speaking in New Hampshire, focused largely on his plans for an immigration crackdown. Trump said he wants to ""suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism"" against the U.S. or its allies.

“We have no choice,” Trump said of the proposed ban. It wasn't immediately clear whether Trump was revising his long-standing proposal to temporarily bar foreign Muslims entering the U.S., which he also defended, or referring to the same plan.

The New York businessman also called the Orlando shooting “an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.”

“It we don’t get tough, and we don’t get smart – and fast – we’re not going to have a country anymore – there will be nothing left,” Trump said.

Trump, speaking at St. Anselm College, was quick to slam his Democratic rival, claiming she “is in total denial” and that her ultimate plan is to “disarm law-abiding Americans” while admitting immigrants who could pose a threat.

A few hours earlier at her speech in Ohio, Clinton called for an ""intelligence surge"" and a ban on assault weapons as part of a multi-pronged strategy to confront homegrown terrorism.

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, following the Orlando terror attack, called on Americans to fight terrorism at home with “clear eyes” and “steady hands.” She delivered a carefully calibrated message, calling for America to get tougher on terrorists while also renewing gun control proposals that have failed to gain steam in Congress.

At the Cleveland campaign event, she drew cheers from the crowd after calling for a ban on assault weapons.

“Weapons of war have no place on our streets,” Clinton said.

Clinton also said if she were in the White House, a top priority would be “identifying and stopping lone wolves,” like the Orlando shooter.

She also called for increased efforts to remove Islamic State messages from the Internet and said “peace-loving Muslims are in the best position to help fight radicalization.”

Trump’s speech was originally supposed to focus on his case against the Clintons – but Trump changed his focus following the attack in Orlando that left 49 people dead and dozens injured. The gunman died in a shootout with police.

On Monday, President Obama said investigators believe the gunman was not directed by external extremist groups, instead saying the shooter “was inspired by various extremist information that was disseminated over the Internet.”

He added that there is “no direct evidence” the shooter “was part of a larger plot.”

Clinton warned earlier Monday against demonizing an entire religion, saying doing so would play into the hands of the Islamic State group.

""We can call it radical jihadism, we can call it radical Islamism,"" Clinton said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""But we also want to reach out to the vast majority of American-Muslims and Muslims around this country, this world, to help us defeat this threat, which is so evil and has got to be denounced by everyone, regardless of religion.""

The horrific shooting consumed the White House race just as Trump and Clinton were fully plunging into the general election. It served as a reminder to the candidates and voters alike that the next president will lead a nation facing unresolved questions about how to handle threats that can feel both foreign and all too familiar.

Trump said Monday he was revoking the press credentials of the Washington Post after the newspaper published an article with a headline ""Donald Trump suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shooting.""

""Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign, we are hereby revoking the press credentials of the phony and dishonest Washington Post,"" Trump posted on his Facebook page.

Authorities identified the killer in Orlando as Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old American-born Muslim. FBI officials said they had investigated him in 2013 and 2014 on suspicion of terrorist sympathies but could not make a case against him.

Mateen opened fire at the Pulse Orlando club with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. He called 911 during the attack to profess his allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist organization though it was unclear whether he had any direct contact with ISIS or was just inspired by them.

285,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/23/house-democrats-jeer-ryan-during-sit-in-to-demand-gun-control-vote.html,2,"House Speaker Paul Ryan sent lawmakers packing for the holiday break early Thursday morning after a raucous, hours-long sit-in waged by congressional Democrats failed to force a vote on gun control measures.

As Ryan decried the protest as a ""publicity stunt"" -- complete with loud chants and blankets and live-streaming -- Democrats claimed they nevertheless had made ""some progress"" on the issue.

The House adjourned around 3:15 a.m. ET Thursday, and even as Republicans left the buildings, some Democrats stayed on the House floor repeating their chant “No bill no break!” and waving papers with the names of gun victims written in black. A core group lingered for a while on the House floor wrapped in blankets and resting on pillows.

The protest finally came to an end early Thursday afternoon, hours after Republicans held a final vote on the Zika response and, save for a short upcoming session, sent lawmakers home until July 5. The sit-in lasted a total of over 25 hours.

Democrats declared success in dramatizing the arguments for action to stem gun violence, despite the failure to conjure a vote.

""Just because they cut and run in the dark of night, just because they have left doesn't mean we are taking no for an answer,"" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

""We won't stop until the job is done,"" the Californian declared to fellow Democrats camped out in the well of the House in the early hours of the morning, saying the party had changed ""the dynamic of what happens"" concerning guns.

House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland said the public shouldn't be happy with a Republican majority that shut down the House and disregarded ""the unfinished business of the American people.""

Georgia Rep. John Lewis, who had participated in the civil rights sit-ins in the South in the 1960s, declared Thursday that “some progress” was made in the lawmakers’ efforts to get the attention of the nation to recognize the need for a vote on gun control legislation.

“We have other bridges to cross. And when we come back in July, we start it all over again,” he added.

Ironically, Lewis was also once on a terror watch list in what he said was a mix-up – and now is backing the controversial legislation to keep people on the no-fly list from getting guns.

Republicans said their colleagues had accomplished nothing other than disrupting the business of the House to score political points.

Pressure had been building on both sides of the Capitol in the wake of the shooting rampage at a Florida gay nightclub earlier this month that killed 49 people and injured 53 others. The assailant also died in the incident. The mass shooting followed similar tragic incidents over the past years including the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.

The agitation for action caused a Senate filibuster last week and led to the chaos on the House floor that lasted well into Thursday.

A burst of activity in the middle of the night, including recorded votes on some other issues such as the Zika virus, capped more than 15 straight hours of Democratic protests. The spectacle captured the attention of a Washington gridlocked on guns despite the slaughter in Orlando. Senate Democrats undertook a nearly 15-hour filibuster last week in fighting for the same cause.

House Republicans used their prerogatives as the majority party to muscle through the bill funding the Zika crisis with no time for debate, overruling Democrat's objections and then moving to adjourn the House into next month as Democrats cried ""Shame, Shame!""

Republicans shut off the cameras in the House gallery throughout most of the protest, but Democrats used their cellphones to capture the action, and C-SPAN carried the feeds live in an unprecedented move.

Ryan said the bill pushed by the Democrats to expand background checks and keep people on the no-fly list from getting guns would take away people’s constitutional rights and deprive them of due process. He noted that similar legislation was already rejected in the Senate earlier this week, along with three others bills.

The protest began around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, unfolding on the House floor with little advance warning from the Democrats.

By evening, 168 House Democrats — out of 188 — and 34 Senate Democrats joined the protest, according to the House minority leader's office. One after another, they spoke of the need for gun control and talked of constituents who had been killed. Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan, whose husband former Rep. John Dingell is a longtime NRA supporter, won thunderous applause and a standing ovation after she talked in personal terms about her experience growing up in a home with gun violence.

Scattered around the House floor were signs reading ""Disarm Hate."" Visitors watched from the galleries. A crowd of several hundred gun control advocates gathered outside the Capitol and cheered as Democrats addressed them.

The sit-in — in which Lewis played a leading role — had the look of a 1960s-style protest, as some lawmakers sat on the floor, others in their seats. The House chamber grew increasingly chaotic as the night wore on, and some lawmakers took breaks on pillows and blankets.

Republicans had staged a similar protest in 2008. Democrats controlling the House at the time turned off the cameras amid a GOP push for a vote to expand oil and gas drilling. Republicans occupied the floor, delivering speech after speech after Pelosi, then the House speaker, sent lawmakers bolting to their August recess. Pelosi at that time had ordered the cameras turned off.

C-SPAN, a cable and satellite network that provides continual coverage of House and Senate floor proceedings, does not control the cameras. They're run on authorization by legislative leaders. Although the cameras were turned off Wednesday, lawmakers relied on social media to transmit video, using Facebook, Twitter and Periscope.

C-SPAN broadcast live video streamed on Periscope and Facebook from lawmakers' accounts. Democrats posted the Capitol's main telephone number, which was overwhelmed, and urged constituents to call and request a vote. They also encouraged tweeting under the hashtag #NoBillNoBreak.

286,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/06/27/british-political-turmoil-deepens-after-eu-referendum.html?intcmp=hpbt1,2,"The political turmoil in Britain escalated Monday as several additional high-ranking members of the opposition Labor Party resigned in protest of its leader Jeremy Corbyn's failure to prevent his nation's decision to leave the European Union.

More than 20 members of Corbyn's ""shadow Cabinet"" -- experts in specific topics like health care or the economy -- stepped down after Friday's vote. One Corbyn ally told the BBC opponents had been plotting a ""coup"" against the party's leader for months.

Unlike Prime Minister David Cameron of the Conservatives, leader of the failed 'remain' side in the British vote on EU membership, Corbyn has refused to resign. But top Labor officials said they were fearful their party could be seriously hurt if Corbyn leads them into an early election that may be called.

Angela Eagle, the party's spokeswoman on Business Innovation and Skills, chose to step down from the senior party position in light of Britain's vote to leave the EU. She is the most senior member of his team to resign.

Eagle says the party needs a leader ""who can unite rather than divide"" the party.

Corbyn has appointed lawmakers loyal to him to fill the vacated posts. He insists he will run in any new leadership contest, and says he has the support of the party's grassroots.

European leaders stepped up the pressure on Britain to begin its complex exit from the 28-nation EU immediately, rather than wait several months as British Prime Minister David Cameron prefers.

The vote to leave sent the pound and global stock markets plunging. Britain's Treasury said finance minister George Osborne would make an early morning statement Monday ""to provide reassurance about financial and economic stability"" before the London Stock Exchange reopens.

The leaders of the successful campaign to leave the EU stayed largely out of the public eye, as opponents accused them of lacking a plan to calm the crisis the result has triggered. In his first statement since Friday morning, ""leave"" leader and former London Mayor Boris Johnson used his column in the Daily Telegraph newspaper to urge unity and say ""the negative consequences (of the vote) are being wildly overdone.""

He said Britain would forge ""a new and better relationship with the EU — based on free trade and partnership, rather than a federal system.""

The vote, however, risks causing a political schism in the United Kingdom. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would ""consider"" advising the Scottish Parliament to try to use its power to prevent Britain from actually leaving the EU. She said Scottish lawmakers might be able to derail the move by withholding ""legislative consent"" for a British exit, or Brexit.

""If the Scottish Parliament was judging this on the basis of what's right for Scotland, then the option of saying 'We're not going to vote for something that is against Scotland's interests,' of course, that is on the table,"" she said of the possibility of withholding consent.

Sturgeon said she believes Scotland's approval is required for the move but conceded the British government would likely take ""a very different view.""

Thursday's U.K.-wide vote to leave the EU was very unpopular in Scotland, where 62 percent cast ballots to stay, and Sturgeon says she is studying ways to keep Scotland part of the EU bloc.

The Scottish question looms large because Sturgeon also has said another referendum on Scottish independence from Britain is ""highly likely"" as a result of Britain's EU vote. A Scottish referendum in 2014 ended with voters deciding to remain in Britain, but analysts believe Britain's withdrawal from the EU may strengthen the independence movement.

In Northern Ireland, which also is part of the U.K., Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said his priority is forging ""special arrangements"" to enable Northern Ireland to maintain its EU ties. Some Brexit opponents have also talked of trying to use Northern Ireland's Assembly to try to block Britain's departure.

Northern Ireland voters also expressed a preference for keeping Britain in the EU. The unhappiness with the results in both Scotland and Northern Ireland is adding to the sense that the Brexit vote may over time lead to the breakup of the United Kingdom.

Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers, Cameron's lead official in Belfast, played down the suggestion that the Scottish Parliament or the Northern Ireland Assembly had the standing to prevent a British departure from the EU.

She said decision-making power resides solely in the British Parliament, which is expected to abide by the results of the referendum, which showed 52 percent of British voters wanted out.

""In the weeks and months ahead, we will be working with both the Scottish government and the Northern Ireland executive on all these matters,"" she told BBC. ""But ultimately it is (the British) Parliament's decision.""

Adam Tomkins, a law professor and member of the Scottish Parliament, agreed with this assessment. The Conservative Party legislator tweeted that it was ""nonsense"" to suggest the Scottish party could block a British departure simply by withholding consent.

The vote is already cutting short Cameron's career. He said after the results that he will resign as prime minister when the Conservative Party chooses a new leader, who will be charged with implementing the separation from the EU.

The new party leader, who will become prime minister, is expected to be in place by October. At that point, he or she may choose to call a quick election to solidify a mandate — and the prospect of an election in the near future may have spurred the revolt against Corbyn.

In her resignation letter, shadow Heath Secretary Heidi Alexander bluntly told Corbyn he had to go. ""I do not believe you have the capacity to shape the answers our country is demanding and I believe that if we are to form the next government, a change of leadership is essential,"" she wrote.

""I regret there have been resignations today from my shadow cabinet,"" Corbyn responded. ""But I am not going to betray the trust of those who voted for me — or the millions of supporters across the country who need Labour to represent them.""

Concerns about last week's EU referendum ranged far beyond U.K. politics.

In Rome, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged Britain and the EU to manage their divorce responsibly for the sake of global markets and citizens. On Monday, he will be the first senior U.S. official to visit London and Brussels since the referendum, and he said he would bring a message of U.S. support to both capitals.

Pope Francis urged the EU to come up with creative ways to stay together following Britain's vote, saying it's clear ""something isn't working in this unwieldy union.""

""The European Union must rediscover the strength at its roots, a creativity and a healthy disunity, of giving more independence and more freedom to the countries of the union,"" the pontiff told reporters as he flew home from Armenia.

The key, he said, is to rekindle the will to stay together with ""creativity and new life.""

After the three attackers arrived at the Turkish transit hub via taxi on Tuesday, one of the assailants entered the terminal, began shooting people and then blew himself up near X-ray machines, officials said. During the chaos, a second attacker rushed to the departures level and detonated his explosives. The third attacker waited outside during the entire episode, blowing himself up as scared travelers frantically flooded out of the airport.



""When the terrorists couldn't pass the regular security system, when they couldn't pass the scanners, police and security controls, they returned and took out their weapons out of their suitcases and opened fire at random at the security check,"" Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said Wednesday.

Several U.S. airports strengthened security measures due to the carnage in Istanbul, and, adding to the tension, a terminal at JFK Airport in New York was evacuated for a brief period Wednesday when a suspicious bag was spotted. It was later determined the unattended bag posed no threat and travelers were allowed back in the terminal.

Authorities viewed ISIS as the most likely culprit in the Istanbul attack, as the Turkey assault bore hallmarks similar to the March 22 coordinated terror attacks in Brussels, in which ISIS operatives killed 32 in coordinated bombings at Zaventem airport and a nearby metro station. But ISIS had not taken credit for Tuesday's attacks, and Ankara has battled Kurdish militants as well as ISIS.

Turkish officials told The Associated Press and Reuters that ISIS was the primary suspect, however, and the Islamic State released an infographic Wednesday in which it claimed to have ""covert"" units in Turkey. The infographic, sent out via ISIS' Amaq news agency, was made to commemorate the two-year anniversary of the militants establishing their so-called caliphate in areas of Syria and Iraq.

A U.S. government official told Fox News that the attack fits the profile of ISIS, which has stepped up its targeting of Turkey. The official said ISIS tends to attack internationally known targets with an economic impact, such as an airport, while the Kurdish terror group PKK generally targets Turkish military and law enforcement.

""If this Islamic State is indeed behind this attack, this would be a declaration of war,"" Analyst Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at The Washington Institute, told AFP. ""Turkey's vengeance will come down like rain from hell on the Islamic State.""

Of the 238 people injured in the carnage, 109 had already been discharged from the hospital Wednesday morning, The Istanbul Governor's Office said. The Turkish Health Minister said 40 people remained in intensive care.

Most of those killed were Turkish, officials said. The 14 foreign travelers killed included six Saudis, two Iraqis and citizens from China, Iran, Jordan, Tunisia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, Reuters reported.

The assault began when one attacker blew himself up outside the Ataturk terminal, the Haber Turk newspaper reported. Two other terrorists then opened fire at a point where X-ray machines are located.

""He's shooting up, two times, and he's beginning to shoot people like that, like he was walking like a prophet,"" Otfah Mohamed Abdullah, who witnessed one of the attackers, told AFPTV.



One attacker was shot at while running amid fleeing passengers, then blew himself up at an exit. The third attacker went up one level to where the international departures terminal is, was shot by police and blew himself up.

A Turkish official told The Associated Press that authorities were going through CCTV footage and eyewitness statements to establish a more detailed timeline of the attack. ""It is a jigsaw puzzle"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government protocol.

Airport surveillance video posted on social media showed the moment of one blast, a huge ball of fire, and passengers fleeing in terror. Another appeared to show an attacker, felled by a gunshot from a security officer, blowing himself up seconds later.

The recent attacks on Turkey, a key partner in the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS and a NATO member, have increased in scale and frequency. They have scared away tourists and hurt the Turkish economy, which relies heavily on tourism.

Hundreds of passengers who fled the airport in fear were left sitting on the grass outside. Several ambulances drove back and forth, and security vehicles surrounded the scene.

As if to underscore Turkey's determination to carry on in the face of a growing threat, the airport reopened Wednesday, just hours after the dead were carried away and glass and debris were cleared.

Adam Keally, from Boston, said he heard gunfire followed by several explosions, then saw people ""very badly injured.""

Hevin Zini, 12, had just arrived from Duesseldorf, Germany, with her family and was in tears.

""There was blood on the ground,"" she told the AP. ""Everything was blown up to bits... if we had arrived two minutes earlier, it could have been us.""

Two South African tourists, Paul and Susie Roos from Cape Town, were at the airport and due to fly home at the time of the explosions.

""We came up from the arrivals to the departures, up the escalator when we heard these shots going off,"" Paul Roos told the AP. ""There was this guy going roaming around, he was dressed in black and he had a handgun.""

Veysel Allay, who was waiting for a friend in the arrivals terminal, told the Daily Telegraph, ""A man ran up and ripped open his jacket, showing a bomb vest. I ran before he did anything.""

Jim Hyong Lee of South Korea told the Telegraph he and his family were checking in for a flight home when ""we heard gunshots.""

""I grabbed my family and ran,"" Lee said. ""Someone waved us into the prayer room and hid us there until the police came.""

A State Department spokesman told Fox News late Tuesday that Americans in Turkey were being urged to contact family members immediately.

Saudi Arabia's Embassy in Turkey said at least seven Saudis were injured in the attack and all were in stable condition.

U.S. and world leaders immediately offered condolences following the attack.

In the U.S., President Obama was briefed about the attack by Lisa Monaco, his homeland security and counterterrorism adviser. A statement from the White House on Tuesday condemned the attack ""in the strongest possible terms.""

""We remain steadfast in our support for Turkey, our NATO Ally and partner, along with all of our friends and allies around the world, as we continue to confront the threat of terrorism,"" the statement said.

Turkey has stepped up controls at airports and land borders and deported thousands of foreign fighters, but has struggled to tackle the threat of ISIS militants while also conducting vast security operations against Kurdish rebels, who have also been blamed for recent deadly attacks.

Turkish airports have security checks at both the entrance of terminal buildings and then later before entry to departure gates.

Istanbul's Ataturk Airport was the 11th busiest airport in the world last year, with 61.8 million passengers, according to Airports Council International. It is also one of the fastest-growing airports in the world, seeing 9.2 percent more passengers last year than in 2014.

The GOP report, released Tuesday, followed by less than a day a report by the Democrats on the panel saying that security at the Benghazi, Libya facility was “woefully inadequate” but former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton never personally denied any requests from diplomats for additional protection.

According to portions of the Republican report reviewed by Fox News, one U.S. agent at the American outpost in Benghazi, whose name was withheld for security reasons, told the committee he first heard “some kind of chanting.”

Then that sound was immediately followed by “explosions” and “gunfire, then roughly 70 people rushing into the compound with an assortment of “AK-47s, grenades, RPG’s … a couple of different assault rifles,” the agent said.

In addition, a senior watch officer at the State Department's diplomatic security command described the Sept. 11, 2012, strikes as ""a full on attack against our compound.”

When asked whether he saw or heard a protest prior to the attacks, the officer replied, ""zip, nothing, nada,"" according to the Republican majority report.

“None of the information coming directly from the agents on the ground in Benghazi during the attacks mentioned anything about a video or a protest. The firsthand accounts made their way to the office of the Secretary through multiple channels quickly …,” the report concluded.

Watch Benghazi Select Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., and committee member Rep. Susan Brooks, R-Ind., Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET on Fox News' “Special Report with Bret Baier.”

U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, foreign service officer Sean Smith and former Navy Seals Ty Woods and Glen Doherty, were killed in the attacks.

Five days later, then-United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice went on every national Sunday talk show. She told Fox News Sunday, “What sparked the recent violence was the airing on the Internet of a very hateful, very offensive video that has offended many people around the world.”

The GOP committee report also identified for the first time a White House meeting that was convened roughly three hours into the attack and included deputies to senior Cabinet members and Clinton.

Stevens was missing at the time. But the report found “much of the conversation focused on the video (which) is surprising given no direct link or solid evidence existed connecting the attacks in Benghazi and the video at the time ….”

The report found that “five of the 10 action items from the rough notes of the 7:30pm meeting reference the video.”

Unlike the Usama bin Laden raid in 2011, in which Clinton, President Obama and his national security team watched events unfold from the Situation Room, they never gathered for Benghazi.

Clinton issued the only statement that night from the administration, following the White House meeting. It read in part: “Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet.”

However, Clinton said something very different privately.

In an email provided to the Select Committee, Clinton told daughter Chelsea, “Two of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an Al Queda-like [sic] group.”

Clinton also told Egypt’s prime minister the following day: “We know that the attacks in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack -- not a protest.”

Kansas GOP Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Benghazi committee member, told Fox News in advance of the report’s release that the report is new and significant because it’s the first to include interviews from “everybody on the ground” in Benghazi.

More than 30 people’s lives were at risk that night, and the majority worked at the secret CIA annex in Benghazi.

Pompeo also said the findings show “it’s unambiguous the administration knew immediately it was a terror attack. And the story of fog of war was known to be false immediately by everyone in the administration.”

Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has seen her campaign plagued by questions about whether she and the rest of the State Department provided adequate security for Americans before the attacks and about why the administration continued to tell Americans the attacks were inspired by the video.

Committee Republicans say the deputies’ meeting, in which Clinton was involved, on the night of the Benghazi attack shows she’s not ready for the so-called “3 a.m. call.”

The report interviewed more than 80 witnesses previously not called before Congress to testify.

Among them was Ben Rhodes, the president’s deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, who with political adviser David Plouffe prepped Rice for her national TV appearances claiming the video was responsible for the terrorist attack.

Rice said her statements were based on the best available information, but nobody from the intelligence community such as the CIA director or the Director of National Intelligence briefed Rice. That was done by the political appointees.

In fact, a Sept. 14, 2012 memo from Rhodes included the subject line: ""RE: PREP Call with Susan: Saturday at 4:00 pm ET.""

The email was sent to a dozen members of the administration's inner circle, including key members of the White House communications team such as then-Press Secretary Jay Carney, who also pushed the video narrative in the days after the attacks.

In the email, Rhodes specifically draws attention to the anti-Islam Internet video, without distinguishing whether the Benghazi attack was different from protests elsewhere, including one day earlier in Cairo.

The Rhodes email, which was a catalyst for the Select Committee, was first obtained by Judicial Watch through a federal court lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act.

The email lists the following two goals, among others: ""to underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video and not a broader failure of policy” and “to reinforce the President and Administration's strength and steadiness in dealing with difficult challenges.""

Rhodes was the same official who signed off on Clinton’s statement the night of the attack linking the video to Benghazi.

The report found the post attack intelligence analysis had errors, contradicting the eyewitness accounts that night, and it alleges the administration latched onto the faulty analysis to defend and justify their misleading statements to the public.

There were in fact two sets of talking points – the White House version by Rhodes and the one by the CIA. When editing the CIA's version, Deputy Director Michael Morell knew his personnel on the ground disputed the protest analysis, but he gave the final say to his analysts in Washington, thousands of miles away."

Earlier, Trump tweeted, ""I look forward to meeting (Ernst) today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!""

Over the weekend, Trump met with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and his wife, though a Pence spokesman said ""nothing was offered.""

The spokesman, Marc Lotter, added, ""The governor had warm, productive meetings with the Trumps."" He declined to say where the Saturday meeting was held. Pence is running for re-election against Democratic former state House Speaker John Gregg.

Trump and Pence discussed Pence's policies during his term as governor which began in 2013, Lotter said. He also declined to discuss Pence's level of interest in the position, echoing a comment from Pence last week that he did not want to talk about ""a hypothetical.""

Trump tweeted Monday about his Saturday meeting with Pence.

""Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people!” Trump tweeted.

As Pence and his wife arrived for a concert Sunday night at Conner Prairie, a history park in Fishers, the governor again declined to discuss whether he was interested in the position. He reiterated his support for Trump's candidacy and said the Trumps ""couldn't have been more kind and gracious"" during the meeting.

Trump has never held public office and is considering a small group of political veterans as potential running mates.

People with direct knowledge of Trump's vetting process say the list includes Pence, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions.

In addition to serving as governor, Pence served in the U.S. House of Representatives for 12 years.

He also at one time had his own presidential ambitions but last year ruled out a run after his popularity fell in the wake of criticism over his handling of the state's religious objections law.

Johnson, a prominent campaigner for British withdrawal from the European Union, told a news conference that the next Conservative Party leader would have needs to ensure Britain's standing in the world.

""Having consulted colleagues and in view of the circumstances in Parliament, I have concluded that person cannot be me,"" he said.

Johnson dropped out after Justice Secretary Michael Gove, Johnson's ally in the EU ""leave"" campaign, astonished the political world by announcing that he was running to succeed Prime Minister David Cameron.

Home Secretary Theresa May and Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb are also in the race.

The winner of the contest, to be announced Sept. 9, will become prime minister and play a vital role shaping the nature of Britain's relationship with the European Union after last week's Brexit vote ended the career of Cameron, whose bid to keep Britain in the EU block failed.

The bookies' early favorite is May, who is seen by many in the party as a safe pair of hands as the country struggles to disentangle itself from the EU.

""This is not a normal leadership held under normal circumstances,"" May said in a speech Thursday in London. ""The result means we face a period of uncertainty we need to address head on.""

Although May had offered a tepid endorsement of Britain's place in the European Union during the referendum campaign, she was clear that the vote would be respected.

""The United Kingdom will leave the EU,"" she said, pledging to create a brand new government department devoted to negotiating Britain's ""sensible and orderly"" departure from the 28-nation bloc.

Boosting May's chances was a last-minute falling out between her two leading competitors -- Gove and Johnson -- who had campaigned together to yank Britain from the EU.

In a statement, Gove said he would pursue the prime minister's post after concluding that Johnson ""cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead.""

An email from Gove's wife, Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, obtained earlier by Sky News, suggested that Gove should ensure he had specific guarantees from Johnson before backing the latter's bid.

She added that influential right-wing media barons Rupert Murdoch and Paul Dacre ""instinctively dislike"" Johnson.

Gove's camp has declined to comment on the missive.

The opposition Labour Party is also is extreme disarray, with leader Jeremy Corbyn facing intense pressure to resign after losing a confidence vote. He has lost the support of the party's lawmakers but claims the rank and file still back him

He is expected to face a formal leadership challenge in the coming days. He has faced heavy criticism for failing to campaign effectively in support of keeping Britain within the EU."

The State Department confirmed Saturday that a U.S. citizen was among those “senselessly murdered” when Islamic terrorists stormed the restaurant in the diplomatic quater of the Bangladesh capita, Dhaka. The standoff ended Saturday morning when police stormed the restaurant, killed six attackers and rescued 13 hostages.

Three of the hostage victims attended U.S. colleges. Abinta Kabir and Faraaz Hossain were students at Emory University in Georgia; and Tarushi Jain, a 19-year-old Indian national, was a student the University of California at Berkeley.

Emory President James Wagner said in a message Saturday on the university’s website that Kabir was from Miami and was in Dhaka visiting family and friends. He said Hossain just graduated and was enrolled in Emory’s business school for the fall.

""The Emory community mourns this tragic and senseless loss of two members of our university family,"" Wagner said. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out on behalf of Faraaz and Abinta and their families and friends for strength and peace at this unspeakably sad time.""

Jain was working at a Dhaka bank through a Berkeley internship progam.

""We are all very devastated to hear the news about Tarishi Jain. She was a smart and ambitious young woman with a big heart,"" said Sanchita Saxena, executive director of Berkeley's Institute for South Asia Studies.

Bangladesh’s Prime Minister vowed at a press conference Saturday to fight terrorism “at all costs” following the seige at the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina condemned the attack while pledging to stand up and fight the terror threats that have mushroomed in the country, Reuters reported.

“We are committed and determined to uphold our freedom,” Hasina said, adding that Bangladesh will fight the terror threat “at all costs.”

Hasina also declared the country would observe two days of mourning.

At least seven Islamic terrorists attacked the upscale restaurant Friday.

The seige ended when Bangladeshi commandoes, supported by armored vehicles, stormed the cafe, killing six attackers and capturing a seventh, while freeing 13 hostages. Two police officers were killed in an earlier gun battle with the militants.

The Islamic terror group ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist activity online. The ISIS-affiliated Amaq news agency posted photos purportedly showing the bodies of hostages, though their authenticity could not be immediately confirmed.



At a news conference, Army Brigadier General Naim Asraf Chowdhury said most of the victims ""were killed mercilessly"" with sharp weapons on Friday night.

Earlier, a police official told AP that that five bodies were seen lying in pools of blood at the restaurant. It was not immediately clear whether they were the remains of militants or hostages.

A Bangladeshi army spokesman said all the victims were foreigners.

Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said the bodies of nine Italians have been identified among the dead.

A Japanese government spokesman said that seven Japanese were among those killed in the siege.

The White House issued a statement Saturday condemning the attack.

""Our deepest condolences go out to the families and loved ones of those killed, and we hope for a speedy recovery for those wounded,"" the statement said. ""This is a despicable act of terrorism, and the United States stands with Bangladesh and the international community in our resolve to confront terrorism wherever it occurs.""

A Bangladeshi police official said two Sri Lankans were rescued Saturday, while local media reported that an Argentine and two Bangladeshis escaped prior to the raid.

Kitchen staffer Sumon Reza, who escaped via the restaurant's roof, said the attackers chanted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is Great) as they assaulted around 9:20 p.m. Friday (11:20 a.m. ET), initially opening fire with blanks.



Rezaul Karim, the father of a Bangladeshi businessman who was rescued along with his family, said the attackers did not harm any hostage who could recite verses from the Islamic holy book, Koran.



Karim said his son, Hasnat, had gone to the restaurant along with his wife and two children to celebrate the birthday of his elder daughter when the attack happened. ""He told me, `Please save us, please!' And he hung up,"" he said.



Karim said his son told him that the attackers ""did not hit people who could recite verses from the Koran. The others were tortured,"" he said.



""The gunmen asked everyone inside to recite from the Koran. Those who recited were spared. The gunmen even gave them meals last night,"" Karim said.



He said detectives were questioning his son and his family as part of the investigation.



Ten of 26 people who were wounded when the militants opened fire were in critical condition, and six were on life support, according to hospital staff. The injuries ranged from broken bones to gunshot wounds. Only one civilian was among the wounded.



The attack marks an escalation in the growing drumbeat of militant violence to hit the traditionally moderate Muslim-majority nation in the past three years, but with increasing frequency in recent months. Most attacks have been by machete-wielding men singling out individual activists, foreigners and religious minorities.



The spree of recent attacks in Bangladesh have raised fears that religious extremists are gaining a foothold in the country, despite its traditions of secularism and tolerance.



About two dozen atheist writers, publishers, members of religious minorities, social activists and foreign aid workers have been slain since 2013. On Friday, a Hindu temple worker was hacked to death by at least three assailants in southwest Bangladesh. ISIS and and Al Qaeda affiliates have claimed responsibility for many of the attacks.



Hasina's government has cracked down on domestic radical Islamists. It has accused local terrorists and opposition political parties -- especially the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its Islamist ally Jamaat-e-Islami -- of orchestrating the violence in order to destabilize the nation, which both parties deny.

292,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/07/04/fourth-july-2016-what-founders-ask-us.html?intcmp=hpbt4,2,"It is remarkable that Abraham Lincoln never delivered a Fourth of July speech.

The closest he came was on July 10, 1858, in Chicago during one of the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates, when Lincoln spoke of the Founders as “iron men.” He remarked how, every July 4, Americans celebrate those “iron men” and their extraordinary achievement, because we are “historically connected” with it.

Lincoln meant this literally. He was speaking to those who were old enough to remember the Founders from their youth and those descendants of the Revolutionary generation.

But then Lincoln spoke about another set of Americans, the ones whose families came here after the great Revolution was over. In a word, immigrants. Of these, Lincoln said:

“If they look back through this history and trace their connection with those days by blood, they find they have none. They cannot carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us, but when they look through that old Declaration of Independence, they find that those old men say that, ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,’ and then they feel that the moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men, that it is the father of all moral principle in them, and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh, of the men who wrote that Declaration, and so they are.”

And so we are. None of us fought at Bunker Hill or Lexington or Concord. None of us endured famine, cold, or the impact of a musket ball. None of us signed our names to a document that made us traitors, fit to be hung.

Yet, despite all that, we are still Americans, and the Fourth is still our celebration, because we hold dear the “moral sentiment” for which those iron men fought and died — “That all men are created equal.”

Lincoln would fight and die for it, too.

Lincoln reassures us that this alone is enough to form that “historical connection” with men who in all other things bear no relation to us. Or, as he puts it: “That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world.”

As this speech was delivered in response to Stephen Douglas, a congressman from Illinois, Lincoln connects the “electric cord” in the Declaration with the question of slavery.

“If one man says [the Declaration] does not mean a negro, why not another say it does not mean some other man?”

In a few short paragraphs, Lincoln eviscerates Douglas’ contention that the ideals of the Declaration were reserved for only the true descendants of the American Revolution. It is remarkable that there was a time when Lincoln’s idea, now so central to our American mindset, was not dominant.

And yet we find our present culture riven by a hypersensitive strain of identity politics. We are told, even by some who belong to Lincoln’s party, that we should provide this group of Americans with one kind of government handout and that group with another.

We are told that we must “speak to” a certain group of Americans in a certain way or else lose their vote. We are told that skin color or sex determines whether a group is more or less deserving of government perks. If one disagrees, one is shouted down as a racist, bigot, or chauvinist.

Yet Lincoln would disagree. The Founders would disagree as well. And so must all whose connection with that great and glorious generation of “iron men” consists of embracing an ideal that was meant to be taken literally; namely, that all men are created equal.

But it is not enough to believe this. We must do more than reread those words this Fourth of July in between the barbeques and fireworks. We must do what the Founders did, and what Lincoln did in his own time, and fight against the insidious notion that those words mean other than what they say.

Lincoln believed the Founders asked this of him and his generation. It is what the Founders ask of us still."
293,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/05/fbi-recommends-no-charges-to-be-filed-against-clinton.html,2,"FBI Director James Comey announced Tuesday that despite evidence Hillary Clinton was “extremely careless” in her handling of classified emails on a private server, the bureau will not recommend to the Department of Justice that criminal charges be brought against the former secretary of state.



“Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,” Comey said.

Clinton's spokesman Brian Fallon issued a written statement shortly after the announcement.

""We are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the Department is appropriate.,"" he said. ""As the Secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again. We are glad that this matter is now resolved.""

FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 5, 2016

Clinton is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Her Republican rival, Donald Trump, blasted the FBI's decision on Twitter.

“FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem” he tweeted.

Trump later issued two seperate statements on the matter including one that in part read: ""Comey let Clinton off the hook. ... The fix was final. The Obama administration's anointed successor has had an indictment removed from her

path and will now be able to glide to the rigged Democrat nomination.""

Despite not recommending charges be brought against Clinton, Comey delivered a blistering rebuke of her actions, saying the FBI found that 110 emails were sent or received on Clinton's server containing classified information.

He added it was possible that people hostile to the U.S. had gained access to her personal email account.

""Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,"" he said.

Comey said seven email chains were classified at the “Top Secret/Special Access Program level” when they were sent and received on Clinton’s server.

“There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,” Comey said.

Tuesday's decision helps remove what was arguably the biggest threat to her presidential campaign going forward – a criminal referral that could have led to an indictment – just weeks before her party’s national convention in Philadelphia, where she is set to seal her nomination as the Democrat standard-bearer.

Clinton consistently had downplayed the FBI investigation, even calling it a “security review,” and as recently as June 3 said there was “absolutely no possibility” she’d be indicted. Weeks ago, a scathing State Department inspector general report directly countered her long-running claim that her personal email use was allowed, though her campaign continued to defend the candidate’s actions.

In the wake of that report, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, stepped up his criticism of her email actions and said she belongs in “jail.”

The DOJ decision does not strip the email controversy as a campaign issue – Trump and the Republicans are sure to keep hammering it as the campaign lurches into full general election mode post-conventions – but shows the federal investigation did not determine the actions to be criminal, even if they were ill-advised and potentially damaging to national security.

House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican, said the decision not to prosecute Clinton defied explanation, adding: ""No one should be above the law.""

The decision comes more than a year after knowledge of Clinton’s use of a personal email account and server first became public. Clinton responded at the time with a point-by-point written explanation and a press conference in which she said she had opted to use her personal server for “convenience.”

But critics said she was clearly circumventing government systems in order to try to shield her communications from public records requests, potentially putting sensitive and highly classified government secrets at risk in the process.

During a subsequent review, more than 2,000 emails on the server were found to have contained information now deemed classified, though they apparently were not marked classified when sent.

The presumptive presidential nominee has approved a convention program that features at least 20 current or former elected officials, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Noticeably absent from a speaker list obtained by The Associated Press early Thursday are many athletes or A-List celebrities that Trump's team long suggested would help make his presidential nominating convention unlike any other.

Yet there is no shortage of political outsiders.

Speakers will include four of Trump's children, Las Vegas casino owner Phil Ruffin, and actor and former underwear model Antonio Sabαto Jr. College football star Tim Tebow will also appear on stage, the campaign confirmed Thursday morning. And in a slap at Democratic contender Hillary Clinton, Mark Geist and John Tiegen will also address the convention, both survivors of the deadly 2012 attack on the American diplomatic consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

""This impressive lineup of veterans, political outsiders, faith leaders and those who know Donald Trump the best -- his family and longtime friends -- represent a cross-section of real people facing the same challenges as every American household,"" said Trump spokesman Jason Miller.

Despite the list of familiar politicos, the convention program is a reminder that the Republican Party remains deeply divided over Trump's candidacy.

Some of the GOP's biggest names were not on the list because they refused to participate in four-day convention, which begins on Monday.

The GOP's two living presidents, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, and its two most recent presidential nominees, John McCain and Mitt Romney, all plan to avoid the Cleveland affair -- as does Ohio's Republican Gov. John Kasich. Shrugging off the high-profile absences, Trump's team suggested the convention lineup would help highlight Trump's outsider appeal.

""We are totally over-booked. We have great speakers, we have winners, we have people that aren't only political people,"" Trump told Fox News Channel on Tuesday. ""We have a lot of people that are just champions and winners.""

The New York billionaire acknowledged in recent days that he'd be hewing a little closer to tradition.

""Look, I have great respect for the institution of the conventions. I mean to me, it's very important. So we're not going to change the wheel,"" he said on Fox.

New England Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady, a Trump friend, was initially teased as a possible speaker, but will not appear next week in Cleveland. Neither will former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight or legendary boxing promoter Don King, a Cleveland resident and passionate Trump supporter.

The program will instead feature people like pro golfer Natalie Gulbis, retired astronaut Eileen Collins, and Ultimate Fighting Championship president Dana White. In addition to the Benghazi survivors, former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell, author of the book, ""Lone Survivor,"" will make an appearance, along with Wisconsin Sheriff David Clarke, a vocal critic of the Black Lives Matter movement.

The convention will also highlight religious leaders such as Jerry Falwell Jr., son of the famed televangelist, and Haskel Lookstein, the New York rabbi who converted Trump's daughter, Ivanka to Judaism.

Trump does not forget his business relationships, giving speaking slots to real estate investor Tom Barrack, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and even the general manager for Virginia's Trump Winery, Kerry Woolard.

And in a nod toward party unity, Trump will feature several former presidential competitors, including Cruz, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Ben Carson and Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.

Two finalists in Trump's search for a running mate made the list as well: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich. The other finalist, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, was not included in the program obtained by the AP.

Trump had already announced that his children would be speaking, along with his wife Melania, whom he said was already working on remarks.

Ivanka Trump, who along with Trump's other adult children, has been playing an increasingly central role in the campaign, predicted in a recent radio interview the GOP convention would be ""a convention unlike any we've ever seen.""

""It will be substantive. It will be interesting. It will be different. It's not going to be a ho-hum lineup of, you know, the typical politicians,"" she said."
295,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/13/ginsburg-under-fire-from-both-sides-over-highly-inappropriate-trump-comments.html,2,"Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced a growing and bipartisan backlash Wednesday -- including a call from Donald Trump to resign -- as she doubled down on her criticism of the presumptive GOP nominee, calling him a “faker” who is unqualified to be president.

Even political figures and newspaper editorial writers who might agree with the comments swiftly said they were out of line for a high court justice.

And Trump himself lashed out on Twitter, saying:

The liberal icon justice had kicked off the storm with comments to The New York Times published Saturday. “I can’t imagine what this place would be — I can’t imagine what the country would be -- with Donald Trump as our president. For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be -- I don’t even want to contemplate that,” she said.

She doubled down late Monday, telling CNN: “He is a faker.""

""He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. ... How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that,"" she said.

Trump swiftly responded Tuesday, telling the Times it was “highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign.”

“I think it’s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn’t believe it when I saw it,” the presumptive Republican nominee said.

Trump’s criticisms were echoed by Republican congressional leaders. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday Ginsburg’s comments were ""totally inappropriate.”

""It raises a level of skepticism that the American people have from time to time about just how objective the Supreme Court is, whether they're over there to call the balls and strikes, or weigh in on one side or another,"" he said.

House Speaker Paul Ryan used similar language at a CNN event Tuesday.

""For someone on the Supreme Court who is going to be calling balls and strikes in the future based upon whatever the next president and Congress does, that strikes me as inherently biased and out of the realm,"" Ryan said.

Ginsburg’s comments also left Democratic lawmakers squirming.

“We all know that the justices on the Supreme Court have political views. I’m not sure we’re well served by them airing them out in the open,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Politico.

“She may have got out over her skis a little bit and more forthright and political than she should have been. It’s very unusual,” Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told the outlet.

Mainstream media outlets also joined in the chorus of criticism.

“However valid her comments may have been, though, and however in keeping with her known political bent, they were still much, much better left unsaid by a member of the Supreme Court,” The Washington Post’s editorial board said Tuesday. “Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts.”

The board noted the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges says that a “judge should not . . . publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office.”

The New York Times also chimed in: “Washington is more than partisan enough without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.""

Wednesday morning brought some relief for the under-fire justice, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders giving qualified support for her comments. While the Democratic presidential candidate declined to comment on whether her comments were appropriate, he said on ABC he agrees Trump is a ""total opportunist"" and said ""the record is quite clear that he lies just a whole lot of the time.""

How can Supreme Court justices be penalized?

And frankly, as the GOP convenes its Cleveland conclave, things could be even more volatile after the three police murders in Baton Rouge.

Security concerns are off the chart in Cleveland. The country reels from Baton Rouge -- just days after the assassinations of five Dallas-area police officers. We haven’t even mentioned talked about controversial police shootings of black motorists in Baton Rouge and Minnesota. Turkey boils. People are still trying to piece together a murder-by-Renault-truck scheme in Nice, France.

When was Orlando again?

And then there are the politics at the GOP convention.

This convention features the most-unconventional candidate to head the ticket of a major political party in decades.

Welcome to the Cleveland Show.

Chairing the convention: House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

It wasn’t long ago that Ryan’s predecessor, former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, suggested the GOP should try to draft the Wisconsin Republican as the 2016 standard-bearer should Donald Trump fail to secure the nomination on the first ballot. Then Ryan called a press conference this spring to quash (once and for all) suggestions that there was some way Republicans would draft him.

So Ryan is sticking with his day job.

A better place to be?

In the days after Orlando, Ryan tried to cobble together a terrorism/guns package before Congress bolted Washington for a protracted, seven-week recess. But those efforts collapsed after Republicans rejected virtually any gun legislation. There didn’t appear to be the votes for a plan authored by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas. It would grant the attorney general a three-day window to halt potential gun sales for prospective terrorists.

“I think what we should be focused on is listening to people in communities who have done a good job of merging law enforcement with the communities so that these kinds of problems don’t occur,” Ryan said after the questionable traffic stop killings and police violence.

Dallas was known in law enforcement circles as one of those agencies which had done just that in recent years. Still, look what happened.

Democrats struggled to keep their focus on firearm laws. On Thursday night, House Democrats staged a “speak-out” about guns at sunset on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol. But even that scored scant coverage. Just an hour before the protest, the now-infamous white lorry tore through the streets of Nice, bludgeoning everyone in its path.

One violent news story, usurped by another violent news story. Before long, it too was usurped by another violent news story: the coup attempt in Turkey. And then that fell by the wayside too as soon as gunfire cut down officers in Baton Rouge.

Mike Pence who?

Baton Rouge frayed nerves even further in Cleveland.

Immediately, the union representing the Cleveland Police Department fired off a request to Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Law enforcement wanted Kasich to suspend a state law allowing for the open-carry of firearms around the convention zone.

Kasich spokeswoman Emmalee Kalmbach quickly responded.

“Ohio governors do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state Constitutional rights or state laws as suggested,” said Kalmbach.

During an appearance on Fox News, Steve Loomis, president of the Cleveland Police Patrolman’s Association, took issue with Kasich.

“That’s a well-written political statement. There’s no basis in reality. The governor could easily declare a state of emergency and act with executive powers,” said Loomis.

Of course, this is precisely why some Democrats assert it’s important to change the law. If the law poses danger, then change it.

We’ll find out soon if the law is right on this score.

Keep in mind that Cleveland banned everything from water pistols to tennis balls in an area near the convention. But firearms are fine under the Buckeye State’s open-carry statute.

One can only imagine how the Baton Rouge shootings could reignite the gun debate in Washington.

Interestingly, most of the gun reform efforts propounded by Democrats – and even some Republicans – would do little to end the spate of violence which now grips the country. Moreover, another utterly incomprehensible slaughter of law enforcement on the eve of the most combustible political convention in nearly a half-century unglues those already fretting about security in Cleveland. If the police aren’t safe, then no one is safe. That means all Constitutional freedoms are in jeopardy, too.

No wonder everyone is flipped out about security at the Republican convention. And we haven’t even gotten to the Democratic convention next week.

But …

Everyone is expecting the Republican convention to erupt into a conflagration – be it a political melee in the hall or violent protests in the streets. The bar is pretty low. But if things actually go well, a successful, relatively calm convention helps establish calm elsewhere. But if things erupt into mayhem, all bets are off.

It’s possible a debate over guns and unrest could dominate the conversation. If so, the trend of police shootings coupled with violence in Cleveland could very well drive Democrats closer to their goal of votes on gun bills.

And that could be the ultimate irony of the Cleveland convention."
297,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/20/christie-convicts-clinton-but-was-guilty-going-too-far.html,2,"Chris Christie wasn’t the only one prosecuting the case against Hillary Clinton last night—Ben Carson tossed out a reference to Lucifer—but he was clearly the lead attorney.

The onetime federal prosecutor delivered a political indictment that roused the crowd here in Cleveland, and the media reaction was sharply divided.

Was the guy who missed out on being Donald Trump’s running mate doing the time-honored task of slamming the opposing candidate? Or did he cross a line by rousing the delegates to chant for Hillary to be jailed?

Has there been another spectacle like this in American political history?

As the governor ticked off the case against Clinton—eliciting roars of “guilty!” inside the Quicken Loans Arena—left-leaning commentators were appalled. But keep in mind that there will be no shortage of Trump-bashing next week in Philadelphia.

Christie went beyond the email investigation that could have led to criminal charges against Clinton, but for the judgment of FBI Director James Comey, to include foreign policy controversies in building his case.

On mishandling classified information, he said: “Let’s face it: Hillary Clinton cared more about protecting her own secrets than she did about protecting America's secrets. Then she lied about it over and over again.”

It’s easy to second-guess Christie’s performance. He made a tough run for the presidency—remember how he took apart Marco Rubio in that debate?—and then drew widespread mockery for the way he endorsed Trump.

He openly campaigned for the VP nod that went to Mike Pence and made no secret of his disappointment.

So perhaps he was seeking some measure of vindication with his speech, or trying out for attorney general in a Trump administration.

But can Trump build a winning campaign by demonizing his opponent? Remember, these are two candidates with sky-high negatives. And the Democratic nominee is just as aggressive in casting Trump as unfit for high office.

On the left, Slate was apoplectic over Christie’s performance:

“Chris Christie’s prosecutorial jeremiad against Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night, and the baying bloodlust of the audience, might seem normal. It is not normal...

“Christie’s speech was logically incoherent. Even if you buy his damning interpretation of Clinton’s foreign policy errors, it doesn't make sense to discuss them as matters of criminal malfeasance. Emotionally, though, that’s in keeping with how Clinton’s bitterest foes talk about her: as a person of absolute corruption, who, through some sort of occult trick, moves through the world with intolerable impunity.”

On the right, National Review’s Jim Geraghty was more admiring, saying Christie “certainly remains one of the toughest attack dogs in the Republican party. It’s not often a convention speaker gets a crowd of delegates to chant ‘LOCK HER UP!’ Christie bit into his role with gusto, inviting delegates to ‘do something fun tonight,’ to ‘hold Hillary Clinton accountable for her performance and her character,’ and asking the delegates to decide whether she was ‘guilty, or not guilty.’…

“The media, which had painted Christie as a perpetually humiliated lackey ever since he endorsed Trump, had to give credit where it was due. The Washington Post’s Paul Rucker called Christie’s speech ‘a master class on how to prosecute a political opponent.’ Salina Zito of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review praised his ‘gripping case to the American people on Clinton’s judgment.’”

Christie pulled it off, but there is a danger that some of this rhetoric veers into banana-republic territory. One Trump delegate, New Hampshire state Rep. Al Baldasaro, said yesterday: “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason.”

It’s no secret this is a divided Republican convention. In an atmosphere where some delegates remain anti-Trump and party leaders like Paul Ryan are barely mentioning Trump in their speeches, Hillary Clinton is a unifying force.

The question now is whether Trump and Mike Pence, while taking their shots at Hillary, will be equally effective at building a positive case for their newly forged ticket."
298,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/07/15/2-americans-10-children-among-at-least-84-killed-in-bastille-day-terror-attack-in-nice.html,2,"Cars and trucks were barred from the Promenade des Anglais during Thursday's Bastille Day festivities, but the terrorist who plowed a 19-ton truck into a mile-long crowd of revelers - killing at least 84 - reportedly got past police by telling them he had ice cream to hand out.

Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, a 31-year-old divorced loner, petty criminal and Tunisian national began his route of carnage by slowly moving onto the packed, seaside walkway around 10:40 p.m. local time. Then, say witnesses, he gunned the engine and weaved through the horrified crowd for nearly a mile, leaving a wake of dead and broken bodies. Police killed him in a shootout minutes later.

""Such a monstrosity,"" French President Francois Hollande said Friday. ""France is deeply saddened, but it is also very strong. I can assure you we will always be stronger than the fanatics who are trying to attack us.""

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but two sources, including a U.S. counterterrorism source who collects and monitors jihadist social media, told Fox News that accounts linked to ISIS were “celebratory” and their followers were told to use the hashtag “Nice.”

Bouhlel, who shot at revelers after driving through the crowd and was then killed by police, was reportedly known to police prior to the attack although his rap sheet included just one arrest, for a road rage incident in March French Justice Minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas said.

""There was an altercation between him and another driver and he hurled a wooden pallet at the man,"" Urvoas told reporters.

Bouhlel was given a suspended sentence and had to contact police once a week, which he did, Urvoas said.

Two Americans among the dead were identified by a relative as Sean Copeland, 51, and his 11-year-old son Brodie. They were from the Austin area and were vacationing with other family members, according to relatives.

Regional President Christian Estrosi also said that more than 10 children were among the dead. A children’s hospital in Nice said it had treated some 50 children and adolescents injured in the attack. Many of the dead were reportedly Muslim, including women whose bodies were seen still clad in the faith's head scarves.

The Daily Mail reported that Bouhlel told police he was delivering ice cream when they questioned why he was parked on the promenade before the attack, which ravaged one of Europe's most scenic tourist destinations.

“Why Nice?"" Hollande asked. ""Because it is a city that is known through the world – it’s one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Why Bastille Day? Because it is the celebration of liberty.”

Damien Allemand, a journalist for Nice-Matin, said the fireworks display was over and people were getting up to leave when they heard a loud noise and screams.

""A fraction of a second later, an enormous white truck came along at a crazy speed, turning the wheel to mow down the maximum number of people,"" he said. ""I saw bodies flying like bowling pins along its route. Heard noises, cries that I will never forget.""

Another witness, Wassim Bouhlel, told The Associated Press that he saw the truck drive into the crowd, then witnessed the driver emerge with a gun and start shooting.

""There was carnage on the road,"" Bouhlel said. ""Bodies everywhere.""

Video showed men and women -- one or two pushing strollers -- racing to get away from the scenes. And, in what appeared to be evidence of a gun battle, photos showed a truck with at least half a dozen bullet holes punched through its windshield.

In addition to extending the country’s state of emergency and the Sentinel operation with 10,000 soldiers on patrol, Hollande said he was calling up ""operational reserves,"" those who have served in the past and will be brought in to help police, particularly at French borders.

President Obama condemned ""what appears to be a horrific terrorist attack"" in the strongest terms. He odered American flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of the victims.

""On this Bastille Day,"" Obama said, ""we are reminded of the extraordinary resilience and democratic values that have made France an inspiration to the entire world, and we know that the character of the French Republic will endure long after this devastating and tragic loss of life.""

Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump announced late Thursday that he would postpone the announcement of his running mate, which had been scheduled to take place Friday morning.

Flags were lowered to half-staff in Nice and in Paris. Marseille also canceled their fireworks celebrations for Friday.

299,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/21/trump-claims-gop-nomination-tells-struggling-americans-am-your-voice.html,2,"Just over a year after Donald J. Trump descended his iconic escalator in Manhattan to announce he was joining a packed field of political veterans seeking the Republican nomination for president, the New York billionaire completed an astonishing and historic political ascent Thursday night in Cleveland, officially claiming his party’s nomination — and declaring to struggling Americans, “I am your voice.”

Trump electrified the convention crowd on closing night, with chants of “U.S.A.” frequently breaking out as the nominee vowed to put “America first.” He used the speech to align his campaign squarely on the side of struggling American workers of all political stripes, as he moved to broaden his appeal beyond the Republican base that largely decided the primaries.

“Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been ignored, neglected and abandoned. … These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice,” Trump said. “I am your voice.”

And he delivered a tough law-and-order message throughout, declaring from the convention floor in Cleveland, “Safety will be restored” under a Trump presidency.

“America will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced,” Trump vowed.

He described the nation at a “moment of crisis,” citing terror attacks, violence against police and “chaos in our communities” including rising inner-city crime. “I will restore law and order to our country,” he said, while vowing to crack down on illegal immigration.

Trump’s highly anticipated speech -- at 75 minutes, the longest convention acceptance address since 1972‎ -- amounts to his closing argument before Clinton and the Democrats get their turn starting Monday in Philadelphia. As much as Republican leaders bashed the presumptive Democratic nominee in Cleveland, Democrats are likely to be just as tough on the Republicans at their convention.

The next big step for Clinton, though, will be to name her running mate, a decision that could come as early as Friday.

But before the attention turns to Clinton, Trump got in his final shots.

The businessman closed his address by turning rival Clinton’s “I’m with her” campaign slogan on its head.

“I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads, I’m with you,” Trump said.

He blasted Clinton’s foreign policy record as secretary of state – citing the bloody tumult in Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Libya – saying her legacy is “death, destruction, terrorism and weakness” and a “change in leadership” is needed.

“Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy,” he said.

And defending his aversion to political correctness, he said for anyone who wants to hear “the corporate spin, the carefully crafted lies, and the media myths, the Democrats are holding their convention next week -- go there. But here, at our convention, there will be no lies.”

Trump also cycled through his campaign promises, including the controversial calls to build a southern border wall and “immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.”

He added, “We don’t want them in our country.”

Trump vowed as well to protect LGBTQ citizens from terrorism like the Orlando club shooting. In a moment that allowed him to show his gay-rights support, Trump thanked the crowd for cheering that line: “It is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said.”

The speech caps a dramatic convention week marked by powerful displays of party unity but also tensions, flaring most recently when Ted Cruz withheld his endorsement Wednesday night.

The omission prompted boos from pro-Trump delegates, and the unrest continued into Thursday, when the Texas senator defended his decision before an audience of Texas delegates clearly divided over Cruz’s handling of the convention speech.

At the same time, Trump’s newly anointed running mate Mike Pence deftly set the stage for Trump’s big night, effectively making the conservative case for the billionaire businessman in his own nomination acceptance speech on Wednesday. The choice of Pence – a classic conservative with Midwestern roots – helped bring various factions of the party together even before the convention began.

Despite the Cruz commotion, top party leaders from House Speaker Paul Ryan to RNC Chairman Reince Priebus worked to heal divisions in the party over the course of the Cleveland coming-together.

“He’s brought millions of new voters to our party because he’s listening to Americans” anxious about the state of the country, Priebus said. “With Donald Trump and Mike Pence, America’s ready for a comeback after almost a decade of Clinton-Obama failures.”

Priebus claimed Republicans are the party with new ideas, while Democrats are the “same party doing the same old thing,” trotting out the “same old candidate” next week.

“Let’s stay united as Republicans,” Priebus said.

Members of Trump’s family also spent the week giving voters a glimpse into the tycoon’s more personal side, with daughter Ivanka introducing her father Thursday night. Appealing to women, she praised the businessman’s record supporting female employees at his organization. And touting her dad as a tireless fighter who can bring his work ethic and aptitude to the nation’s highest office, Ivanka asked all voters to put their faith in him.

“For more than a year, Donald Trump has been the people’s champion, and tonight he is the people’s nominee,” she said. “… When my father says he’ll make America great again, he will deliver.”"
300,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/21/trump-calls-cruz-non-endorsement-no-big-deal-senator-defends-decision.html,2,"Donald Trump mostly brushed off the furor over Ted Cruz’s non-endorsement speech Wednesday night, calling the snub “no big deal” even as the senator himself doubled down – though the Republican standard-bearer used the dispute to warn voters that if Democrats win in November, their justices “will destroy us all.”

Trump blasted out a pair of tweets responding to the Cruz speech backlash.

Cruz, meanwhile, defended his remarks Thursday morning at a breakfast with Texas delegates, during which he was pushed to admit he still held a grudge against Trump for “maligning” his wife and father.

Even as some in the audience Thursday morning chanted “Trump, Trump,” Cruz doubled down, saying he still doesn’t plan to endorse. He also said Trump never asked him to do so when he invited him to speak, and the campaign knew what he was going to say.

The Texas senator faced a mixed reaction from the crowd, at a gathering down the street from the convention arena where his remarks caused a commotion the night before. Some cheered, while others challenged him on whether he’d endorse. Cruz, amid some contentious exchanges with delegates, suggested endorsing Trump would have been the easy option.

But he said, “Whether you want me to or not, I’m not going to lie to you, and what I said last night is what I believe.”

And he made clear that part of the reason was personal, referencing campaign swipes at his family in explaining why he broke a primary campaign pledge to back the eventual nominee.

""I'll tell you the day that pledge was abrogated was the day this became personal -- I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,"" he said.

One delegate said, ""Get over it. This is politics.""

Cruz responded, ""No, it is not. It's about right and wrong.""

The night before, Cruz faced a backlash when he, instead of backing Trump, said only that delegates should ""vote your conscience.""

Party officials immediately slammed Cruz, with one calling the speech ""classless,"" while a senior GOP operative on the convention floor told Fox News: ""I could not believe it. I literally could not believe [Cruz] didn't endorse Trump. I'm speechless.""

Cruz, a rival of Trump's during primary season — and widely believed to already be eying a 2020 presidential run — was interrupted several times during the speech with angry chants of “endorse Trump, endorse Trump,” with the voices of discontent nearly drowning him out when Trump himself entered the Quicken Loans Arena as Cruz was finishing his speech.

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who spoke later in the evening, departed from his prepared text to attempt to recast Cruz's remarks as an endorsement of Trump.

Gingrich, a strong Trump supporter, noted what he described as the real estate mogul's ""generosity"" in allowing Cruz to address the delegates in Cleveland and said that the audience had ""misunderstood"" the point of the speech.

""So to paraphrase Ted Cruz,"" Gingrich added, ""the only way to protect that is to vote for the Trump/Pence ticket.""

A source close to Cruz's inner circle acknowledged to Fox News that the end of the speech ""was tough, but sometimes standing for principle means getting booed.""

""It's not classless to compliment Trump for winning,"" the source added. ""It's not classless to highlight areas of policy where they can work together like border security, trade or fighting ISIS. It's not classless to call on all his supporters to not stay home, but turn out.”

The speech overshadowed what was supposed to be a coming out party for Trump’s vice presidential running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.

Pence nevertheless delivered just what the Trump campaign hoped he would — a measured but forceful message that set the tone for the general election campaign, while assuring voters that Trump was the best option for America, and the conservative choice.

Drawing a sharp contrast between Trump and Hillary Clinton and calling 2016 a “time for choosing,” Pence echoed the message of party leaders the night before: It’s Trump or Clinton in November, so pick a side.

“The choice couldn’t be more clear. Americans can elect someone who literally personifies the failed establishment in Washington, D.C., or we can choose a leader who will fight every day to make America great again,” Pence said.

He added, “It’s change versus status quo, and my fellow Republicans, when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States of America the change will be huge.”

Pence appealed to voters Wednesday to “resolve here and now that Hillary Clinton will never become president of the United States of America.”

Calling Trump the “genuine article” and a “winner” who “never backs down,” he also said Trump is the candidate to confront radical Islam, cut taxes, grow the economy, shrink the bureaucracy, enforce immigration law and appoint Supreme Court justices who will uphold the Constitution.

But the colossal screwup over the passages that were strikingly similar to Michelle Obama’s Democratic convention speech is getting worse because the campaign is denying the obvious.

Folks, the video evidence is out there. Cable news channels are playing the Melania/Michelle similarities back to back. Everyone knows the Trump campaign is allergic to apologies, but insisting that this was a mere coincidence is just inflaming the media coverage.

It is, of course, not that big a deal. Melania is neither a politician nor a practiced public speaker. Although she claimed ownership of the Cleveland address in an interview, it’s clear that it was largely the work of speechwriters. What, they thought no one would notice that the current first lady used some of the same phrases in 2008?

So in insisting that the story is bogus, campaign officials are actually giving it legs by prompting anchors and reporters to prove the case and to question why the Trump operation persists in its denials.

“There's no cribbing of Michelle Obama's speech,” campaign chief Paul Manafort told CNN’s “New Day” this morning. “These were common words and values …To think that she would be cribbing Michelle Obama's words is crazy. I mean and so this is once again an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton, she seeks out to demean her and take her down it's not going to work.”

What does this have to do with threatening Hillary Clinton?

The controversy is taking the focus off the hard-edged speeches by Rudy Giuliani and others on Monday night in favor of a flap that is, in all honesty, more fun for journalists to cover.

Here is some of the wording, via the New York Times:

Melania Trump, 2016:

""From a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise, that you treat people with respect. They taught and showed me values and morals in their daily lives. That is a lesson that I continue to pass along to our son. And we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow. Because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.”

Michelle Obama, 2008:



“Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you’re going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don’t know them, and even if you don’t agree with them. And Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generation. Because we want our children — and all children in this nation — to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.”

Whatever you think of the contretemps, I love that it was broken by a random dude on Twitter. Jarrett Hill, described as an interior designer and journalist, was sitting in a Starbucks in L.A. when he noticed one similarity from eight years ago and began checking for others.

The other striking thing from last night: While Patricia Smith, whose son was killed in Benghazi, was blaming Hillary Clinton on stage, Trump called in to Bill O’Reilly—essentially preempting his own convention for those few minutes. No one ever called him a conventional candidate."

The Vermont senator blasted Trump as a candidate who ""insults"" minorities and ""divides us up.""

“Based on her ideas and her leadership, Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States,” the Vermont senator told the rowdy and emotional convention crowd, with many of his supporters visibly crying during his remarks and chanting his name.

Sanders appealed to supporters Monday night to get behind Clinton, as he tried to restore order at the Democratic convention after a chaotic opening day marked by intense street protests and near-constant disruptions inside the arena from delegates and others loyal to him.

Sanders suddenly found himself in the role of helping the Democratic Party whose establishment had shunned him for much of the primary race. But he now is virtually their only hope for easing the tensions at the Philadelphia convention, where delegates are poised to crown Clinton as the party’s presidential nominee on Tuesday.

“I understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process. I think it’s fair to say that no one is more disappointed than I am,” he told delegates. “But to all of our supporters – here and around the country – I hope you take enormous pride in the historical accomplishments we have achieved.”

Sanders argued that, despite his differences with Clinton during the primary campaign, her views are far more in line with his than are Republican nominee Trump’s – on issues ranging from the minimum wage to climate change to college tuition costs.

“It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues,” he said. But Sanders said they have come together on some of them, and his side was able to win major changes to the party platform.

“Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand with her tonight,” Sanders said, though some in the audience still booed at Clinton’s name.

Trump, tweeting from the sidelines, fired back:

Sanders was joined by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in appealing to the left wing of the party to unite behind Clinton. First lady Michelle Obama, too, worked to ease the tensions in the convention hall in an earlier speech that at times seemed to rally the divided crowd.

“America faces a choice,” Warren said. “We’re here today because our choice is Hillary Clinton. I’m with Hillary.”

She called Trump a ""man who inherited a fortune from his father” and cares only for himself.

""Donald Trump has no real plans for jobs, for college kids, for seniors. No plans to make anything great for anyone except rich guys like Donald Trump.""

The liberal icon, who spoke right before Sanders, still faced small pockets of unrest as she delivered a full-throated Clinton endorsement, with some people chanting “we trusted you” over her remarks. But Warren called Clinton “a woman who fights for all of us.”

Together, the two speakers had an opportunity to tamp down the unrest among liberal activists, many of whom not only backed Sanders during the turbulent primary battle but wanted to either see Warren step into the ring or be tapped for running mate. Whether their words can now help calm the storm inside and outside the convention hall remains to be seen.

Sanders’ speech could help. “It was a very unifying message, the essence of unity,” Kit Andrews, a Vermont alternate delegate and Sanders supporter, told FoxNews.com. “It’s a long process to bring people together. He has always said that.”

Sanders and Warren, along with Michelle Obama and Clinton booster New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, addressed the convention at the close of a noisy and boisterous Monday session. From the very start, Sanders supporters booed and jeered convention officials as they tried to gavel in.

Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, who was presiding, scolded the protesters as they interrupted at the very mention of Clinton.

“We are all Democrats, and we need to act like it,” she said.

Michelle Obama, speaking hours and countless disruptions later, seemed to draw a more positive response, eliciting applause during her lines on Clinton.

“I’m with her,” Obama declared, asking Democrats to do for the former secretary of state what they did for her husband – and turn out to the polls.

“Between now and November, we need to do what we did eight years ago and four years ago. … We need to get out every vote!” she said. “Let’s get to work.”

The audience remained visibly divided during her remarks, however, with one man being shushed for saying, “We love you, Michelle.”

Obama didn't leave the stage without taking a veiled shot at Trump. She warned that the White House couldn't be in the hands of someone with a ""thin skin or tendency to lash out or someone who tells voters the country could be great again.

Booker, who had been considered for running mate before the job went to Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, earlier blasted Republican nominee Donald Trump while touting Clinton’s support for a “fair wage” and “debt-free college” – and trying to connect her ideals to Sanders’.

“It represents the best of our values, the best of our history and the best of our party -- all of our shared ideas and values together,” Booker said.

Several celebrities including comedian Sarah Silverman and actress Eva Longoria also rallied to Clinton’s defense – with Silverman even taking on the Sanders crowd, saying, “Bernie or bust people, you’re being ridiculous.”

Even before the disruptions in the arena, the convention had kicked off Monday under a cloud of controversy -- after the leak of emails indicating an anti-Bernie Sanders bias inside the DNC forced the resignation of Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

She had been expected to open the convention anyway, but after facing continued backlash from Sanders supporters Monday morning was replaced in that role by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake.

Anti-Clinton sentiment, however, continued to run high inside and outside the convention site, as pro-Sanders and other demonstrators marched from Camden to downtown Philadelphia and ultimately toward the arena – all while the convention was gaveling in. Inside the hall, Sanders supporters jeered Democratic officials trying to move the proceedings along.

The developments added up to a far more chaotic start than at the Republicans’ convention a week ago in Cleveland. Trump, from the sidelines, stoked the unrest inside the Democratic ranks by tweeting about how Bernie Sanders had been mistreated by the party.

He tweeted before the convention start: “The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!”

303,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/22/trump-claims-gop-nomination-tells-struggling-americans-am-your-voice.html,2,"Just over a year after Donald J. Trump descended his iconic escalator in Manhattan to announce he was joining a packed field of political veterans seeking the Republican nomination for president, the New York billionaire completed an astonishing and historic political ascent Thursday night in Cleveland, officially claiming his party’s nomination — and declaring to struggling Americans, “I am your voice.”

Trump electrified the convention crowd on closing night, with chants of “U.S.A.” frequently breaking out as the nominee vowed to put “America first.” He used the speech to align his campaign squarely on the side of struggling American workers of all political stripes, as he moved to broaden his appeal beyond the Republican base that largely decided the primaries.

“Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been ignored, neglected and abandoned. … These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice,” Trump said. “I am your voice.”

And he delivered a tough law-and-order message throughout, declaring from the convention floor in Cleveland, “Safety will be restored” under a Trump presidency.

“America will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced,” Trump vowed.

He described the nation at a “moment of crisis,” citing terror attacks, violence against police and “chaos in our communities” including rising inner-city crime. “I will restore law and order to our country,” he said, while vowing to crack down on illegal immigration.

Trump’s highly anticipated speech -- at 75 minutes, the longest convention acceptance address since 1972‎ -- amounts to his closing argument before Clinton and the Democrats get their turn starting Monday in Philadelphia. As much as Republican leaders bashed the presumptive Democratic nominee in Cleveland, Democrats are likely to be just as tough on the Republicans at their convention.

The next big step for Clinton, though, will be to name her running mate, a decision that could come as early as Friday.

But before the attention turns to Clinton, Trump got in his final shots.

The businessman closed his address by turning rival Clinton’s “I’m with her” campaign slogan on its head.

“I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads, I’m with you,” Trump said.

He blasted Clinton’s foreign policy record as secretary of state – citing the bloody tumult in Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Libya – saying her legacy is “death, destruction, terrorism and weakness” and a “change in leadership” is needed.

“Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy,” he said.

And defending his aversion to political correctness, he said for anyone who wants to hear “the corporate spin, the carefully crafted lies, and the media myths, the Democrats are holding their convention next week -- go there. But here, at our convention, there will be no lies.”

Trump also cycled through his campaign promises, including the controversial calls to build a southern border wall and “immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.”

He added, “We don’t want them in our country.”

Trump vowed as well to protect LGBTQ citizens from terrorism like the Orlando club shooting. In a moment that allowed him to show his gay-rights support, Trump thanked the crowd for cheering that line: “It is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said.”

The speech caps a dramatic convention week marked by powerful displays of party unity but also tensions, flaring most recently when Ted Cruz withheld his endorsement Wednesday night.

The omission prompted boos from pro-Trump delegates, and the unrest continued into Thursday, when the Texas senator defended his decision before an audience of Texas delegates clearly divided over Cruz’s handling of the convention speech.

At the same time, Trump’s newly anointed running mate Mike Pence deftly set the stage for Trump’s big night, effectively making the conservative case for the billionaire businessman in his own nomination acceptance speech on Wednesday. The choice of Pence – a classic conservative with Midwestern roots – helped bring various factions of the party together even before the convention began.

Despite the Cruz commotion, top party leaders from House Speaker Paul Ryan to RNC Chairman Reince Priebus worked to heal divisions in the party over the course of the Cleveland coming-together.

“He’s brought millions of new voters to our party because he’s listening to Americans” anxious about the state of the country, Priebus said. “With Donald Trump and Mike Pence, America’s ready for a comeback after almost a decade of Clinton-Obama failures.”

Priebus claimed Republicans are the party with new ideas, while Democrats are the “same party doing the same old thing,” trotting out the “same old candidate” next week.

“Let’s stay united as Republicans,” Priebus said.

Members of Trump’s family also spent the week giving voters a glimpse into the tycoon’s more personal side, with daughter Ivanka introducing her father Thursday night. Appealing to women, she praised the businessman’s record supporting female employees at his organization. And touting her dad as a tireless fighter who can bring his work ethic and aptitude to the nation’s highest office, Ivanka asked all voters to put their faith in him.

“For more than a year, Donald Trump has been the people’s champion, and tonight he is the people’s nominee,” she said. “… When my father says he’ll make America great again, he will deliver.”"
304,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/24/wasserman-schultz-to-step-down-as-dnc-chairwoman-amid-email-scandal.html,2,"Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced Sunday she will soon step down as Democratic National Committee chairwoman, amid the fallout over leaked emails indicating an anti-Bernie Sanders bias in her operation -- a stunning development just hours before the start of her party's convention.

In a written statement, the controversial party leader said she was ""privileged to serve as the DNC Chair for five and a half years.""

She said her first priority is serving the people of her Florida congressional district while stressing the importance of helping elect Hillary Clinton, adding: ""Going forward, the best way for me to accomplish those goals is to step down as Party Chair at the end of this convention.""

She said she would still ""open and close the convention,"" which begins Monday in Philadelphia, and address delegates ""about the stakes involved in this election,"" in her role as party chair.



She apparently will step down at the end of the convention. Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile is slated to take over as interim chair during the rest of the general election campaign.

The announcement came just hours after reports first surfaced that Wasserman Schultz may be denied a speaking role at the convention, and that she would not be presiding -- a decision apparently made under pressure from the Clinton campaign and the White House.

Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, the former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, will instead preside over the Democratic proceedings as convention chairwoman. On the sidelines, party officials were already discussing Wasserman Schultz' role as DNC chairwoman.

One Democratic source told Fox News, “Debbie is being forced out sooner than later.”

The rapid-fire set of developments ahead of the convention kick-off raise immediate questions about whether the party can unite its battling factions in Philadelphia this week.

Officials were clearly trying to prevent anger over the email leak controversy and other issues from disrupting proceedings. The emails only bolstered claims from Sanders – and Republican nominee Donald Trump – that the system was rigged against the Vermont senator.

Trump tweeted after the DNC news broke:

Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.) — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016

Sanders himself blasted the DNC and Wasserman Schultz in interviews earlier Sunday, demanding her resignation as party chairwoman.

“I think [Wasserman Schultz] should resign. Period. And I think we need a new chair who is going the lead us in a very different direction,” Sanders told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, hours before the resignation was announced.

He later issued a statement thanking her for her service, and saying she made ""the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party.""

President Obama and Clinton both issued statements thanking Wasserman Schultz for her service.

""I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year's historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week's events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,"" Clinton said, adding that she will serve as ""honorary chair of my campaign's 50-state program to gain ground and elect Democrats in every part of the country"" and act as a surrogate.

The WikiLeaks document dump, which included emails from January 2015 to May 2016, purportedly came from the accounts of seven DNC officials. In a May 5 email, a DNC employee asked a colleague to collect information on his religious beliefs – claiming it might sway voters in West Virginia and Kentucky. In that particular email, Sanders' name was not mentioned, but he was the only other candidate in the race at that time against Clinton.

DNC chief financial officer Brad Marshall wrote, “This would make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.”

Others from Wasserman Schultz herself contained very strong language, raising questions about her status as an ostensibly neutral party official.

Responding to Sanders’ complaints the party hasn’t been fair to him, she wrote to a staffer in an April email: “Spoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do.”

Responding to the same staffer a month later regarding Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver blaming the Nevada state party for a raucous convention, she wrote, “Damn liar. Particularly scummy that he barely acknowledges the violent and threatening behavior that occurred.”"
305,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/27/obama-kaine-pile-on-trump-in-scorching-warm-up-for-closing-night.html,2,"President Obama and Tim Kaine tag-teamed to deliver a scorching warm-up Wednesday for Hillary Clinton to accept the party’s nomination for president at the Democratic convention, with the president accusing Republican Donald Trump of only offering “slogans” and “fear” – and Clinton’s newly tapped running mate almost upstaging the commander-in-chief with his gusty impression of the billionaire’s New Yawk bravado.

Framing the election as a choice between pessimism and optimism, Obama endorsed Clinton as a tough and tenacious leader, saying “she is fit” and “ready” to be the next commander-in-chief – while rejecting Trump’s claim that only he can cure the nation’s ills.

“America is already great. America is already strong,” Obama said. “And I promise you, our strength, our greatness, does not depend on Donald Trump.”

Of Clinton, he said: “There has never been a man or a woman – not me, not Bill, nobody – more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America.”

As the kicker, Clinton surprised the crowd by showing up onstage with Obama at the end of his speech, the two of them hugging and waving to delegates who were holding up ""thank you"" signs.

The president’s convention embrace of his one-time political rival is sure to fuel a central charge of Republicans in the general election – that Clinton represents a third Obama term, and the status quo. Without question, the sitting president depends on his former secretary of state to help preserve his legacy, and fend off recurring Republican attempts to repeal ObamaCare, upend environmental regulations and more.

To that end, Obama and a host of speakers on the convention’s third night intensified their attacks on Trump, as they talked up Clinton’s qualifications.

“The Donald is not really a plans guy. He’s not really a facts guy, either,” Obama said. “He calls himself a business guy, which is true, but I have to say, I know plenty of businessmen and women who’ve achieved remarkable success without leaving a trail of lawsuits, and unpaid workers, and people feeling like they got cheated.”

Obama also used the platform to defend his record in office, declaring he’s “more optimistic about the future of America than ever before.”

Trump countered on Twitter: “Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.”

The night in Philadelphia was replete with barbed insults even as the musical acts kept returning to themes of “love” and understanding. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid lit into Trump earlier in the night, calling him a “hateful con man” and “egomaniac.” Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, an ex-Clinton primary rival, gave a fiery speech calling Trump a “bully racist.”

Obama’s address, marking a passing of the torch to the woman he defeated for the nomination eight years ago, was delivered shortly after delegates finalized the party’s 2016 ticket. In an overwhelming voice vote, they nominated Virginia Sen. Kaine for vice president.

Kaine himself, after starting off talking family and faith, shifted gears in the second half and shelved his nice-guy persona to deliver a broadside against Trump, as he accepted the VP nomination from his party.

“Hillary has a passion for kids and families. … Donald Trump has a passion too: It's himself,” Kaine said. The senator was merciless after that. He went on to mock Trump, imitating his Queens accent when he says, “Believe me.”

“We're gonna destroy ISIS so fast -- believe me! There's nothing suspicious in my tax returns -- believe me!” Kaine bellowed, as the crowd roared with laughter. “Here's the thing. Most people, when they run for president, they don't just say ‘believe me.’ They respect you enough to tell you how they will get things done. … You cannot believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth.”

The senator also delivered several lines in Spanish as he recalled his long-ago work with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras.

While he was speaking, the Trump campaign was firing out press releases ripping Kaine as a “job killer” and part of the Washington establishment.

The sitting vice president, Joe Biden, also went after Trump on all fronts, saying the billionaire businessman would endanger national security – and lacks compassion.

“He’s trying to tell us he cares about the middle class. Give me a break. That’s a bunch of malarkey,” Biden said.

Remnants of the noisy factions that have disrupted proceedings since the week’s start flared up again during the Kaine voice vote – with a large section of the California delegation chanting, “Roll call! Roll call!” – and during ex-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta’s remarks. But some of the unrest has subsided, as party elders have methodically worked since Sunday – when they ousted party Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz over a leaked email scandal – to convince Bernie Sanders’ soldiers to lay down their arms.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who had considered an independent presidential run before ruling it out, made a late appearance Wednesday – with an endorsement that could help Clinton reach out to vital independents whom Trump also is courting, and a bagful of zingers aimed squarely at his fellow billionaire.

“Trump says he wants to run the nation like he’s run his business. God help us!” Bloomberg said, calling him a “dangerous demagogue” and claiming it’s “imperative” to elect Clinton.

The focus of the third convention night was heavy on gun control, global warming and even national security, an issue largely absent from the first two nights.

Obama delivered his address just weeks after his Justice Department closed the books on its investigation into Clinton’s improper use of a private server and email while secretary of state, opting to pursue no charges. Despite allegations from Republicans of political favoritism, the decision helped clear away one of the last major hurdles to her nomination going into the Philadelphia convention.

Together, the speakers Wednesday set the stage for Clinton to deliver her nomination acceptance speech and close out the convention Thursday night, after becoming Tuesday the first woman in U.S. history nominated for president by a major party.

The president’s speech Wednesday effectively kicks off Obama’s general election role as a chief Clinton surrogate. The New York Times reported that aides mostly have cleared his calendar for October and expect him to be on the trail regularly for Clinton until the election."
306,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/28/haywire-over-hacking-media-refuse-to-believe-trumps-russia-comments-were-sarcastic.html,2,"The uproar over Donald Trump’s latest comments is a classic case of media-generated outrage.

All over the newspapers, all over the airwaves, there is shock and horror that Trump would appeal to Russia to furnish Hillary Clinton’s hacked emails.

The lines seemed so obviously sarcastic to me, as I watched Trump’s presser from the Democratic convention here in Philadelphia, that I didn’t see the tsunami coming. Maybe I’m wrong, but as a longtime Trump-watcher, that’s how it came off to me.

But think about the media coverage for a minute. To believe that the Republican nominee was dead serious in urging an adversary of the United States to commit or complete an act of espionage against his Democratic opponent is to believe that Trump is clinically insane.

And I do think many journalists and commentators view him as a bit unhinged. That’s why this makes sense to them. They think Trump is so off the wall that it seems perfectly plausible.

Others, I believe, don’t believe Trump really meant it, but they think he stepped in it with the remarks and are happy to bash him over it.

Look, Trump says a lot of incendiary things. His comments on Mexicans and Muslims and the like get him into trouble and are more than fair game for criticism. But this one is different.

“Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” Trump said. He added that the press would love that.

Trump is a master, of course, of saying things that are just far enough over the line that he drives a story for days. In this case, it means keeping a focus on the 33,000 emails that Clinton deleted from her private server as pundits and politicians debate whether he crossed a line—siphoning covering from the convention speeches by President Obama, Vice President Biden, Bill Clinton and others.

Trump now says he was being sarcastic and we don’t even know whether the Russians are behind the hacking.

What’s striking about the coverage is that it barely acknowledges that this could be an open question:

The New York Times headline: “Donald Trump’s Appeal to Russia Shocks Foreign Policy Experts”:

“There is simply no precedent for this: A presidential candidate publicly appealing to a foreign adversary to intervene in the election on his behalf.”

The Washington Post lead: “Republican nominee Donald Trump pleaded directly Wednesday with the Russian government to meddle in the U.S. presidential election by finding and releasing tens of thousands of private emails from his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton — an extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented maneuver in American politics.""

Politico’s lead: ""Donald Trump's call on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails has shocked, flabbergasted and appalled lawmakers and national security experts across the political spectrum, with one saying it was ‘tantamount to treason.’”



“Is it possible that Trump was being sarcastic? That he was joking?” CNN’s Carol Costello asked her panel. The response was no, and even if he was, it wasn’t funny.

This is why professional politicians avoid sarcasm, to avoid uttering words that create an uproar. But Trump delights in it, which is why his supporters love him, his detractors view him as reckless and the media can never seem to get enough."
307,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/08/08/trump-to-outline-economic-plan-in-detroit.html,2,"Donald Trump vowed Monday to ""jumpstart"" the U.S. economy by cutting taxes and regulation and unshackling the American energy industry -- as he touted an economic plan he called a ""night-and-day-contrast"" with the “job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.”

“We have begun a conversation about the great economic recovery of America,” Trump said in Detroit, which he described as a once-thriving industrial city destroyed by failed Democratic Party policies. He used the address to not only unveil a new version of his economic plan but draw a stark contrast with rival Hillary Clinton's approach.

“Detroit is a living, breathing example of my opponent’s failed economic policies,” said Trump, arguing bad international trade deals like NAFTA have resulted in record unemployment for the city and made a “total disaster” of the entire U.S. economy.

“Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton’s apology,” he continued.

In a speech received with subdued applause and repeatedly interrupted by protesters, Trump vowed to create 500,000 jobs annually in the first seven years of his administration, while cutting business taxes and reducing federal regulations -- with hopes of resetting his presidential campaign in the process.

Trump also touted his plan to eliminate the estate tax, put a moratorium on new federal regulations and reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, in his speech at the Detroit Economic Club.

He also said he wants to simplify the tax code with the GOP-led House proposal of reducing the number to tax brackets from seven to three -- 12, 25 and 33 percent.



“Detroit, the Motor City, will come roaring back,” Trump said.

He also vowed to re-negotiate the decades-old North American Free Trade Agreement and warned that Clinton, if elected, would enact the Obama administration’s Trans Pacific Partnership, which critics argue would create even more disadvantages for the United States in international trade.

“We cannot let her win because that will be disaster for Detroit and everybody else,” Trump said. “Hillary Clinton’s Trans Pacific Partnership will be even bigger and even worse than NAFTA.”

Clinton says she opposes the TPP in its current form.

In an appeal to unemployed steel workers, miners and other blue collar workers whom Trump hopes to win over in Rust Belt states, the GOP nominee also vowed to end federal regulations that have throttled coal plants and eliminated jobs.

“The Obama-Clinton [agenda] has blocked jobs through anti-energy regulations,” he said. “The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan jobs. Clinton said she will put coal miners out of business. … A Trump administration will end this war on the American worker and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth.”

The businessman and first-time candidate hopes to steady his campaign after a rough week in which he was criticized for comments about a Muslim-American family whose son, an Army captain, was killed in the Iraq War and for temporarily withholding his endorsement of House Speaker Paul Ryan in Tuesday's Wisconsin primary.

The Clinton campaign ripped into the proposed Trump plan Monday morning, ahead of the speech, saying his tax breaks are only for the wealthy and includes no paid family leave or increase in the federal minimum wage.

“We wanted to offer a look at how a Trump presidency would cause damage to the American economy and working families,” the campaign said in a 7-point memo. “We can be certain of this because we’ve read Trump’s ‘plans,’ listened to his words, reviewed what analysts have to say about what he wants to do. And it's the only logical conclusion.”

While Trump was delivering his speech, Clinton was in the battleground state of Florida talking about jobs.

While polls have shown that voters have deep concerns about Trump's temperament and fitness for office, recent polling puts him ahead of or on par with Clinton, on whom people trust more on the economy.

She is set to deliver her own economic speech in Detroit on Thursday, which is expected to highlight her plan, if elected, to make ""the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II.""

She has also proposed raising taxes on the highest-income earners, including a surcharge on multimillionaires, but analysts have found lower-income earners would see little change beyond measures like additional tax credits for expenses like out-of-pocket health care costs.

In his speech Monday, Trump also announced his plan to allow parents to fully deduct the cost of childcare from their taxable income. He also called again for boosting domestic energy production -- a plan his campaign estimates can add $6 trillion in local, state and federal revenue over the next four decades.

Trump also discussed new investments in infrastructure, and said further details about his overall economic plan will be released in the coming weeks.

This wasn’t the first time Trump set out his economic vision. He first unveiled his tax plan in the fall of 2015, framing it as a boon to the middle class. ""It's going to cost me a fortune,"" he told reporters as he vowed to lower taxes across the board without exploding the deficit.

But a host of independent groups crunching the numbers soon concluded otherwise. The plan, they said, dramatically favored the wealthy over the middle class and would increase the debt by as much as $10 trillion over the next decade.

Trump had promised at the time that he would make up for lost revenue by closing a slew of loopholes. He declined to provide specifics. And a companion plan on reducing government spending, which he had promised would follow, never came.

308,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/08/04/media-trumpeting-trump-implosion-but-is-it-real.html,2,"This is what a full-fledged feeding frenzy looks like.

With Donald Trump facing the roughest stretch of his candidacy, the media have moved from questioning his sanity to depicting a campaign in disarray and top Republicans still wondering whether they can dump the nominee.

That won’t happen, of course, but it’s an indication of the toxic nature of the coverage and the flood of anti-Trump leaks now washing across the media landscape.

There’s a natural piling-on effect when campaigns go off the rails: The polls dip, the critics step up their rhetoric, staffers start pointing fingers, and the press keeps the vicious cycle going.

But I’ve never seen anything like this.

Things reached the point yesterday morning that CNBC’s John Harwood tweeted: “Longtime ally of Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign manager: 'Manafort not challenging Trump anymore. Mailing it in. Staff suicidal.'""

And there was this from CNN: “A source tells @DanaBashCNN that some Trump campaign staff are frustrated w/ candidate lately, ‘feel like they are wasting their time.’""

I am told by knowledgeable campaign sources that Manafort is not going anywhere and believes that Trump will be getting back on message.

I am further told that reports of a planned “intervention” with the candidate, led by Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani, are false.

And the sources also say that, contrary to media reports, party chairman Reince Priebus is not furious with Trump, though he is disappointed with the nominee’s refusal to endorse Paul Ryan.

Trump and the House speaker appear to have an increasingly tenuous relationship. Trump is also refusing to back John McCain, one of several Republicans who ripped him for his handling of the Khizr Khan controversy.

Manafort told Fox’s Jon Scott that the campaign is “in good shape.”

Asked about reports that outside allies were plotting an “intervention” with the candidate, Manafort said: ""This is the first I'm hearing about it,"" adding that some in the media are “saying untrue things.



Much of this grows out the Khan debacle, which the media seized upon after his Democratic convention speech about his son’s death in Iraq but which Trump then fueled by criticizing a Gold Star family.

That, in turn, revived fears among Republicans that Trump is too busy picking fights with everyone who insults him to run a disciplined campaign. I’m told there is frustration within his campaign that he keeps diverting to side issues, often in response to cable news chatter, rather than staying focused on attacking Hillary Clinton.

Even Gingrich, a close adviser and VP finalist, is criticizing his friend (while also lambasting media bias). “He has not made the transition to being the potential president of the United States, which is a much tougher league,” Gingrich told Maria Bartiromo. He added that “some of what Trump has done is just very self-destructive.”

Along comes ABC’s Jonathan Karl, reporting that “senior party officials are so frustrated — and confused — by Donald Trump’s erratic behavior that they are exploring how to replace him on the ballot if he drops out.”

Good luck with that.

MSNBC ran headlines all day about the Trump ""intervention,"" but there were no signs it would materialize.

All of this has mushroomed into a tsunami of negative media coverage, with very little scrutiny of Clinton, at least right now.

Trump has been at war with the press from the day he got in the race, even as he drew enormous amounts of ink and airtime. But he can't expand his base simply by bashing the media, as satisfying as that may be.

The pundits, especially the ones on the left and right who detest him, are enjoying this latest chance to write him off.

But that has proven dangerous in the past. And campaign narratives, even the most relentlessly negative, have a way of changing at a moment's notice.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke in a live nationally-televised address in front of Istanbul city Hall. At least 51 people were killed and dozens of others wounded in the attack late Saturday in the southeastern city of Gaziantep.

Erdogan added that there was “absolutely no difference” between ISIS, Kurdish rebels and the movement behind the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, calling them terrorists. He said 69 people were wounded, with 17 of them in critical condition.

The remains of a suicide vest have been recovered at the site, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency, citing a statement by the chief public prosecutor's office.

""We stand with the people of Turkey as they defend their democracy in the face of all forms of terrorism. We are in close touch with Turkish authorities,"" National Security Council spokesman Ned Price responded, calling the attack ""barbaric.""

Turkey has been the target of attacks in the past year that have been claimed by Kurdish militants linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) or were blamed on ISIS. In June, suspected Islamic State militants attacked Istanbul’s main airport with guns and bombs, killing 44 people. A dual suicide bombing blamed on ISIS at a peace rally in Turkey's capital, Ankara, in October killed 103 victims.

Earlier this week, a string of bombings blamed on the PKK that targeted police and soldiers killed at least a dozen people. A fragile, 2 ½ year-long peace process between the PKK and the government collapsed last year, leading to a resumption of the three-decade-long conflict.

""This was a barbaric attack. It appears to be a suicide attack. All terror groups, the PKK, Daesh, the (Gulen movement) are targeting Turkey. But God willing, we will overcome,” Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek told NTV television.

Daesh is an Arabic name for ISIS.

Simsek later traveled to Gaziantep along with the country's health minister to visit the wounded and inspect the site of the attack. He characterized the attack as “barbaric.”

""This is a massacre of unprecedented cruelty and barbarism,"" he told reporters in Gaziantep. ""We ... are united against all terror organizations. They will not yield.""

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim condemned the bombing that turned ""a wedding party into a place of mourning"" and vowed to prevail over the ""devilish"" attacks.

""No matter what this treacherous terror organization is called, we as the people, the state, and the government will pursue our determined struggle against it,"" he said.

A brief statement from the Gaziantep governor's office said the bomb attack on the wedding in the Sahinbey district occurred at 10:50 p.m.

Mehmet Tascioglu, a local journalist, told NTV television, that the huge explosion could be heard in many parts of the city.

Police sealed off the site of the explosion and forensic teams moved in. Hundreds of residents gathered near the site chanting ""Allah is great"" as well as slogans denouncing attacks.

310,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2016/08/18/us-swimmers-pulled-off-homebound-flight-as-questions-surround-lochte-robbery-claim.html,2,"Police in Rio de Janeiro Thursday indicted U.S. Olympic swimmers Ryan Lochte and James Feigen for falsely reporting a crime, the latest twist in a bizarre case that has overshadowed the final week of the Summer Games.

Lochte originally claimed that he, Feigen and teammates Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz were robbed at gunpoint early Sunday morning. Instead, Rio police used security camera footage to claim that the athletes were not robbed, but had vandalized a gas station bathroom.

Under Brazilian law, a judge must decide whether to accept the police indictment. If the judge does not accept the indictment, the case will be dropped. Falsely reporting a crime is punishable by a fine or up to six months in prison.

The U.S. Olympic Committee said in a statement late Thursday that the swimmers' behavior was ""not acceptable, nor does it represent the values of Team USA or the conduct of the vast majority of its members.""

The USOC said that Feigen had given ""a revised statement"" to police ""with the hope of securing the release of his passport as soon as possible."" Lochte returned to the U.S. earlier this week, before a Brazilian judge ordered the swimmers' passports seized.

""We apologize to our hosts in Rio and the people of Brazil for this distracting ordeal in the midst of what should rightly be a celebration of excellence,"" the USOC statement added.

Conger and Bentz were not indicted because they did not speak to police until Wednesday, when they were pulled off a flight bound for the United States by authorities, and never claimed they had been robbed. The USOC confirmed that the pair had been given back their passports and flew out of Rio Thursday night.

Because Lochte and Feigen are first-time offenders, they will likely only be fined if the judge accepts the indictment.

At Thursday's news conference, Rio police said a security guard pointed a gun at the athletes as the swimmers attempted to leave the scene in a taxi cab before police arrived.

""Yes, according to the security guards, they said that because one of them was very upset,"" Rio de Janeiro chief of civil police Fernando da Silva Veloso said through a translator. ""So if there was a use of an arm it was to contain them.""

Once they were contained, ""the weapon was holstered,"" da Silva Veloso said. The athletes were outside of the cab when the weapon was pointed at them.

Police said Lochte was the individual at the gas station who appeared ""most upset,"" and da Silva Veloso confirmed that the group was ""under the influence"" during the encounter.

Police said the athletes ultimately gave money -- ""voluntarily"" -- to the owner of the gas station to repair the alleged damages. Asked if the use of a gun could have been seen by the swimmers as an extortion attempt, da Silva Veloso said ""For now, there's nothing that indicates this.""

The police chief, however, left open the door that the use of a weapon could have been seen by the Olympians as being excessive behavior.

""Maybe yes, maybe no. It depends on the circumstance,"" said da Silva Veloso, who declined to identify the security guards.

He said the guards' guns were registered and their actions are not ""suspect.""

Informed that an attorney for Lochte believed the Rio police had ""overreached"" during their investigation, da Silva Velos responded: ""We don’t have anyone with a clown’s nose here. I think his comments merit that response.""

Lochte described the alleged robbery to NBC’s “Today” show Sunday.

""We got pulled over, in the taxi, and these guys came out with a badge, a police badge, no lights, no nothing just a police badge and they pulled us over,"" Lochte said. ""They pulled out their guns, they told the other swimmers to get down on the ground — they got down on the ground. I refused, I was like we didn't do anything wrong, so — I'm not getting down on the ground.

""And then the guy pulled out his gun, he cocked it, put it to my forehead and he said, 'Get down,' and I put my hands up, I was like 'whatever.' He took our money, he took my wallet — he left my cellphone, he left my credentials.""



NBC reported Wednesday night that Lochte backed off some of his earlier claims about the robbery. He now says the taxi wasn't pulled over by men with a badge, but that they were robbed after stopping at a gas station, NBC reported. Lochte also said the assailant pointed a gun at him rather than putting it to his head.

But Lochte also said no one in law enforcement asked him to stay in the country for additional questioning and reportedly expressed surprise at the casual nature of authorities' questioning.

Asked by NBC's Matt Lauer if he had made the robbery story up, Lochte denied the charge.

""He stopped me quickly and strongly denied that,"" Lauer said. ""He said, 'That's absolutely not the case. I wouldn't make up a story like this, nor would the others. As a matter of fact, we all feel it makes us look bad. We're victims in this and we're happy that we're safe.'""

But the group did not call police, authorities said, and officers began investigating once they saw media reports in which Lochte's mother spoke about the robbery.

Police interviewed Lochte and Feigen, who said they had been intoxicated and could not remember what type and color of taxi they rode in or where the robbery happened, the police official said. The swimmers also could not say what time the events occurred.

Lochte told USA Today that he and his teammates didn't initially tell U.S. Olympic officials about the robbery ""because we were afraid we'd get in trouble.""

311,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/08/17/trump-campaign-undergoes-overhaul.html,2,"Donald Trump, hitting reset on his 2016 campaign, is preparing to roll out his first wave of general election TV ads in four pivotal battleground states after shaking up the top echelon of his team in a bid to focus his message and make up lost ground in the polls against Hillary Clinton.

“I am committed to doing whatever it takes to win this election, and ultimately become President because our country cannot afford four more years of the failed Obama-Clinton policies which have endangered our financial and physical security,” the Republican nominee said in a statement early Wednesday announcing the latest staffing changes.

In what was described as an expansion, Trump promoted pollster Kellyanne Conway to campaign manager and named Stephen Bannon, the co-founder of Breitbart News, as campaign chief executive. Trump said in the statement that Paul Manafort, who took over following the departure of Corey Lewandowski in June, will maintain his current title and work closely with Conway and Bannon on the campaign moving forward.

Meanwhile, a senior Trump aide told Fox News the campaign will be rolling out TV ads Friday in the battleground states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and North Carolina.

This would be three days earlier than Manafort originally planned – the campaign had been preparing to launch ads after the Olympics, which end Sunday. Clinton, though, has been plastering the airwaves with ads, while taking a significant post-convention lead in a number of battleground and national polls.

Trump seems to be changing up his approach, amid concerns that his off-the-cuff style could be hurting him in the general election environment. In a shift, he delivered a scripted speech to a rally audience Tuesday night in Wisconsin, appealing to minority voters in part by accusing Clinton of ""bigotry"" and saying she sees African-Americans as no more than votes to be won.

In an interview with Fox News, Trump voiced confidence in the state of his campaign.

“We’ve got a lot of money in the bank and I haven’t spent any of it,” he said, while confirming his campaign would be airing ads soon.

“We’ve got some pretty good ads,” he said.

In a statement, Trump also called Conway and Bannon “extremely capable.”

Conway told Fox News that “everyone else” on the campaign will remain in place.

“This is an expansion during the busy homestretch in the campaign,” she added.

Trump will step off the stump Wednesday in order to attend his first classified briefing from intelligence officials, at the FBI office in New York.

On a conference call, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook suggested little would change for Trump despite the staffing changes.

“What’s become clear from this is that no matter how much the establishment wants to clean Donald Trump up … and get him on message, he has officially won the fight to let Trump be Trump,” he said. “It’s time that we believe him.”

Though Trump previously has resisted repeated calls from fellow Republicans to change his approach on the campaign trail that has powered his surge to the top of the GOP field in the primary season, recent poll numbers have showed that Clinton has a sizeable lead in several key states. It could force Trump to pivot as the campaign moves forward, though he still downplays that possibility.

""You know, I am who I am,"" he told a local Wisconsin television station Tuesday. ""It's me. I don't want to change. Everyone talks about, 'Oh, well you're going to pivot, you're going to.' I don't want to pivot. I mean, you have to be you. If you start pivoting, you're not being honest with people.""

The Associated Press reported that the moves were discussed at a lengthy senior staff meeting at Trump Tower Tuesday while the billionaire mogul was on the road. Additional senior hires are expected to come in the next few days.

Trump, whose campaign is built on his persona as a winner, said several times that the campaign is ""doing well,"" and said his speech hours earlier in Wisconsin Tuesday was well-received.

""We're going to be doing something very dramatic,"" Trump added.

In the Wisconsin outing, Trump accused Clinton of ""bigotry"" and being ""against the police,"" claiming that she and other Democrats have ""betrayed the African American community"" and pandered for votes.

Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri responded with a statement early Wednesday accusing Trump of being the bigot instead.

""With each passing Trump attack, it becomes clearer that his strategy is just to say about Hillary Clinton what's true of himself. When people started saying he was temperamentally unfit, he called Hillary the same. When his ties to the Kremlin came under scrutiny, he absurdly claimed that Hillary was the one who was too close to Putin. Now he's accusing her of bigoted remarks -- We think the American people will know which candidate is guilty of the charge,"" she said.

312,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/08/25/trump-says-government-can-work-with-illegal-immigrants.html,2,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump continued to insist Wednesday in a ""Hannity"" town hall with Fox News' Sean Hannity that there will be ""no amnesty"" for illegal immigrants, but suggested that he would be willing to ""work with them.""

His remarks were the latest in a series of recent interviews where he has said he is considering softening a previous pledge made at the onset of his campaign to deport 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. During a “Hannity” town hall on Tuesday, Trump said he was open to “softening” laws dealing with illegal immigrants.

On Wednesday, Trump told Hannity there would be ""no citizenship"" for those illegal immigrants.

""Let me go a step further- they'll pay back-taxes, they have to pay taxes, there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them,"" Trump said.

He also spoke of how hard it would be to deport people who have lived in the country for decades and raised a family.

""Now, everybody agrees we get the bad ones out,"" Trump said. ""But when I go through and I meet thousands and thousands of people on this subject, and I've had very strong people come up to me, really great, great people come up to me, and they've said, 'Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person who's been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and their family out, it's so tough, Mr. Trump,' I have it all the time! It's a very, very hard thing.""

The Republican nominee then returned to one of his tougher stances by slamming sanctuary cities for ""protecting criminals,"" where he claimed police are at the point ""where they almost give up.""

""It's so hard for the police to--if somebody is protected between the sanctuary city nonsense,"" Trump said. ""We got to get rid of the sanctuary cities, we're protecting these people. We're protecting criminals. And the police, who are phenomenal people, they're at a point where they almost give up. They catch them, they have them, they know they did it and then they know nothing is going to happen. You know, ok, so if you're a killer and you're in this country, they go after you big league and it's tough. If you're a killer and you're an illegal immigrant, the police don't know what to do.""

He added that he is expected to announce a decision on his stance regarding illegal immigration ""very soon.""

Trump is expected to unveil his new immigration policy next week during a speech in Phoenix, the Associated Press reported late Wednesday.

Trump plans to speak at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Phoenix Aug. 31.

Arizona Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham confirmed the event to the AP, and that the speech would cover ""policy."" Two officials with knowledge of the Trump campaign's plans confirmed the topic was immigration to the AP. They weren't authorized to speak on the record about campaign plans.

313,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/08/24/more-than-50-reported-dead-after-strong-earthquake-rocks-central-italy.html,2,"Rescue crews aided by sniffer dogs dug through crumbled homes in Italy Thursday looking for earthquake survivors as the death toll reached 250 and officials anguished over how to secure their ancient towns and modern cities from the country's highly seismic terrain.

As many as 365 people were injured in the quake that struck at 3:36 a.m. Wednesday, Italy's civil protection service announced. At least 470 aftershocks have since rattled the area, triggering more damage to centuries-old buildings in Amatrice. One aftershock had a magnitude of 5.1.

After a night of uninterrupted, flood-lit search efforts, firefighters and rescue crews worked in teams around the hard-hit area in central Italy, pulling chunks of cement, rock and metal from mounds of rubble where homes once stood, searching for signs of life.

One rescue effort focused on the Hotel Roma in Amatrice, famous for the Amatriciana bacon and tomato pasta sauce that brings food lovers to this medieval hilltop town each August for its food festival.

Amatrice's mayor had initially said 70 guests were in the crumbled hotel ahead of this weekend's festival, but rescue workers later halved that estimate and the owner said most guests had managed to escape.

Firefighters' spokesman Luca Cari said one body had been pulled out of the hotel rubble just before dawn after five were extracted earlier but searches continued there and elsewhere.

""We're still in a phase that allows us to hope we'll find people alive,"" Cari said, noting that in the 2009 earthquake in nearby L'Aquila, one survivor was pulled out after 72 hours.

Rescuers refused to say when their work would shift from saving lives to recovering bodies.

""We will work relentlessly until the last person is found, and make sure no one is trapped,"" said Lorenzo Botti, a rescue team spokesman.

Worst affected by the quake were the tiny towns of Amatrice and Accumoli near Rieti, 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Rome, and Pescara del Tronto, 25 kilometers (15 miles) further to the east.

Italy's civil protection agency reported the death toll had risen to 241 early Thursday with at least 264 others hospitalized. Most of the dead -- 184 -- were in Amatrice. Authorities revised downward an earlier figure of 247 after one of the affected areas corrected its toll.

A Spaniard and five Romanians were among the dead, according to their governments.

There is no clear estimate of the missing since the area was flooded with summer vacationers. The Romanian government alone said 11 of its citizens were missing.

Emergency services set up tent cities around the quake-devastated towns to accommodate the homeless, housing about 1,200 people overnight. In Amatrice, 50 elderly people and children spent the night inside a local sports facility.

""It's not easy for them,"" said civil protection volunteer Tiziano De Carolis, who was helping to care for about 350 homeless in Amatrice. ""They have lost everything: the work of an entire life, like those who have a business, a shop, a pharmacy, a grocery store. From one day to another, they discovered everything they had was destroyed.""

As the search effort continued, the soul-searching began as Italy once again confronted the responsibilities that come with having the highest seismic hazard in Western Europe. At the same time, the country has countless picturesque medieval villages but its anti-seismic building codes aren't applied to old buildings and often aren't respected when new ones are built.

""In a country where in the past 40 years there have been at least eight devastating earthquakes ... the only lesson we have learned is to save lives after the fact,"" columnist Sergio Rizzo wrote in Thursday's Corriere della Sera. ""We are far behind in the other lessons.""

Some experts estimate that 70 percent of Italy's buildings aren't built to anti-seismic standards, though not all are in high-risk areas. After every major quake, proposals are made to improve, but they often languish in Italy's thick bureaucracy and chronic funding shortages. It's no small task to secure thousands of ancient towns and newer structures built before codes were passed or later in violation of them.

Premier Matteo Renzi, visiting the quake-affected zone Wednesday, promised to rebuild ""and guarantee a reconstruction that will allow residents to live in these communities, to relaunch these beautiful towns that have a wonderful past that will never end.""

Geologists were surveying the damage Thursday to determine which buildings were still inhabitable, while Culture Ministry teams were also fanning out to assess the damage of some of the region's cultural treasures, especially its medieval-era churches.

Italian news reports Thursday said prosecutors investigating the quake were looking in particular into the collapse of Amatrice's ""Romolo Capranica"" school -- restored in 2012 using funds set aside after the last major quake struck central Italy in 2009.

In recent quakes, some of these more modern buildings -- many of them public institutions -- have been the deadliest: the university dormitory that collapsed in the 2009 L'Aquila quake, killing 11 students; the elementary school that crumbled in San Giuliano di Puglia in 2002, killing 27 children -- the town's entire first-grade class.

In Italy, major quakes are often followed by criminal charges being filed against architects, builders and officials responsible for public works if the buildings crumble.

In the case of the L'Aquila quake, prosecutors also put six geologists on trial for allegedly having failed to adequately warn residents about the temblor. Their convictions were ultimately overturned on appeal.

While the government was already looking ahead to reconstruction, rescue workers on the ground still had days and weeks of work ahead of them.

In hard-hit Pescara del Tronto, firefighter Franco Mantovan said Thursday that crews knew of three residents still under the rubble but in a hard-to-reach area.

On Wednesday evening there, about 17 hours after the quake struck, firefighters pulled a 10-year-old girl alive from a crumbled home.

""You can hear something under here. Quiet, quiet,"" one rescue worker said, before soon urging her on: ""Come on, Giulia, come on, Giulia.""

Cheers broke out when she was pulled out.

But in many other cases, wails of grief rang out when bodies emerged.

""Unfortunately, 90 percent we pull out are dead, but some make it, that's why we are here,"" said Christian Bianchetti, a volunteer who was working in Amatrice.

314,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/09/02/more-than-170000-without-power-as-hermine-barrels-through-florida-heads-up-east-coast.html,2,"The first hurricane to hit Florida in more than a decade wiped away beachside buildings and toppled trees onto homes Friday before plowing inland on a path that could send it rolling up the densely populated East Coast with heavy rain, high winds and flooding.

Hermine quickly weakened to a tropical storm and was spinning inland along the North Carolina coast late Friday. But the National Hurricane Center predicted it would regain hurricane strength late in the weekend after emerging over the Atlantic Ocean. The system could then lash coastal areas as far north as Connecticut and Rhode Island through Labor Day.

The storm’s projected path prompted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to declare a state of emergency Saturday for three counties on the Atlantic Ocean. “The impending weather conditions constitute an imminent hazard, which threatens and presently endangers the health, safety, and resources of the residents of Ocean County, Atlantic County and Cape May County,” he said.

In Florida, Hermine's main impact came in the form of power outages and damage from storm surges. A homeless man south of Gainesville died when a tree fell on him, Gov. Rick Scott said.

He later took to a Blackhawk helicopter to visit the coastal communities of Cedar Key and Steinhatchee hit hard by the damage from flooding and storm surge that crumpled docks and washed out homes and businesses.

Scott pledged that businesses would be eligible for help from the state. But it's unclear whether Florida will get any federal disaster assistance as the state begins to clean up from the storm.

An estimated 325,000 people were without power statewide and more than 107,000 in neighboring Georgia, officials said.

At 2 a.m. Saturday, the hurricane center said the tropical storm's center was about 60 miles west-northwest of Cape Lookout, North Carolina. Forecasters said the storm threatens a dangerous storm surge into Hampton Roads in southeast Virginia. Hermine had top sustained winds of 60 mph and was moving northeast at 22 mph.

Forecasters said the system could strengthen back into a hurricane by Monday morning off the Maryland-Delaware coast before weakening again as it moves north. Tropical storm watches and warnings were posted up and down the coastline.

Amtrak says it has cancelled or altered some service on the East Coast as the storm approaches.

Back in Florida, a storm surge at Dekle Beach damaged numerous homes and destroyed storage buildings and a 100-yard fishing pier. The area is about 60 miles southeast of St. Marks, where Hermine made landfall at 1:30 a.m. in the Big Bend area, where Florida's peninsula and panhandle meet.

Nancy Geohagen walked around collecting photos and other items for her neighbors after the storm scattered them.

""I know who this baseball bat belongs to,"" she said plucking it from a pile of debris.

An unnamed spring storm that hit the beach in 1993 killed 10 people who refused to evacuate. This time, only three residents stayed behind. All escaped injury.

In nearby Steinhatchee, a storm surge crashed into Bobbi Pattison's home. She wore galoshes and was covered in black muck as she stood in her living room amid overturned furniture and an acrid smell. Tiny crabs darted around her floor.

""I had a hurricane cocktail party last night and God got even with me,"" she said with a chuckle. Where her bar once stood was now only wet sand and rubble. Pattison and two neighbors managed to set upright a large wooden statue of a sea captain she had carved from wood that washed ashore in the 1993 storm.

In Keaton Beach, about two dozen people waited on a road just after sunrise Friday, trying to get to their homes. Police blocked the road because of flooding.

Dustin Beach, 31, rushed there from a hospital in Tallahassee where his wife gave birth to a girl Thursday night to see if his home still stood.

""When my wife got up this morning, she said, 'Go home and check on the house. I need to know where we're going after we leave the hospital,'"" Beach said.

Cindy Simpson was waiting near her car, hoping her beach home and boats survived. ""It's a home on stilts so I put everything upstairs. We have two boats in the boat house, and I hope they're still there,"" she said.

High winds knocked trees onto several houses in Tallahassee, injuring people inside.

It was sometime after midnight when Alan Autry, 48, started hearing the large pines in his Tallahassee neighborhood start to crack and fall to the ground.

Then he heard one come down on the top floor of his house. The tree didn't initially crash through the roof, and Autry and his wife went to a neighbor's house. Sometime before dawn, the corner of his house collapsed from the weight of the tree.

""We've been married 13 years and this is our fifth hurricane,"" said Autry who moved from central Florida six years ago. ""By far, this is the worst damage we've ever had.""

Tampa and St. Petersburg escaped major damage. Up to 17 inches of rain fell in the area over the last two days.

The last hurricane to strike Florida was Wilma, a powerful Category 3 storm that arrived on Oct. 24, 2005. It swept across the Everglades and struck heavily populated south Florida, causing five deaths in the state and an estimated $23 billion in damage.

The Florida governor declared an emergency in 51 counties and said about 6,000 National Guardsmen stood ready to mobilize for the storm's aftermath. The governors of Georgia and North Carolina also declared emergencies.

315,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/02/fbi-files-show-agents-focused-clinton-interview-questions-on-top-secret-emails.html,2,"The 11-page FBI summary released Friday of Hillary Clinton's July 2 interview in the criminal email investigation shows bureau agents focused their questions to her on the 22 “Top Secret” emails considered too damaging to national security to make public.

These emails contained some of the U.S. government's most closely held secrets, known as Special Access Programs (SAP), as first reported by Fox News.

Though the summary is heavily redacted, it shows FBI agents asked Clinton about an Afghan national identified as ""Salehi,"" who appeared in her emails, which included a discussion of a New York Times report about his alleged ties to the CIA. Clinton said she did not remember the email, had no reason to believe the discussion involved classified information, and had ""no reason to doubt the judgment of the people working for her on the 'front lines.'""

The discussion of a foreign national working with the U.S. government raises security implications -- an executive order signed by President Obama said such unauthorized disclosures are “presumed to cause damage to the national security.""

The Salehi email, and the discussion of a possible relationship with the U.S. government, was first reported by Fox News as an example of how human spying intelligence, known as humint, was contained in the Clinton emails. The sharing and discussion of such intelligence puts lives at risk.

Clinton was also asked about an October 2012 email that discussed, ""This am Green on Blue"" -- referencing an attack in Afghanistan where American personnel were among the dead. While key sections are redacted, a separate publicly released State Department email, as well as details in the FBI summary, suggest the communication included discussion of an American later revealed to be a CIA officer. Fox News is not reporting the identity of the individual in deference to the family’s wishes not to publicize his national security work.

According to a December 2013 policy document released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the HCS-O designation ""is used to protect exceptionally fragile and unique IC (intelligence community) clandestine HUMINT operations and methods that are not intended for dissemination."" An unauthorized disclosure would be expected to cause especially ""grave"" damage.

Dan Maguire, former Special Operations strategic planner for Africom, told Fox News in January the disclosure of sensitive material impacts national security and exposes U.S. sources.

""There are people’s lives at stake. Certainly in an intel SAP, if you’re talking about sources and methods, there may be one person in the world that would have access to the type of information contained in that SAP,” he said.

FBI agents also asked Clinton about three emails marked classified. They contained a ""C"" or portion marking, indicating the intelligence was at the lowest level, or confidential. Clinton said she thought the ""C"" was part of series like bullet points or a listing, like A, B, C. Fox News first reported in June that at least one of the Clinton emails contained classified markings -- conflicting with Clinton's repeated public statements.

Agents also asked Clinton about a 2011 cable, first documented by Fox News, that went out under her signature as secretary of state and advised State Department personnel against personal email use because of the high risk of cyber intrusion. Clinton told the FBI she could not recall the specific cable."
316,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/09/01/trump-immigration-speech-president-was-born-on-wednesday.html,2,"America, we were introduced to our next president on Wednesday night. He’s not a politician. He is one of a kind. He is an American. Welcome President Donald J. Trump.

I’m a cynical Jewish Ivy Leaguer from New York. Nothing gets me too excited. I don’t believe politicians. Nor do I believe in politicians. I don’t fall for theatrical political productions. I don’t believe rhetoric or propaganda. And I’ve never teared up over a political speech in my life.

Until now. . .

Wednesday night I found myself fist-pumping. I found myself chanting along with the crowd “USA, USA, USA.” And as the procession of mothers and fathers came up to the podium to state the name of their child -- who was murdered by illegal immigrants -- and then say “I’m voting for Trump” or “Trump is our last chance to save America” I found myself tearing up. And the amazing thing is… I couldn't stop. The tears rolled down my face.

This speech in Arizona was the game-changer.

Not just the speech, but the entire day. Trump accepted the invitation to meet with the President of Mexico. He showed he’s a man of action by flying to Mexico on a moment’s notice. Trump stood next to Mexico's president -- looking to all the world like President Donald J. Trump. Trump stated his case and never gave an inch to the president of Mexico. Trump turned a vision -- that was mocked and ripped to shreds for a year now -- into a reality. Who now believes that if Trump is elected a wall won’t be built?

As a conservative, I’ve waited a lifetime for this speech. Why? Because it was a speech that didn’t back down by even one inch. It was a speech aimed at Americans, for Americans, delivered by a proud American, who values American exceptionalism.

It was a speech that restores law and order.

A speech that always put American citizens, workers and taxpayers first.

A speech that recognized the right to safety and security for American citizens.

A speech that recognizes that a foreigner here illegally does not have the same rights as an American-born citizen.

A speech that pointed out that foreigners here illegally should not be treated better than our veterans.

A speech that recognized that American citizens have every right to choose who comes into our country. And that we should proudly choose immigrants with skills, self-sufficiency and a respect for our common values.

It was a speech that recognized that illegal immigrants do not qualify for welfare, food stamps and other entitlements -- and our government has a right, for the first time ever, to prioritize the deportation of illegal foreigners for abusing the welfare system.

It was a speech that recognized that foreigners in American prisons for violent crimes and felonies should and will be deported immediately -- and that no country can refuse to take them back.

It was a speech that recognized our right to practice “extreme vetting” on anyone who wants to come into America -- and that we can choose to exclude those who don’t share or respect our values, customs, laws and Constitution. Some people just won’t be allowed in. (At this point, I jumped up from my chair and screamed “YES!”)

It was also a speech that recognized that the federal government must shut off all funding to Sanctuary cities. After all that's our taxpayer money being given to political leaders who are choosing to break the law. FINALLY, an adult has decided to just say ""NO.""

And then there’s the wall… that great, big, beautiful Trumpian wall. I’ve waited a lifetime to hear that we have a right to build a wall, to protect and secure our borders and keep the bad guys out.

Trump covered it all on Wednesday night. He never backed down to pressure from the corrupt mainstream media, billionaire titans, Wall Street moguls, Silicon Valley tech gurus, lawyers, lobbyists, liberals, the GOP establishment, Ivy League know-it-all intellectuals. He gave no quarter to any of them. He changed nothing to appeal to them.

I could feel their mouths dropping open in disbelief.

Trump is our last chance to save America. To restore law and order. To protect my four beautiful children. To save our economy. To rescue our middle class. We have only one choice. We have only one chance.

Look at yourself in the mirror. If you’re American-born…if you’re a taxpayer…if you’re a parent…if you love America…if you agree this is the greatest country in world history….if you believe we are blessed by God…if you’re horrified at the prospect of bringing hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees into this country at a cost of $400 billion…if you’re scared to death about our soon-to-be-$20 trillion national debt…if you don’t want your child to become just another murder statistic…if any of those descriptions fits you and Trump’s speech didn’t move you…

You suffer from a mental disease called liberalism.

If everything Trump promised and everything I’ve just said doesn’t impress you, then just think of Trump as our TREXIT. Trump is a blunt force, all-American, laser-guided middle finger to everything and everyone in Washington, D.C.

And that, my fellow Americans, sounds like the dream of a lifetime to me."

The former president will host two fundraising events Tuesday in Los Angeles and a campaign rally Wednesday in Las Vegas, Fox News has learned.

Still, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, will call into a fundraiser event Monday night in San Francisco, after having to abruptly leave a 9/11 memorial ceremony Sunday morning in New York City.

“Thanks to everyone who’s reached out with well wishes!,” Clinton tweeted Monday afternoon. “I’m feeling fine and getting better.”

The incident Sunday -- in which Clinton appeared unsteady and needing assistance from aides -- has resulted in her and Republican rival Donald Trump each planning to release more personal health information.

The 70-year-old Trump said Monday that candidate health is now an “issue” in the White House race.

Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said on MSNBC that the campaign will release more information in the next couple days.

Trump told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” earlier Monday morning that he’ll be releasing “very, very specific” details from a recent physical.

“I think they’re going to be good. I feel great,” he said. Fox News has learned Trump plans to release those details during his appearance Thursday on “The Dr. Oz Show.”

As for Clinton’s health, Trump said: “Something’s going on, but I just hope she gets well and gets back on the trail.”

Clinton, 68, on Sunday night canceled plans to visit California and is resting at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y.

Her doctor revealed she had been diagnosed Friday with pneumonia, following after the episode at the 9/11 memorial, in which Clinton was also seen stumbling on her way to her van when leaving.

Clinton’s doctor also said she had become “overheated and dehydrated” at Sunday’s ceremony, but is “recovering nicely.”

The incident fueled questions about Clinton’s health. Trump on Monday brushed aside any speculation that Clinton might be replaced as the Democratic nominee, but said of the candidate’s health: “I think it’s an issue.”

Trump, meanwhile, continued to criticize Clinton for saying -- before her health episode -- that half of his supporters fall into a “basket of deplorables.” Clinton has expressed regret for the remarks, but Trump said, “I think this is the biggest mistake of the political season.”

Even before Monday’s comments, Trump already had said both candidates should release detailed medical records.

Clinton’s campaign earlier released a July 2015 letter from Dr. Lisa Bardack describing Clinton as “a healthy 67-year-old female whose current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies.” The letter noted her elbow fracture in 2009 and concussion in 2012. Bardack detailed how Clinton, now 68, had to undergo “anticoagulation therapy” to dissolve a clot, and experienced “double vision for a period of time,” after the concussion.

But the campaign has not released detailed records beyond that.

Former President Obama adviser David Axelrod rapped Clinton Monday on her ""penchant for privacy.""

Within minutes of Obama arriving on Air Force One, a member of the Chinese delegation started screaming at White House staff, according to reporters on the tarmac.

One reporter described the scene as “a bit of chaos,” as the Chinese official appeared furious about journalists being so near Obama’s arrival, though they purportedly were standing in the area Chinese officials had designated for them.

White House officials reportedly told the Chinese official that the U.S. press corps was staying for the American president arriving on a U.S. aircraft.

When the White House official insisted the U.S. would set the rules for its own leader, her Chinese counterpart shot back, the Associated Press reported.

""This is our country! This is our airport!"" the Chinese official yelled.

The exchange with Rice reportedly happened when the Chinese official attempted to prevent her from walking to the U.S. motorcade, as she crossed a media rope line. The official purportedly spoke angrily to her before a Secret Service agent intervened.

Rice responded, but her comments were inaudible to reporters standing underneath the wing of Air Force One. It was unclear if the official, whose name was not immediately clear, knew that Rice was a senior official, not a reporter.

When asked about the incident later by a reported, Rice seemed less than amused by the incident.

""They did things that weren't anticipated,"" she said, the AP reported.

A White House spokesman and China's Foreign Ministry did not respond immediately to requests by Reuters for comment.

To be sure, China is taking every precaution to ensure the summit, in the eastern city of Hangzhou, goes smoothly. But the incidents appeared to underscore the community country’s contentious relationship with the United States and other Western nations and efforts to control the media.

Obama has raised issues of freedom of the press on previous visits to China, which insists that media must follow the party line and promote ""positive propaganda"".

Foreign reporters are often physically prevented from covering sensitive stories, but altercations involving foreign government officials are rare.

U.S. officials also apparently got into a heated exchange with Chinese security official before Obama arrived at China’s West Lake State Guest House, where he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping to formally enter their respective countries -- the world's two biggest carbon emitters -- into last year's Paris climate change agreement.

The ceremony included U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and took place ahead of the summit, which officially starts Sunday.

White House staffers and Secret Service officers trying to enter the state guest house separately from reporters were stopped at a security gate and purportedly argued about how many members of the U.S. delegation would be allowed to enter.

""The president is arriving here in an hour,"" one White House staffer was overheard saying in exasperation.

However, the most heated exchange purportedly occurred between a Chinese security official and a Chinese official helping Americans who got angry about how the guards were treating the White House staff.

“You don't push people,” the Chinese official purportedly yelled in Chinese. “No one gave you the right to touch or push anyone around.""

Another Chinese official stepped between the two when the security official purportedly looked ready to throw a punch.

""Calm down please. Calm down,"" White House official purportedly said.

A foreign ministry official said in Chinese: ""Stop, please. There are reporters here.”

Another heated exchange between White House press officers and Chinese officials purportedly occurred minutes later -- over how many American print reporters would be allowed inside the building.

The disagreement continued until about 20 minutes before Obama arrived and purportedly ended with 10 of the reporters being allowed inside, despite White House officials arguing there was plenty of empty space for them to stand at the back of the room.

Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, said at a New York fundraiser Friday night that half of Trump-Pence supporters could be put into a ""basket of deplorables.""

“Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it,” Clinton said. “There are people like that and he has lifted them up.”

Clinton attempted at the fundraiser to qualify her remarks by saying they were ""grossly general-istic"" and that the other 50 percent of Trump supporters are frustrated by hard times and merit sympathy.

However, Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, then Pence seized on her remarks throughout the day.

“The men and women who support Donald Trump's campaign are hard-working Americans, farmers, coal miners, teachers, veterans, members of our law enforcement community, members of every class of this country,” Pence said at the annual gathering of conservatives in Washington, D.C., known as the Value Voters Summit.

“They are not a basket of anything, they are Americans, and they deserve your respect. … No one with that low opinion of the American people should ever be elected president of the United States of America.”

One day after promising to be aspirational & uplifting, Hillary insults millions of Americans. #desperate https://t.co/OrBkowI4Sd — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) September 10, 2016

Earlier in the day Trump tweeted: “Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard-working people” tweeted Trump, after Clinton’s comments at a Friday night New York fundraiser. “I think it will cost her at the Polls!”

(1/3) She gave an entire speech about how the alt right movement is using his campaign to advance its hate movement. https://t.co/ZZZv31cFCq — Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) September 10, 2016

Clinton was speaking at an LGBT fundraiser in New York City, where she encouraged supporters to ""stage an intervention"" if they have friends considering voting for Trump.

""That may be one conversion therapy I'd endorse,"" said Clinton, referring to a type of counseling designed to urge gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender children to change their sexual orientation. She later clarified that she wants to end the practice.

Singer Barbra Streisand, who performed at the fundraiser, altered the lyrics of the Stephen Sondheim song ""Send In The Clowns"" to mock Trump, referring to the real estate mogul as a ""sad, vulgar clown.""

Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement that Clinton had ""revealed her true contempt for everyday Americans"" and called the remarks an ""inexcusable mistake.""

Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill defended the candidate in tweets of his own.

""Obviously not everyone supporting Trump is part of the alt-right, but alt-right leaders are with Trump,"" he said. ""And their supporters appear to make up half his crowd when you observe the tone of his events.”

The fundraiser capped a day in which Trump again attacked Clinton's credibility. He said Clinton was being ""protected"" during the Justice Department's investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state.

""She could walk right into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching, right smack in the middle of the heart, and she wouldn't be prosecuted,"" Trump said at a rally in Pensacola, Fla.

Trump also faced criticism from within his own party for refusing to outline his plans for combating foreign policy challenges, including threats posed by ISIS. Trump said this week that he does indeed have a plan, but would convene military leaders in his first 30 days in office to craft another plan.

Trump has also faced criticism for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin during a high-profile national security forum earlier in the week, and appearing on a Russian-backed television network Thursday evening.

On Friday, Clinton said she was ""disappointed"" by Trump's decision to appear on RT America, saying that ""every day that goes by this just becomes more and more of a reality television show. It's not a serious presidential campaign.""

With several prominent Republican national security officials already concerned about Trump's national security acumen, Clinton has tried to cast herself as the better potential commander in chief. She has aggressively promoted her growing list of military endorsements from both parties.

On Friday, her campaign said the number of retired generals and admirals endorsing Clinton for president has grown to 110. Trump quickly countered by saying his list had ballooned to 120 former U.S. generals and admirals earlier in the week.

Pence received his first intelligence briefing Friday. He declined to offer any specifics since the information was classified.

Hillary finally shared her true feelings at a fundraising event in Manhattan on Friday night, with her old pal Barbara Streisand hosting. Just like Mitt Romney exposed his true feelings about ""the 47 percent"" at a private fundraiser in 2012.

Hillary said that half of Donald Trump’s supporters belong in a “basket of deplorables.”

This was the real Hillary -- raw and unfiltered. She must be taking lessons from Donald Trump.

Everything I love -- and millions of conservatives, Christians and patriots love -- is under attack from Hillary and the Democrats. They resent us. They disrespect us. They want to silence us.

Of course, she now regrets saying it. Politicians often regret letting their true feelings out. But it's clear what Hillary meant. Hillary and her supporters despise and disrespect anyone who loves God, country, family and our Constitution.

Hillary was talking about me and my friends. I’m Exhibit A for her rant. I’m the author of the new book “ANGRY WHITE MALE.” It’s my testimony about exactly what millions of angry white males who support Donald Trump believe in…and exactly what liberals like Hillary and President Obama think of us. How they are trying to target us, muzzle us, punish us and destroy us.

Thanks Hillary. We already knew how you felt, but it's nice to get it out into the open. Now you're on record.

Everything I love -- and millions of conservatives, Christians and patriots love -- is under attack from Hillary and the Democrats. They resent us. They disrespect us. They want to silence us. They want to financially cripple us (to redistribute our income in the name of ""fairness"" and ""social justice"").

Millions of Trump supporters believe the things that made America great are simple: Faith in God, family, patriotism, American exceptionalism, capitalism, Judeo-Christian values, Constitution, military and police. But Hillary and the Democrats despise those symbols. To them, belief in those symbols makes you...""deplorable.""

Well, I’m proud that Hillary and her socialist cabal see me as “deplorable.” Let’s look at who else is in this “basket"" with me. Here is a list of my teammates in Hillary's ""basket of deplorables"":

- The soldiers who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. We know they are Trump supporters. The latest poll shows Trump winning the military vote by a landslide. Hillary thinks they are ""deplorable.""

- Military veterans. These are the Americans who were willing to die for our freedoms. Vets were included in that military poll that showed Trump winning by a landslide.

- Vets who came home from Iraq and Afghanistan with no arms, or no legs, or both. I’m betting most of them are for Trump too. Does Hillary think they’re “deplorable?”

- Policemen murdered in the line of duty -- like the five officers recently killed in Dallas, or the three who were killed in Baton Rouge. Most every police officer I meet is voting for Trump.

- The spouses and children of policemen murdered in the line of duty. What if they're voting for Trump? Are they “deplorable” to Hillary and her supporters?

- Every red-blooded regular church-goer on Sunday mornings in America. We know a large majority of regular church-goers are for Trump.

- A majority of the 28 million small business owners in America. This group will be voting overwhelmingly for Trump. They get up early, work 16 hour days, risk their own money, and create the majority of America's private sector jobs. But Hillary doesn't like them very much. She thinks if they vote for Trump they're ""deplorable.""

Now Hillary is walking back her comment. She says she regrets calling us all ""a basket of deplorables."" But it's too late. We all know your first comment was the raw truth, Hillary. That was how you really feel about us.

The only thing Hillary regrets is that she let the cat out of the bag.

Well, I have news for Hillary…

I'm for Donald Trump. And...

I am proud to be part of ""the basket of deplorables."""
321,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/16/trump-clinton-trade-barbs-over-obama-birther-movement.html,2,"Donald Trump tried to tamp down a newly revived campaign dust-up Friday over his views on President Obama’s birthplace, declaring the president was born in the United States – “period” – after declining to make that statement earlier this week.

The Republican presidential nominee also tried to blame Hillary Clinton for starting the controversy back in 2008, which her team denies. He cast his remarks as a bid to put the issue to rest once and for all, at a time when his poll numbers are rising.

“Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it,” Trump said in Washington, D.C. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.”

He spoke at his new Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., a visit that began with lengthy remarks from military supporters and veterans. He briefly addressed the “birther” issue at the end.

The statement comes after Trump’s response on the matter in an interview Wednesday revived the issue. In the interview with The Washington Post, Trump was asked whether he believed Obama was born in the U.S. ""I'll answer that question at the right time,"" Trump told the paper. ""I just don't want to answer it yet.""

Trump’s campaign spokesman, trying to calm the waters, said overnight the Republican candidate now believes Obama was born in the U.S. Campaign spokesman Jason Miller said Trump ""did a great service to the country"" by bringing closure to the debate.

""In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate,"" Miller said.

But the Clinton campaign seized on Trump’s reluctance to address the issue in his Post interview.

Speaking shortly before Trump across town at the Black Women's Agenda Symposium, Clinton said Friday the Republican nominee was “feeding into” the “bigotry and bias that lurks in our country” – and should apologize.

“Barack Obama was born in America,” she said. “Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.”

Her campaign called his Friday comments ""disgraceful.""

The dust-up comes as Trump gains on Clinton in national and battleground state polls, even surpassing her in some states.

A new Fox News poll shows Clinton topping Trump by just one point among likely voters in the four-way ballot nationally.

In the head-to-head matchup, Trump’s up by one point.

Both candidates were fundraising Friday after events in Washington. Clinton has endured a rough week on the campaign trail, after criticizing some Trump supporters last Friday as ""deplorables"" and then having to take time off from the campaign due to a bout of pnemonia.

She used the birther issue to try and go back on offense.

While Obama was born in Hawaii, Trump several years ago was a key figure in stoking the so-called ""birther"" controversy. Critics saw it as an attempt to delegitimize the nation’s first black president.

Trump has said repeatedly during the campaign that he no longer talks about the ""birther"" issue.

The Trump campaign’s statement late Thursday claimed that Clinton launched the “birther” movement during her unsuccessful primary run against Obama in 2008.

""Hillary Clinton's campaign first raised this issue to smear then-candidate Barack Obama in her very nasty, failed 2008 campaign for President,"" the statement said. ""This type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the Clinton Playbook. As usual, however, Hillary Clinton was too weak to get an answer.""

Clinton has long denied the claim, and fact-checkers previously have found no public evidence that she or her campaign directly pushed the issue. Rather, Trump’s comments appear to refer to reports that Clinton supporters circulated an email during the bitter 2008 primary race questioning Obama’s citizenship.

Yet former McClatchy D.C. bureau chief James Asher said on Twitter Friday that Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal in fact “told me in person” that Obama was born in Kenya.

Obama had released a standard short form of his birth certificate before the 2008 presidential election. Anyone who wants a copy of the more detailed, long-form document must submit a waiver request, and have that request approved by Hawaii's health department.

In 2011, amid persistent questions from Trump about his birthplace, Obama submitted a waiver request. He dispatched his personal lawyer to Hawaii to pick up copies and carry the documents back to Washington on a plane.

The form said Obama was born at 7:24 p.m. on Aug. 4, 1961, at Kapiolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu. It is signed by the delivery doctor, Obama's mother and the local registrar.

At the White House on Friday, Obama declined to comment at length on the issue, saying he’s got other business to attend to – and is confident about where he was born.

Several surveys appear to show the Republican presidential nominee effectively ending, at least for now, a post-convention slump that saw Clinton leading in virtually every swing state. Now, a Monmouth University Poll shows Trump taking a narrow 2-point lead in Nevada; a Bloomberg Politics poll shows Trump leading Clinton by 5 points in Ohio; and new CNN/ORC polls show Trump leading in Florida and Ohio.

In the latter survey, Trump leads 46-41 percent among likely voters in Ohio, and 47-44 percent among likely voters in Florida.

Meanwhile, a Los Angeles Times tracking poll shows Trump taking a 6-point national lead.

“We’ve really had a good month,” Trump told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” claiming he’s enjoying renewed “enthusiasm” from voters.

Clinton, though, plans to return to the campaign trail Thursday afternoon after taking three days off to recover from a bout of pneumonia. While her campaign dispatched high-powered surrogates to the stump in her absence -- including Bill Clinton and President Obama -- the Democratic nominee’s presence could help reset the race once again.

The contest remains tight, and the polls are hardly uniform. A Quinnipiac University national poll released Wednesday showed Clinton leading 48-43 percent among likely voters.

But that still represents a narrowing of the race since a late-August survey showing Clinton up 10 points.

The recent surveys come as Clinton grapples with new controversies on two fronts: Her comment at a Friday fundraiser that half of Trump’s backers are in a “basket of deplorables,” and her campaign’s handling of a health scare on Sunday during a 15th anniversary ceremony honoring victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Clinton has since expressed regret for her “deplorables” comment, though Trump has called on her to outright retract it. And Clinton’s campaign has sought to answer questions about the former secretary of state's health, after Clinton was seen stumbling at the 9/11 memorial event in New York City.

The campaign said she was overheated and dehydrated, and revealed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. While the incident revived long-simmering questions about her health, the campaign on Wednesday released additional medical details. Dr. Lisa Bardack, Clinton’s physician, said she is “recovering well with antibiotics and rest.”

Bardack also said Clinton remains “healthy and fit to serve.”

Trump, too, has tried to answer questions about his own health. He discussed the results of a recent physical with TV’s “Dr. Oz,” and told Fox News on Thursday “they were good.” The discussion with “Dr. Oz” will air on his show Thursday.

Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign maintains they always knew states like Ohio would be competitive – and they are building out their operation there.

The campaign announced that they will open a half-dozen new offices in the state, bringing their total to 54."
323,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/09/19/person-interest-to-named-in-nyc-bombing.html,2,"The Afghan immigrant who authorities believe planted bombs in New Jersey and New York this weekend was captured Monday after a dramatic gun battle with police that was sparked when officers found him sleeping in the doorway of a bar.

Officials had launched a dragnet earlier Monday in search of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the 28-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen who was identified as the primary person of interest in the Saturday night blast in New York's Chelsea neighborhood, an explosion in New Jersey's Seaside Park on Saturday morning and a foiled bomb attack Sunday night near a train station in Elizabeth, NJ.

The hunt for Rahami turned out to be brief. A bar owner in Linden, NJ spotted a man sleeping in his doorway Monday morning and called police. An officer confronted the man around 10:45 a.m., and soon recognized the person as Rahami, officials said. Rahami pulled out a gun and shot the officer, identifed by the Linden mayor's office as Angel Padilla, in the abdomen. Padilla was wearing a bulletproof vest.

A second police officer, idenitifed as Investigator Pete Hammer, had a bullet graze his head. Both officers were expected to be okay.

Rahami was shot at least once in the leg and eventually brought down and captured alive, Union County Prosecutor Grace Park said. He was taken to University Hospital in Newark where he underwent surgery, Fox News confirmed.

Rahami was charged late Monday in Union County with five counts of attempted murder of a police officer. He was being held on $5.2 million bail and remained at a hospital. It wasn't known if Rahami had an attorney, as messages left with phone numbers listed for family members by the Associated Press weren't returned. Federal charges in the bombings have yet to be filed.

Linden, the city where Rahami was captured, is about four miles from Elizabeth, where Rahami was last known to have lived. The FBI had launched a raid at his apartment, located above a fried chicken restaurant, on Monday morning. Elizabeth is also the city where investigators discovered five suspicious devices -- one of which exploded while a bomb squad robot tried to disarm it -- near a train station on Sunday night.

""Today I believe we're going to find out that [the bombing] was influenced by foreign sources,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday on ""Fox & Friends.""

Two U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday that the bomb plot likely involved several individuals, a revelation that came hours after federal authorities on Sunday night conducted a traffic stop in Brooklyn of a “vehicle of interest” in the bombings.

Officials said Monday that the car was identified after having been at a location associated with Rahami. The individuals in the vehicle were no longer in custody, the FBI said Monday.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio noted during a Monday news conference that authorities weren't currently searching for any other suspects. The assistant director of the FBI's field office in New York, William Sweeney Jr., said ""there is no indication that there's a cell"" in the area.

Following the Chelsea explosion -- which injured 29 people -- on West 23rd Street at 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, police found a second, unexploded device four blocks away. The device was described as a pressure cooker with wires and a phone attached. The contraption, which bore a resemblance to the bomb used in the 2013 Boston Marathon attack, was placed in a plastic bag.

Officials said Rahami's fingerprint was found on the unexploded bomb discovered on West 27th Street. Authorities were still searching for two people who removed that bomb from a duffle bag after it had allegedly been placed on the street by Rahami. The pair placed the device in a plastic bag and then walked off with the duffel bag. Police said the individuals were only considered witnesses.



The Chelsea bombing came 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded about 80 miles south in a New Jersey garbage can near the route of a charity 5K race. That explosion occurred in Seaside Park, a borough about 60 miles from Elizabeth. No one was injured in that blast. Runners were slated to be near the location of the explosion when it went off, but the race was delayed after an unattended backpack was discovered.

Authorities said the New York and New Jersey bombs used flip phones as detonators. Several media outlets also reported the New York bombs contained shrapnel consisting of ball bearings and BBs.

Local and federal officials said Rahami had not been on law enforcement's radar before the explosions, and the FBI said they had no knowledge of Rahami receiving any weapons or explosives training overseas.

Previous story below...

Protesters flocked to Charlotte for a third straight night Thursday in the latest sign of mounting pressure for police to release video that might resolve the different accounts of the shooting death of a black man.

There were contentious moments between demonstrators and police, but it was a far cry from the looting and destruction that was seen Wednesday night. Local officers' ranks were augmented by members of the National Guard carrying rifles and guarding office buildings against the threat of property damage.

People chanted “release the tape” and “we want the tape” while briefly blocking an intersection near Bank of America headquarters and later climbing the steps in front of the city government center. Later, several dozen demonstrators climbed onto an interstate highway through the city, but they were pushed back by police in riot gear.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg police have resisted the calls to release dashcam and body camera footage of the death of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott earlier this week. His family was shown the footage Thursday and demanded that police release it to the public. The family's lawyer said he couldn't definitively tell whether Scott was holding a gun.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney told Fox News' Megyn Kelly on ""The Kelly File"" that the decision to release the video was not up to him, but added ""I think [releasing the footage] is probably the better option right now.""

Putney said that local police were no longer leading the investigation into Tuesday's shooting and the decision to release the footage rested with the State Bureau of Investigation.

Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts signed documents Thursday night for the citywide curfew that runs from midnight to 6 a.m. But demonstrators continued to march after the curfew took effect, and Police Capt. Mike Campagna told reporters that officers wouldn't seek to move curfew violators off the street as long as they were peaceful. The demonstrators' ranks appeared to thin from their peak of several hundred as the early morning arrived.

Scores of rioters Wednesday night attacked reporters and others, set fires and smashed windows of hotels, office buildings and restaurants in the city's bustling downtown section. The NASCAR Hall of Fame was among the places damaged.

Forty-four people were arrested after Wednesday's protests, and one protester who was shot died at the hospital Thursday; city officials said police did not shoot the man and no arrests have been made in 26-year-old Justin Carr's death.

There were no reports of arrests Thursday night. Police said only two officers were hurt after they were sprayed with a chemical agent by demonstrators.

Police have said that Scott was shot to death Tuesday by a black officer after he disregarded loud, repeated warnings to drop his gun. Neighbors, though, have said he was holding only a book. The police chief said a gun was found next to the dead man, and there was no book.

Putney acknowledged on ""The Kelly File"" that the video ""is not the most definitive piece of evidence we would have hoped for,"" but added ""there is a lot of other evidence that gives us a great deal of support and comfort.""

Justin Bamberg, an attorney for Scott's family, watched the video with the family's relatives. He said Scott gets out of his vehicle calmly.

""While police did give him several commands, he did not aggressively approach them or raise his hands at members of law enforcement at any time. It is impossible to discern from the videos what, if anything, Mr. Scott is holding in his hands,"" Bamberg said in a statement.

Scott was shot as he walked slowly backward with his hands by his side, Bamberg said.

The lawyer said at a news conference earlier in the day that Scott's wife saw him get shot, ""and that's something she will never, ever forget."" That is the first time anyone connected with the case has said the wife witnessed the shooting. Bamberg gave no details on what the wife saw.

325,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/27/online-polls-declare-trump-debate-winner-despite-media-consensus-for-clinton.html,2,"If polls only included media pundits, Hillary Clinton would have won Monday’s debate by a landslide, but online surveys had Donald Trump as the yuge winner.

The Drudge Report online vote had 80 percent of respondents giving the victory to Trump, and a Time.com survey had the Republican nominee leading Clinton by 4 percentage points – 52 percent to 48 percent – after more than 1,300,000 votes were cast. CNBC and Breitbart votes also had Trump winning the event, at New York’s Hofstra University.

A Fox News online vote had Trump winning with 50 percent of respondents, Clinton at 35 percent and the other 15 percent declaring no one won.

The online surveys are not scientific and, in many cases, supporters of either candidate can cast multiple ballots. Still, the disconnect in judging Trump’s performance was reminiscent of the Republican Party primary, when pundits often said his competitors bested him while online polls put him on top.

Experts say the online votes are a good gauge of enthusiasm, which could mean Trump’s performance was enough to energize those who already backed him.

Experts were near unanimous in finding Clinton was more disciplined and armed with greater recall of facts, but Trump’s supporters believe his blunt style and unconventional background are among his best attributes.

Trump’s best moment, according to Stuart Tarlow, of American Thinker, came when he distinguished himself from Clinton based on their disparate backgrounds. Trump characterized his opponent as a ""typical politician,"" who knows how to make statements and promises that sound good, but who never actually gets things done, Tarlow wrote.

Most experts agree the winner and loser won’t be determined based on arcane rules of debating. Hillary’s mission was to come off as well-versed on the facts and warm, while Trump’s goal was to appear capable of filling the role of chief executive.

The real test of who won and who lost will likely come in the next wave of scientific polling in what has become a dead-even race. If Trump continues to surge in key battleground states, it will be taken as evidence he accomplished what he needed to in the debate. If Clinton stops or even reverses his momentum, she may be retroactively declared the winner.

Edward Panetta, professor of communication studies at the University of Georgia and director of the Georgia Debate Union, said Trump got out of the gate fast, but then struggled.

“While Donald Trump was strong in the first 20 minutes of the debate he faltered badly as the debate progressed,” Panetta said."

At an evening rally in Melbourne, Fla., Trump said the former secretary of state was ""stuck in the past.""

""For 90 minutes, on issue after issue, Hillary Clinton defended the terrible status quo, while I laid out a plan to bring back prosperity for the American people,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""For 90 minutes, she argued against change. I want dramatic change.""

The real estate mogul added that he was ""holding back — I didn't want to do anything to embarrass her."" Trump previously said he held back to avoid embarrassing the Clintons' daughter, Chelsea, who also was in the debate audience.

Trump repeated several attack lines against Clinton and resurrected the ""Crooked Hillary"" nickname he gave her earlier in the campaign.

""The only thing she's succeeded at is helping her donors and covering up her crimes,"" Trump said.

Earlier in the day, Clinton claimed Trump ""didn't prepare"" for Monday night's debate, the first of three that will take place over a period of 23 days.

""[He was] kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail, getting prepared,"" Clinton told supporters in Raleigh, N.C. ""I'll tell you what else I'm prepared for, prepared to be President of the United States.""

Clinton also repeated her debate speculation that Trump is refusing to release his returns because he goes years without paying any federal taxes. ""That makes me smart,"" was Trump's coy response in the debate, but on Tuesday, Clinton insisted it was nothing to brag about.

""If not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us?"" she asked her supporters.

The next debate between Clinton and Trump will be held Oct. 9 in St. Louis.

327,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/10/06/millions-urged-to-flee-deadly-strengthening-hurricane-matthew.html,2,"Hurricane Matthew closed in on Florida Thursday evening as a powerful Category 4 storm as the governor urged people up and down the state's 580-mile Atlantic coastline to brace for ""devastating impacts.""

""This storm is a monster,"" Gov. Rick Scott said at an evening news conference. ""Matthew is likely to produce devastating impacts along portions of the east coast tonight,"" he added.

As it moved north in the evening, Matthew stayed about 100 miles or more off South Florida, sparing the 4.4 million people in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas from its most punishing effects.



""We were lucky this time,"" Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said.

By Thursday night, more than 60,000 homes and businesses were without power. Streets in Vero Beach were partially covered with water, and hotel guests in Orlando were told to stay inside, though a few sneaked out to smoke or watch the rain.

The hurricane was instead expected to blow ashore -- or come dangerously close to doing so -- early Friday north of West Palm Beach, which has about 1.1 million people, and then slowly push north for the next 12 hours along the Interstate 95 corridor, through Cape Canaveral and Jacksonville, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Forecasters said it would then probably hug the coast of Georgia and South Carolina over the weekend before veering out to sea -- perhaps even looping back toward Florida in the middle of next week as a tropical storm.

As of 10 p.m. EDT, Matthew was located 65 miles east-southeast of West Palm Beach, moving northwest at about 13 mph.

As evening fell, the winds picked up along Vero Beach, midway between West Palm Beach and Cape Canaveral, stripping away palm fronds, ripping awnings and blowing sand that stung the face. Waves crashed on the beach, and rain came in short bursts. About 30,000 homes and businesses were in the dark.



Officials from Florida to South Carolina urged an estimated 2 million people to evacuate. Scott said so far he has activated 3,500 Florida National Guard members to assist in any rescues and recovery missions after the storm passed.

CLICK FOR INFORMATION ON CURRENT FLORIDA EVACUATION ORDERS

President Obama declared a state of emergency for Florida and South Carolina on Thursday, clearing the way for federal aid in addition to state and local emergency response teams. The Pentagon reported the governors of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina had mobilized 4,500 National Guardsmen ahead of the hurricane.

Forecasters said Matthew could dump up to 15 inches of rain in some spots and cause a storm surge of 9 feet or more.

They said the major threat to the Southeast would not be the winds -- which newer buildings can withstand -- but the massive surge of seawater that could wash over coastal communities along a 500-mile stretch from South Florida to the Charleston, S.C., area.

The Fort Lauderdale airport shut down on Thursday morning, and further north the Orlando airport also closed. By early-evening, flight-tracking service FlightAware.com reported that nearly 1,500 flights within the U.S. had been scrapped, with the largest numbers at Fort Lauderdale and Miami. American Airlines, which has a major hub in Miami, was the hardest-hit carrier, followed by Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways.

Amtrak suspended train service between Miami and New York, and cruise lines rerouted ships to avoid the storm, which in some cases will mean more days at sea.

Workers transferred patients from two Florida waterfront hospitals and a nursing home near Daytona Beach to safer locations. Officials at Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld said the parks would shut down Thursday afternoon until the storm passes.

Thousands of people hunkered down in schools converted to shelters, and inland hotels in places such as Charlotte, N.C., reported brisk business.



At the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, NASA no longer has to worry about rolling space shuttles back from the launch pad to the hangar because of hurricanes, since the shuttle fleet is now retired. But the spaceflight company SpaceX was concerned about the storm's effect on its leased seaside pad.

""When a hurricane is forecast to take a track roughly parallel to a coastline, as Matthew is forecast to do from Florida through South Carolina, it becomes very difficult to specify impacts at any one location,"" National Hurricane Center forecaster Lixion Avila said.

The number of people killed in Haiti rose to at least 283, local officials told Reuters on Thursday, saying the storm killed at least four people elsewhere in the Caribbean.

Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal ordered an evacuation of the state's entire coast, covering more than a half-million people. It was the first hurricane evacuation along the Georgia coast since 1999, when the state narrowly escaped Floyd.



The last Category 3 storm or higher to hit the U.S. was Wilma in October 2005. It sliced across Florida with 120 mph winds, killing five people and causing an estimated $21 billion in damage.

As people hurried to higher ground, authorities in South Carolina said a motorist died on Wednesday after being shot by deputies in a gun battle that erupted when he sped away from a checkpoint along an evacuation route.



South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley reversed Interstate 26 so that all lanes of traffic were headed west and out of Charleston. It was the first time the lanes had been reversed. Plans to reverse the lanes were put in place after hours-long traffic jams during Hurricane Floyd in 1999.

Haley said Thursday night she's ""begging"" people to understand the seriousness of Matthew and evacuate the South Carolina coast.

Haley said so far 280,000 people had evacuated as of 3 p.m. Thursday, but that means hundreds of thousands more need to leave.

The governor told reporters that forecasts are getting worse, but ""we can't take you by the hand and bring you to the Upstate.""

Medical facilities that have had to evacuate their patients include Beaufort Memorial Hospital. Haley said Thursday night that should be an indication of the seriousness.

Authorities said the storm surge in some areas along the southern coast of South Carolina will exceed those when Hurricane Hugo hit the state in 1989. Haley said to ""imagine floor-to-ceiling"" storm surges, while eastern parts of the state could see 8 to 14 inches of rain.

In Florida, Scott also lifted tolls on major roads. The Florida Turnpike, Alligator Alley and part of the Central Florida Expressway Authority and the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority had toll services suspended, according to Fox 35 Orlando.

In Melbourne Beach, near the Kennedy Space Center, Carlos and April Medina moved their paddle board and kayak inside the garage and took pictures off the walls of their home about 500 feet from the coast. They moved the pool furniture inside, turned off the water, disconnected all electrical appliances and emptied their refrigerator.

They then hopped in a truck filled with legal documents, jewelry and a decorative carved shell that had once belonged to April Medina's great-grandfather and headed west to Orlando, where they planned to ride out the storm with their daughter's family.

""The way we see it, if it maintains its current path, we get tropical storm-strength winds. If it makes a little shift to the left, it could be a Category 2 or 3 and I don't want to be anywhere near it,"" Carlos Medina said. ""We are just being a little safe, a little bit more cautious.""

About 20 miles away in the town of Cape Canaveral, John Long said Hurricane Matthew is just hype as his neighbors in his RV park packed up and evacuated inland. Even though his 32-foot RV is just feet from the Banana River and a half mile from the beach, he had no plans to leave.

Long, who owns a bike shop and has lived along the Space Coast for 30 years, said he has a generator and enough food and water for himself and his cats to last a week. ""There's always tremendous buildup and then it's no stronger than an afternoon thunderstorm,"" he said. ""I'm not anticipating that much damage.""

At Folly Beach, S.C., southwest of Charleston, Gaby Trompeter loaded her car at her beachfront home preparing to evacuate to Augusta, Georgia.

Trompeter, a 50-year-old goldsmith who designs and makes jewelry, remembers Hurricane Hugo when she stayed in Savannah, Georgia, in 1989.

A year ago when what has been described as a 1,000-year flood inundated South Carolina there was so much water on the road near her house she couldn't get out for three days.

""If it brings a lot of rain, more than the storm last year, why would I want to stay?"" she said.

On the Georgia coast, 92-year-old Lou Arcangeli saw two of his adult children come to his home on Tybee Island to help prepare and evacuate if necessary.

""It's serious,"" said Arcangeli, who has lived in the Savannah area since 1979, when Hurricane David became the last hurricane to make landfall on Georgia's 100-mile coast. ""I'm going to keep an eye on it and not wait until the last minute. As far as I'm concerned, what's going to happen is going to happen.""

""We have a house that sits right here on the water and we kind of said goodbye to it thinking that, you know, the house ... might not be here when we get back,"" said Jennifer Banker, a resident of Georgia's dangerously exposed St. Simons Island. ""You know, we pray a lot and trust God to provide.""

Some coastal residents in Georgia and beyond decided to take their chances and stay.

Darcy O'Connor, a restaurant owner who lives in a rowhouse in Savannah, Ga., a historic city of many beautifully maintained homes from the 18th and 19th century, said she and her most of her neighbors were sticking around.

O'Connor noted that her home, built in 1883, has weathered hurricanes before: ""Half the windows, if you look, still have the original glass. So that tells you something.""

Farmers in Matthew's path scrambled to protect their crops. In South Carolina, Jeremy Cannon was harvesting his soybeans a week early after waiting too long before last year's record rainstorm. He watched his soybeans and cotton crops slowly drown as 20 inches of rain fell, costing him $800,000.

""I don't want to lose a single soybean this year if I don't have to,"" Cannon said. ""The Lord says pray without ceasing. And that's what I've been doing — in the fields, near the barn — just praying all the time. I don't want to find out what I'll have to do if I get wiped out for another year.""

328,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/09/29/penny-nance-trump-vs-miss-universe-can-t-get-to-victim-when-think-alicia-machado.html,2,"At Monday’s presidential debate Hillary Clinton’s asserted that Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe, was victimized about her weight by Donald Trump. Her remarks have, perhaps rightfully, given some women pause. So let’s reflect a moment and add some context to this allegation. Here’s where I’ve come down.

Like many young girls of my era, I grew up watching the Miss America Pageant. My friends and I would get together, root for the young woman from our state, or pick another favorite if she didn’t make the top ten.

We held our breath as some of them struggled to answer the interview question and discussed our own answers regarding world peace. We clapped for the pianist and giggled at the fiery baton twirler. It was reality TV before reality TV. And who knew that years later I would be friends with some of those same young women as they went on to have laudable careers in law and broadcasting. The women I know were then, and remain today, smart and gifted women of noble character.

Fast forward to today, and somewhere along the way pageants fell out of favor. Perhaps it was second wave feminism of the 60s and 70s, or perhaps we just got bored with them. Regardless, in 2004, the ABC television network dropped the show’s coverage due to record low ratings, but CMT picked it up, and there remains a smaller following. Most of us were done with Miss America. However, her more racy sisters, Miss USA and co-owned Miss Universe were, by this time, split off and vying for our attention.

Of course, there are some smart, talented women who have chosen to participate in the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, but let’s be honest, it’s not why they win.

Unlike Miss America, these pageants make no pretense of being anything more than a “beauty” pageant. They have no talent competition and award no scholarships.

In fact, according to Bustle.com, the entire reason for the split was because Miss America 1951 Yolande Belbeze refused to be photographed for a newspaper wearing a swimsuit. One of the show’s sponsors, Catalina swimwear, retaliated by creating its own show and, thus, we have Miss USA and Miss Universe.

Of course, there are some smart, talented women who have chosen to participate in the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, but let’s be honest, it’s not why they win.

The women who participate voluntarily don a bikini and walk in front of judges to be, well, judged.

The participants are competing for a job based on their bodies and good looks.

Their worth is based almost solely upon those things and, for one year, they are to represent the company with the asset of conventional beauty. Not brains, not talent, just beauty. Quite literally, their bodies are their money makers.

Here’s a little known fact, even the U.S government recognizes this arrangement. I am told by friends who have modeled that they are able to write off of their taxes anything they do to keep their assets looking good. All the things women spend money on — hair, makeup, gym memberships, and even Botox — is a write off. Even Uncle Sam gets the joke. Their bodies are their small businesses I suppose.

So here’s the deal. Logically, I can’t get to victim when I think of Alicia Machado. Name calling is never nice, and — shocker! — Donald Trump isn’t diplomatic in giving criticism.

Here’s the irony. Regardless of how much Hillary Clinton wants Ms. Machado to be the poster child for misused women, she doesn’t fit the narrative. Let’s be honest, a woman who voluntarily puts on a bikini and literally asks people to judge her based almost solely on her body can’t be mad when they do.

Ms. Machado was being paid to look perfect, and when she couldn’t -- or wouldn’t -- live up to the standard she had asked to be measured by, she caught criticism.

Maybe she’s also smart and kind. Who knows? But that was not why she was chosen to serve as Miss Universe for one year.

At this point in my life, I feel conflicted about pageants. Women I love have done them and will do them. CWA’s Young Women for America boasts more than one pageant winner.

As logical women, however, we can’t pretend that Alicia Machado was misused. There are millions of women across this nation who are objectified, abused victims of sexism and misogyny. Let’s work to protect them, instead of inventing new ones."
329,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/04/ap-fact-check-claims-in-vp-debate.html,2,"Not all the claims in the vice presidential debate stand up to scrutiny. A look at some of them and how they compare with the facts:

REPUBLICAN MIKE PENCE: ""The fact that under this past administration, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.... Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.""

THE FACTS: As a share of the total U.S. economy, the national debt has gone up 35 percent; not a doubling.

Still, the debt has ballooned to $19.6 trillion. This largely reflected efforts by the Obama administration to stop the Great Recession.

Would Clinton similarly increase the debt? Not according to an analysis by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

The Clinton plan with its tax increases would increase the gross debt -- both privately and publicly held-- by $450 billion over 10 years. Mind you, that is on top of an $8.8 trillion increase already projected by the government under current law.

As for Donald Trump, the committee says his tax-cut-heavy plan would increase the gross debt by $4.3 trillion --nearly 10 times more than Clinton's plan would do.

------

DEMOCRAT TIM KAINE, on fighting the Islamic State: ""Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.""

THE FACTS: Clinton also doesn't have a plan that is materially different than what President Barack Obama is already doing.

She's described a three-part strategy that involves crushing IS ""on its home turf"" in the Middle East, disrupting its infrastructure on the ground and online, and protecting America and its allies. All are current elements of the Obama administration's strategy, so it's not clear what would change or if she would accelerate any portions of it.

It's also the case that Trump has not laid out a clear plan.

------

PENCE, calling Clinton the ""architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy,"" says the crisis in Syria was the result of a ""failed and weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead.""

THE FACTS: Clinton, as secretary of state, actually pushed for increased U.S. intervention after Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against rebels. But Obama is the commander in chief and nothing has swayed him thus far. Whatever her failings might be on foreign policy, it's a stretch to accuse her of helping to lead a weak policy on Syria.

------

PENCE: ""We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal.""

THE FACTS: The coal industry's woes don't come solely from onerous federal regulations. Pence omitted the effects of steep competition from cheap natural gas.

A string of major coal companies have filed for bankruptcy in recent years, including Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Peabody Energy. Layoffs and cutbacks have spread economic suffering through coal country in the Appalachians and Wyoming's Powder River Basin. By contrast, these are boom times for natural gas extraction, mostly due to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.

Still, the Obama administration has implemented rules that aren't making the coal industry's life any easier. Obama last year imposed a rule requiring coal-fired power plants to cut their carbon emissions as part of his effort to combat climate change. The rule has been suspended pending a legal challenge. Obama also has halted new coal leases on federal lands until it completes a comprehensive review.

------

PENCE, saying he's proud that ""the state of Indiana has balanced budgets.""

THE FACTS: True, but that's not exactly to his credit as governor of Indiana. A balanced budget is required by law, as it is in every state except Vermont."
330,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/11/trump-survives-media-firestorm-and-rough-debate-but-ryan-undercuts-him.html,2,"After 48 hours of sheer media hell, Donald Trump lived to fight another day.

And all of the pundits and news organizations that filled the airwaves and websites with speculative chatter about whether he might drop out are looking a little silly today. That was never going to happen.

Nor, as it turned out, was Mike Pence leaving the ticket or Kellyanne Conway quitting the campaign.

Conway, in fact, tweeted this in response to CNN reported that Pence never considered bowing out: “So, this actually ISN'T #BreakingNews unless you'd convinced yourself rumor, innuendo, conspiracy & the telephone game are news.”

Sitting there in St. Louis about 20 minutes into the ugly opening of the debate, I didn’t think things looked good for Trump. Having endured virtually nonstop covering of the decade-old “Access Hollywood” tape in which he boasted of being a celebrity who could grope women’s genitals at will, the Republican nominee staged a bizarre, dimly lit news conference with Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick, and then brought Broaddrick to the debate. The message to Hillary Clinton—your husband’s sexual misconduct is worse than my sexual embarrassments—seemed to accomplish little more than dragging the evening into the gutter.

Sure, Trump’s supporters must have cheered at seeing him try to pivot from apologizing for what he called “locker room talk” to an attack on the Clintons’ character—but it’s not clear how that approach would attract new voters to Trump’s cause.

Still, he battled his way to a strong performance in the rest of the debate, and Clinton spent much time on the defensive as the focus shifted to her record. Plus, she had used most of her ammunition in the first debate, so her attacks sounded a bit more rehearsed.

Even an over-the-top verbal assault—Trump not only vowing to name a special prosecutor to pursue Clinton but snapping that if he won she would be in jail—did little to derail him, except among critics in the media.

But Trump’s off-the-mat performance failed to stem the tide of criticism from big-name Republicans who had been abandoning him in droves over the weekend. Word quickly leaked when Paul Ryan held a GOP conference call that he would no longer defend Trump but would concentrate on saving the party’s House majority. The P-word tape had finally pushed the speaker, with his tepid backing of Trump, to cancel a weekend appearance and bail on the standard-bearer.

Trump fired back on Twitter: “Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee.”

Such intramural sniping took the gloss off what should have been a good morning-after for Trump. Some Republicans are furious at Ryan for making the story about him and undercutting the only nominee the party has. Others say the party is smart to try to contain the down-ballot damage and wonder how many lawmakers will follow Ryan. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll taken after the “Access Hollywood” flap—but before Sunday’s debate—gives Clinton a 46-35 lead over Trump.

Trump, of course, is here because he ran against the entire Republican establishment and beat 16 contenders. Now he may finish the race the way he started it, on his own."
331,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/15/trump-slams-corrupt-media-as-more-women-make-sexual-assault-claims.html,2,"Two more women accused Republican nominee Donald Trump of sexual assault Friday, with a relative of one of them saying that the allegation was ""an attempt to regain the spotlight.""



Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump's NBC reality show ""The Apprentice,"" said the real estate mogul kissed her and groped her after meeting at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2007 to discuss a potential job. Zervos, accompanied at a Los Angeles press conference by attorney Gloria Allred, said she was later offered a lower-paying job at a Trump golf course.

“You do not have the right to treat women as sexual objects just because you are a star,” Zervos said at the press conference, addressing Trump.

Late Friday, the Trump campaign released a statement purporting to be from statement in which a cousin of Zervos said he was ""shocked and bewildered"" by her account.

John Barry of Mission Viejo, Calif., said in the statement that Zervos spoke glowingly of Trump until the real estate mogul rebuffed an invitation to visit her restaurant during the primary campaign.

""I think Summer wishes she could still be on reality TV, and in an effort to get that back she’s saying all of these negative things about Mr. Trump,"" Barry said. ""That’s not how she talked about him before.""

Trump himself issued a statement saying that he ""never met [Zervos] at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I’ve conducted my life."" He added that Zervos had emailed Trump's office this past April 14 to ask if he could visit her restaurant in California.

Allred, who frequently represents women bringing sexual harassment and assault claims, said “many more women” have contacted her regarding the Republican nominee after a video emerged of Trump making lewd comments about women in 2005 – comments Trump apologized for, but dismissed as “locker room talk.”

Allred said Zervos is not filing a suit at this time.

Earlier Friday, The Washington Post reported on a woman’s claim that Trump put his hand up her skirt and groped her at a Manhattan nightspot in the early '90s.

According to the Post, Kristin Anderson claimed that while she was at the Manhattan nightspot in the early 1990s, Trump slid his fingers under her miniskirt and fondled her.

Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks called Anderson's claim a ""total fabrication."" She said in a statement, ""It is illogical and nonsensical to think Donald Trump was alone in a nightclub in Manhattan.""

The new allegations capped a tumultuous week on the campaign trail for Trump, who has faced a daily drip-drip of allegations even as he has tried to focus on Bill Clinton's female accusers -- and the massive leak of Clinton campaign emails by WikiLeaks.

As Zervos was making her accusations Friday, Trump was at a rally in Greensboro, N.C., rejecting all the allegations against him as “total fiction.”

“I have no idea who these women are,” Trump said. “The stories are total fiction. They’re 100 percent made up.”

He continued to expand on his argument that the claims are part of a conspiracy involving the Clinton campaign and what he calls “the corrupt media” – in particular the New York Times, which kick-started the reports of sexual misconduct earlier this week. Trump previously threatened to sue the Times over allegations they published from two women who claim Trump groped them.

On Friday, Trump went after the Times again, suggesting the reporters were acting at the behest of billionaire Carlos Slim, the largest shareholder in the Times.

“Now, Carlos Slim, as you know, comes from Mexico. He’s given many millions of dollars to the Clintons and their initiatives,” Trump said. “Reporters at The New York Times, they’re not journalists. They’re corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and for Hillary Clinton.”

Trump then claimed the controversy was “a total setup” consisting of “lies spread by the media” as a way to undermine his campaign. He went so far as to mock his accusers, making fun of one who told the Times he groped her on an airplane in the early 1980s.

“The only way they can figure they can slow it down is to come up with people that are willing to say ‘Oh I was with Donald Trump in 1980,’” he said, putting on a voice mocking his accusers. “'I was sitting with him on an airplane and he went after me on the plane.’ Yeah, I'm gonna go after you…”

“Believe me,” he added. “She would not be my first choice, I can tell you.”

One of the accusers who came forward earlier this week, Mindy McGillivray of Palm Springs, Fla., told the Palm Beach Post Friday that she was planning to leave the United States because she feared for her family’s safety. She told the paper cars had been driving around her house.

As Trump ratched up his attacks Friday on the media and his accusers, Democrats have been seizing on the accounts as proof that Trump is unfit for office. On Thursday, first lady Michelle Obama launched a scathing attack on the billionaire and the comments he made on the 2005 tape.

""We have a candidate for president of the United States who over the course of his lifetime, over the course of this campaign, has said things about women that are shocking, so demeaning,"" she said. ""I simply will not repeat anything here today. Last week, we actually saw this candidate bragging about sexually assaulting women. I can't believe I'm saying that, a candidate for president of the United States bragged about sexually assaulting women.""

On Friday, President Obama followed up, saying Trump was determined to “drag this election as low as he can possibly go” and warned that “democracy is on the ballot” in November.

""We will absolutely accept the results of the election,"" Republican vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Pence made the comment amid two polls Sunday that showed Clinton with a solid lead and as he and Trump resumed their attack on the media -- after essentially nine straight days of headlines related to Trump’s treatment of women over the past 30 years.

“The American people will speak,” Pence continued on NBC. “But (they) are tired of the obvious bias in the national media. That's where the sense of a rigged election goes here.”

Democratic vice-presidential nominee Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine told “Fox News Sunday”: “From the beginning, I’ve said this would be a very close campaign.”

A Washington Post-ABC News poll shows Clinton with a 47-to-43 percent lead over Trump, essentially unchanged, compared the groups’ earlier polls.

And an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll shows Clinton with an 11 percentage point lead over Trump, her GOP rival, with 23 days before Election Day.

“The media is piling on with unsubstantiated claims … while they ignore an avalanche of hard evidence about corruption, pay to play, political favoritism emanating out of Hillary Clinton's years as secretary of state,” Pence told “Fox News Sunday.”

He cited the example of a hacked email recently released by WikiLeaks that shows that representatives from Qatar in 2012, while Clinton was secretary of state, apparently tried to get a quick meeting with Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, to give him a $1 million check for the family foundation.

Trump on Sunday continued his attack on the media via Twitter, after making his case in person Saturday at three campaign rallies.

""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary -- but also at many polling places,"" Trump tweeted.

Trump tweeted earlier in the day: “Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me. Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!""

On Saturday, Trump, a first-time candidate and wealthy New York businessman, suggested that Clinton, during their debate earlier this month, appeared to be on drugs -- acting “pumped up,” then exhausted at the end.

He suggested they each take a drug test before their third-and-final debate Wednesday and mocked Clinton for staying off the trail the entire weekend to prepare.

Pence declined to elaborate on Trump’s remark, saying to Fox News, ""All I know for sure is that Donald Trump is going to be ready for the debate.”

The stories about Trump mistreating women started with the Oct. 7 release of a 2005 audiotape in which Trump is heard bragging about his celebrity status allowing him to kiss and fondle women without their consent.

Trump has apologies for the comments, and nine women have since come forward to say Trump acted inappropriately with them. Trump has denied the allegations, calling one woman a “liar,” while he and Pence work to find evidence to refute the allegations.

The allegations appear to have overshadowed WikiLeaks' recent release of hacked emails from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta.

Some showed the campaign worrying whether Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., might endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders in the party's primary, and wrestling with how to respond to revelations about Clinton's private email use. The emails also show aides lining up materials to respond to fresh accusations from a woman who accused Bill Clinton of raping her decades ago. The former president denied the accusation, which was never adjudicated by a criminal court.

Clinton campaign spokesman Glen Caplin on Saturday compared the Podesta email hack to the Watergate break in.

""Four decades later, we’re witnessing another effort to steal private campaign documents in order to influence an election,” he said. “Only this time, instead of filing cabinets, it’s people’s emails they’re breaking into … and a foreign government is behind it.""

Top Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani appeared Sunday on TV to try to downplay Trump’s renewed argument about potential voter fraud and the potential need for poll monitors -- particularly in big, Democratic-run cities like Philadelphia.

""When he talks about a rigged election, he's not talking about the fact that it's going to be rigged at the polls,"" the former New York City mayor said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “What he's talking about is that 80 percent to 85 percent of the media is against him.""

333,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/21/trump-jeered-over-clinton-slams-at-charity-dinner-as-candidates-get-personal.html,2,"Republican nominee Donald Trump was jeered by attendees at a New York white-tie charity dinner Thursday night after his speech crossed from roast-style jokes into attacks on Hillary Clinton -- though the Democratic nominee also took swipes, and both candidates got roasted by the master of ceremonies.

The first outburst from members of the audience at the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner came when Trump said that Clinton was ""so corrupt she got kicked off the Watergate Commission.""

WATCH: TRUMP JOKES ABOUT CLINTON 'PARDON'

The jeers continued when Trump referenced the Clinton campaign emails leaked by Wikileaks and claimed that the former secretary of state was ""pretending not to hate Catholics,"" an apparent reference to 2011 emails from a current Clinton campaign spokeswoman that mocked Catholics and evangelical Christians.

CLINTON: IT TOOK A VILLAGE TO WRITE THESE JOKES



Some members of the audience appeared to be shouting at Timothy Cardinal Dolan, who was sitting between the candidates, and asking him to take the microphone from Trump, who quickly pivoted to remembrances of attending the event with his father.

Moments earlier, Trump had gotten one of the biggest cheers of the night when he joked about his wife Melania's speech at the Republican National Convention, which was found to have been partially plagiarized from an address by first lady Michelle Obama.

""Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it,"" Trump said. ""My wife Melania gives the exact same speech and people get on her case and I don't get it. I don't know why.""

As Melania Trump rose to acknowledge the applause, her husband remarked, ""I'm in trouble when I go home tonight. She didn't know about that one.""

Clinton also was the first one to laugh when Trump joked that she had bumped into him earlier in the night ""and she very simply said `Pardon me""' -- an unsubtle reference to the Republican nominee's frequent declarations that his opponent should go to jail.

Clinton, meanwhile, joked that she had taken a break from her ""usual nap schedule"" to attend and suggested that the audience should be pleased she's not charging her usual fee for speaking in front of potential donors.



But she also got in some digs at Trump, a few of which drew scattered jeers. Clinton said she understood why Trump was leery of teleprompters because they can be difficult to follow and ""I'm sure it's even harder when you're translating from the original Russian.""

Clinton repeatedly referenced Trump's most controversial moments from the three presidential debates. She joked that if Trump didn't like what she was saying, then he could shout 'wrong.""'

She added that she was surprised Trump let her go second because ""I didn't think he'd be OK with a peaceful transition of power."" And she said Trump ""looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four. Maybe a `5' if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.""

She even took a shot at Trump's running mate, saying that ""after listening to your speech, I will also look forward to listening to Mike Pence deny that you ever said it.""

The candidates did not greet each other or make eye contact when they entered and took their seats for the event at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, though they did shake hands at the conclusion of the roast.

For his part, Dolan called his seat ""the iciest place on the planet,"" though he later said that he was ""very moved"" by the candidates' interaction on the dais.

""They were very friendly, very uplifting, very complimentary to one another,"" he told Fox News outside the event. ""The fact that we are together, the fact that they shook hands at the end and said, 'See ya on the campaign trail,' that's not bad.""

Clinton and Trump both took some early heat from the night's master of ceremonies, Alfred E. Smith IV, the event namesake's great-grandson. Smith joked that Trump approached Clinton before the event and asked how she was doing, to which Smith responded ""I'm fine but now get out of the ladies' dressing room.""

Trump laughed at the joke, and again when Smith made another joke about the leaked video which captured Trump using vulgar language, saying while the celebrity businessman was ""sitting next to a man in a robe [Cardinal Dolan], but this is not a locker room. Watch your language!""



Smith also teased Clinton, noting that ""titans of Wall Street"" were in attendance, but told her to restrain herself from seeking donations and to ""remember the children.""

The Al Smith Dinner, named in honor of the former New York governor and 1928 Democratic presidential nominee, benefits charities supporting needy children in the Archdiocese of New York. Smith IV announced that this year's dinner had raised approximately $6 million.

334,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/19/fight-night-in-las-vegas-high-stakes-for-trump-clinton-and-chris-wallace.html,2,"Chris Wallace has got his work cut out for him.

The Fox News anchor has a rare opportunity as the moderator of tonight’s third and final debate here in Las Vegas. But it comes at an especially tumultuous time in the campaign.

I have no doubt about Wallace’s ability to ask fair, probing questions of both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Well before I came to Fox, I believed that he was one of the toughest interviewers in the business. He has a wealth of experience to draw upon, including his previous stints at NBC and ABC, going back to his coverage of the Reagan White House.

Third debates usually matter less than the first two. The candidates have usually thrown their best stuff at each other and wind up recycling many of their attacks.

But this is not most campaigns.

Wallace told me after he became the first Fox journalist tapped to moderate a general-election debate that he’d have to wait in writing most of the questions to see what was covered in the first two faceoffs. Turns out a whole lot has happened since St. Louis.

The final encounter comes as Trump is denying allegations of sexual misconduct by nine women, and whether they are telling the truth or not, this changes the environment more drastically than Trump merely boasting about groping women on a tape he has dismissed as locker-room talk. And Trump has been increasingly at war with Paul Ryan, talking and tweeting about voter fraud, and accusing the media of rigging the election.

The debate also comes as a near-daily drip of disclosures from Wikileaks – and newly released FBI files from her email investigation -- causes more damage to the Clinton campaign. This goes beyond embarrassing comments and coziness with journalists to collusion with the State Department (including talk of a quid pro quo in exchange for changing the secret designation for some of the emails sent from Clinton’s private server).

These stories hang like a shadow over the Las Vegas Strip.

But while I assume that Wallace will deal with those stories fairly early, he also has the responsibility of tackling trade, terrorism, taxes and other issues that affect hundreds of millions of Americans. These subjects are too important to get short shrift in favor of the more scandalous and salacious stuff.

This is the last time for Trump and Clinton to make their case before a mass audience when it comes to persuading voters, but also in attacking their opponents and fending off the broadsides that come their way.

Beyond the zingers and tough exchanges, the debates always come down to which candidate can make more Americans feel comfortable with the prospect of him or her siting in the Oval Office and acting as their champion. The polls show that questionable temperament is Trump’s greatest liability and dishonesty is Clinton’s biggest albatross.

No matter what he does, if the past is any indication, Wallace will draw criticism from partisans on both sides.

But as he told me, he is there to facilitate a debate between two people, one of whom will be the next president. Chris would be perfectly satisfied if no one is talking about him after Las Vegas."
335,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/26/fox-news-poll-clinton-leads-trump-by-three-points.html,2,"With less than two weeks to go, the race for the White House has narrowed as Hillary Clinton now has a three-point advantage over Donald Trump.

That’s within the margin of error of the national Fox News Poll of likely voters.

Clinton is ahead of Trump by 44-41 percent. Another one-in-ten back a third-party candidate and four percent are undecided. Last week she was up by six points (45-39 percent) and before that by seven (45-38 percent).

The poll, released Wednesday, finds Clinton leads 49-44 percent in the head-to-head matchup. That 5-point advantage is at the edge of the error margin. She was up 7 a week ago (49-42 percent).

CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS.

Trump is helped by increased backing among independents and greater strength of support: 68 percent of those backing Trump support him “strongly,” compared to 61 percent for Clinton.

Independents favor Trump over Clinton by 13 points (41-28 percent). He had a 7-point advantage last week, and two weeks ago they were tied at 35 percent each. Third-party candidates play a role here, as Gary Johnson (14 percent) and Jill Stein (7 percent) receive the combined support of more than one-in-five independents.

In the four-way race, Trump leads among whites (+14 points) and men (+5), although his best groups remain white evangelical Christians (+56) and whites without a college degree (+28).

Clinton has commanding leads among blacks (+77 points), unmarried women (+27), voters under 30 (+18), and women (+10). First-time voters are also more likely to back her (+16).

The candidates garner almost equal backing among the party faithful: 83 percent of Democrats back Clinton, while 81 percent of Republicans support Trump.

“To be competitive, Trump needs to consolidate support among Republicans and carry independents,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw. “That’s where he’s made in-roads in the last week, mostly by focusing his attention on the economy and Obamacare.” Shaw conducts the Fox News Poll with Democratic counterpart Chris Anderson.

Trump’s substantive strength is the economy. He’s trusted over Clinton by four points, yet that’s the only issue where he bests her. More trust Clinton to handle foreign policy (+15 points), immigration (+3), and terrorism (+3).

Who would voters put across the table with Russian President Vladimir Putin? More trust Clinton to negotiate with Putin by 3 points (47-44 percent among registered voters). That’s down from a 13-point lead on this measure in April (53-40 percent).

All in all, likely voters don’t think Trump is up to the task: less than half think he’s qualified to be president (46 percent) and even fewer feel he has the temperament to serve effectively (36 percent). Plus, over half lack confidence in his judgment in a crisis (56 percent).

Clinton trounces Trump on each of those measures: 64 percent believe she’s qualified, 62 percent say she has the temperament, and 56 percent are confident in her judgment.

Plus, Clinton continues to receive more positive personal ratings. She has a net negative rating of eight points (45 favorable vs. 53 unfavorable), while Trump is underwater by 14 (42 favorable vs. 56 unfavorable). In addition, when undecided voters and those backing third-party candidates are combined, 26 percent have a favorable view of Clinton vs. 18 percent for Trump.

Yet despite Trump’s weaknesses on traits, it’s still a tight race. That’s because, at least in part, lots of folks prioritize issues when deciding their vote. By a 59-28 percent margin, more say their decision is about the issues as opposed to the character of the candidates. Those backing Trump are more likely to be voting on issues than character by a wide 57-point margin (73-16 percent). For Clinton supporters, the choice is more about issues by 12 points (47-35 percent).

Compared to 2008, this is a more character driven election. At that time, voters said issues were more important than personal qualities by a 71-14 percent margin.

""The bottom hasn't fallen out for Trump and Clinton hasn't pulled away, but the race isn’t as close as the 3-point lead suggests,” says Anderson. “Trump needs a solid majority of undecided voters and wavering supporters of third-party candidates, and that’s extremely unlikely since most of them think he lacks the judgment, temperament, and qualifications to be president.""

There are a couple of areas where the two are about evenly matched. First, 52 percent feel Clinton “stands up” for people like them, and 49 percent feel that way about Trump.

Also on their honesty -- or lack thereof: a record-low 30 percent of likely voters think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, while 34 percent say Trump is.

Pollpourri

Here are five additional takeaways from the poll.

- 63 percent of Trump’s supporters believe things in the United States generally favor “other people,” rather than people like them. Forty-four percent of Clinton’s supporters feel that way.

- Twice as many voters expect Clinton to win as think Trump will (64-26 percent). Fully 86 percent of Democrats think Clinton will win, while 49 percent of Republicans think Trump will.

- Trump supporters (34 percent) are more than three times as likely as Clinton supporters (10 percent) to say they won’t accept the election outcome if their candidate loses. Eighty-eight percent of Clinton supporters say they’ll accept the outcome, up from 74 percent in September.

- The generic congressional ballot test is also tight: 47 percent back the Democratic candidate in their congressional district, while 45 percent support the Republican. Among those backing the GOP congressional candidate, 79 percent go for Trump in the four-way presidential race. Clinton gets 82 percent of those backing the Democratic candidate.

“Models suggest a 2-point Democratic advantage on the generic ballot would result in a gain of about 11 seats in the House and 4 in the Senate,” says Shaw. “That means the GOP would retain an edge of about 20 seats in the House, while the Senate would be very much up for grabs.”

- The political parties are about evenly matched in popularity among likely voters. The Democratic Party has a net positive rating of four points (51 percent favorable vs. 47 percent unfavorable). The Republican Party has a net negative rating by just one point (48 percent favorable vs. 49 percent unfavorable).

The Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,309 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from October 22-25, 2016. The survey includes results among 1,221 likely voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for results among both registered and likely voters."
336,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/28/clinton-more-than-doubles-her-money-edge-over-trump-in-final-days-race.html,2,"Hillary Clinton entered the final phase of her presidential bid with a resounding campaign cash advantage over Donald Trump.

New fundraising reports show her campaign and joint accounts with Democrats had $153 million in the bank as of last week.

That's more than double the $68 million Trump's campaign and partnership committees had on hand.



Clinton's continued fundraising advantage helps ensure the Democratic nominee can keep her sprawling political operation at full strength in the frantic final days of the race. She maintains a staff of more than 800 -- several times larger than Trump's -- and has spent more on advertising than the Republican has every single week of the race.



Over the course of the primary and general elections, Clinton's campaign has hauled in $513 million, roughly double what Trump's has.



She outpaced him again in the first 19 days of October, the new reports show, when her campaign reaped $53 million as his brought in about $30 million.



While Trump, a New York businessman who says he is worth $10 billion, typically makes a personal contribution of about $2 million each month, he had not done so yet in October. The latest contribution reports, up to date as of Wednesday, show he had given only about $33,000.



The candidates and many outside groups involved in the presidential race are filing their final pre-election fundraising reports on Thursday. The filings cover the first 19 days of the month.



Outside groups backing Clinton are better funded than those supporting Trump, the reports show. Super PACS can take unlimited contributions from wealthy donors, but they may not coordinate with the campaigns.



The pro-Clinton Priorities USA raised $18 million in 19 days. Some of its biggest most recent donors include Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Susan Mandel, the wife of a hedge fund founder, who each put in $2.5 million this month.



Priorities USA has been spending most of its money on TV ads. It plans to spend $21 million on ads this week and next, according to Kantar Media's political ad tracker.



Rebuilding America Now, one of several pro-Trump groups, raised only about $215,000 through the early part of this month. As of last week, the super PAC only had about $1.2 million in cash on hand. Another, Great America PAC, raised $2 million and had about as much left to spend.

"
337,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/24/too-soon-media-cast-trumps-task-as-mission-impossible.html,2,"Is the press declaring the presidential race over?

The tenor of the coverage certainly suggests that Donald Trump has no hope and Hillary Clinton is coasting to victory.

Whether it’s the third debate, the latest polls, the Al Smith dinner or a feeling that they’ve finally slayed the Trump dragon, many pundits are now portraying the billionaire’s plight as Mission Impossible.

I’m always more cautious than that. I’ve seen too many elections where a candidate bounced back after being written off, the polls were off, or some unexpected event moved the needle.

Is Clinton now the favorite to reach 270 electoral votes, or, according to some forecasts, much more? Sure.

But it’s not over.

You don’t have to look very far to see the Trump-is-sinking narrative. It’s as if the media left open the possibility that he could still shake up the race in the third debate, until the Las Vegas faceoff ended with him being attacked by both parties for not promising to accept the election outcome.

This goes beyond the horse race stories. You see it when the Washington Post analyzes how the pro-life movement will fare in a Hillary Clinton administration.

You see it with a New York Times headline, ""Clinton Hopes for a Mandate and Coattails.""

You see it when Politico runs a big piece on whether Hillary will tap Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg as Treasury secretary and, yes, handicaps who's on the short list to be her Agriculture secretary.

You see it when Fox's Karl Rove says Trump will have a very hard time coming back and it leads the Huffington Post: ""ROVE: HE'S TOAST.""

Take this Washington Post lead:

“A wave of apprehension and anguish swept the Republican Party on Thursday, with many GOP leaders alarmed by Donald Trump’s refusal to accept the outcome of the election and concluding that it is probably too late to salvage his flailing presidential campaign.”

And there was this Post headline over the weekend: ""Donald Trump is in a funk: Bitter, hoarse and pondering, ‘If I lose. . .’""

Then, of course, there are the polling and prognostication stories:

“Even if Trump ran the table in the remaining battleground states — Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio — he would fall short of the White House if he cannot flip another state where Clinton currently leads in the polls,” says Politico.

“The six states where Clinton is currently comfortably ahead show all the hallmarks of swing states that have faded from contention.”

Data guru Nate Silver of 538:

“I’m not sure I need to tell you this, but Hillary Clinton is probably going to be the next president. It’s just a question of what ‘probably’ means.”

Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball:

“With less than three weeks to go, and all of the debates blessedly in the rearview mirror, Clinton is in a commanding position in the contest to become the 45th president…

“A striking development in recent days has been the smattering of polling showing Trump with weak leads in some reliably Republican states. He’s barely ahead in some polls of Alaska, Indiana, Missouri, South Carolina, and Texas — states that shouldn’t be close in any competitive election…

“We have moved Utah to Toss-up. Seriously, did you ever even for a second think Utah would be a Toss-up in late October?”

These are fair questions in studying the electoral map. Yes, the L.A. Times poll calls the race a tie and an IBD poll gives Trump a 2-point lead, but these seem to be outliers, and in any event the race will be decided in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Colorado, Arizona and a handful of other states.

I have the growing sense that journalists want this long and rather ugly election to be over, and that much of the country does as well.

But remember what Yogi Berra said. And we still have two weeks to go."

Officers arrested 46-year-old Scott Michael Greene without incident in Dallas County, west of Des Moines, police told Fox News. The Iowa State Patrol and Dallas County Sheriff's Dept. took part in the arrest.

Greene was spotted alone on foot on a roadway at the time of his arrest. Police said he surrendered to a state Department of Natural Resources officer without incident.

Greene is suspected in the shooting deaths of Urbandale officer Justin Martin, with the force since 2015, and Sgt. Anthony ""Tony"" Beminio, who joined the department in Des Moines in 2005.

Martin was single. Beminio was married with children.

EX-FBI MAN: ANTI-COP FERVOR PUTS BLUE LIVES IN DANGER

The shootings appeared to be the latest cases of police officers being targeted for assassination in a year that has seen 113 police officers killed in the line of duty, including 50 by gunfire, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.

Gov. Branstad, @IALtGov have been briefed by @IowaDPS on early morning attack on 2 police officers - https://t.co/NO0CZlEnhR #iagov — Terry Branstad (@TerryBranstad) November 2, 2016

Officers first responded to a report of shots fired at 1:06 a.m. and found an Urbandale Police Dept. officer who had been shot. Authorities from several agencies raced to the area after that shooting, and about 20 minutes later discovered that a Des Moines officer had been shot in a patrol car at an intersection. The shootings happened less than 2 miles apart and both took place along main streets that cut through residential areas.

FLASHBACK: POLICE FACE HEIGHTENED THREAT OF AMBUSH

“In all appearances it looks just like... these officers were ambushed,” Parizek said. “It doesn't look like there was any interaction between these cowards and the officers they shot in their cars.”

Court records show Greene was jailed and charged with interference with official acts after resisting Urbandale police officers trying to pat him for a weapon on April 10, 2014. An Urbandale officer described him as hostile and combative. He entered a guilty plea and was fined.

Two days later Urbandale police were called to answer a complaint of harassment at the apartment complex where Greene lived. The complaint said he threatened to kill another man during a confrontation in the parking lot. He was charged with harassment.

He pleaded guilty and received a suspended jail sentence and a year of probation. Court records show he completed a substance abuse and psychological evaluation.

Urbandale Sgt. Chad Underwood said his officers are equipped with body cameras, but they are not always on.

Asked at a news conference about a video on social media that appeared to show a man identified as Greene being removed from a high school football game, Parizek said he was aware of the video but hadn't seen it and couldn't comment.

The shootings follow a spate of police killings, including ambushes of officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Five officers were killed in Dallas on July 7 and three were killed later that month in Baton Rouge.

The Des Moines Register reported that streets at both shooting scenes were closed amid the investigation. Schools in the area were also closing for the day, officials said.

The Des Moines police officer is believed to be the first from the city to be shot and killed on duty since two officers were gunned down in separate incidents in 1977, according to the Register. Two Des Moines police officers were killed earlier this year when their car was struck head-on by a wrong-way drunken driver, according to the paper.

The Urbandale police officer is believed to be that department's first to be shot dead in the line of duty, Underwood said at the news conference.

From coast to coast, demonstrators are burning flags and effigies of the president-elect while declaring that they refuse to accept Trump’s victory. But observers online are claiming that, in some cases, protesters were bused to the scenes - a telltale sign of coordination.

“Anti-Trump protestors in Austin today are not as organic as they seem,” one local in the Texas capitol tweeted Wednesday, along with photos offered as evidence.

Others claimed to have found ads posted on CraigsList in which a Seattle-based non-profit was soliciting “Full-Time Activists.”

“We are looking for motivated individuals who are seeking Full-Time, Part-Time, and Permanent positions,” reads a line from the ad from Washington CAN! posted on Wednesday.

Rumors have also been circulating that the new batch of anti-Trump protesters has been bankrolled by individuals like billionaire liberal activist George Soros and groups like Moveon.org.

“WTF, @georgesoros busing in & paying #protestors to destroy cities is domestic #terrorism. #fakeProtests #BlueLivesMatter have tough days,” read one tweet in response to the viral picture of buses in Austin.

Another theory floated on social media is that many of the signs that were distributed at rallies across the country appeared to be exactly the same, indicating they were printed and distributed by an organized group.

Trump tweeted about the protesters Thursday night:

Wednesday’s protests occurred in nearly every major city, and more are expected to come in the days leading up to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Some of the most troubling dissent was in the city of New

Orleans where protesters wound up defacing the Lee Memorial, spray painting “Die Whites Die” and “F--- Trump” and “F--- White People.”

Other messages scrawled on the memorial included ""F--- Pence"" and ""We are ungovernable"" next to a symbol of the letter ""A"" in a circle -- protester shorthand for anarchy.

In Chicago, several thousand people marched through the Loop. They gathered outside Trump Tower, chanting “Not my president!” One resident, Michael Burke, told The Associated Press that the president-elect will divide the nation and stir up a deep-seated hatred.

Hundreds of protesters gathered near Philadelphia's City Hall despite chilly, wet weather. Participants — who included both supporters of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who lost to Clinton in the primary — expressed anger at both Republicans and Democrats over the election's outcome.

In Boston, thousands of anti-Trump protesters streamed through downtown, chanting ""Trump's a racist,"" and carrying signs that said ""Impeach Trump"" and ""Abolish Electoral College."" Clinton appeared to be on pace to win the popular vote, despite losing the electoral count that decides the presidential race.

In the Midwest, protesters gathered in Minneapolis, Omaha, Nebraska and Kansas City. Mo. The Des Moines Register also reported that Iowa’s capital city saw some people protest as well, though it was kept to small numbers.

On the West Coast, some of the protests became unruly with fires being started. Thousands of protesters burned a giant papier mache Trump head in Los Angeles and started fires in Oakland intersections.

Los Angeles demonstrators also beat a Trump piñata and sprayed the Los Angeles Times building and news vans with anti-Trump profanity. One protester outside LA City Hall read a sign that simply said ""this is very bad.""

Late in the evening Wednesday, several hundred people blocked one of the city's busiest freeways, U.S. 101 between downtown and Hollywood.

Speaking to cheering supporters early Wednesday morning at his victory party in New York City, the Republican candidate and now president-elect said Clinton called to congratulate him, and Fox News confirms she has conceded. Despite their hard-fought campaign, Trump praised Clinton for her service and said “it is time for us to come together as one united people.”

“I will be president for all Americans,” Trump vowed, after a brief introduction by running mate Mike Pence.

TRUMP'S AGENDA: WHAT HIS ELECTION MEANS FOR AMERICA

Sounding a call to “reclaim our country’s destiny,” Trump declared: “The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. … America will no longer settle for anything less than the best.”

Trump will be the oldest president in U.S. history, entering the Oval Office at age 70. With her defeat, Clinton falls short in her second bid to become the first female president of the United States.

Though Clinton called Trump, her campaign initially did not concede defeat. Earlier, her campaign chairman John Podesta addressed supporters nearby in New York and said several states were “too close to call.”

Clinton herself did not appear at the rally. Podesta had urged supporters to “head home” and said they would not have “anything more to say tonight.”

Amid Trump’s victory, Republicans also were projected to hold onto their majority in the House and Senate, improving Trump’s chances of advancing his agenda in office.

A surge of support in key battlegrounds – and especially surprise victories in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – helped propel Trump to victory. The GOP nominee built a commanding lead early on with wins in heavily contested North Carolina, Florida, Ohio and Iowa.

Clinton won her share of battlegrounds, including Virginia and Nevada and Colorado, but could not make up for Trump’s strong performance in other states thought to favor the Democrat.

The billionaire businessman’s victory marked a remarkable upset and turnaround, after he had been complaining amid a rough patch just weeks ago the vote could be “rigged” against him.

Clinton was still thought to have the clear advantage in the electoral map going into Tuesday’s vote, yet the polls had been tightening in the race’s closing days.

His victory could demonstrate just how much the dynamics were shifting in his favor – and perhaps how his true support was elusive all along to pollsters and others gauging the race.

Without question, his bid was helped over the last two weeks by a burst of setbacks for his opponent.

Eleven days before the election, FBI Director James Comey announced the bureau was revisiting the investigation into Clinton’s personal email server use while secretary of state, after discovering new messages on the laptop of disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide. He closed the case again on Sunday, but the political damage may have been done. And the WikiLeaks release of emails hacked from Podesta’s account became a constant distraction for the campaign, as the messages revealed infighting, internal concerns about the Clinton family’s foundation and even evidence that the now-head of the Democratic National Committee leaked town hall questions to Clinton during the primaries.

This at times overshadowed the numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Trump that came out in October (which he denies), following leaked footage from over a decade ago showing Trump making crude comments about women.

Trump’s victory marks the second time Clinton was thwarted in her bid to become the first female U.S. president, having been defeated by President Obama in their 2008 primary race.

But Trump has been able to defy expectations from the start. He defeated a deep field of 16 competitors during the Republican primaries – stitching together a motivated coalition of voters invigorated by his outsider, populist message; throwing his rivals off their talking points during a raucous marathon of debates; and commanding media attention throughout with his unpredictable, learn-as-he-goes campaign style.

He also defied party orthodoxy, railing against free-trade deals like NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership and staking out a sometimes-confusing set of positions on foreign policy that may yet evolve. Democrats have criticized him heavily for statements expressing admiration for Russia’s Vladimir Putin and a desire to rebuild ties with Moscow.

Trump was aided by the infrastructure of the GOP, but his campaign never came close to the juggernaut operation mounted by Clinton. While she entered the final stretch of the race with an army of high-powered surrogates, Trump’s campaign was driven mainly by him, an inner circle of family members and a rotating set of top campaign advisers. Surrogates like retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani advocated aggressively for the Republican nominee, but he remained at odds with many influential elected Republicans who in some cases – as with House Speaker Paul Ryan – endorsed him, but only reluctantly. His stances on trade as well as his hardline immigration proposals – including variations on a plan to suspend Muslim immigration from certain countries – also made party brass uncomfortable.

The late emergence of a 2005 tape showing him making crude comments about women led some congressional Republicans to abandon him entirely. But even the biggest controversies seemed only to ding Trump, whose resilience in the polls could be credited to a movement of grassroots supporters who seemed to have little interest in the nominee’s tensions with the GOP establishment and saw him as the true change-maker in the election."

Portland police said at least 29 people were arrested in the riot and that more information would be given on the charges Friday morning.

According to KPTV, one driver had her windshield smashed and someone painted “Capitalism kills” on a nearby convenience store. Police declared the protest a riot at around 8:30 pm. A riot is a Class C felony in Oregon.

The state Department of Transportation briefly shut down Interstate 5 between the Marquan Bridge and the Fremont Bridge due to the demonstration. Parts of Interstate 84 were also temporarily closed.

Protesters in Portland’s Pearl District were breaking windows of several businesses and some were arming themselves with rocks from a construction site, police said.

""People attending any of the various protest events are encouraged to obey all laws and be respectful of others who are using city streets, freeways and mass transit. Marching into and blocking streets is illegal, and dangerous to protesters as well as road users and has a significantly negative impact to our community. Pedestrians walking on the freeway is illegal and extremely dangerous to all road users,"" Portland police said.

KPTV reported that the groups Don’t Shoot Portland and Black Lives Matter combined in Portland to become Portland’s Resistance. The founder told the station that “Trump is going to be our president. We need to save our city and hopefully allow people to come here to be a city where there is hope.""

Anti-Trump demonstrations erupted across the U.S. for the second straight night. From Portland to Chicago to New York and parts in between drew a couple hundred people.

In New York City, a large group of demonstrators once again gathered outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue Thursday night. They chanted angry slogans and waved banners baring anti-Trump messages.

""You got everything straight up and down the line,"" demonstrator David Thomas said. ""You got climate change, you got the Iran deal. You got gay rights, you got mass deportations. Just everything, straight up and down the line, the guy is wrong on every issue.""

In Denver, protesters managed to shut down Interstate 25 near downtown Denver briefly Thursday night.

Denver police tweeted around 10 p.m. that demonstrators made their way onto the freeway and traffic was halted in the northbound and southbound lanes. Police say the interstate was reopened about half an hour later as the crowd moved back downtown.

Earlier protests in Denver, Boulder and Colorado Springs on Wednesday and Thursday went off peacefully.

In San Francisco's downtown, high-spirited high school students marched through, chanting ""not my president"" and holding signs urging a Donald Trump eviction. They waved rainbow banners and Mexican flags, as bystanders in the heavily Democratic city high-fived the marchers from the sidelines.

Hundreds of protesters demonstrated outside Trump Tower in Chicago and a growing group was getting into some shoving matches with police in Oakland, California.

Another protest was building in Los Angeles, where 28 people were arrested Wednesday for blocking traffic during a demonstration that also saw vandalism to some buildings and a news truck.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, condemned what he called a ""very, very small group of people"" that caused problems in that demonstration but said he was proud of the thousands more that peacefully protested.

""I actually thought it was a beautiful expression of democracy. I think it was a marvelous thing to see the next generation of this country get engaged and involved,"" he said at a news conference, adding that at one time in his life he might have joined them.

President-elect Trump reacted for the first time to the protests on Thursday.

“Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!""

As expected, the demonstrations prompted some social media blowback from Trump supporters accusing protesters of sour grapes or worse, though there were no significant counter-protests.

Trump supporters said the protesters were not respecting the democratic process.

343,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/18/alabama-senator-sessions-offered-attorney-general-post-in-trump-administration.html,2,"President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced his first two Cabinet picks: Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo as CIA director.

Trump also confirmed that he called on retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn to be his national security adviser.

Sessions, Pompeo and Flynn have all been outspoken critics of President Obama and how his administration has handled terrorism and national security.

In picking Sessions and Flynn, Trump is rewarding two loyalists who were among his most ardent supporters during the presidential campaign.

Trump praised all three men in a lengthy written statement, calling Sessions “a world-class legal mind” who is “greatly admired by legal scholars and virtually everyone who knows him.”

Sessions, who accepted Trump’s offer and awaits confirmation hearings by the Senate, said he looks forward to fulfilling his duties “with an unwavering dedication to fairness and impartiality.”

Trump said Pompeo “will be a brilliant and unrelenting leader for our intelligence community to ensure the safety of Americans and our allies.”

He said Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, “will be by my side as we work to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, navigate geopolitical challenges and keep Americans safe at home and abroad.”

Trump is a foreign policy novice, and his early moves on national security are being closely watched both domestically and globally.

Like Sessions, Pompeo will need to be confirmed by the Senate before assuming the role. Flynn does not require confirmation.

Even though Republicans control the Senate, Sessions could face obstacles with his confirmation.

He withdrew from consideration for a federal judgeship in 1986 after being accused of making racist comments while serving as a U.S. attorney in Alabama.

Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump, has been a leading proponent of tough immigration enforcement policies. He's tangled with the past two Democratic-appointed attorneys general on whether terrorism suspects deserve the protections of American civilian courts and on the planned closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. He's also been protective of the attorney general's right to refuse a legally unsound directive from the president.

Pompeo is a conservative Republican and a strong critic of Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. A three-term congressman, he graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point and from Harvard Law School.

Pompeo has said that Muslim leaders are ""potentially complicit"" in terrorist attacks if they do not denounce those made in the name of Islam.

""They must cite the Koran as evidence that the murder of innocents is not permitted,"" he said in a 2013 House floor speech.

Flynn was a critic of Obama's military and foreign policy long before he began advising Trump on national security issues during the presidential campaign. As national security adviser, Flynn would work in the West Wing and have frequent access to Trump.

The 57-year-old has been outspoken in his warnings about the dangers of Islamist groups, saying the U.S. needs to ""discredit"" radical Islam. He's called Islam a ""political ideology"" and said it ""definitely hides behind being a religion.""

Flynn has also worried some national security experts with his warmth toward Russia. Like Trump, he's called for the U.S. to work more closely with Moscow.

Last year, Flynn traveled to Moscow to join Russian President Vladimir Putin at a celebration for RT, a television channel funded by the Russian government. Flynn said he had been paid for taking part in the event, but brushed aside concerns that he was aiding a Russian propaganda effort.

Trump has made no public appearances this week, but his meetings have signaled a focus on national security. He met Thursday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader since winning the election Nov. 8.

He also consulted with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and sat down with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a potential contender to lead the State Department.

In a separate gesture of reconciliation with establishment Republicans, Trump plans to meet on Saturday with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who lambasted Trump as a ""con man"" and a ""fraud"" in a stinging speech in March. Trump responded by repeatedly referring to Romney as a ""loser.""

The two began mending fences after Trump's victory when Romney called to offer congratulations. They are to meet this weekend, a transition official says. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said they are still ""working on"" the meeting.

Since his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump has spoken with Putin, British Prime Minister Theresa May and nearly three dozen other world leaders by telephone.

Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to the United States, also visited Trump Tower and called the billionaire businessman ""a true friend of Israel."" He specifically cited as another ""friend"" Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon, whose selection as a top White House adviser has created a backlash among Democrats. Breitbart, the news website Bannon ran before joining the Trump campaign, has been accused by Democrats of peddling conspiracy theories, white nationalism and anti-Semitism.

Trump, a reality television star, business mogul and political newcomer, also rolled out new teams that will interact with the State Department, Pentagon, Justice Department and other national security agencies as part of the government transition before his Jan. 20 inauguration.

344,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/05/how-internet-conspiracy-theory-led-gunman-into-dc-pizza-parlor.html,2,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman may have lost his handkerchief on Martha’s Vineyard one day in September 2014 – and two years later that incident has spawned a convoluted conspiracy theory involving a supposed pedophilia ring run out of a Washington, D.C., pizza joint.

How we got from John Podesta’s hankie to claims of a child sex ring – and an armed man arrested Sunday at the pizza parlor attempting to “investigate” the claims – is a disjointed tale that reveals how a toxic Internet story is born, fed and spread without evidence.

Edgar Maddison Welch, a 28-year-old North Carolina man, was arrested Sunday afternoon on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon, after police say he fired his rifle into the floor of the pizza place. No one was hurt, but the incident sent customers running. Welch, who told authorities he went to the establishment to “self-investigate” the sex ring claims, allegedly was spotted looking for rumored tunnels filled with hidden children, a nearby store owner told The Washington Post.

MAN WITH RIFLE ARRESTED AT DC EATERY

Welch apparently was searching for proof of the so-called “#pizzagate” plot, initially advanced by users on 4Chan and Reddit on Nov. 4, citing seemingly innocuous details from Podesta’s hacked emails as evidence of a child sex operation.

The author of one popular blog that gathered many of the details pointed, for instance, to the 2014 email to Podesta about a supposedly missing handkerchief. The blog claimed the description of the cloth as “white w/ black” correlated to a “handkerchief code” indicating leanings toward “S&M” and “Virginity/Pedo.”

The handkerchief was described in the email as “having a map that seems pizza-related.” Podesta referred often in his emails to pizza – a popular dish for anybody, never mind hungry and overworked campaign staffers. But the numerous mentions merited a deeper look for some. And that brought them to the pizzeria that Welch walked into on Sunday: Comet Ping Pong.

Comet Ping Pong has been a popular eatery for a decade. Its walls are painted with trendy murals and its owner, James Alefantis, was ranked No. 49 in GQ’s 2012 edition of the 50 most powerful people in Washington.

But to posters on 4Chan and Reddit, the murals contained disguised symbols of pedophilia. It was even posited that Comet Ping Pong’s logo had Satanic connections. Alefantis’ personal social media postings, which contained popular memes and pictures of family and friends, were dissected for alleged links to the sex scheme. This included an Instagram image of a girl with her arms stuck with masking tape to a table, with a comment joking about it being a “procedure for your youngest guests.” His fundraising links to key Democratic figures – including Podesta – were also cited as proof.

Alefantis was a sender or recipient of about 20 of the more than 50,000 leaked Podesta emails, with messages dating between 2008 and 2016. In one October 2008 email, Alefantis wrote to Podesta following a fundraiser: ""Raised over 40 grand. My only regret is I did not make you a nice pizza. When can I?""

The conspiracy theorists claim ""pizza"" is a euphemism.

As far-fetched as ""#pizzagate"" is, Bill Clinton's past helped fuel the theorists. The former president – aside from having acknowledged extra-marital encounters and having been accused of sexual assault by several women, which he denies – flew several times on the private jet of Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier who was convicted in 2008 of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. For some Redditers, it was a simple act of connecting some very, very distant dots to get from there to Comet Ping Pong.

But even after the election, the controversy refused to die down. Questions about “#pizzagate” persisted on Twitter and Facebook. Believers journeyed to the pizza place, posing questions to Alefantis and streaming Facebook Live videos. Finally, an armed man arrived.

Though the “#pizzagate” conspiracy was widely shared by far-rightwing elements on the Internet who supported Donald Trump and distrusted Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the election, it was also spread by others. The author of the popular blog about “#pizzagate” is a self-proclaimed supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who claimed to vote for a third party on Election Day.

The son of incoming National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, also named Michael Flynn, tweeted about Welch’s arrest on Sunday night: “Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it’ll remain a story. The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many ‘coincidences’ tied to it.”"
345,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/21/4-cops-shot-in-3-states-during-bloody-sunday-for-police-nationwide.html,2,"The man suspected of executing a San Antonio police officer late Sunday morning staked out police headquarters just hours before the shooting and briefly gained access to a vestibule of the building before quickly leaving, officials said.

An extensive police dragnet had failed Monday to catch the unnamed suspect in the ambush killing of Detective Benjamin Marconi, 50, a 20-year veteran. Marconi was the first of four police officers in three states shot during a seemingly unconnected Sunday spree.

Three of the incidents appeared to be targeted attacks and involved law enforcement officers sitting unsuspectingly in their patrol cars, either waiting in traffic or after pulling vehicles over for traffic stops.

""I think the uniform was the target and the first person who happened along was the person he targeted,"" San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said on Monday of the Texas case.

A GLANCE AT POLICE AMBUSH KILLINGS IN THE US

Police in that investigation are searching for a 2009-2012 black Mitsubishi Galant with black rims that was believed to be driven by the suspected gunman.

Earlier Monday, San Antonio authorities released video surveillance footage showing the man outside police headquarters. He is seen speaking to a clerk on an intercom before being let in to a vestibule. But the man only stayed a short time before leaving. McManus wouldn't detail what the suspect said, only that he asked a question.

""I don’t know why he was in headquarters,"" McManus said. ""We have some ideas why we believe he may have been in headquarters, but we're not sure.""

Four hours later, the man is suspected of killing Marconi as Marconi sat in his patrol car across from police headquarters writing a traffic ticket at 11:45 a.m. local time.

While Marconi was in the squad car, a vehicle thought to be driven by the suspect pulled up behind him. A man got out and shot Marconi twice in the head. The final shot was fired as the assailant reached inside Marconi’s passenger window to shoot the father of two at close range.

McManus said dashcam footage of the incident existed, but he wouldn't say what was on the video.

Authorities had yet to identify a motive in the apparent ambush, which was only the first in a bloody day for police.

A St. Louis police sergeant was shot twice in the face at 7:30 p.m. Sunday night, but was expected to survive and was hospitalized in critical condition. The 46-year-old officer, who was not named, is a married father of three and, like Marconi, a 20-year veteran of the force.

“This officer was driving down the road and was ambushed by an individual who pointed a gun at him from inside of his car and shot out the police officer’s window,” Police Chief Sam Dotson said.

The gunman was later killed after he shot at other officers who returned fire. No officers were injured during that encounter.

An officer in Sanibel, Fla., was shot and injured during a similar incident when a person fired at the officer as he sat in his patrol car after finishing a traffic stop just before 8 p.m., The News-Press reported. Other officers fired back at the suspect, who was eventually taken into custody.

An officer in Gladstone, Mo., sustained non-life-threatening injuries during a struggle with a man in his late teens who had fled from a traffic stop, FOXC4KC reported. During the tussle, authorities said the man revealed a handgun, shots were fired and the teen was killed.

The shootings came less than five months after a gunman killed five officers in Dallas who were working a protest about the fatal police shootings of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana. It was the deadliest day for American law enforcement since Sept. 11, 2001.

Ten days after the Dallas attack, a man wearing a ski mask and armed with two rifles and a pistol killed three officers near a gas station and convenience store in Baton Rouge, La. And earlier this month, two Des Moines, Iowa-area police officers were fatally shot in separate ambush-style attacks while sitting in their patrol cars.

In 2016, 56 state, county and local officers have been shot while on duty.

346,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/29/trump-to-nominate-steven-mnuchin-for-treasury-secretary-sources-say.html,2,"President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday formally nominated former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin to be his Treasury secretary.

Mnuchin had long been considered a favorite for the Treasury position. Sources told Fox News on Tuesday that Mnuchin would be nominated. Two weeks ago, businessman and close Trump associate Carl Icahn tweeted that Trump was considering Mnuchin for the post.

The 53-year-old Mnuchin was in May appointed Trump's campaign finance chairman. Through his work, Mnuchin grew close to Trump's children and son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- a top adviser to Trump -- and worked with them on fundraising events.



The campaign raised at least $169 million, in addition to the $66 million Trump spent out of his own pocket. Though that was far short of what Hillary Clinton raised, it represented an impressive haul given that Trump didn't begin fundraising in earnest until the end of May.

If approved by the Senate, Mnuchin would follow in the tradition of two previous treasury secretaries -- Robert Rubin in the Clinton administration and Henry Paulson in George W. Bush's. All had vast Wall Street experience gained from years spent working at Goldman Sachs.



Yet unlike Rubin and Paulson and unlike President Obama's two treasury secretaries, Timothy Geithner and Jacob Lew, Mnuchin would bring no government experience to Treasury, something that could prove a hurdle in navigating the tricky politics of Washington.



After graduating from Yale in 1985. Mnuchin worked for Goldman Sachs for 17 years. His father, Robert Mnuchin, had himself worked for Goldman for three decades, becoming a partner in charge of equity trading.



The younger Mnuchin amassed his own fortune at the firm and then left in 2002. He worked briefly for Soros Fund Management, a hedge fund led by George Soros, before starting his own investment firm, Dune Capital Management.



As head of this firm, Mnuchin and other investors participated in the purchase of failed mortgage lender IndyMac in 2009 and renamed it OneWest. The failure of IndyMac in 2008 with $32 billion in assets was one of the biggest casualties of the housing bust.



Mnuchin became chairman of OneWest, which was sold to CIT Group in 2015. Before the sale, OneWest faced a string of lawsuits over its home foreclosure practices.



This month, housing advocates filed a complaint asking the Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate OneWest for possible violations of the Fair Housing Act. The lender failed to place branches in minority communities, provided few mortgages to black homebuyers and preserved foreclosed properties in white neighborhoods while allowing similar homes in minority communities to fall into disrepair, according to the California Reinvestment Coalition and Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California.



CIT declined to respond directly to the complaint but stressed in a statement that it is ""committed to fair lending and works hard to meet the credit needs of all communities and neighborhoods we serve.""



Mnuchin also became a major investor in Hollywood, helping finance a number of movies, including the 2009 blockbuster ""Avatar.""



As treasury secretary, Mnuchin would be the administration's chief economic spokesman, serving as a liaison not only to Wall Street but also to global investors, a critical role given the trillions of dollars in treasury bonds owned by foreigners. In addition, it would be his job to sell the new administration's economic program to Congress.



Mnuchin will also oversee a sprawling bureaucracy that includes the Internal Revenue Service and the agency that issues millions of Social Security and other benefit checks each month. Treasury also runs the agency that wages the financial war on terrorism.

Earlier Tuesday, Trump officially nominated Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., as Health and Human Services Secretary and tapped Elaine Chao, former President George W. Bush's Labor Secretary, to be secretary of transportation.

Price, a former surgeon, supports the repeal of ObamaCare and has offered a replacement that would provide tax credits to subsidize the purchase of individual and family health insurance policies. His proposal would also allow insurers to sell policies across state line, boost incentives for health savings accounts, and create high-risk pools to help individuals afford coverage, while barring assistance for nearly all abortions.

Price has emerged as a top advocate of House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to transform Medicare from a program that supplies a defined set of benefits into a ""premium support"" model that would, similar to Obamacare, offer subsidies for participants to purchase health care directly from insurance companies. He also wants the Medicare eligibility age to rise to 67.

Price also backs, as does Trump, a plan by House Republicans to sharply cut the Medicaid health program for the poor and disabled and turn it over to the states to run. Like Trump and most other Republicans, Price wants federal funding withdrawn from Planned Parenthood, which has come under attack for its practice of supplying tissue from aborted fetuses to medical researchers.

If confirmed as Transportation Secretary, Chao would face many pressing issues, such as how to boost the nation's aging infrastructure so that it can accommodate population growth and not become a drag on the economy, modernizing the nation's air traffic control system, ensuring that new transportation technologies are adopted in a safe manner and responding to a surge in traffic fatalities.

After serving in the Bush administration, Chao served on the board of directors for Bloomberg Philanthropies, run by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. She resigned last year after learning the organization planned to expand an environmental initiative to shutter coal-fired power plants.

Almost 90 percent of Kentucky's electricity comes from coal, and Chao's ties to the organization were used against her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, during his 2014 re-election campaign.

347,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/30/trump-effect-after-carrier-pledge-to-keep-jobs-in-us-more-companies-may-follow.html,2,"President-elect Donald Trump didn't wait to be sworn in to stop an air conditioner manufacturer from pulling out of America, and his top aides say he'll turn up the heat on other companies planning to send jobs outside the U.S.



Carrier's announcement Tuesday that, after negotiations with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, it is reversing plans to close an Indiana factory shows the ""Trump effect"" is real, according to his backers. They say Trump can stop America from bleeding manufacturing jobs to Mexico, China and other places where labor is cheaper, taxes are lower and regulations are lax.

""So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this,"" Trump said. ""We have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States.""

The air conditioning company will keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indianapolis after telling workers earlier in the year that it would be closing its plant and moving production to Mexico at the cost of 1,400 jobs.

Video of company officials telling workers about the move to Mexico in February surfaced online and became a high-profile example for Trump of manufacturing jobs being shipped abroad to Mexico due to what he called bad trade deals that hurt American workers. In a presidential debate against Hillary Clinton in September, he blasted Carrier’s decision and pledged to do something about it if elected.

A Trump transition source told Fox News that Carrier executives went to Trump Tower on Tuesday to work out the deal, after Trump had tweeted on Thanksgiving Day that he was working on a deal with the company.

Trump and Pence, Indiana's outgoing governor, will travel to the state Thursday to formally announce the agreement alongside company officials.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Pence had taken the lead in negotiating with parent company United Technologies officials, and had discussed priorities for the upcoming Republican Congress, including a tax reform package that could benefit manufacturers.

CNBC, which first broke the news, reported the company decided the savings that would result from moving to Mexico was not worth the fallout of incurring the wrath of the new administration, including the threat to the business it currently does with the government, such as orders for defense equipment.

Carrier workers reacted with delight at the news.

“I would like to tell [Trump] 'Thank you for going out of your way and taking your holiday away from your family and working on Carrier employees and sticking to your word and going to bat for all of us and keeping our jobs here,'” Robin Maynard, a Carrier employee for 24 years, told ""Fox & Friends"" Wednesday.

Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller said the move showed the power of an administration focused on jobs.

“This is the power of the presidency, this is the power of a team coming in that is so focused on our economy and helping to create and save American jobs, to protect American jobs that are here, this saves 1,000 jobs, this is huge,” Miller told Fox News Channel.

He also hinted that there could be a number of similar announcements in the pipeline.

“It’s not just here with Carrier, we’re going to see some future announcements as well, with some other companies that are already working behind the scenes,” he said. “This is fundamentally going to help our manufacturing industry and so many other industries.”

The Carrier announcement comes after Ford Chairman Bill Ford told Trump earlier this month that the automaker will not be moving production of Lincolns out of Kentucky to Mexico, in what is seen as a sign that the company aims to work with the new administration on keeping jobs in America.

Trump made keeping jobs from being shipped abroad a cornerstone of his campaign, and his focus on manufacturing jobs and trade is seen as being a key factor in his victory in states such as Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Trump, in an interview with The New York Times last week, said he has spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cook about building a new plant in the U.S. instead of in places such as Vietnam or China. He said in the same interview he had also received a call from Microsoft CEO Bill Gates but did not go into detail about what was discussed.

Steven Mnuchin, Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary, also hinted at more deals coming down the line, telling CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Wednesday that Trump and his administration are ""going to have open communications with business leaders.""

A recent incident involving a gunman who fired multiple shots inside a Washington pizza shop has become a target of a fake conspiracy story.

Clinton addressed the issue saying it’s ""not about politics or partisanship. Lives are at risk. Lives of ordinary people just trying to go about their days to do their jobs, contribute to their communities.""

Trump said in his statement that he was “thrilled to nominate Carson,” adding that he “has a brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communiuties.”

Carson had recently downplayed having any role in the Trump administration, saying that he didn’t know where he would fit. But in a statement on Monday, the retired pediatric neurosurgeon said he felt he could ""make a significant contribution particularly by strengthening communities that are most in need.""

""We have much work to do in enhancing every aspect of our nation and ensuring that our nation’s housing needs are met,"" he said. Carson also tweeted that he would accept the position.

TRUMP EXPANDS SECRETARY OF STATE SEARCH; MORE INTERVIEWS THIS WEEK

Carson, who had previously been rumored to be a contender for a job heading Veteran’s Affairs, Education or Health and Human Services, could appear at first glance as an odd choice for HUD. However, Carson wrote and spoke about the department and issues affected by its actions numerous times during his time as a primary candidate, and he also addressed some of what may soon face him in a Facebook post last month that hinted at a HUD job offer from Trump.

“After serious discussions with the Trump transition team, I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone,” Carson wrote. “We have much work to do in strengthening every aspect of our nation and ensuring that both our physical infrastructure and our spiritual infrastructure is solid. An announcement is forthcoming about my role in helping to make America great again.”

He also told Fox News Channel’s “Your World with Neil Cavuto” in an interview last month that the HUD position was ""one of the offers [from Trump] that is on the table.""

""Our inner cities are in terrible shape,"" Carson said. ""And they definitely need some real attention. There have been so many promises made over the last several decades and nothing has been done, so it certainly is something that has been a long-term interest of mine.""

TRUMP SAYS HE'LL NOMINATE RETIRED MARINE GEN. MATTIS AS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Carson ran against Trump during the Republican primary battle. But after he dropped out of the White House race in March, the subdued doctor quickly endorsed the boisterous businessman and became one of Trump’s most visible surrogates.

Caron's position in the cabinet requires Senate confirmation before it becomes official.

Carson has often recounted his childhood as the son of a single mother in inner-city Detroit in his books and motivational speeches. In his 1996 autobiography ""Gifted Hands,"" Carson wrote of the humiliation he felt using food stamps from his mom to pay for bread and milk, and said how he began to excel at school only after receiving a free pair of glasses that allowed him to see the lessons written on chalk boards.

Carson has not said whether his family ever lived in federally-funded housing or received Section 8 subsidies to help pay rent, but as a political figure he has criticized such public assistance programs for creating ""dependency"" on the government among low-income minorities.

""I'm interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society, and as more and more people hear that message, they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes,"" Carson said in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2015.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the U.S. intelligence community, has not fully embraced the CIA finding.

Fox News is told that several U.S. election-related hacking incidents are being wrongly lumped together, when they should be treated as separate events -- these cover breaches at the Democratic National Committee and another campaign arm; in a top Hillary Clinton campaign official’s email account; and at state election boards.

Reuters reports that while the ODNI does not dispute the CIA’s general analysis on Russia hacking, the office is not convinced of the evidence that Moscow sought specifically to help Trump defeat Democratic opponent Clinton.

U.S. intelligence agencies at odds over #Russia hack assessment—a look at Russian intervention in the 2016 election pic.twitter.com/J65rCkuun9 — Fox News Research (@FoxNewsResearch) December 13, 2016

The government source told Fox News the discrepancy comes down to Russia’s intent.

One official also told Reuters that the CIA’s judgment was based on the fact that only Democratic information was leaked. The official called this a “thin reed upon which to base an analytical judgment.”

The developments further underscore how U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies may be at odds over an assessment that has fueled Democratic complaints and questions about the race -- and spurred bipartisan calls for deeper congressional investigation.

The Clinton campaign chairman who was hacked, John Podesta, even backed calls for electors -- who are set to formally choose the president next week, based on the results of the Nov. 8 election -- to get an intelligence briefing on Russian interference in the race.

Trump, though, has pushed back hard at the reported assessment, calling it “ridiculous” in an interview with “Fox News Sunday.”

Potential space between the CIA and the ODNI on the matter was first revealed in a letter Monday from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. The letter, obtained by Fox News, noted that the CIA finding conflicts with Clapper’s mid-November public testimony.

""On November 17, 2016, you told the Committee during an open hearing that the IC (Intelligence Community) lacked strong evidence connecting Russian government cyberattacks and WikiLeaks disclosures,” Nunes wrote.

In response to a question at the time from ranking Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, Clapper had said, “As far as the WikiLeaks connection, the evidence there is not as strong and we don't have good insight into the sequencing of the releases or when the data may have been provided. We don't have as good insight into that.”

The Nunes letter continued, “According to new press reports, this is no longer the CIA’s position … I was dismayed that we did not learn earlier, from you directly about the reported conflicting assessments and the CIA’s reported revision of information previously conveyed to this Committee.”

Nunes is requesting a briefing from the CIA and FBI on the current assessment of alleged Russian involvement related to the U.S. election no later than Dec. 16.

The Washington Post first reported Friday that the CIA concluded in a secret assessment that Russia interfered in the race to boost Trump, not just undermine confidence in the system. Intelligence agencies reportedly found individuals connected to the Russian government gave WikiLeaks hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee, as well as from Podesta – though the agencies did not have “specific intelligence” showing Kremlin officials directed the activity.

The Post reported, however, that the FBI also gave a differing account on potential Russian interference.

The Post reported Tuesday that the CIA assessment was based in part on intelligence indicating Moscow’s hacking disproportionately affected Democratic targets.

This also includes: Hope Hicks as director of strategic communications; Jason Miller as director of communications; and Dan Scavino as director of social media.

“Sean, Hope, Jason and Dan have been key members of my team during the campaign and transition. I am excited they will be leading the team that will communicate my agenda that will Make America Great Again,” Trump said in a statement.

Spicer was thought to have the inside track for the job, in part because of his ties to incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who currently runs the Republican National Committee.

Spicer worked alongside Priebus throughout the 2016 campaign as chief strategist and communications director at the RNC.

After the news was announced, Spicer thanked the incoming president for the “amazing honor.”

352,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/13/why-rex-tillerson-would-be-disaster-as-secretary-state.html,0,"On Tuesday morning, after a weekend of anonymously-sourced winks and nudges, President-elect Trump formally announced that he will nominate ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be the next Secretary of State.

Tillerson’s nomination would be a disaster.

He is a CEO, not an experienced diplomat. Moreover, he is simply too close to Russia and Vladimir Putin to be an effective or credible advocate for American interests around the world.

Tillerson has direct economic interests in Russia having cut multi-billion dollar deals with Putin himself as well as Kremlin confidant Igor Sechin, the head of Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft. When Sechin isn’t palling around with Tillerson, he keeps busy selling nuclear capabilities to Venezuela or negotiating oil deals with Cuba. Tillerson doesn’t seem to mind, and even appeared with Sechin after he had been formally sanctioned by the United States.

We cannot allow the State Department to be led by a friend and ally of Vladimir Putin and continue the disastrous diplomacy of negotiation and appeasement that has handed Putin his greatest victories.

Tillerson’s loyalty to Russia has not gone unnoticed, and Putin personally awarded him Russia’s “Order of Friendship” in 2013.

Since then, Putin has invaded Ukraine, murdered 298 civilians on Malaysian Airlines Flight 17, and directed the Russian Air Force to attack aid convoys and hospitals in Syria. Yet Tillerson has remained a staunch and vocal opponent of sanctions against Russia, even as Putin’s body count continues to climb.

This hasn’t gone unnoticed.

Senator John McCain has called Tillerson’s “friendship award from a butcher […] an issue that I think needs to be examined.” Marco Rubio has expressed “serious concerns about his nomination,” since “the next Secretary of State must be someone who views the world with moral clarity.”

And it’s not as if Tillerson would be the first Putin pal in Trump’s cabinet.

Michael Flynn, Trump’s choice for National Security Advisor, has been honored by Russian state propaganda network RT, sitting at Putin’s right hand during the awards dinner. Just as Tillerson has opposed sanctions against Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, so too has Flynn urged that America “move forward” from Putin’s bloody interventions in Ukraine and Syria.

Together, Tillerson and Flynn are a dangerous pro-Putin combination that threatens to undermine American values, allies, and interests around the world.

Neither Tillerson nor Flynn are likely to take the urgent action needed to successfully deal with the Russians, or apply the pressure that will get Putin to back down. They will not strengthen NATO, finish the missile shield in Europe, arm Ukraine, or aggressively disrupt Putin’s relentless cyberwarfare and propaganda operations.

Indeed, we agree with the bipartisan group of senators calling for a full investigation of Russian hacking and election meddling.

To Rex Tillerson, we say: keep your day job. To Michael Flynn, we say: seek new employment, as your son is now doing.

There are perfectly good candidates for Secretary of State who share our worldview and would perform admirably, such as Mitt Romney and John Bolton.

We don’t need a National Security Advisor or a Secretary of State who believes that we just need to negotiate better with Vladimir Putin.

That’s the same trap that snared George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and enabled Putin’s decade of aggression. We need a National Security Advisor and a Secretary of State who see Russia as among the greatest, if not the greatest threat, our country faces.

We cannot allow the State Department to be led by a friend and ally of Vladimir Putin and continue the disastrous diplomacy of negotiation and appeasement that has handed Putin his greatest victories.

America needs a Secretary of State who will stand up to Putin. Rex Tillerson is not the man for the job."
353,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/20/german-police-call-christmas-market-crash-intentional-suspected-terror-attack.html,2,"The manhunt for the perpetrator of an Islamic State-claimed attack on a Christmas market in Berlin continued Tuesday as German police said ""we may still have a dangerous criminal out there.""

Peter Frank, the country’s top prosecutor, said investigators are treating Monday's attack on the market outside Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church as an act of terrorism. At least 12 people were killed and more than 50 were injured after a truck plowed through a crowd at the market.



ISIS -- through its media arm on Tuesday -- claimed responsibility for the massacre and called the attacker ""a soldier of the Islamic State,"" a typical phrase used by the group when an assailant has been inspired but not directed.



A man who was previously in custody -- identified as a Pakistani citizen who came to Germany last year, had been picked up based on a description of a man who jumped out of the truck and fled after the attack.

But federal prosecutors said late Tuesday that he denied any involvement and they had found no forensic evidence proving he was in the cab during the rampage. Additionally, no witnesses had followed him from the scene to the spot where he was picked up.

Police sources told the country's Die Welt newspaper that they had the “wrong man” and that the true perpetrator “is still armed, at large and can cause fresh damage.”

""We may still have a dangerous criminal out there,"" Berlin police chief Klaus Kandt said.

Holger Muench, head of Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office, said they have not yet found a pistol believed to be used to kill the truck’s passenger, who was identified by police as 37-year-old Lukasz Urban.

One of his colleagues said he was so dedicated to his work and his truck that he could be expected to defend the vehicle ""to the end.""

Ariel Zurawski, the owner of the trucking company and the victim's cousin, was asked by German authorities to identify Urban from photos.

""It was really clear that he was fighting for his life. His face was swollen and bloodied. Police informed me that he had suffered gunshot wounds. Despite being stabbed he was shot dead,"" Zurawski told Polish media.

Frank said the method used in the rampage was reminiscent of July’s truck attack in Nice, France, and of the new “modius operandi” used my Islamic extremist groups.

For those reasons, he said, we are ""naturally on high alert and are investigating in all directions.""

Six out of the 12 people killed have been identified and are all Germans, but he does not yet know whether the other six are as well, Muench added.

Berlin police urged people to remain ""particularly vigilant"" and to report ""suspicious movement"" to a special hotline.

COLONGE INCREASES POLICE PRESENCE, CLEARS JAIL CELLS FOR NYE CELEBRATION

Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere -- Germany's top security official -- said Tuesday that authorities have ""no doubt"" that the attack was intentional.

The truck struck a popular Christmas market packed with holiday shoppers outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial late Monday as tourists and locals were enjoying a traditional pre-Christmas evening out near Berlin’s Zoo station.

""All police measures concerning the suspected terror attack at Breitscheidplatz are being taken with great speed and the necessary care,"" Berlin police said on Twitter.

TRUMP PINS KILLINGS IN GERMANY, RUSSIA ON RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM

The crash came less than a month after the U.S. State Department called for caution in markets and other public places across Europe, saying extremist groups including Islamic State and Al Qaeda were focusing ""on the upcoming holiday season and associated events.""

The Islamic State and Al Qaeda have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack crowds. On July 14, a truck plowed into Bastille Day revelers in the southern French city of Nice, killing 86 people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France. No group had claimed responsibility for the Berlin attack as of early Tuesday.

The revelations about the attacker's identity are likely to heap more pressure onto German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose decision to accept waves of migrants from Africa and the Middle East has stoked controversy and unsettled Germany and Europe.

In Tuesday press conference, Merkel said she is “shocked, shaken and deeply saddened” by the attack. She had told reporters that it would be “particularly sickening” if it’s confirmed the attack was an asylum-seeker who sought refuge in Germany.

Zurawski said he last spoke with the driver around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. ""They must have done something to my driver,"" he told TVN24.

For several hours, the truck was started and stopped as if the driver was learning how to use the vehicle and finally pulled away at around 7:14 p.m. local time. By about 8:14 p.m., the truck had plowed into a group of people as it headed the wrong way on a street and then onto a sidewalk.

Federal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, took over the investigation, according to German Justice Minister Heiko Maas. In Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the United States was in contact with German officials and ready to help in the investigation and response.

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump blamed Islamist terrorists, though it was unclear what that assessment was based on. He said Islamic extremists must be ""eradicated from the face of the earth"" and pledged to carry out that mission with all ""freedom-loving partners.""

Germany has not experienced any mass-casualty attacks by Islamic extremists, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by ISIS. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach, both in the southern state of Bavaria. Both attackers were killed.

Those attacks, and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, helped stoke tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants.

RNC Chairman Reince Priebus released a three-paragraph statement on the holiday, but it was the first paragraph that drew critics’ attention.

“Over two millennia ago, a new hope was born into the world, a Savior who would offer the promise of salvation to all mankind. Just as the three wise men did on that night, this Christmas heralds a time to celebrate the good news of a new King.""

The message kicked off a heated debate on social media over whether the reference to a “new King” was about President-elect Donald Trump.

John Weaver, a top aide to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, was among those who tweeted their displeasure with the statement.

Spicer later said that it was “sad & disappointing you are politicizing such a holy day.”

The statement also asked Americans to keep military members in their thoughts and prayers and to “rise to meet the material, emotional, and spiritual needs of individuals all around us.”

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and other top intelligence officials visited the White House Thursday afternoon, to brief the president on the materials.

President-elect Donald Trump is to be briefed on the report on Friday.

Clapper also testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that they plan to brief Congress and release an unclassified version of the report to the public “early next week.”

In its earlier assessment, the intelligence community said Moscow interfered in the election to help Trump win.

""We stand actually more resolutely on the strength of that statement than we did on the 7th of October,"" Clapper said.

The administration’s allegations of Russia-directed hacking of Democratic organizations during the 2016 U.S. elections – and punitive measures taken against Russian officials and agencies last week – continue to drive fierce debate in Washington, especially among Republicans.

Trump and his allies have cast doubt on the claims. The latest detail to raise questions is confirmation from the Democratic National Committee that the FBI did not examine their servers.

A spokesman confirmed to Fox News that “the FBI never requested access to the DNC's computer servers,” though the DNC had several meetings with FBI and other officials during the investigation. BuzzFeed first reported the FBI did not inspect the servers before issuing their report.

That 13-page report, issued with the Department of Homeland Security, also has faced some scrutiny for being light on hard evidence confirming Russian government involvement.

The report sent to Obama – and soon to be shared with Trump and others – could offer more.

Trump tweeted earlier this week that it was “very strange” his briefing on Russia hacking will not be held until Friday. He speculated, “perhaps more time needed to build a case.” Intelligence officials said there had been no delay.

Trump also has drawn attention to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s recent interview on Fox News’ “Hannity” in which Assange insisted the Russians were not his source for thousands of hacked emails from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.

Some Republicans, though, have made clear they harbor few doubts about Russia’s cyber-meddling -- and do not see Assange as a reliable source.

Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., said at Thursday’s hearing that he believes Assange is responsible for publishing names of individuals who work with the U.S. government and putting them at risk.

Clapper said, “Yes, he has,” adding that he does not find Assange to be credible.

McCain also said Thursday that ""every American should be alarmed"" by Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

There is ""no escaping the fact that this committee meets today for the first time in this new Congress in the aftermath of an unprecedented attack on our democracy,"" he said.

In prepared testimony Thursday, intelligence officials said Russia poses a major and growing threat to U.S. government, military, diplomatic and commercial operations -- as well as America's critical infrastructure. Russia is among at least 30 nations that are developing capabilities to launch cyberattacks, according to their statement. Clapper on Thursday stood by claims that the Russian government was involved in the 2016 hacking.

In new tweets early Thursday, Trump backed away from Assange somewhat. He blamed the ""dishonest media"" for portraying him as agreeing with Assange.

Accusations Russia interfered in the 2016 election by hacking Democratic email accounts have roiled Washington for weeks. Obama struck back at Moscow in late December with penalties aimed at Russia's leading spy agencies, the GRU and FSB, that the U.S. said were involved. The GRU is Russia's military intelligence agency. The FSB is the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB.

But Trump easily could rescind the sanctions. So far, he has publicly refused to accept the conclusion that Russia is responsible for the attacks. Trump suggested Wednesday in a tweet that one of Russia's primary targets, the Democratic National Committee, could be to blame for being ""so careless.""

CIA Director John Brennan said in a Dec. 16 message to employees that the FBI agreed with the agency's conclusion that Russia's goal was to support Trump in the election. Brennan wrote that he also had spoken with Clapper and said ""there is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election.""

Moscow has denied the hacking allegations and dismissed Obama's sanctions as an attempt to ""harm Russian-American ties."" Although Russian President Vladimir Putin rebuked the Obama administration for trying to punish Russia, he said his country would not immediately retaliate and would instead wait for a new U.S. approach after Trump takes office.

356,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/24/after-un-veto-kerry-suggests-israels-west-bank-foray-spawning-terrorism.html,2,"Secretary of State John Kerry is defending the Obama administration’s decision to effectively allow the United Nations to condemn Israel for attempting to build more settlements in the disputed West Bank, saying the “unprecedented” effort has spawned terrorism and violence that jeopardizes lasting peace in the region.

The United States on Friday abstained from a U.N. Security Council vote to adopt a resolution condemning Israel’s settlement expansion, which allowed for the measure’s passage and resulted in the disapproval of incoming Republican President Donald Trump.

“Things will be different after Jan. 20,” Trump tweeted minutes after the vote.

Kerry said Israel’s continued and stepped-up attempts to build more settlements, or communities, in the region, which includes East Jerusalem, risks the so-called “two-state” solution between Israelis and the Palestinians, who also lay claim to the region.

“The United States acted with one primary objective in mind: to preserve the possibility of the two state solution, which every U.S. administration for decades has agreed is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians,"" Kerry said Friday. “Two states is the only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state, living in peace and security with its neighbors, and freedom and dignity for the Palestinian people.”

He also said the administration does not agree with “every aspect” of the resolution but that it “rightly condemns violence” and calls on both sides to take constructive steps to reverse current trends and advance the prospects for a two-state solution.

The resolution was put forward by four nations a day after Egypt withdrew it Thursday under pressure from Israel and Trump.

The U.S. not vetoing the measure is being considered a snub to the country’s key Middle East ally and attributed to outgoing Democratic President Obama, who has had chilly relations with Israel throughout his eight-year tenure.

Reaction from U.S. Republicans and Jewish leaders around the world was swift and sharp.

""It was to be expected that Israel's greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we share and that they would have vetoed this disgraceful resolution,"" said Israel's Ambassador Danny Danon. ""I have no doubt that the new U.S. administration and the incoming UN Secretary General will usher in a new era in terms of the UN's relationship with Israel.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., blasted the administration for appearing to undermine America's historic Middle East ally.

""This is absolutely shameful,"" he said. ""Today's vote is a blow to peace that sets a dangerous precedent for further diplomatic efforts to isolate and demonize Israel.""

Former GOP presidential candidate and Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee called the administration’s move “a big mistake.”

Anne Bayefsky, director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and president of Human Rights Voices, said the contention that settlements, and not Palestinian terrorism, is the obstacle to peace is false.

""This UN resolution represents the Big Lie of modern anti-Semitism,"" Bayefsky said. ""Palestinians' backers on the Council, New Zealand and Malaysia, made today's slander clear, claiming Jews living peaceful, productive lives on Arab-claimed land was the 'single biggest threat to peace' and ""primary threat to a two-state solution.’

""Seven decades of violent Palestinian rejection of a Jewish state prove otherwise.""

The measure was adopted with 14 votes in favor, to a round of applause, after U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power abstained. It is the first resolution the Security Council has adopted on Israel and the Palestinians in nearly eight years.

Powers said the U.S. used its veto power in 2007 on a similar matter but that “circumstances have (since) changed dramatically.”

“One cannot simultaneously champion Israeli settlements and champion a viable two-state solution,” she said. “One has to make a choice.”

The Obama White House, under heavy pressure from the Israeli government and its supporters to veto the resolution, kept everyone guessing until the vote whether it would stop shielding Israel from council resolutions and permit it to pass by abstaining.

After the vote, White House officials acknowledged on a conference that Obama made the decision himself after several rounds of discussions with top administration officials.

Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said afterward that the U.S. has only one president at a time.

Israel believes it has the right to expand settlements in the disputed territories as populations within them expand. Palestinians do not believe the settlements should exist at all, and world condemnation of expansion is seen as a possible first in that direction.

The resolution calls on Israel to “immediately and completely cease all settlement activity in occupied territories, including East Jerusalem.” And it repeated the longstanding U.N. position that all settlements on land Israel conquered in 1967 are illegal under international law.

A senior Israeli official accused the U.S. of a ""shameful move"" after learning that it did not intend to veto the text, the BBC reported.

As one the council five permanent members of the council, the U.S. has veto power and has used it to sheltered Israel from condemnatory resolutions. But the Obama administration has long made clear its opposition to Israeli settlement-building in occupied territory, even though it gives Israel tens of billions annually in assistance.

“This last minute political maneuvering is shameful,"" said Ric Grenell, former spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the U.N. and a Fox News contributor. ""Today’s abstention by the Obama administration will make it harder to find a peaceful solution because it imposes outside positions on Israel without letting them negotiate directly.”

358,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/04/obama-pence-head-to-capitol-hill-as-health-law-fight-begins.html,2,"The battle-lines were drawn Wednesday on Capitol Hill in the high-stakes fight over ObamaCare, as President Obama and Vice President-elect Mike Pence huddled with their respective congressional allies to talk strategy for Republicans' repeal push.

While Obama urged Democrats to ""fight"" for the Affordable Care Act's survival, Pence assured Republicans that the Donald Trump administration will make the law's demise its ""first order of business.""

“It was a promise made on the campaign trail,” Pence said at a press conference after meeting with House Republicans. “The first order of business is to repeal and replace ObamaCare. … People voted for a better health care system, and we owe them that.”

The VP-elect sought to reassure supporters jittery about reports that party leaders could delay repeal efforts and that they have no replacement plan.

He also said the repeal process would be a “two-track approach,” with incoming GOP President Donald Trump using his executive powers, as leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress draft and pass the requisite legislation.

“It will be a legislative and executive action agenda to assure an orderly transition to something better,” said Pence, who with Trump takes office on Jan. 20.

He also said the incoming White House team is “already working on a series of executive actions.”

Sources also told Fox News on Wednesday that Pence said in the meeting that Republicans hope to have a repeal bill on Trump's desk by Feb. 20, one month after the inauguration.

Though Pence boasted Wednesday that Trump could start taking executive action with minutes or hours of being sworn in, he and House Republican leaders were peppered with questions about when the repeal process would be complete and why they don’t have an alternative health care plan.

“We have plenty of plans,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. “We don’t want to pull the rug out on people. We don't want people to be caught with nothing.”

Ending ObamaCare without a substitute plan could result in as many as 20 million Americans losing their health insurance, which would be political disaster for Republicans.

Obama exited his 90-minute, closed-door meeting without comment but reportedly urged fellow Democrats not to ""rescue"" Republicans on what he suggested be called ""Trumpcare.""

New Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said afterward that Obama and fellow Democrats had a “very inspiring” meeting in which they discussed a strategy to save ObamaCare, then blasted Republicans for their repeal-replace agenda.

“It would make America sick again, lead to chaos instead of affordable care,” the New York Democrat said. “They have no idea what to put in place of [ObamaCare]. They talked about repeal, but for five years they have nothing to put in its place.”

The visits come on the second day of the new, GOP-led Congress.

Trump replacing Obama at the White House in 16 days puts the GOP’s longtime goal of annulling much of the 2010 health care overhaul within reach.

Trump, despite his campaign vows to repeal the law, warned his colleagues on Wednesday not to let Democrats off the hook for a program he called a ""disaster,” while warning them to be careful in their methods.

Those who voted for Trump and other ObamaCare detractors are already concerned about congressional Republican leaders saying after the election that they’ll need two to four years to implement a replacement plan.

ObamaCare was created as a way to drive down overall insurance costs by reducing emergency-care visits and other uninsured medical expenses.

However, lower-than-projected enrollment among younger, healthy Americans as well as doctors and insurance companies dropping out of the program have contributed to significantly increasing premium costs.

On Tuesday, as the 115th Congress opened, Senate Republicans took the first step toward repealing ObamaCare.

Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., introduced a resolution that begins the process for repeal legislation and calls for two House and two Senate committees to send over a legislative plan by Jan. 27.

“Today, we take the first steps to repair the nation’s broken health care system,” said Enzi, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.

He and other leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress are relying on a parliamentary maneuver known as “budget reconciliation” to dismantle the law because it avoids a Senate Democrat filibuster and requires only a 51-vote majority for passage in the chamber, not the 60-vote majority.

Republicans have a 52-to-48 member majority in the Senate and a 241-to-194 majority in the House, which requires only a simple majority for passage.

Trump has provided few specifics about how he would revamp the nation's $3 trillion-a-year health care system. Steps he and congressional Republicans have mentioned include greater reliance on tax credits to help people afford coverage.

And he has talked about keeping such provisions as allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ plan and providing access to coverage for Americans with pre-existing medical conditions.

PUTIN VOWS NOT TO STOOP TO OBAMA'S LEVEL AFTER INTEL OPERATIVES KICKED OUT

The cyber pros, not specifically tied to election hacking, appeared to specialize in fraud, according to the feds. They were identified as 29-year-old Alexsey Belan -- known online as ""Abyrvaig"" and ""Fedyunya"" -- and 33-year-old Yevgeny Bogachev -- AKA ""lucky12345"" and ""slavik."" The Russian nationals' specific whereabouts are unknown, according to the feds. Combined, their cyberactivity hit victims in the U.S. and abroad costing them more than $100 million, the FBI reported.

The sanctions against both men, freeezing all their assets in the U.S. and making it illegal to do business with them, were among a series of penalties imposed by the Obama administration on Thursday. The U.S. also moved to kick out 35 Russian intelligence operatives from two U.S. compounds. The Russians were declared ""persona non grata"" and given 72 hours to leave the country.

TRUMP RESPONDS TO SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA, SAYS IT'S TIME TO 'MOVE ON'

Obama sanctioned two Russian intelligence services, the GRU and the FSB, plus companies which the U.S. claimed supported the GRU. The cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate theft of its emails determined earlier this year the hacking came from the Fancy Bear group, believed to be affiliated with the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency. The FSB is the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB.

""All Americans should be alarmed by Russia's actions,"" Obama said, adding, ""Such activities have consequences."" The president also sanctioned GRU chief Igor Korobov and three of his deputies.

Photos of Belan showed him with blond and red hair -- which the feds said were dye jobs. They said he was last known to be in Greece, but may travel to Russia, Latvia, the Maldives and Thailand.

Bogachev -- often seen with a shaved head -- would travel to spots along the Black Sea in his boat, according to investigators. They said he was last known to live in Anapa, Russia -- along the sea -- but also owns property in Krasnodar, east of there.

The FBI pinpointed Belan's crimes to breaches of three U.S.-based e-commerce firms between 2012 and 2013 in California and Nevada. The feds said he stole data from millions of accounts -- including encrypted passwords -- before offering to sell them.

As for Bogachev, he allegedly created malicious software -- or malware -- known as ""Zeus"" to snake into computers, swiping online banking account data as early as 2009. A version of the malware known as ""GameOver Zeus"" sparked more than a million computer infections, according to the FBI.

The bureau is offering up to $100,000 for information leading to Belan's arrest -- and a whopping $3 million for Bogachev.

360,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/11/tillerson-to-be-grilled-in-secretary-state-confirmation-hearing.html,2,"Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and Sen. Marco Rubio clashed during a pair of contentious exchanges Wednesday, with an incredulous Rubio pressing the prospective diplomat to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" and Tillerson coolly blunting Rubio's broadsides by explaining his more deliberative vision.



During the tense back-and-forths at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing, Rubio, R-Fla., cross-examined Tillerson on policy regarding Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. At the end of Rubio's second questioning period, Tillerson sought to allay any concerns the aggressive Rubio may have had.



""There seems to be some misunderstanding that I see the world through a different lens, and I do not,"" Tillerson said. ""...But I'm also clear-eyed and realistic about dealing with cultures.""

Tillerson's statement followed a heated initial session during which the ExxonMobil CEO refused to specifically call Putin a ""war criminal.""

""I find it discouraging your ability to cite that, which I think is globally accepted,"" Rubio said.

That exchange mirrored later questions by Rubio, who tried getting Tillerson to categorize Saudi Arabia as a ""human rights violator"" and denounce the practices of controversial Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte.

Tillerson also wouldn't bite when Rubio, a former opponent of President-elect Donald Trump during the Republican presidential primary, tried to get Tillerson to say Putin murdered political foes.

Still, Tillerson took a noticeably harder line toward Putin and Russia than Trump has done during the transition period and prior to it.

“Russia today poses a danger, but it is not unpredictable in advancing its own interests,"" Tillerson said during his opening statement. ""...Our NATO allies are right to be alarmed at a resurgent Russia.”

Tillerson called Russia an ""unfriendly adversary"" during later testimony, stopping short of saying the nation was an enemy of the U.S.

Russia took center-stage during the early portion of the hearing for Tillerson. Senators grilled Tillerson amid swirling questions about alleged meddling in U.S. politics by the Kremlin and Tillerson’s own business ties to Russia.

""My love of country and my patriotism is going to dictate that I serve no one's interests but that of the American people,"" Tillerson said.

Tillerson said that Russia had no legal claim to Crimea -- ""that was a taking of territory that was not theirs"" -- and said the Obama administration should have provided Ukraine with help defending its borders.

""The absence of a very firm, forceful response to the taking of Crimea was judged by leadership in Russia as a weak response,"" Tillerson said.

While Russia dominated the early proceedings, Tillerson also addressed other areas.

He took aim at China’s “illegal” building of man-made islands in the South China Sea and radical Islam, which he said posed “a grave risk to the stability of nations and the well-being of their citizens.”

On Syria, Tillerson said the U.S. currently had too many competing goals and needed to focus on defeating ISIS before a discussion could occur about who should lead the country. The Obama administration's dual priorities of ousting President Bashar al-Assad and eradicating ISIS were sometimes at odds with each other, Tillerson said.

Tillerson called ISIS an imminent threat but named cyber intrusions as the ""greatest and most complex threat"" facing the U.S.

He also said the American government had “stumbled” under the Obama administration.

“If we do not lead, we risk plunging the world deeper into confusion and danger,” Tillerson said.

One moment of levity occurred when Sen. Tim Kaine asked Tillerson about ExxonMobile's climate change policies. Tillerson told Kaine that Kaine would need to ask current executives, to which Kaine asked if Tillerson lacked ""the knowledge to answer my question or are you refusing to answer my question?""

""A little of both,"" Tillerson said to laughs.

On the topic of Trump's frequent use of Twitter, Tillerson said he wouldn't ""tell the boss how to communicate with the American people. That's gonna be his choice.""

Tillerson testified a day after a contentious Senate session involving Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions. The audience at Tillerson’s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing again appeared to be filled with protesters, including Code Pink activists who were dressed in Statue of Liberty garb, a man outfitted in a suit made of money and some protesters suited up in T-Rex costumes – a play on Tillerson’s name.

One early protester was ejected after she screamed “I reject you!” at Tillerson."
361,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/18/top-congressional-republicans-condemn-chelsea-manning-decision.html,2,"Top Congressional Republicans condemned Tuesday the decision by President Barack Obama to commute former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning’s 35-year prison sentence for leaking classified documents.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., blasted the decision, calling it “outrageous.”

“Chelsea Manning’s treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation’s most sensitive secrets. President Obama now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won’t be held accountable for their crimes,” Ryan said in a statement.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the decision was a “grave mistake.”

""It is a sad, yet perhaps fitting commentary on President Obama’s failed national security policies that he would commute the sentence of an individual that endangered the lives of American troops, diplomats, and intelligence sources by leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive government documents to Wikileaks, a virulently anti-American organization that was a tool of Russia’s recent interference in our elections.""

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, went on further to echo the statements of Ryan and McCain.

“It is shameful that President Obama is siding with lawbreakers and the ACLU against the men and women who work every day to defend our nation and safeguard U.S. government secrets.”

OBAMA COMMUTES CHELSEA MANNING’S SENTENCE FOR LEAKING ARMY DOCUMENTS

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told Fox News that while pardons are a Constitutional tool in the president's repertoire, Obama is ""undermining our ability on criminal justice reform by granting clemency at an alarming rate.""

According to ABC News, Defense Secretary Ash Carter was one of the U.S. officials who were also opposed to the White House’s decision to commute Manning’s sentence.

Manning is more than six years into a 35-year sentence at the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas for leaking classified government and military documents to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. Her sentence is now set to expire May 17.

Manning was known as Bradley Manning at the time of her 2010 arrest, but revealed after being convicted of espionage that she identifies as a woman.

Manning accepted responsibility for leaking the material to WikiLeaks to raise public awareness about the effects of war on civilians, and has said she was confronting gender dysphoria at the time of the leaks while deployed in Iraq.

She attempted suicide twice last year, according to her lawyers, citing her treatment at Leavenworth.

Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Manning, said the president's action ""quite literally save Chelsea's life.""

WILL WIKILEAKS’ JULIAN ASSANGE MAKE GOOD ON HIS OFFER TO TURN HIMSELF IN AFTER MANNING CLEMENCY?

In a conference call with White House reporters, an official said the decision to grant a commutation to Manning was not influence anyway by Julian Assange or WikiLeaks. A separate White House official said that more commutations should be expected before Obama leaves office.

The U.S. Army declined to comment on the announcement when asked by The Associated Press.

WikiLeaks said earlier this week that Assange would accept extradition to the U.S. if Obama granted clemency to Manning.

Commutations reduce sentences being served but don't erase convictions. Pardons generally restore civil rights, such as voting, often after a sentence has been served.

Most of the other people receiving commutations were serving sentences for nonviolent drug offenses.

362,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/15/ringling-bros-circus-plans-to-shut-down-greatest-show-on-earth-after-146-years.html,2,"After 146 years, the curtain is coming down on ""The Greatest Show on Earth."" The owner of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus told The Associated Press that the show will close forever in May.

The iconic American spectacle was felled by a variety of factors, company executives say. Declining attendance combined with high operating costs, along with changing public tastes and prolonged battles with animal rights groups all contributed to its demise.

""There isn't any one thing,"" said Kenneth Feld, chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment. ""This has been a very difficult decision for me and for the entire family.""

The company broke the news to circus employees Saturday night after shows in Orlando and Miami.

Ringling Bros. has two touring circuses this season and will perform 30 shows between now and May. Major stops include Atlanta, Washington, Philadelphia, Boston and Brooklyn. The final shows will be in Providence, Rhode Island, on May 7 and in Uniondale, New York, at the Nassau County Coliseum on May 21.

The circus, with its exotic animals, flashy costumes and death-defying acrobats, has been a staple of entertainment in the United States since the mid-1800s. Phineas Taylor Barnum made a traveling spectacle of animals and human oddities popular, while the five Ringling brothers performed juggling acts and skits from their home base in Wisconsin. Eventually, they merged and the modern circus was born. The sprawling troupes traveled around America by train, wowing audiences with the sheer scale of entertainment and exotic animals.

By midcentury, the circus was routine, wholesome family entertainment. But as the 20th century went on, kids became less and less enthralled. Movies, television, video games and the internet captured young minds. The circus didn't have savvy product merchandising tie-ins or Saturday morning cartoons to shore up its image.

""The competitor in many ways is time,"" said Feld, adding that transporting the show by rail and other circus quirks — such as providing a traveling school for performers' children— are throwbacks to another era. ""It's a different model that we can't see how it works in today's world to justify and maintain an affordable ticket price. So you've got all these things working against it.""

The Feld family bought the Ringling circus in 1967. The show was just under 3 hours then. Today, the show is 2 hours and 7 minutes, with the longest segment — a tiger act — clocking in at 12 minutes.

""Try getting a 3- or 4-year-old today to sit for 12 minutes,"" he said.

Feld and his daughter Juliette Feld, who is the company's chief operating officer, acknowledged another reality that led to the closing, and it was the one thing that initially drew millions to the show: the animals. Ringling has been targeted by activists who say forcing animals to perform is cruel and unnecessary.

In May of 2016, after a long and costly legal battle, the company removed the elephants from the shows and sent the animals to live on a conservation farm in Central Florida. The animals had been the symbol of the circus since Barnum brought an Asian elephant named Jumbo to America in 1882. In 2014, Feld Entertainment won $25.2 million in settlements from groups including the Humane Society of the United States, ending a 14-year fight over allegations that circus employees mistreated elephants.

By the time the elephants were removed, public opinion had shifted somewhat. Los Angeles prohibited the use of bull-hooks by elephant trainers and handlers, as did Oakland, California. The city of Asheville, North Carolina nixed wild or exotic animals from performing in the municipally owned, 7,600-seat U.S. Cellular Center.

Attendance has been dropping for 10 years, said Juliette Feld, but when the elephants left, there was a ""dramatic drop"" in ticket sales. Paradoxically, while many said they didn't want big animals to perform in circuses, many others refused to attend a circus without them.

""We know now that one of the major reasons people came to Ringling Bros. was getting to see elephants,"" she said. ""We stand by that decision. We know it was the right decision. This was what audiences wanted to see and it definitely played a major role.""

The Felds say their existing animals — lions, tigers, camels, donkeys, alpacas, kangaroos and llamas — will go to suitable homes. Juliette Feld says the company will continue operating the Center for Elephant Conservation.

Some 500 people perform and work on both touring shows. A handful will be placed in positions with the company's other, profitable shows — it owns Monster Jam, Disney on Ice and Marvel Live, among other things — but most will be out of a job. Juliette Feld said the company will help employees with job placement and resumes. In some cases where a circus employee lives on the tour rail car (the circus travels by train), the company will also help with housing relocation.

Kenneth Feld became visibly emotional while discussing the decision with a reporter. He said over the next four months, fans will be able to say goodbye at the remaining shows.

In recent years, Ringling Bros. tried to remain relevant, hiring its first African American ringmaster, then its first female ringmaster, and also launching an interactive app. It added elements from its other, popular shows, such as motorbike daredevils and ice skaters. But it seemingly was no match for Pokemon Go and a generation of kids who desire familiar brands and YouTube celebrities.

""We tried all these different things to see what would work, and supported it with a lot of funding as well, and we weren't successful in finding the solution,"" said Kenneth Feld."
363,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/19/republicans-pushing-to-confirm-slate-trump-nominees-on-day-one.html,2,"There is business to be done on Inauguration Day in the United States Senate.

But it will come late in the day.

Long after the swearing-in of President-elect Trump. Hours following the helicopter departure from the Capitol of President Obama via “Executive One.” It’s designated as such because the former president is on board, having just bid farewell to the new president. And we haven’t even mentioned the special inauguration luncheon on Statuary Hall of the Capitol.

Consider the bill of fare:

Did guests prefer the J. Lohr 2013 Arroyo Vista Chardonnay paired with the Maine lobster and Gulf shrimp -- with saffron sauce and peanut crumble? Or did the Delicato Black Stallion 2012 Limited Release Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon go better with the Angus beef -- with dark chocolate and juniper jus and potato gratin?

The House and Senate are in fact in session Friday. The inauguration itself constitutes a Joint Session of Congress – just outside. The House gavels in Friday morning but won’t really do anything. Technically, the Senate is in too at that point (there’s a debate about whether to raise the flag over the Senate wing of the Capitol, denoting the Senate meeting). But unlike its companion body, the Senate will conduct the first business of the Trump administration sometime after 4 p.m. ET.

The question … is how much.

The Senate will focus on confirming some of the new president’s nominees. Republicans certainly have the votes to confirm many of Trump’s picks. But for now, Democrats can determine how many nominees the Senate can advance on Inauguration Day and how many they can delay.

Senate Republicans are pushing for the confirmation of seven nominees. But in reality, Trump will only get three or four on Friday. Maybe five at the most.

“Seven sounds like a good number,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas. “Seven is the number in 2009. I would expect parity.”

Seven is magnificent for Republicans because that’s how many nominees the Senate confirmed on Obama’s inauguration day eight years ago. The Senate approved the nominees on what’s called a “voice vote,” not taking a formal tally. Those in favor simply holler “aye.” Those opposed shout “no.” The louder group prevails.

In 2009, the Senate confirmed Steven Chu as Energy secretary, Arne Duncan as Education secretary, Janet Napolitano as Homeland Security secretary, Ken Salazar as Interior secretary, Eric Shinseki as Veterans Affairs secretary, Tom Vilsack as Agriculture secretary and Peter Orszag as the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

The Senate confirmed Hillary Clinton as secretary of State the next day, 94-2 with 39 Republicans voting yea. Defense Secretary Bob Gates stayed on from the Bush administration.

At the very least, Republicans are angling to confirm Trump’s national security team Friday: Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., as CIA Director, retired Gen. James Mattis as Defense secretary and retired Gen. John Kelly as Homeland Security secretary. There’s chatter the Senate could confirm Elaine Chao, the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as Transportation secretary Friday. Chao’s not controversial. The Senate confirmed Chao on a voice vote as President George W. Bush’s Labor secretary in 2001.

This is an important moment for the Democrats. Democrats don’t align politically with many of the president-elect’s nominees. Cabinet confirmations are the first proxy fight on the field. Democrats must flex their muscles to build support with the left. This helps set the tone for the next two if not four years. The Democrats’ efforts to vilify the president and portray his choices in a negative light help their cause. In other words, if Trump is so good at spotting talent, why are there issues with the nominees?

“This is a swamp Cabinet full of bankers and billionaires,” proclaimed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

But doesn’t the president have the right to have as many members of his Cabinet in place as soon as possible? Schumer says “it’s not analogous” for the GOP to complain if the Senate doesn’t confirm seven nominees on inauguration day like they did for Obama. Schumer says the president’s nominees turned in their background paperwork for review in a timely fashion. He said the wealth of Trump’s picks created issues in the vetting process.

Start with Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson. Tillerson could even face Republican opposition. That’s a problem. Republicans hold a 52-48 advantage in the Senate (two independent senators caucus with the Democrats). If Democrats hold the line, Republicans have a narrow margin for error.

Democrats are also targeting Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos and EPA Administrator nominee Scott Pruitt. Democrats are worked into a lather over the nomination of Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., as Health and Human Services secretary. That’s because of the role Price could play in dismantling ObamaCare. The OMB nominee, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., just coughed up more than $15,000 in delayed payroll taxes he owed to a worker at his home.

“I’m sure they’ll grab for every straw they can to delay the president-elect’s cabinet,” said Cornyn.

But Democrats can’t do much to torpedo nominations if Republicans stick together. All Democrats can do is elongate the process by a day or two and require a procedural vote to end debate on a nomination. All eyes are watching for the first Republican senator who dares to vote against one of Trump’s nominees – and the wrath they may incur.

Such a prospect could give any senator indigestion – regardless of the wine pairing they preferred or the peanut crumble.

364,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/20/trump-takes-charge-45th-president-vowing-robust-first-100-days.html,2,"The moment Donald Trump swears the oath of office and lifts his hand from the Bible as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, the clock begins on his first 100 days.

And within hours, the man who campaigned as an outsider vowing to shake up Washington will have his chance to start rolling back his predecessor's legacy while forging his own.

The president-elect is set to take the oath shortly before noon, after spending Thursday meeting with supporters and getting his team in place. He met Friday morning with the Obamas. Incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer would not give specific details about the extent and timing of Trump's promised actions to turn back some of President Obama's policies -- but he promised a ""robust"" start.

""Make no mistake, we’re ready to go on Day One,"" he said Thursday. Spicer said earlier that Trump has a ""few"" executive actions, ""probably in the area of four to five, that we're looking at on Friday.""

From there, Trump will be under pressure to begin working on his 100 days bucket list, which he detailed in a speech delivered in Gettysburg, Pa., last October.

Trump's ""Contract with the American Voter"" outlines his plans for the “kind of change that only arrives once in a lifetime” -- including 18 major action items. Based on that contract, here's some of the more significant changes the 45th president could have in store for America:

Health Care

Trump wants to ""fully"" repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it -- with what, is not yet entirely clear. His campaign plan called for using ""Health Savings Accounts,"" and allowing insurance to be bought across state lines. Trump says he's still working out the details and will soon have a new proposal, which based on recent interviews also could include taking on the pharmaceutical industry.

Immigration

Trump has vowed to cancel ""all federal funding"" for so-called sanctuary cities as he moves to toughen immigration enforcement. He's vowed to ""begin removing"" the ""criminal illegal immigrants"" from the country at the start of his term, and to suspend immigration from ""terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.""

Trump also promised to work with Congress to introduce a so-called ""End Illegal Immigration Act,"" which would seek a range of changes including setting a two-year minimum federal prison sentence for illegaly re-entering the country after a prior deportation. The legislation, according to his campaign document, also would ""fully"" fund a U.S.-Mexico border wall, with the understanding that Mexico would reimburse the money -- something Mexican politicians say they won't do.

Trump also could move to turn back some of Obama's executive actions that gave a deportation reprieve to some illegal immigrants.

Government Reform

Trump has vowed a set of ethics measures as part of his ""drain the swamp"" mantra.

While Democrats have accused Trump of not living up to that pledge given the connections of some of his Cabinet nominees, he set ambitious targets during the campaign. This included a constitutional amendment to set term limits on members of Congress; a hiring freeze on federal employees; a requirement that any new regulation be offset by the elimination of two existing regulations; a five-year ban on White House officials becoming lobbyists after leaving government; and a permanent ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.

American Workers

Trump talked tough on trade even before he was a candidate, and is vowing to turn those words into action in the White House.

He has said he'd direct his Treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator; remove restrictions on American energy production; allow projects like the Keystone pipeline to move forward; and direct certain U.N. funding toward American infrastructure projects.

Trump also said he'd work with Congress on legislation meant to grow the economy 4 percent per year and create at least 25 million jobs. The package would include tax reforms, trade reforms and regulatory relief, as well as help for the energy industry. On taxes, his campaign vowed to cut the number of tax brackets from seven to three and lower the corporate tax rate from 35 to 15 percent.

Further Trump says he'd establish tariffs to discourage companies from offshoring.

Expectations

Trump would hardly be alone in turning back some of his predecessor's policies.

According to the website FiveThirtyEight, Obama signed 19 new executive orders and reversed nine of the orders signed by President George W. Bush in his first 100 days. Eight years earlier, Bush signed 11 new executive orders and revoked 4 Clinton-era actions.

The 100-day benchmark dates back to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who came into office in 1933 and unleashed a flurry of activity. Over the course of 105 days, Congress passed 76 bills – far exceeding current trends.

By contrast, statistics compiled by Govtrack show just seven bills were passed during George W. Bush’s first 100 days in 2001, and 11 in Obama’s in 2009.

“I am not sure it is as relevant as it once was in this age of new media and increased partisanship. The historical comparison to FDR is not a good gauge since he came into office at a time of national crisis with Democratic control of Congress and a mandate to act,” said Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, agrees that the measure is out of step with current legislative and political realities.

“The whole idea of 100-day agenda is fundamentally at odds with the political reality of 2017 and actually has the potential to undermine the presidency if [Trump] chooses to run roughshod over the Congress,” he told FoxNews.com.

The 100 days may not be important in historical terms, but it is important in setting a tone.

“While Trump needs to get off to a clean start and take quick, decisive action, I think he would be well-advised to break his agenda into three parts – a hundred hours, weeks and months,” said Bill Whalen, a research fellow with the Hoover Institution.

In the meantime, Whalen suggests the new administration address the issues most important to his base – repealing ObamaCare and the Supreme Court.

A Politico/Harvard University poll found Trump voters rank ObamaCare as their top priority. However, it is only the second priority for the general public.

Several political and policy obstacles lie in the administration’s path starting with the confirmation of Rep. Tom Price as secretary of Health and Human Services, noted Paul Howard, director of health policy at the Manhattan Institute.

“The good thing is that the last administration has left behind a lot of administrative flexibility to lay the groundwork for repealing ObamaCare, but it is crucial they get Price confirmed and get some victories behind him,” he said.

According to Howard, if the intention is to simultaneously repeal and replace the law, Trump will need to cut some deals with moderate Democrats to avoid the mistake Obama made in passing it.

The self-professed dealmaker also promised action on jobs by either withdrawing from or renegotiating NAFTA and withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Both efforts may set up an early battle with the pro-free trade GOP leadership in Congress.

“The president has wide latitude to act on trade issues, so one of the significant early questions will be how willing Congress will be to accept his authority on trade,” Grumet said."
365,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/24/trump-to-sign-orders-reviving-pipeline-projects-sources-say.html,2,"President Trump signed executive orders on Tuesday effectively reviving the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, as a major builder said it will reapply to build one of the projects which had been stalled by the Obama administration under pressure from environmental and other groups.

The president said the projects would be subject to a “renegotiation of the terms.” But he made clear the government was resuming consideration for both pipelines, describing them as a potential boon to construction workers.

“We’re going to put a lot of … steel workers back to work,” Trump said. “We’ll build our own pipelines, we will build our own pipes.”

Builder TransCanada said Tuesday afternoon it was ""preparing the application"" for the Keystone XL pipeline.

""We appreciate the President of the United States inviting us to re-apply for KXL,"" TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said in a statement.

""KXL creates thousands of well-paying construction jobs and would generate tens of millions of dollars in annual property taxes to counties along the route as well as more than $3 billion to the U.S. GDP,"" Cunha added.

According to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Trump directed agencies to approve it without delay -- and told agencies to expedite reviews and approvals for the remaining parts of the Dakota project.

“There’s an energy revolution that’s going to happen in this country,” he said.

The president also signed three other orders related to pipeline construction, including one expediting the environmental permitting process for infrastructure projects and one directing the Commerce Department to maximize the use of U.S. steel.

Looking ahead, Trump also announced he planned to nominate a justice for the Supreme Court next week, moving swiftly to try to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The president was summoning top senators to the White House later Tuesday to discuss his upcoming nomination.

The moves on the pipelines had been widely expected, as Trump last year blasted his predecessor for effectively blocking the projects.

Republican allies hailed Tuesday’s orders, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying in a statement, “It’s about time.”

North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer said: “Today’s executive orders affirm President Trump’s respect for the rule of law and his support for responsible infrastructure development, energy production and job creation.”

Former President Obama stopped the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in late 2015, declaring it would have undercut U.S. efforts to clinch a global climate change deal that was a centerpiece of his environmental legacy. The pipeline would run from Canada to Nebraska where it would connect to existing lines running to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. The U.S. government needs to approve the pipeline because it would cross the nation's northern border.

Separately, late last year, the Army Corps of Engineers declined to allow construction of the Dakota Access pipeline under Lake Oahe, saying alternative routes needed to be considered. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters say the project threatens drinking water and Native American sites, though Energy Transfer Partners, the company that wants to build the pipeline, disputes that and says the pipeline will be safe.

The pipeline is to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. The project had been the subject of fierce protests until the Army Corps of Engineers stepped in.

The moves are likely to spark a new fight with environmentalists. Even before Trump’s orders were official, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune put out a statement blasting what he called the “dangerous” decision.

“The Keystone pipeline was rejected because it was not in the country’s interest, and the environmental review of the Dakota Access Pipeline was ordered because of the threats it poses to the Standing Rock Sioux. Nothing has changed. These pipelines were a bad idea then and they’re a bad idea now,” he said.

The moves come as Trump makes the economy and jobs the centerpiece of his administration’s first week in office.

He met Tuesday morning with representatives from the auto industry including GM and Ford, after meeting a day earlier, separately, with business and union leaders.

The pipelines were among the few issues that put the Obama administration at odds with labor unions, some of whom have voiced hope the Trump administration can work with them to promote job creation. Trump said Tuesday during his meeting with auto industry bosses that he considers himself an environmentalist, but called current regulations ""out of control.""

The pipeline orders follow earlier executive actions covering everything from trade to ObamaCare.

Trump on Monday signed measures withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, and instituting a hiring freeze for most of the federal government. He also ordered federal agencies on his first day in office to ease the regulatory burden of the Affordable Care Act.

366,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/05/pence-will-use-all-legal-means-at-our-disposal-to-reinstate-immigration-ban.html,2,"Vice President Mike Pence said Sunday that the federal judge who halted President Trump’s temporary immigration ban “made the wrong decision” and vowed to use “all legal means at our disposal” to protect Americans.

“From the outset of his campaign and administration, the president of the United States has made it clear to put the safety of the American people first,” Pence said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We are going to win this argument.”

Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27 that temporarily halted immigration from seven mostly Muslim nations and the United States’ Syrian refugee program. The order follows his steadfast argument that radical Islamic terrorism poses a major threat to Americans’ safety.

On Friday, a federal judge in Seattle imposed a temporary restraining order on Trump’s ban, in response to a case filed last week by Washington state and Minnesota challenging Trump’s constitutional authority to unilaterally impose such a sweeping ban.

On Saturday night, a federal appeals court denied a Trump administration request to lift the restraining order and allow the immigration ban to continue.

“Under statutory law and under the Constitution, that authority belongs to the president,” Pence also said Sunday.

California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told “Fox News Sunday” that she has “no doubt” that the legal issue will ultimately go to the Supreme Court.

Pence also supported the new sanctions Trump imposed on Iran after the country last week launched a medium-range ballistic missile.

“They have flouted the U.N. security resolution,” he said. “What we are seeing here is a hostile action, belligerent action, taken by the Iranians. And we just are not going to put up with it anymore."""
367,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/24/us-quietly-sent-221m-to-palestinians-in-obamas-last-hours.html,2,"Officials said Monday that the Obama administration-- in its waning hours-- defied Republican opposition and quietly released $221 million to the Palestinian Authority that GOP members of Congress had been blocking.

A State Department official and several congressional aides told The Associated Press that the outgoing administration formally notified Congress it would spend the money Friday morning.

The official said former Secretary of State John Kerry had informed some lawmakers of the move shortly before he left the State Department for the last time Thursday.

The aides said written notification dated Jan. 20 was sent to Congress just hours before Donald Trump took the oath of office.

In addition to the $221 million for the Palestinians, the Obama administration also told Congress on Friday it was going ahead with the release of another $6 million in foreign affairs spending, including $4 million for climate change programs and $1.25 million for U.N. organizations, the congressional aides said.

The aides and the State Department official weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity.

Congress had initially approved the Palestinian funding in budget years 2015 and 2016, but at least two GOP lawmakers — Ed Royce of California, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Kay Granger of Texas, who sits on the House Appropriations Committee — had placed holds on it over moves the Palestinian Authority had taken to seek membership in international organizations.

Congressional holds are generally respected by the executive branch but are not legally binding after funds have been allocated.

The Obama administration had for some time been pressing for the release of the money for the Palestinian Authority, which comes from the U.S.

Agency for International Development and is to be used for humanitarian aid in the West Bank and Gaza, to support political and security reforms as well as help prepare for good governance and the rule of law in a future Palestinian state, according to the notification sent to Congress.

The Palestinian funding is likely to draw anger from some in Congress as well as the Trump White House. Trump has vowed to be a strong supporter of Israel and has invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to visit Washington next month.

Some of Trump’s incoming administration has been split on whether to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.

The Washington Post noted that most of the world doesn’t recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. East Jerusalem is also considered “occupied territory,” which Palestinians hope to call their capital if a two-state solution is ever reached.

South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump’s U.N. ambassador, said Wednesday that she would back the embassy move, while Trump’s Defense Secretary nominee retired Marine Gen. James Mattis said he would “stick to U.S. policy” regarding Jerusalem.

Trump’s next ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, supports Israeli settlements and other changes to U.S. policies in the region.

Friedman said he looked forward to carrying out his duties from ""the U.S. embassy in Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem,"" even though the embassy is in Tel Aviv. Trump advisers have said that the president-elect will follow through on his call for moving the embassy.

About 9.2 million people signed up through HealthCare.gov, the insurance marketplace serving most states, said the Health and Human Services department. That's about 500,000 fewer customers than had enrolled last year in those same 39 states, or slippage of around 5 percent.

Trump administration spokesman Matt Lloyd said Friday that ""Obamacare has failed"" and the new president looks forward to providing relief through ""patient-centered solutions that will work for the American people.""

VIDEO: CONGRESSMAN SAYS OBAMACARE CANNOT BE 'REPAIRED'

Ron Pollack, executive director of the advocacy group Families USA, said Trump had tried to ""sabotage"" enrollment.

""Millions of consumers still got their insurance through the ACA,"" said Pollack. ""The Republican rush to repeal the ACA without a replacement will do real harm to real people.""

The report doesn't include figures from 11 states that run their own health insurance markets — including California and New York — so the final national number will be higher. But the preliminary report is being closely watched, because President Donald Trump and the GOP-led Congress have vowed to repeal the Obama-era health law and replace it with a plan yet to emerge.

“Enrollment numbers are down and costs are up. These cost hikes are exactly the reason why Republicans are committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare,” Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement

Insurance markets created by former President Obama's law provide subsidized private coverage for people who don't have access to health care through their jobs. Along with a Medicaid expansion aimed at low-income adults, the Affordable Care Act has helped millions get coverage, reducing the nation's uninsured rate to a historic low of about 9 percent.

But even before Trump's election victory, the ACA's markets were facing double-digit premium increases and a sharp drop in insurer participation. Although most customers receive taxpayer subsidies for their premiums, the increases averaged more than 20 percent nationally and much higher in several states.

The night he was inaugurated, Trump signed an executive order directing his administration to provide relief from Obamacare. That was interpreted as a signal that officials would waive the law's tax penalties meant to nudge uninsured people to sign up. Then last week the administration pulled back about $5 million in ads that were part of a closing bid to woo the uninsured. Former Obama administration officials cried foul.

But independent analysts said the report also highlights the challenges that Trump and the GOP Congress will face trying to deliver on their promises without disrupting coverage for millions. That includes many people in states that Trump won in November, among them Florida (1.8 million); Texas (1.2 million); North Carolina (549,000); Georgia (494,000), and Pennsylvania (426,000).

""While enrollment is down, this does not exactly paint a picture of a program collapsing,"" said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

""Enrollment had been tracking on pace with last year, but sign-ups slowed down in the final weeks of open enrollment,"" said Caroline Pearson of the consulting firm Avalere Health. The controversy over unwinding the health care law may have contributed, she said.

Nonetheless, Pearson said the demand for coverage ""remains strong."" She added, ""Policymakers will need to consider how forthcoming changes will impact those currently purchasing coverage.""

Supporters of the health care law, trying to beat back or blunt efforts to repeal it, blamed the Trump administration for the lackluster number.

Facing higher premiums, less choice and a last-minute advertising pullback, fewer people signed up for coverage this year through HealthCare.gov, according to data from a preliminary government report Friday.

It was also the harshest indictment of the media ever delivered from the White House.

And it was riveting. You could not turn away. Trump unplugged.

And it was, like all things Trump, a Rorschach test. Those who support this president thought it was a brilliant takedown of a corrupt media. Those who oppose this president thought he seemed somewhat crazed—unhinged, as CNN anchor Jake Tapper put it.

Trump scored some points, as he always does, by denouncing fake news. And he was over the top at times. He even said, jokingly, that today’s headlines would be about him “ranting and raving”—but that actually, the administration, rather than being chaotic, is running like a “fine-tuned machine.” Okay, maybe a bit of hyperbole there.

The president is justified in complaining about an unprecedented flood of illegal leaks that are clearly aimed at damaging him. But that doesn’t mean the information is wrong. The Washington Post was accurate, based on unnamed sources, in reporting that Michael Flynn not leveling with the vice president about his past contacts with the Russian ambassador. That’s why, despite his argument that the press treated Flynn unfairly, Trump fired him.

The president is also right that the tone of his coverage has been unrelentingly negative.

But when the president criticized yesterday’s Wall Street Journal report that some spies are withholding sensitive intelligence from him, he said the paper never called him, as if you can just ring him up in the Oval Office. The story’s fourth paragraph quoted a White House official as denying the allegations. Trump also said a New York Times piece on earlier contacts with Russia by aides and associates was “discredited.” The jury is out on that, and there is, as the Times said, an FBI investigation.

Trump really went off on CNN’s Don Lemon, although not by name, saying his nightly show is stacked with anti-Trump panels. Whether that’s true or not, it feels like a small argument for the president to make.

What was most revealing, in regard to CNN and the media more generally, was Trump saying some journalists have “hatred” for him. He told me that in campaign interviews, but now he’s the commander-in-chief. So he has deep-seated grievances about the way he’s been covered since 2015.

Of course, Trump can get even – and get better press – by accomplishing some of the big-ticket items on his agenda. And that would be real news, not fake."
370,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/15/us-spies-reportedly-keeping-intelligence-from-trump.html,2,"Sensitive intelligence reportedly is being withheld from President Trump by U.S. intelligence officials because they are concerned that the information could be compromised.

The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that in some cases officials opted not to show the president how they collected the information. The paper, citing both former and current officials, said the decision to hold back information underscores the mistrust between the Executive Branch and spies.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said he has heard about these concerns in the past.

“I’ve talked with people in the intelligence community that do have concerns about the White House, about the president, and I think those concerns take a number of forms,” he said, according to the paper. “What the intelligence community considers their most sacred obligation is to protect the very best intelligence and to protect the people that are producing it.”

VIDEO: NUNES ON INTELLIGENCE LEAKS: NO DOUBT A CRIME WAS COMMITTED

The situation could be more nuanced.

A government official told Fox News that Trump has in fact been receiving what’s known as the President’s Daily Brief, noting that it does not routinely include raw data or discussion of sources and methods.

Fox News has learned that former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn wanted to pull together overnight intelligence reporting, including raw data, for the president to review, and this may explain the reported roadblocks.

The Journal report points out that, historically, intelligence officials have held back information about how spies gather information, but in those cases, the information was not held back due to concerns over the president’s trustworthiness.

In January, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., took on Trump over his criticism of the intelligence service.

""Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,"" Schumer told MSNBC. “So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he’s being really dumb to do this.”

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence denied the accusation late Wednesday that intelligence officials were withholding information from Trump.

""Any suggestion that the U.S. intelligence community is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.""

The Week magazine published an article Tuesday about how America’s spies ""took down Michael Flynn.""

Damon Linker, a senior correspondent, wrote, “These leaks are an enormous problem. And in a less polarized context, they would be recognized immediately for what they clearly are: an effort to manipulate public opinion for the sake of achieving a desired political outcome. It's weaponized spin.”

Flynn's ouster was a blow to a White House struggling to find its footing in Trump's first weeks in office.

The questions about Russia only deepened late Tuesday when The New York Times reported that U.S. agencies had intercepted phone calls last year between Russian intelligence officials and members of Trump's 2016 campaign team.

Current and former U.S. officials who spoke to the Times anonymously said they found no evidence that the Trump campaign was working with the Russians on hacking or other efforts to influence the election.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, told Fox News on Wednesday that he had sent a letter to the Justice Department's inspector general urging it to investigate the leaks that led to Flynn's removal.

Flynn maintained for weeks that he had not discussed U.S. sanctions in his conversations with Russia's ambassador. He later conceded that the topic may have come up.

Still, reports that there is a divide between Trump and his spies is concerning.

A White House official told The Journal that there is no information “that leads us to believe that this is an accurate account of what is actually happening.”

The Week linked to a report in Bloomberg that said, “Normally intercepts of U.S. officials and citizens are some of the most tightly held government secrets. This is for good reason. Selectively disclosing details of private conversations monitored by the FBI or NSA gives the permanent state the power to destroy reputations from the cloak of anonymity. This is what police states do.”

Hundreds of liberals rioted at the University of California Berkeley Wednesday night -- burning stores, throwing Molotov cocktails and clashing with police.

Click here for a free subscription to Todd’s newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives!

The rampaging mob forced the university to shut down an event featuring gay conservative firebrand and Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos.

“I’m outraged that Milo has been given a platform at UC Berkeley, and there should be no place for him here,” visiting assistant art professor Samara Haplerin told the Daily Californian. “He should be scared that people aren’t going to stand for this.”

Ironically, Milo had planned to deliver remarks defending free speech.

“One thing we do know for sure: the Left is absolutely terrified of free speech and will do literally anything to shut it down,” he wrote on Facebook.

Learn how Conservatives can fight back and reclaim our public universities!

The British conservative journalist called the violence a “horrible spectacle and very humiliating for American higher education.”

The crowd hurled fireworks at police officers and smashed windows at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Student Union. They also damaged buildings in downtown Berkeley – including a Starbucks and a number of banks.

The bloodthirsty mob targeted several supporters of President Trump. One young lady wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat was attacked during a television interview. An unknown man sprayed some sort of liquid in her face.

The Daily Californian reports another Trump supporter was grabbed by a crowd of agitators and thrown to the ground. He escaped, but they grabbed his red hat and set it on fire. And police had to rescue another man who was bloodied and beaten.

The university released a statement blaming the violence on outsiders who they allege came to the campus to cause mayhem.

They also affirmed Milo’s right to speak on the liberal campus.

“Chancellor Nicholas Dirks made it clear that while Yiannopoulos’ views, tactics and rhetoric are profoundly contrary to those of the campus, UC Berkeley is bound by the Constitution, the law and the university’s values and Principles of Community, which include the enabling of free expression across the full spectrum of opinion and perspective.”

Those are very nice words – but they are meaningless – unless they are enforced. According to the university, not a single person was arrested. Not a single arrest, folks.

Did someone order the police officers to stand down? If so, who gave that order – and why?

So here's what needs to happen: President Trump should immediately issue an executive order blocking Berkeley students from receiving any federal funding. And the same goes for any other public universities that want to silence conservative voices.

Universities must guarantee free speech for all students – conservative and liberal. It’s time for the federal government to eradicate this un-American infestation in higher education.

So shut down Berkeley, Mr. President. Shut it down.

“No one’s safety is at risk from different opinions,” Milo told “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” “No one’s physical safety is endangered by political ideas from a speaker on campus, but universities have sort of allowed this stuff to happen, and even in some cases encouraged it.”

Ironically, it was liberals who silenced a gay immigrant and vandalized a building named after a Civil Rights legend. Who knew there were so many homophobic, racist xenophobes at Berkeley?"

The tweets come as Trump tries to galvanize support for his orders placing restrictions on travelers from seven countries and pausing Syrian refugee resettlement. The Justice Department is currently fighting against a federal judge’s ruling halting those executive actions.

“Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting,” Trump tweeted.

He added: “I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!”

Trump’s comments during a Florida campaign rally on Saturday – which some took as a misstatement about a supposed terror attack – dovetail with what Springare has been seeing during a typical week in Orebro, Sweden. Five rapes, three assaults, a pair of extortions, blackmail, an attempted murder, violence against police and a robbery made up Springare’s caseload for a five-day period earlier this month, according to a Feb. 3 Facebook post he wrote. The suspects were all from Muslim-majority countries – Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia and Turkey – save for one Swedish man nabbed in a drug-related case.

“Mohammed, Mahmod, Ali, again and again,” Springare wrote of those arrested.

Springare, who was briefly investigated for possible hate crime incitement based on his post, managed to elucidate what Trump only hinted at during a Florida campaign speech – somewhat opaquely.

“You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden,” Trump said. “Sweden. Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible.”

Many analysts took issue with Trump’s “last night” framing, and immediately compared the line to recent misstatements by Trump spokespeople, such as counselor Kellyanne Conway’s infamous “Bowling Green Massacre” blunder.

But Trump explained on Twitter late Sunday that he was only referring to a Fox News segment that aired on Friday night’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight” dealing with the Swedish refugee crime.

My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017

“It seems like we may be missing the point of the story, which is there has been a massive social cost associated with the refugee policies and the immigration policies of Western Europe,” Carlson said on “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning.

He added: “Fifty years of immigration policy is coming to flower in Europe. We’re not paying any attention. We’re not drawing any of the obvious lessons from it. It's not working. That's the real point here. ”

Trump tweeted again on Monday morning, blasting media outlets that failed to report on Sweden's migrant crime epidemic.

""Give the public a break - The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!"" Trump wrote.

Last month, the police chief for the southern Swedish city of Malmo issued a desperate plea for help curtailing a plague of attempted murders, beatings and rapes. About 32 percent of Malmo’s occupants are migrants, although it is not clear what role migrants play in the crime wave.

“We cannot do it on our own,” Chief Stefan Sinteus wrote in an open letter about the “upward spiral of violence.”

And Sinteus is not merely dealing with typical crimes that any modern city would witness.

Malmo had 52 hand grenade attacks in 2016 alone, a jump from 48 attacks in 2015, according to figures provided by the Swedish Police Authority.

Nationwide, the terror threat level is at “elevated” and police believe at least 300 Swedish nationals have travelled to Syria and Iraq for jihadi training. On Feb. 11, a Swedish man and a Danish man were arrested in Turkey, suspected of plotting to carry out attacks in Europe. Tofik Saleh, a 38-year-old Swedish citizen of Iraqi origin, had been training with ISIS since 2014, officials said.

On the same day Springare posted his screed, a Swedish court turned over to Belgium evidence – seized in Malmo – in connection with the 2016 Brussels terror attacks, prosecutors said.

Sweden has taken in 650,000 asylum-seekers during the past 15 years – including 163,000 in 2015 alone, The Spectator reported. Of those refugees, 35,000 were unaccompanied children – or at least claimed to be. The children – mostly males from Afghanistan and Somalia – are only identified as minors by the age the applicant gives. The only time an applicant-provided age is rejected is if it’s “obviously” untrue, though there’s no clear definition of “obviously.” The Spectator interviewed asylum-seekers who admitted to lying about their age to improve their chances of avoiding deportation.

Carlson warned this mass influx of migrants, many of whom are uneducated and jobless, has begun to alter the face – and crime rates – of countries such as Sweden.

“[The integration policy] hasn’t worked very well, at all,” Carlson said. “And it’s in the process of totally changing these ancient cultures into something different and much more volatile and much more threatening, so what are the lessons we should draw from this? That’s the conversation we should have.”"

Miller claimed that the new executive order would be ""responsive"" to federal court rulings which halted the original order and resolve ""a lot of very technical issues that were brought up by the court.""

However, Miller also insisted that the court ruling staying the original order was ""flawed"" and ""erroneous"" and that Trump's action was ""clearly legal and constitutional.""

DHS SECRETARY ORDERS IMMIGRATION AGENT HIRING SURGE, END TO 'CATCH-AND-RELEASE'

""Here's the reality,"" Miller said. ""We’ve got a serious problem in our country of terrorism, radicalization and serious problems of people joining ISIS, joining terror groups, joining Al Qaeda and committing or attempting to commit acts of crime and terror against our nation.""

Miller indicated the revised order would apply to the same seven majority-Muslim countries — Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya — as the previous order.

Miller spoke to host Martha MacCallum at the top of an hour-long immigration town hall in Jacksonville, Fla. hours after Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly directed agency heads to hire thousands more immigration officers, end so-called “catch-and-release” policies and begin work on the president’s promised U.S.-Mexico border wall.

NEW IMMIGRATION POLICIES DRAW PRAISE AND ALARM

Through a show of hands, most of the town hall audience indicated that they supported Trump's tough stance on illegal immigration.

""I think [Miller's] main argument was right on point,"" said audience member Jack Capra. ""Securing our borders is a national security issue [and] it's the federal government's job to keep our citizens safe from external and internal threats. I think immigration is a big contributor to that.""

However, immigration attorney Francisco Hernandez told MacCallum that Trump's ordered immigration enforcement changes had ""written a blank check that he can't cash.""

""He’s going to have to get the money from somewhere,"" Hernandez said, ""and we don’t have the money.""

The president will have his say Tuesday night. Majority Republicans in the House and Senate will be closely watching the prime-time address for guidance, marching orders or any specifics Trump might embrace on health care or taxes, areas where some of his preferences remain a mystery.

Treasure Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday told Fox News that the speech will include Trump’s plan for corporate and individual tax reform. He also suggested that the president is not sold on House Republicans’ so-called “border tax adjustment plan” to tax exports to essentially offset proposed tax cuts.

Trump is expected to deliver his fiscal 2018 budget to Congress in mid-March.

Congressional Republicans insist they are working closely with the new administration as they prepare to start taking votes on health legislation, with the moment finally upon them to make good on seven years of promises to repeal and replace ObamaCare.

House Republicans hope to pass their legislation by early April and send it to the Senate, with action there also possible before Easter.

Republicans will be ""keeping our promise to the American people,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said as he sent lawmakers home for the Presidents Day recess armed with informational packets to defend planned GOP changes to the health law.

However, the recess was dominated by raucous town halls in which Republicans -- including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Virginia Rep. Dave Brat, a favorite of the Tea Party movement -- faced tough questions about their plans to replace the far-reaching law with a new system built around tax credits, health savings accounts and high-risk pools.

Among the important, unanswered questions are what will be the overall cost and how many people will be covered.

There's also uncertainty about how to resolve divisions among states over Medicaid money, with at least a couple of GOP plans circulating, including one by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford.

The lack of clarity created anxiety among voters who peppered the lawmakers from coast to coast with questions about what would become of their own health coverage and that of their friends and family.

It has forced Republicans to offer assurances that they don't intend to take away the law and leave nothing in its place, even though some House conservatives favor doing just that.

""I think we have a responsibility in Washington to try to make the system better,” GOP Rep. Leonard Lance told an overflow crowd last week in his politically divided New Jersey district.

Many Republicans say that how they will handle health legislation will set the stage for the next big battle, over taxes. And the GOP's early plans for major infrastructure bill do not appear on the table.

Senators also will be weighing the nomination of federal appeals Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's pick for the Supreme Court. Hearings soon will get under way in the Senate Judiciary Committee; floor action is expected before Easter.

Despite Gorsuch's sterling credentials, Democrats are under pressure from their liberal supporters to oppose him, given voters' disdain for Trump and the GOP's refusal last year to allow even a hearing for Obama's nominee for the high court vacancy, federal appeals Judge Merrick Garland.

Yet some Democrats are already predicting that one way or another, Gorsuch will be confirmed. Even if he doesn't pick up the 60 votes he needs, McConnell could use a procedural gambit to eliminate Democrats' ability to filibuster Gorsuch, an outcome that Trump has endorsed.

The Senate has confirmed 14 Cabinet and Cabinet-level officials, fewer than other presidents at this point.

Next up will be financier Wilbur Ross for Commerce secretary, Rep. Ryan Zinke to lead the Interior Department, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson to be Housing secretary and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry at the Energy Department.

How Democrats vote will be telling, given the extreme pressures on them to oppose Trump at every turn.

376,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/28/trump-vows-new-chapter-american-greatness-in-speech-to-congress.html,2,"President Trump declared Tuesday that a “new chapter of American greatness is now beginning” as he made economic revival the centerpiece of his first address to Congress – issuing a clarion call to “restart the engine of the American economy” through tax cuts, better trade deals, immigration enforcement and a $1 trillion infrastructure program.

He also called on Congress to replace what he called the “imploding ObamaCare disaster” with legislation that lowers costs and expands access, an ambitious goal for GOP lawmakers still trying to come together on a plan.

The president outlined his agenda in an address to a joint session of Congress that lasted roughly an hour and focused largely on priorities at home, more than abroad. He offered a decidedly upbeat vision for the future of the country that stood in contrast to his at-times foreboding inauguration address.

“Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope,” Trump said, urging lawmakers to ""join forces"" to deliver.

Trump for the most part traded the contentious and punchy tone of the last few weeks for loftier – some might say more presidential – rhetoric. Declaring “the time for small thinking is over,” Trump appealed to the country to “believe, once more, in America.”

“A new chapter of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation,” he said. “And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.”

He described his address as a “message of unity and strength.”

The generally well-received speech could mark an opportunity for Trump to reset his young presidency after a rocky start in which clashes with the media and staffing controversies at times overshadowed action on the jobs front.

In perhaps the most memorable moment of the night, the audience broke out into extended applause as Trump introduced the widow of William ""Ryan"" Owens, the Navy SEAL killed in a raid in Yemen last month. Carryn Owens sobbed as lawmakers gave her a standing ovation and Trump said the raid he participated in yielded vital intelligence. His “legacy is etched into eternity,” Trump said.

In between the more dramatic moments were a host of policy prescriptions that could have a big impact on discussions in Congress.

Trump called for a “national rebuilding,” urging Congress to pass legislation that produces a $1 trillion public-private investment in infrastructure.

Speaking to a key campaign promise that has yet to be realized, he said his team is developing “historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.” He vowed a “big, big cut” including “massive tax relief for the middle class.”

And he urged Congress to replace ObamaCare “with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better health care.”

He outlined “principles” to guide negotiations, including a call for Americans with pre-existing coverage to keep access to care, for states to have “flexibility” with Medicaid, and for Americans to be able to buy insurance across state lines.

Calling education the “civil rights issue of our time,” Trump also urged Congress to pass an education bill funding “school choice.”

While laying out his agenda, Trump touted his early-administration accomplishments while claiming he inherited many problems.

And as he did during the presidential campaign, he pushed a nationalist message, making big promises for what will happen when America puts its citizens first: “Dying industries will come roaring back to life. … Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. … Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.”

He said his job is to represent the United States, not the world.

In calling to “restart” the American jobs engine, Trump said the U.S. must make it “easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.”

He also defended his stepped-up deportations and other border security plans, casting his immigration agenda as part of the broader economic plan. By enforcing immigration laws, he said, “we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.” He joined GOP lawmakers seeking reforms to legal immigration – and potentially reopened the broader debate in Congress by saying immigration reform is possible.

Trump's first official status report to Congress came amid a fast-paced opening volley of activity at the start of his term: a slew of executive actions, a forthcoming budget proposal and various side-deals with American companies aimed at creating jobs. Trump was eager to highlight those accomplishments, but also faces early challenges: an order suspending refugee and other admissions on hold by the courts, questions about his team’s contacts with Russia and a Congress that has not yet moved legislation on key priorities.

The biggest task ahead is Republicans’ drive to repeal and replace ObamaCare. As Trump appealed for a comprehensive package, some in the party have been divided over the plans being privately discussed at the Capitol.

House Speaker Paul Ryan played down divisions ahead of Tuesday’s speech. “This is a plan that we are all working on together,” he told reporters. “There aren’t rival plans here.”

After the speech, Ryan applauded Trump for what he called a ""home run.""

But the official Democratic response offered a reminder of the resistance Trump will face on his legislative agenda, particularly on ObamaCare.

Former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear warned those efforts would strip affordable health insurance from Americans. “This isn’t a game. It’s life and death for people,” he said."
377,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/19/mccain-defends-media-in-nbc-interview.html,2,"In an interview on NBC airing on Sunday, Senator John McCain defended the media, saying “we need a free press, we must have it.”

In an interview with NBC News' Chuck Todd on “Meet the Press” the Republican senator was asked to respond to President Trump’s tweet on Friday where he called many media outlets “the enemy of the American people.”

McCain said that in order to “preserve democracy” you must have a free press. He says that without it he’s “afraid we would lose so much of our individual liberties over time.”

“That’s how dictators get started,” McCain added in a clip of the interview released on Saturday.

“They get started by suppressing free press,” the Senator responded asked if he was referring to Trump’s tweet.

McCain added that “the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press.”

“I’m not saying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator, I’m just saying we need to learn the lessons of history,” McCain said in the NBC interview.

McCain’s defense of the media comes after recent comments from Trump, calling specific media outlets, “fake news.”

In a rally on Saturday in Florida, Trump attacked the news media for unfavorable stories saying that it was “a big part of the problem” toward in helping to “make America great again.”

Trump told the crowd that he wanted to speak ""without the filter of the fake news.""

378,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/02/white-house-defends-sessions-as-dems-seek-resignation-over-russia-revelation.html,2,"The White House is standing by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the face of mounting Democratic calls for his resignation – after reports showed he spoke with the Russian ambassador, despite testimony that he did not have “communications” with Moscow.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday morning became the latest top Democrat to seek Sessions’ dismissal, while also calling for a special prosecutor and an inspector general probe.

“There cannot be even the scintilla of doubt about the impartiality and fairness of the attorney general,” he said. “It’s clear Attorney General Sessions does not meet that test … for the good of the country, Attorney General Sessions should resign.”

Republicans have split, meanwhile, on the question of whether Sessions should recuse himself from a Russia investigation. The top-ranking congressional Republican, House Speaker Paul Ryan, said Thursday he doesn’t see a purpose in recusal unless Sessions is the subject of the investigation.

He told reporters he’s seen “no evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, and “Democrats are lighting their hair on fire to get you to cover this story.”

A White House official, in a statement, described Democrats’ demands as a “partisan” attack, suggesting the controversy is timed to distract from the positive response to President Trump’s address to Congress earlier this week.

“This is the latest attack against the Trump administration by partisan Democrats. [Attorney General] Sessions met with the ambassador in an official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is entirely consistent with his testimony,” the official said.

In a statement to Fox News, the former Alabama Republican senator said, ""I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.""

While Sessions is denying he specifically discussed campaign issues with the Russians, The Washington Post first reported that he did speak twice last year with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. One discussion, in July, was described as involving a group of ambassadors after a Heritage Foundation event on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention. Kislyak was part of a “small group” of diplomats who approached Sessions and spoke with him.

A subsequent meeting was held in September in the senator’s office. Justice officials said Sessions met with ambassadors in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

But while Sessions was serving on the Senate Armed Services panel, he also was a prominent surrogate for then-candidate Donald Trump. And in Senate testimony, Sessions denied contacts with the Russians.

Asked by Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., at that hearing what he’d do with evidence that anyone tied to the campaign communicated with Russia last year, Sessions said: “I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I … did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it.”

The Post noted that Sessions also responded, “No,” in a written answer when asked whether he’d been in contact with any part of the Russian government regarding the election.

Officials told the Post Sessions did not consider his discussions relevant and did not recall details of what was discussed with the ambassador from Russia.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, speaking with “Fox & Friends’” Abby Huntsman, also said Sessions “did his job” as a senator. He said Sessions was “100 percent straight with the committee” and Democrats are playing politics.

WATCH THE SPICER INTERVIEW ON 'FOX & FRIENDS' STARTING AT 6 A.M. FRIDAY

“There was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer,” Sessions spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement. “Last year, the senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian, German and Russian ambassadors. He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign -- not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee.”

According to a schedule provided to Fox News, Sessions had 30 meetings with numerous ambassadors from April 14 through Nov. 11. Russia appears on the schedule only once – the Sept. 8 meeting with Kislyak. The day before, Sessions also took a meeting with Ukraine Ambassador Valeriy Chaly. These meetings took place a week before a seven-day unilateral ceasefire plan was accepted by Russia on behalf of separatist rebels it backed in the conflict with Ukraine.

But for Democrats, the revelations of any Russia discussions only served to fuel long-running accusations that Trump-tied officials have sought to conceal past contacts with Moscow. Earlier this month, Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser amid accusations he misled Vice President Pence and others over his contact with the Russian ambassador.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called Wednesday night for Sessions’ resignation.

“Jeff Sessions lied under oath during his confirmation hearing before the Senate,” she said. “Attorney General Sessions has never had the credibility to oversee the FBI investigation of senior Trump officials’ ties to the Russians. That is why Democrats have consistently called for Sessions to recuse himself from any oversight of the investigation. Now, after lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians, the attorney general must resign.”

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., also called for Sessions’ resignation.

All Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee wrote to FBI Director James Comey and the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia urging a criminal probe.

Others, including Franken, have called for Sessions at least to recuse himself from a DOJ Russia investigation. The Wall Street Journal reported that investigators previously examined contacts between Sessions and Russian officials.

The critical factor may be what top congressional Republicans say next.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House oversight committee, tweeted: “AG Sessions should clarify his testimony and recuse himself.”

Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, also said: ""Jeff Sessions is a former colleague and a friend, but I think it would be best for him and for the country to recuse himself from the DOJ Russia probe.""

Asked about such requests, Sessions told NBC, “I’ve said that whenever it’s appropriate, I will recuse myself, there’s no doubt about that.”

379,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/15/trump-hits-msnbc-for-fake-news-after-tax-return-report.html,2,"Hours after a much-touted MSNBC “scoop” revealed part of President Trump's 2005 tax returns -- and in the process, undermined the left's speculation that he was a tax dodger -- the commander-in-chief fired back Wednesday morning with another volley of barb-laden tweets.

Though Trump was set to hit the road for a stop in Detroit and a rally in Tennessee on Wednesday, he kicked off his travel with a victory lap on Twitter after DCReport.org reporter David Cay Johnston revealed 2005 Trump tax documents to MSNBC host Rachel Maddow. Johnston said he found the president’s 1040 form “in the mail,” a story Trump wasn’t buying as he took aim at Maddow’s parent network.

“Does anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, ‘went to his mailbox’ and found my tax returns? @NBCNews FAKE NEWS!” Trump tweeted.

Does anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, ""went to his mailbox"" and found my tax returns? @NBCNews FAKE NEWS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2017

Johnston's story about finding the tax documents in the mail mirrors how a New York Times reporter was mailed Trump tax info from 1995 in October.

The tax documents, which showed Trump made $153 million in 2005 and paid $36.5 million in income taxes ($38 million in total taxes), did not exactly amount to a bombshell. His effective rate was close to 25 percent. It appeared so favorable to the president that Johnston -- a longtime reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2001 -- speculated to Maddow it was possible “Donald sent this to me.”

“Donald has a long history of leaking material about himself when he thinks it’s in his interest,” Johnston said.

Former Trump Deputy Campaign Manager David Bossie told ""Fox & Friends"" on Wednesday that Johnston's charge was ludicrous.

""That's ridiculous,"" Bossie said. ""President Trump is a very private person. He takes his privacy, the safety of his family, and his business empire very seriously.""

The White House in a Tuesday night statement called the tax story a sign that Maddow was “desperate for ratings.” A senior administration official added it was “totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns.”

Maddow argued the returns were “not illegally published” and said MSNBC merely exercised its First Amendment right to publish information in the public interest. The unauthorized publishing of federal tax returns is a criminal offense that can be punished by five years in jail or a fine of up to $5,000.

Most of the post-reveal chatter focused on how Maddow overhyped the report and took too long -- about 20 minutes -- to even break the story on her own show, a delay that allowed other publications and TV shows to report on the tax news ahead of her.

The ""Legal Insurrection"" website mocked Maddow with the headline ""Rachel Maddow's career committed suicide live on national TV tonight.""

""If anything, Maddow helped Trump by showing he paid $38 million in taxes on $150 million of income. Hardly the narrative the Democrats like,"" William A. Jacobson wrote.

Donald Trump Jr. sent out a slew of tweets lambasting the Maddow segment and highlighting the millions of dollars in taxes his dad was proven to have paid. The narrative that Trump paid little or no taxes has dogged Trump since the GOP primary battle. Trump has so far refused to release his taxes, saying the documents are under audit.

""BREAKING NEWS: 12 years ago @realDonaldTrump made a lot of money and paid a lot in taxes #scandal #thankyouMaddow,"" Trump Jr. tweeted.

Can you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2017

Trump turned from the tax debacle in a subsequent Wednesday tweet, also taking aim at rapper Snoop Dogg – who took literal aim at an actor dressed up as Trump in a new music video, pretending to shoot the man.

“Can you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time!” Trump wrote.

Trump also previewed his Wednesday travel schedule and boasted of his early successes in bringing auto manufacturing jobs back to America.

“Will be going to Detroit, Michigan (love) today for a big meeting on bringing back car production to State & U.S. Already happening!” Trump tweeted.

He added: “Looking forward to a big rally in Nashville, Tennessee, tonight. Big crowd of great people expected. Will be fun!”"
380,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/08/now-or-never-on-obamacare-repeal-despite-pressure-gop-divided-on-bill.html,2,"Congressional Republicans may find inspiration from the King of Rock and Roll when comes to passing their replacement bill for ObamaCare.

Imagine Elvis Presley crooning his 1960 number one single, “It’s Now or Never.”

“We have a choice,” proffered House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, one of the authors of the health care blueprint. “We can act now or we can keep fiddling around and squander this opportunity to repeal ObamaCare.”

In 2009 and 2010, Republicans railed against Democrats as they relied almost exclusively on their own members to approve ObamaCare. Now Republicans are going it alone to repeal ObamaCare and adopt their own health care package. But some conservative lawmakers and interest groups alike are upbraiding the GOP legislation. It only takes a few renegades in both the House and Senate to incinerate the plan.

“It’s ObamaCare-lite,” argued Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. “We have to admit we are divided on replacement.”

“Obviously we have serious concerns,” said House Freedom Caucus co-chairman Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C.

Michael Needham, the head of the conservative policy organization Heritage Action, declared there was “no significant difference” between the GOP replacement package and ObamaCare.

Passage of the Republican health care bill comes down to the numbers. The GOP can only lose 21 votes before the measure fails on a party-line vote.

The Freedom Caucus has a bylaw that compels its members to vote as a bloc if 80 percent of its 40-plus members feel the same on a given issue. That’s more than enough to incinerate the health care measure on the floor.

That’s why the Trump administration deployed Budget Director and Freedom Caucus founder Mick Mulvaney to liaise with congressional Republicans. Vice President Pence also paid a visit to the Freedom Caucus.

Meadows says Pence told his members the bill was still open for negotiation.

“We took this as good news,” said Meadows.

But after a lunch meeting with Senate Republicans, Pence suggested the bill might not be that agile.

“This is the bill,” said Pence. “The president supports it and looks forward to working directly on this bill.”

Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., suggested Trump was in negotiation mode.

“What we have here is an opening bid,” said Sanford.

Some Republicans hoped to alter the legislation.

“There better not be a rule that bans amendments which are badly needed to fix this bill,” said Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas.

The Freedom Caucus is a little like the Democratic Blue Dog coalition which was key to approving ObamaCare. The Blue Dogs, a group of conservative Democrats, are still around. There just aren’t many left in the House Democratic Caucus these days. The Blue Dogs, when their numbers were bigger, often made a lot of noise. But when then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., needed Blue Dog votes, most of them heeled.

In March, 2010, Pelosi lacked the votes to pass the final version of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). So she authorized the House Rules Committee to allow but two amendments before the decisive ObamaCare debate. One amendment was for a Republican health care plan. The other amendment was a proposal written by then-Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich. The “Stupak Amendment” constructed an additional firewall to ensure that federal dollars wouldn’t cover abortions. The Stupak amendment ultimately courted the support of just enough conservative, pro-life Democrats. The House okayed the first iteration of Obamacare 220-215.

Switch three votes and the bill would have failed.

The question now is how might lawmakers contour the GOP health care plan to their liking. Also, as Gohmert asks, what amendments might the GOP brass permit? Is there flexibility? What happens if just enough Republicans balk at the bill? Does the president light them up on Twitter?

“The American Health Care Act (ACHA) is the first test of presidential legislative power,” suggested House Republican Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., after a White House confab.

Meadows understands the risks some conservatives could face should they buck Trump.

“The president has a powerful bully pulpit and a powerful tweet,” said Meadows. “I would not want to take him on in either of those concerns.”

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., may not emulate Pelosi when it comes to whipping a vote. But he sure exuded confidence Tuesday.

“We will have 218 votes,” predicted Ryan. “I can guarantee you.”

Of course, Ryan only needs 216 to approve the ACHA.

Ryan and other ACHA supporters must court members of the Freedom Caucus for their votes. Some top GOP aides and even lawmakers spent the past few days trolling conservatives who weren’t on board, privately bad-mouthing them. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., co-wrote the ObamaCare replacement bill alongside Kevin Brady. Rand Paul embarked on a Quixotic, if faux, quest to find the “secret location” of the bill last week. When the House Republican leadership released the bill, Walden’s crew “hand-delivered” a copy of the legislation to Paul’s office and tweeted a photo of the consignment.

The margin to pass this bill could be tight. Consider the narrow vote engineered by Pelosi to pass ObamaCare. Ryan and other Republican leaders must earn the support of skeptics in their own party, not antagonize them.

Ryan wants to pass the bill by the end of the month. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., hopes to follow suit in early April. The bill probably calcifies if it sits out there too long. In 2009 and 2010, congressional Democrats burned nearly 10 months approving ObamaCare.

As the King sings, “It’s now or never” – if Republicans are to repeal and replace ObamaCare. “Tomorrow will be too late.”

John McCain to either provide evidence of President Trump’s wiretapping claims or retract the allegation, saying the White House will wait until congressional committees release their own findings.

“We will comment further after those findings are made clear,” Conway told “Fox & Friends.”

She was responding to McCain, R-Ariz., who on Sunday said Trump has “one of two choices” to make regarding his explosive allegation two weekends ago that former President Barack Obama tapped his phones.

“Either retract or ... provide the information that the American people deserve, because, if his predecessor violated the law, President Obama violated the law, we have got a serious issue here, to say the least,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Top lawmakers also expressed doubt Sunday that the Justice Department would meet a bipartisan request to provide evidence by Monday.

“I don’t expect to see any evidence,” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told ABC’s “This Week.”

Schiff and committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., made the request in a letter Saturday.

In a tweet Monday morning, Conway said they are “pleased” the House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating, “& will comment after.”

She echoed that assessment on “Fox & Friends,” noting the congressional investigation is ongoing.

After Trump’s tweets touched off a firestorm, the White House has sought to move beyond the controversy for now by putting the investigation in Congress’ hands, focusing instead on the push to advance Republicans’ ObamaCare repeal bill and other initiatives.

Conway, though, said Monday that leaks about the administration are “coming from somewhere.” As to Trump’s specific – and most controversial – claim that Obama had “wires” tapped in Trump Tower, Conway said: “We’ll see where these investigations lead.”

The committees have not given a timetable for when their work might conclude."

“ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE,” Trump tweeted. “Do not worry!”

Trump tweeted after House Speaker Paul Ryan on Friday cancelled the final vote for the ObamaCare replacement bill, upon concluding he didn’t have enough votes despite the chamber’s GOP majority.

“We’re going to be living with ObamaCare for the foreseeable future,” the Wisconsin Republican said afterward, making clear that neither he nor Trump intend to introduce new legislation.

Meanwhile, Trump appeared to already be turning his attention to tax reform and returning to his plan to allow ObamaCare to continue -- with the expectation that the 2010 health care law would implode amid increasing costs and few options for Americans.

Still, his tweet Saturday suggested a potential willingness to work on a bipartisan plan on overhauling ObamaCare -- albeit a scenario in which Democrats come to the GOP-controlled Congress to work together on improvements.

Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan on Saturday seemed open to such discussions, acknowledging that ObamaCare indeed has problems, including too few tax credits for poor Americans to help them pay for the insurance.

“ObamaCare is not perfect. We need to fix things” he said on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.” “This is all fixable if we sit down as reasonable people.”

Louisiana GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy told Fox News' ""America's News Headquarters"" on Saturday that he agrees with Trump's tweet, suggesting a bipartisan effort."

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump is looking forward to the House passing the bill and confirmed House Speaker Paul Ryan is meeting with Trump to “discuss the way forward” on the bill.

According to GOP lawmakers and congressional aides, House Republican leaders were short of the votes needed for the bill to pass.

Trump on Friday told lawmakers still on the fence over repealing and replacing ObamaCare with TrumpCare, that voting against the White House-backed bill is tantamount to voting for Planned Parenthood.

Trump tweeted Friday, “The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!""

In a bid to coax support from conservatives, House leaders proposed a fresh amendment repealing Obama's requirement that insurers cover 10 specified services like maternity and mental health care.

Conservatives have demanded the removal of those and other conditions the law imposes on insurers, arguing they drive up premiums.

The president met with members of the Freedom Caucus Thursday in an effort to win them over. But the vote was postponed after administration officials fell short.

Trump issued lawmakers an ultimatum Thurday night. He wants the House to vote Friday on the legislation to begin dismantling ObamaCare and if it fails, he is ""done with health care,” and ready to move on to tax reform, a source told Fox News.

""My understanding is he’s going to get it,"" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on ""The O'Reilly Factor.""

""We’re hoping to make this the last anniversary that any American has to suffer under ObamaCare by instilling a patient-centric health care system in place, and the president has made that case to members throughout the spectrum of the Republican conference, and tomorrow, it’s time to vote,"" he added.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., thinks it will wrap up by 4:30 or 5 p.m. ET (WATCH FOX NEWS CHANNEL FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE). If the bill passes, it will be a monumental achievement for Speaker Ryan and Trump. But if the bill stumbles, recriminations will abound.

Trump's demands aren't sitting well with some Republicans.

Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie tweeted Friday morning:

""If Exec branch tells Legislative branch ""when 2 vote"" ""how 2 vote"" & ""what it will b allowed 2 work on if vote fails,"" is that a republic?""

Republican leaders Thursday canceled a vote after leadership's attempts to lobby enough votes apparently failed -- a major setback for Ryan and Trump.

""For seven and a half years we've been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it's collapsing and failing families,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters after meeting with Republican leaders. ""Tomorrow we're proceeding.""

Trump and Republican leaders had spent much of the day scrambling to get both moderates and conservatives on board with the increasingly unpopular legislation.

""We have not gotten enough of our members to get to yes at this point under what we have now,"" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters.

Ryan postponed his press conference twice as he worked with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy R-Calif., Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., to get enough votes to get the American Healthcare Act through the House on the seventh anniversary of ObamaCare's passage.

The House Rules Committee is expected to prep the health care bill starting at 7am ET Friday.

When asked about the timing of the vote McCarthy told Fox News the House should be ""done in the afternoon"" but said Democrats could delay things.

Meanwhile, Trump met inside the Cabinet room with the Freedom caucus to try and rally conservatives to the cause. He also tweeted, urging supporters to call their representatives to back the bill.

A senior administration official told Fox News after the meeting with Trump and the conservative group that there was a deal in the works, but that it was not yet finalized. A source from the Freedom Caucus later said there wasn't yet a deal.

""I would say progress is being made, and that progress should be applauded with the efforts by the White House to deliver on a campaign promise, and to lower premiums for every American from coast to coast and in between,"" Meadows said. He also called Trump's involvement ""unparalleled in the history of our country.""

When asked if this was a loss for the president, Meadows said: ""Absolutely not.""

Earlier in the day, Spicer had expressed confidence that the White House was would be voted on and would pass.

""It’s going to pass. That’s it,"" he said at his daily press briefing.

Spicer also noted that Trump had been making calls past 11 p.m. Wednesday night to try and bring members on board.

Sources later told Fox News that the White House was anticipating a vote after midnight, but that was before the vote was canceled.

House Republicans were due to meet about the around 7 p.m. ET, but there appeared no clear path to pass the bill.

In appealing to conservatives with concessions that include limiting requirements that plans offer benefits including maternity and substance abuse care, Republican leaders risk scaring off moderates. A plan to cut funding to Planned Parenthood also risked spooking centrist Republicans.

Meanwhile, Democrats blasted what they saw as Republicans’ amateurish maneuvering. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it was a ""rookie's error"" to bring the legislation to a vote so early, and urged fellow Democrats to oppose the legislation.

“While Republicans scramble to make TrumpCare even more destructive, our Caucus must continue to be fully engaged today in exposing its disastrous consequences for the American people,” she told colleagues in a letter Thursday.

The AHCA would stop ObamaCare’s tax penalties against Americans who choose not to buy coverage, as well as cutting the federal-state Medicaid program for low earners. It would also give tax credits to help people pay medical bills, while allowing insurers to charge older Americans more. It would also repeal tax increases on high-earners and health companies.

The ObamaCare battle was Mission Impossible from the beginning, because Donald Trump ran against Republican orthodoxy on health insurance.

There was simply no way to satisfy the GOP’s most conservative wing, which wanted to junk most of ObamaCare, the center-right conservatives who don’t want millions to lose coverage or face huge rate hikes, and Trump’s own conditions.

There’s been lots of media chatter about how Trump might not be as great a dealmaker as he says. Perhaps, but there was no way to square this circle.

The president faulted the Democrats for their united opposition--the same thing the Republicans did when the 2010 law passed--but the GOP never engaged the opposition party, confident it could win on its own.

While the failure to hold the vote is a major setback for Trump, it’s just as much of a defeat for the House Freedom Caucus, which, while acting on principle, may have fumbled its best chance to repeal much of a program its members despise.

The plain fact is there was virtually no bill that would satisfy the Freedom Caucus that could pass the House, and even if it did, it would have been doomed in the Senate.

So those lawmakers made the judgment that they’d rather have no repeal than such a watered-down version.

The party’s mainstream conservatives feared ownership of a health care debacle in which millions of Americans lost coverage or couldn’t afford coverage, while states struggled with huge Medicaid cuts, while premiums didn’t come down.

Which brings us to the president, who realized he’d rather move on than fight this losing battle indefinitely.

Trump doesn’t come out of the conservative movement, which is a key reason why he won the election. He called for the replacement of ObamaCare a zillion times during the campaign, but he also said that no one should lose their coverage. That the ban on preexisting conditions should remain. That kids should be able to stay on parental policies until 26. That he wouldn’t cut Medicaid (or Medicare and Social Security, which also breaks with the Paul Ryan philosophy).

With all those conditions, Trump was always going to be at odds with the Freedom Caucus that had the numbers to kill the bill.

On the tactical questions, should Trump have tackled an easier issue like infrastructure first? Probably. Should he have let Ryan take the lead? Probably not, for the House speaker couldn't deliver. Was the bill rushed and badly flawed? Absolutely.

But my sense is that Trump didn’t care that much about the details, which is why he made several concessions, including on Medicaid. He wanted a deal, something he could declare a victory before turning to the rest of his agenda. He simply is not as passionate about the intricacies of medical insurance as he is about trade and immigration.

In the end, the bill that nobody liked died. And the Republican Party showed it’s far easier to be a protesting minority than to actually govern."

""The perpetrator of the attacks yesterday in front of the British Parliament in London is an Islamic State soldier and he carried out the operation in response to calls to target citizens of the coalition,"" the Amaq statement said.

The claim of responsibility comes fewer than 24 hours after a man driving an SUV plowed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge near the Parliament building.

Two people were killed and more than 30 others injured before the attacker fatally stabbed police officer Keith Palmer on the Parliament’s grounds. Police shot the attacker, who later was pronounced dead.

HERO COP LIKELY SAVED OTHERS FROM LONDON MANIAC

The attacker's identity has not been revealed, but British Prime Minister Theresa May said he was born in Britain and known to authorities who had once investigated him for links to religious extremism.

""Our working assumption is that the attacker was inspired by Islamist ideology,"" she told members of Parliament. “We know the threat from Islamist terrorism is very real. But while the public should remain utterly vigilant, they should not and will not be cowed by this threat.”

British officials did not release the attacker's identity or confirm a link with the Islamic State group, though May did say it would be wrong to describe the attack as ""Islamic"" extremism.

""It is Islamist terrorism,"" she said. ""It is a perversion of a great faith.""

On Thursday, British police announced that six homes were raided and eight arrests were made in connection to the Wednesday terror attack that left four dead, including the attacker and a police officer.

PHOTOS: AFTERMATH OF 'TERROR INCIDENT' NEAR PARLIAMENT

Armed police carried out the raid in the central city of Birmingham, about 130 miles north of London; however, police said they believed the terror attacker acted alone during his assault on the Westminster Bridge near Parliament.

May called the attack “sick and depraved,” and stood defiant against it.

“An act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy, but today we meet as normal … we are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism,” she said. “Democracy and the values it entails will always prevail.”

While she honored the police, May also saluted the everyday actions of millions who went about their lives in London as normal and describing it as proof that the attack failed to break the determination of Londoners and Britons.

""As I speak, millions will be boarding trains and airplanes to travel to London, and to see for themselves the greatest city on Earth,"" she told the House. ""It is in these actions -- millions of acts of normality -- that we find the best response to terrorism -- a response that denies our enemies their victory, that refuses to let them win, that shows we will never give in.""

The prime minister said people from 11 countries were among the wounded victims, including one American. Others included: 12 Britons, 3 French, 2 Romanians, 4 South Koreans, 1 German, 1 Pole, 1 Irish, 1 Chinese, 1 Italian, and two Greeks required hospital treatment.

UK PARLIAMENT ATTACK IS THE LATEST TERROR SCARE FOR LONDON

Parliament began its moment of silence at 9:33 a.m. (5:33 a.m. ET), honoring the slain police officer, 48-year-old Palmer, a 15-year veteran of the Metropolitan Police and a former soldier. Parliament then returned to business, an act of defiance to those who had attacked British democracy.

""Those who carry out such wicked and depraved acts as we saw yesterday can never triumph in our country and we must ensure it is not violence, hatred or division, but decency and tolerance that prevails in our country,"" Trade Secretary Liam Fox said.

""Hear, hear!"" lawmakers from all parties responded in unison.

MAY'S EXPERIENCE PREPARED HER TO HANDLE LONDON ATTACK, AFTERMATH, EXPERT SAYS

Mayor Sadiq Khan called for Londoners to attend a candlelit vigil at Trafalgar Square on Thursday evening in solidarity with the victims and their families and to show that the city remains united.

""I think the population of this country and indeed most of the other European states -- we're now saying to our governments, look, frankly, you have brought this upon us through immigration policies and through not cracking down on extremism that has grown in communities. What are you going to do for us? So we're calm, but I do think we demand answers.""

Parliament Square, Westminster Bridge and several surrounding streets remain cordoned off by police. Scores of unarmed officers in bright yellow jackets were staffing the perimeter tape, guiding confused civil servants trying to get to work.

Metropolitan Police counterterrorism chief Mark Rowley revised the death toll from five to four: the police officer, two civilians and the attacker. He said that 29 people required hospitalization and seven of them were in critical condition. He also said that authorities were still working out the number of ""walking wounded."" Police had previously given the total number of injured as around 40.

President Trump was among world leaders offering condolences. Former President Obama tweeted that this attack would not ""shake the strength and resilience of our British ally.""

London has been a target for terrorism many times over past decades. Just this weekend, hundreds of armed police took part in an exercise simulating a ""marauding"" terrorist attack on the River Thames.

May underscored that the attack targeted ""free people everywhere,"" and she said she had a response: ""You will not defeat us.""

""Let this be the message from this House and this nation today: our values will prevail,"" she said.

Armed and unarmed patrols have been stepped up as a precaution across the country, according to Rowley.

A full counter-terrorism investigation is underway.

Police said a vehicle mowed down pedestrians on London's Westminster Bridge, leaving more than a dozen with injuries described as catastrophic.

Rowley said the car then crashed near to Parliament, and one man - armed with a knife - continued the attack and tried to enter Parliament.

The knife-wielding attacker stabbed a police officer and was shot on the grounds outside Britain's Parliament, sending the compound into lockdown for hours.

The threat level for international terrorism in the U.K. was already listed at severe, and will remain so, according to May. The attack came on the one-year anniversary of the terror attacks in Brussels in which 32 people were killed and more than 300 injured.

UK PARLIAMENT ATTACK: ISIS SYMPATHIZERS CELEBRATING ON SOCIAL MEDIA

ISIS has long promoted the use of vehicles and knives in attacks by so-called ""lone wolf"" terrorists, particularly in Western countries. Senior U.S. officials expected an uptick of terror attacks in Europe as they ramp up the fight to take ISIS capital Raqqa, Fox News is told.

The terrorist group has not claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack, but a European government official told Reuters that investigators are considering the possibility the attack was inspired by ISIS propaganda.

London police were called to the Parliament building at around 2:40 p.m. local time (10:40 a.m. EST) after reports of a vehicle crashing into a crowd at Westminster Bridge near Britain's parliament.

The French prime minister said French high school students were among the injured on Wednesday.

Colleen Anderson of St Thomas' Hospital said a woman died after a vehicle apparently hit pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, near Parliament, according to the Press Association.

Anderson said: ""There were people across the bridge. There were some with minor injuries, some catastrophic. Some had injuries they could walk away from or who have life-changing injuries.""

A woman was also pulled alive from River Thames. The Port of London Authority said the female member of the public was recovered from the river, injured but alive.

Rick Longley told the Press Association that he heard a bang and saw a car plow into pedestrians and come to a crashing stop. Images from the scene showed pedestrians sprawled on the ground, with blood streaming from a woman surrounded by a scattering of postcards.

""They were just laying there and then the whole crowd just surged around the corner by the gates just opposite Big Ben,"" he said. ""A guy came past my right shoulder with a big knife and just started plunging it into the policeman. I have never seen anything like that. I just can't believe what I just saw.""

The former Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski posted a video on Twitter that seems to show people lying injured in the road on Westminster Bridge.

Sikorski, a senior fellow at the Harvard Centre for European Studies, says he saw at least five people lying on the ground after being ""mown down"" by a car.

Sikorski told the BBC he ""heard what I thought what I thought was just a collision and then I looked through the window of the taxi and someone down, obviously in great distress.

""Then I saw a second person down, and I started filming, then I saw three more people down, one of them bleeding profusely.""

PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY RUSHED TO SAFETY AFTER ATTACK OUTSIDE UK PARLIAMENT

Prime Minister Theresa May was rushed to safety after the attack.

""The thoughts of the PM and the government are with those killed and injured in this appalling incident, and with their families,"" May's office said in a statement.

In a prime-time address to the nation outside 10 Downing Street, May praised the ""exceptional bravery"" of police, and thanked them and other emergency services ""on behalf of the whole country.""

May said it was ""no accident"" the attacker chose Parliament, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law.

The White House condemned the attacks, adding that President Trump is continuing to monitor developments out of London.

Spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday Trump spoke with May and said that the White House applauds ""the quick response of British police and first responders.""

The White House said Trump ""pledged the full cooperation and support of the United States Government in responding to the attack and bringing those responsible to justice.""

The U.S. State Department said it is closely monitoring the incident and urged Americans in London to avoid the area.

Spokesman Mark Toner said Wednesday: ""We stand ready to assist in any way the U.K. authorities would find helpful.""

He added that the U.S. Embassy in London is closely following the news and stands ready to help any affected Americans.

""Our hearts go out to those affected,"" Toner said.

Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the British government's ""top priority"" is the security of its people, following the attack.

""The British people will be united in working together to defeat those who would harm our shared values: values of democracy, tolerance and the rule of law,"" Rudd said in a clip broadcast on Sky News.

Daily Mail journalist Quentin Letts said he saw a man in black attack a police officer outside Parliament before being shot two or three times as he tried to storm into the House of Commons.

""He had something in his hand, it looked like a stick of some sort, and he was challenged by a couple of policemen in yellow jackets,"" Letts told the BBC. ""And one of the yellow-jacketed policemen fell down and we could see the man in black moving his arm in a way that suggested he was stabbing or striking the yellow-jacketed policeman.""

Dennis Burns, who was just entering Parliament for a meeting, told the Press Association he heard a radio message saying an officer had been stabbed. Police and security rushed outside as he was going in.

""When I got inside I was wondering what the hell was going on and I saw dozens of panicked people running down the street,"" he said. ""The first stream was around 30 people and the second stream was 70 people. It looked like they were running for their lives.""

UK PARLIAMENT ATTACK IS THE LATEST TERROR SCARE FOR LONDON

British security has thwarted some 13 terror plots over the past four years, but the UK has largely been spared major international terror attacks such as the ones seen in Belgium and France.

387,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/02/mcconnell-vows-gorsuch-confirmation-this-week-says-nuclear-option-in-hands-democrats.html,2,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday that Judge Neil Gorsuch will be confirmed this week to the Supreme Court but acknowledged Republicans still might not have enough support from Senate Democrats to avoid their attempts to slow or try to stop the nomination process with a filibuster.

“We’re going to get Judge Gorsuch confirmed this week,” McConnell, R-Ky., told “Fox News Sunday.”

Gorsuch, President Trump’s pick to fill the high court seat of conservative Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, will almost certainly have enough votes early this week in the GOP-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee but will struggle to get 60 votes for final confirmation by Friday. (Scalia died in February 2016.)

Republicans have 52 senators in the chamber and will need the support of eight Democrats to get Gorsuch confirmed in a straight floor vote.

Without Democratic support, McConnell could get Gorsuch confirmed with a parliamentary maneuver known as the “nuclear option,"" which would break the filibuster and get him confirmed on a simple 51-vote majority.

McConnell said Sunday that Gorsuch “deserves to be confirmed” and “will ultimately be confirmed.” But he would not commit to using the so-called nuclear option, arguing he’s still not sure how Democrats will vote.

“We’ll know through the course of the week,” he said. “It’s in the hands of Democrats.”

McConnell also argued, as he and fellow Republicans have repeatedly said in recent weeks, that Democrats in 2013 used parliamentary tactics to end debate and used the filibuster during the nomination process for lower court judges."
388,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/05/susan-rice-saga-murky-allegations-and-media-reluctance.html,2,"The Susan Rice situation is murky, but one thing that’s crystal clear is that she’s changing her story.

And that is raising a whole lot of questions about the tangled allegations that the Obama administration “unmasked” Donald Trump or his associates when they were picked up on foreign intercepts.

When Rice was asked about this by PBS’s Judy Woodruff a couple of weeks ago, the former national security adviser said she knew nothing about it and was just learning about it from news reports.

But in the wake of reports by Fox News and Bloomberg’s Eli Lake that Rice had done the unmasking, she broke her silence yesterday on MSNBC.

“It was not uncommon” to make these requests and “necessary” to do her job, Rice told Andrea Mitchell. She needed to know the names of the Americans picked up on the intercepts, but it’s “absolutely false” to say this was done “for political purposes.”

So she’s now gone from professed ignorance to nothing improper.

In fairness to Rice, it may turn out that what she did was perfectly legal. But there are now a whole host of troubling questions.

Did she seek the identities of Trump folks solely for intelligence reasons, or did she have political motivations?

Who did she share the information with?

Did she leak any of the findings, or cause them to be leaked? Rice denied leaking anything to do with her successor, Michael Flynn, whose false denials about contacts with the Russian ambassador led President Trump to fire him. “I leaked nothing to nobody and never have and never would,” she said.

This brings us to the role of the media.

Since the allegations were minimized yesterday by the Washington Post and New York Times (with the Times depicting them as something bouncing around conservative media), some critics on the right say they are covering for Rice. ABC and NBC didn't cover them on Monday's evening newscasts, while the ""CBS Evening News"" quoted a former official as saying Rice did ""nothing improper or political.""

I’d suggest the situation is complicated. It looks to me that many news outlets were unable to confirm the allegations, which raises the dilemma of whether you publish something based on other outlets citing unnamed sources when your own reporters can’t verify it.

Of course, some of these same outlets have run with stories, also involving anonymous sources, about alleged collusion between Trump associates and Russia.

It’s fair to say they are more enthusiastic about that story.

But there’s a difference between not confirming publishing allegations and denigrating them, which is what some at CNN have been doing.

Anchor Don Lemon told viewers “we will not insult your intelligence” by suggesting the Trump team was spied on illegally, “nor will we aid and abet the people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion.”

How does Lemon know it’s a diversion? Shouldn’t he want to know all the facts? It’s true that the latest story does not confirm Trump’s original charge that the previous administration targeted him for wiretapping, but that doesn’t mean other surveillance was properly handled.

CNN’s national security correspondent, Jim Sciutto, was equally condescending, saying the Bloomberg scoop on Rice was “largely ginned up, partly as a distraction from this larger investigation.”

Not only is Sciutto dismissing legitimate questions, he worked for the Obama State Department as a diplomat from 2011 to 2013. I think the better course would have been to recuse himself.

Right now the media are on two different planets: Those more interested in proving a Russia/Trump conspiracy and those more interested in proving an Obama surveillance conspiracy. Hard facts are hard to come by, but it would be nice if the same standards were applied to both parts of this bizarre story."
389,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/31/trump-backs-flynn-says-ex-adviser-should-seek-immunity-amid-witch-hunt.html,2,"President Trump said Friday that his former national security adviser is right to seek immunity in exchange for answering questions on Russia, tweeting that Mike Flynn is caught up in a “witch hunt” of “historic proportion.”

Flynn’s attorney said Thursday that the retired general is in discussions with the House and Senate intelligence committees, indicating he wants immunity from ""unfair prosecution"" in exchange for answering questions on potential ties between Russia and Trump campaign associates.

Attorney Robert Kelner said Flynn “certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,” but claimed he’s operating in a “highly politicized, witch hunt environment” and wants assurances.

Trump echoed that sentiment Friday.

“Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!” he tweeted.

A congressional aide confirmed to the Associated Press that discussions with the Senate intelligence committee involved immunity.

Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin.

Since July, the FBI has been conducting a counterintelligence investigation into Russia's interference in the election and possible coordination with Trump associates.

Four other Trump associates have come forward in recent weeks, saying they would talk to the committees. As of Wednesday, the Senate intelligence committee had asked to interview 20 people as part of the probe.

Trump and allied Republicans, though, say a bigger problem is the leaking of sensitive information and potential surveillance of Trump associates under the prior administration. FBI Director James Comey has denied Trump’s specific charge of wiretapping ordered by the former president, but House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes says he’s learned some Trump team communications were incidentally collected during the transition – information he apparently found out with help from White House aides, a detail that has only fueled Democratic complaints.

In his statement, Kelner said the political climate in which Flynn is facing ""claims of treason and vicious innuendo"" is factoring into his negotiations with the committees.

Flynn was fired from his job as Trump's first national security adviser after it was disclosed that he misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition.

In the weeks after he resigned, Flynn and his business registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents for $530,000 worth of lobbying work that could have benefited the Turkish government.

The lobbying occurred while Flynn was a top Trump campaign adviser. The Turkish businessman who hired Flynn, Ekim Alptekin, has told the AP that Flynn's firm registered under pressure from the Justice Department.

The meeting took place at President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago south Florida estate and was led by White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who with Bannon was told by the president on Thursday to “work this out.”

The White House is trying to downplay and dismiss reports about infighting, as Trump attempts to capitalize on his efforts this week on Syria and the Senate on Friday confirming Judge Neil Gorsuch, the president’s Supreme Court nominee, to the high court.

Reports about infighting, and efforts to dismiss them, have slowed the Republican administration essentially since its start, with talk about Trump firing Priebus.

However, several White House and administration source this weekend dismissed stories about a major White House shakeup and Priebus’ ouster.

“He is staying,” a source said.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Fox News on Friday: ""The only thing we are shaking up is the way Washington operates.”

Still, the schism between Kushner and Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, is apparent and has its roots in Trump’s unconventional, outsider White House campaign in which they each played a major role.

Supporters for Bannon, a former executive for Brietbart News, which gave voice to Trump’s so-called “alt-right” supporters during the campaign, are at odds with Kushner, a 36-year-old New York entrepreneur, and his faction. The Bannon side purportedly calls the Kushner side “the Democrats.”

Bannon's removal earlier in the week from the National Security Council apparently exacerbated the feud.

“Some stories are made to distract from the success that (Trump) has had this week,” White House special counsel Kellyanne Conway said Friday, hours after the GOP-led Senate confirmed Gorsuch to the high court.

Overnight Thursday, the U.S. military carried out a Trump ordered airstrike on a Syria airbase, after the regime of President Bashar Assad apparently executed a chemical weapons attack on civilians earlier in the week."

Roy Cooper said late Wednesday that they have agreed on legislation to resolve a standoff over the state's ""bathroom bill"" through a replacement measure that still restricts LGBT nondiscrimination protections.

GOP leaders announced the new legislation would be debated and voted on Thursday—at about 9:15 a.m. ET-- but it was unclear whether there were enough House and Senate votes to pass it.

Cooper, who ran successfully last fall on a platform that included repealing House Bill 2, said in a release that he supported the compromise.

Make no mistake: This newest #HB2 proposal is a bad deal that does not actually #RepealHB2. Instead, it doubles-down on discrimination. — HumanRightsCampaign (@HRC) March 30, 2017

""It's not a perfect deal, but it repeals House Bill 2 and begins to repair our reputation,"" he said.

Leaders of LGBT rights groups were incensed about the anticipated proposal and vowed political punishment for elected officials who support it.

Chris Sgro, the executive director of Equality NC, told The Charlotte Observer that the proposed deal “would continue to actively discriminate against the LGBT community.”

The late-night work came as the NCAA has said North Carolina sites won't be considered for championship events from 2018 to 2022 ""absent any change"" in the March 2016 law known as House Bill 2, which it views as discrimination. The NCAA said decisions would be made starting this week on events.

I urge #NCGA & @NC_Governor to finally stick with this deal that still respects privacy and let Supreme Court resolve issue for our nation. — Pat McCrory (@PatMcCroryNC) March 30, 2017

The announcement came after days of “marathon, often contentious negotiations,” The Observer reported.

HB2 has prompted some businesses to halt expansions and entertainers and sports organizations to cancel or move events, including the NBA All-Star game in Charlotte. An Associated Press analysis this week found that HB2 already will cost the state more than $3.76 billion in lost business over a dozen years.

The new proposal would repeal HB2 but would leave state legislators in charge of policy on public multi-stall restrooms. Local governments also couldn't pass ordinances extending nondiscrimination covering things like sexual orientation and gender identity until December 2020. That temporary moratorium, according to House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger, would allow time for pending federal litigation over transgender issues to play out.

""Compromise requires give and take from all sides, and we are pleased this proposal fully protects bathroom safety and privacy,"" Berger and Moore said in a prepared statement.

Moore and Berger made the announcement after several hours of private meetings among lawmakers, with the two shuttling between their corner offices at the Legislative Building. GOP lawmakers and Cooper have been grappling for months over what to do about HB2, which the Republican-controlled legislature passed in response to a Charlotte ordinance that allowed transgender people to use restroom aligned with their gender identity.

Cooper narrowly defeated GOP Gov. Pat McCrory, who signed the law. A potential compromise failed during a special session in December, when Cooper was governor-elect.

Social conservatives want HB2 to remain in place, saying ordinances like the one in Charlotte make it easy for male sexual predators to enter public restrooms designated for the opposite sex.

Anything except a full repeal — nothing else — has drawn opposition from gay rights groups, who responded before the announcement to anticipated provisions in the legislation.

""At its core, it's a statewide prohibition on equality,"" Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin told reporters earlier Wednesday as details of the proposal began surfacing. ""Just like we did with ... McCrory, we will hold all elected officials accountable — Democrats and Republicans — who target our community by advancing this statewide ban on nondiscrimination protections.""

392,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/11/tillerson-issues-ultimatum-to-russia-after-meeting-with-top-diplomats-at-g7-summit.html,2,"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson issued a stern ultimatum to Russia Tuesday: side with America and its allies on Syria, or stand alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad, Iran and the militant group Hezbollah.

""We want to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people. Russia can be a part of that future and play an important role,"" Tillerson added in remarks to reporters following urgent meetings in Italy with top diplomats. ""Or Russia can maintain its alliance with this group, which we believe is not going to serve Russia's interests longer term.

""We cannot let this happen again,"" he added.

The meeting of “likeminded” countries was arranged on the sidelines of the summit of the Group of 7 industrialized economies days after the U.S. launched airstrikes against Assad’s forces, and hours before Tillerson is scheduled to make a tense trip to Moscow to pressure Russia’s leaders to end their support for Assad.

Tillerson said it was unclear whether Russia had failed to take seriously its obligation to rid Syria of chemical weapons, or had merely been incompetent. But he said the distinction ""doesn't much matter to the dead.""

""It is clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,"" he said. ""But the question of how that ends and the transition itself could be very important in our view to the durability, the stability inside of a unified Syria.""

In addition to G-7 countries, diplomats at the summit are attending from Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and others. The inclusion of the countries is important because the U.S. strategy for Syria involves enlisting help from Middle East nations to ensure security and stability in Syria after ISIS is defeated.

Diplomats made no remarks as photographers were allowed in briefly for the start of the meeting. The session lasted about an hour.

Tillerson, who has been largely out of the public eye, was visible during last week’s announcement of the response to the gruesome chemical attack, fielding questions from reporters on and off camera, and then captured in an official White House photo seated next to President Trump as they heard the result of the 59 cruise missiles that struck a Syrian military base.

Tillerson and U.S. officials have projected a sense of urgency about the Syria crisis, but have failed to set a strategy on how Assad must go, how to protect displaced Syrians and whether the U.S. should take further action. Successive attempts by top Trump administration officials to articulate a plan have only furthered the appearance of a policy still evolving.

""We rededicate ourselves to holding to account any and all who commit crimes against the innocents anywhere in the world,"" Tillerson said Monday while visiting Sant'Anna di Stazzema, a Tuscan village where the Nazis massacred more than 500 civilians during World War II.

Leading up to the U.S. missile attack, Trump's administration had said that Assad's future was up to the Syrian people. Then Trump, the day after the assault, said his thinking about Assad had changed. Tillerson answered a question about effecting regime change by saying the U.S. was organizing a coalition to do just that.

Tillerson, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and the other ministers aim to pressure Russia to end its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after a tumultuous week, which included the nerve gas attack and the U.S.’ airstrikes on a Syrian air base.

The U.S. received broad support from Europe after the airstrikes. Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano, who is hosting the meeting, said the missile strike contributed to a “renewed harmony” between the U.S. and its partners ahead of the first meeting of G7 foreign ministers since President Trump took office.

""We need to remember that not 10 years ago, but 100 or 120 days ago, the concern in Europe was that the United States and the EU were moving apart,"" Alfano told Sky TG24 Sunday. ""I welcome this renewed harmony.""

With ties between the U.S. and Europe seemingly getting better, there has been no indication President Vladimir Putin was going to move from his position on the Assad regime in Syria.

Russia and Iran said in a joint statement Sunday that the countries would “respond to any aggression” in wake of the airstrikes in Syria.

“What America waged in an aggression on Syria is a crossing of red lines,” the countries said, The Sun reported. “From now on we will respond with force to any aggressor or any breach of red lines from whoever it is and America knows our ability to respond well.”

H.R. McMaster, President Trump’s national security adviser, said in an interview on “Fox News Sunday” that Russia should re-evaluate its support for Assad. He added that Russia will have to decide whether it wanted to continue backing a “murderous regime” as Trump weighed the next steps against Syria.

Tillerson is expected to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov after the G7 meeting.

394,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/04/09/egypt-church-bombing-kills-at-least-21.html,2,"Egypt's president called for a three-month state of emergency Sunday after at least 44 people were killed and more than 100 more were injured in two Palm Sunday suicide attacks at Coptic Christian churches, each carried out by the ISIS terror group.

Sunday's first blast happened at St. George Church in the Nile Delta town of Tanta, where at least 27 people were killed and 78 others wounded, officials said.

Television footage showed the inside of the church, where a large number of people gathered around what appeared to be lifeless, bloody bodies covered with papers.

A second explosion – which Egypt’s Interior Ministry says was caused by a suicide bomber who tried to storm St. Mark's Cathedral in the coastal city of Alexandria -- left at least 17 dead, and 48 injured. The attack came just after Pope Tawadros II -- leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria -- finished services, but aides told local media that he was unharmed.

At least three police officers were killed in the St. Mark’s attack, the ministry told The Associated Press.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks via its Aamaq media agency, following the group's recent video vowing to step up attacks against Christians, who the group describes as ""infidels"" empowering the West against Muslims.

'CHRISTIANS ARE OUR FAVORITE PREY,' ISIS SAYS

The blasts came at the start of Holy Week leading up to Easter, and just weeks before Pope Francis is due to visit Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country.

Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi accused unnamed countries of fueling instability in the country, adding ""Egyptians have foiled plots and efforts by countries and fascist, terrorist organizations that tried to control Egypt."" El-Sisi ordered the immediate deployment of troops to assist police in protecting vital facilities across the country.

El-Sisi did not immediately detail the legal measures needed to declare the state of emergency but according to the Egyptian constitution, the parliament majority must vote in favor of the state of emergency.



President Donald Trump tweeted that he is ""so sad to hear of the terrorist attack"" against the U.S. ally but added that he has ""great confidence"" that el-Sissi, ""will handle the situation properly."" The two leaders met at the White House on April 3.

The State Department issued its own statement condemning the attacks, which it called ""barbaric.""

""The United States will continue to support Egypt's security and stability in its efforts to defeat terrorism,"" the statement said.

""Either a bomb was planted or someone blew himself up,"" provincial governor Ahmad Deif told the state-run Nile TV channel, Sky News reported.

The attack in Tanta was the latest in a series of assaults on Egypt's Christian minority, which makes up around 10 percent of the population and has been repeatedly targeted by Islamic extremists.

Grand Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, head of Egypt's Al-Azhar — the leading center of learning in Sunni Islam — condemned the attacks, calling them a ""despicable terrorist bombing that targeted the lives of innocents.""

Across the street from St. George, neighbor Susan Mikhail, whose apartment has a clear balcony view of the church and its front yard, said the explosion violently shook her building midmorning, at a time when the church was packed.

""Deacons were the first to run out of the church. Many of them had blood on their white robes,"" she told The Associated Press. Later, the more seriously wounded started to come out, carried in the arms of survivors and ferried to hospitals in private cars, she

said.

Pope Francis decried the bombings, expressing ""deep condolences to my brother, Pope Tawadros II, the Coptic church and all of the dear Egyptian nation."" Word of the attacks came as Francis was holding Palm Sunday services in St. Peter's Square.

Both Israel and the Islamic Hamas movement ruling neighboring Gaza also condemned the bombings.

Turkey also condemned the attacks.

Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin tweeted his condolences and said, ""We strongly condemn the heinous terror attacks on churches in Egypt on Palm Sunday today.""

Mehmet Gormez, the head of religious affairs in Turkey, ""cursed"" the attacks and said they are the shared problem of all humanity.

""The immunity of a place of worship, no matter the religion it belongs to, cannot be violated and the bloodthirsty killing of innocent worshippers cannot ever be forgiven,"" Gormez said in an official statement.

Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also published a statement denouncing the attack on St. George Church.

""We convey our condolences to the bereaved families and the whole people of Egypt,"" the statement said before a second attack hit an Alexandria church.

The bombings add to fears that Islamic extremists who have long been battling security forces in the Sinai Peninsula are shifting their focus to civilians.

A local Islamic State affiliate claimed a suicide bombing at a church in Cairo in December that killed around 30 people, mostly women, as well as a string of killings in the restive Sinai Peninsula that caused hundreds of Christians to flee to safer areas of the country. The group has threatened further attacks.

A militant group called Liwa al-Thawra claimed responsibility for an April 1 bomb attack targeting a police training center in Tanta, which wounded 16 people. The group, believed to be linked to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood,has mainly targeted security forces and distanced itself from attacks on Christians.

Egypt has struggled to combat a wave of Islamic militancy since the 2013 military overthrow of an elected Islamist president.

395,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/04/13/north-korea-preparing-for-sixth-nuclear-test-monitoring-group-says.html,2,"North Korea may soon conduct its sixth nuclear test in the face of the United States' decision to move a carrier group toward the region.

Satellite imagery shows activity at the Punggye-ri testing site, analysts from 38 North, a U.S. research institute that monitors North Korea, wrote on its website Wednesday.

Foreign journalists inside the country were told to prepare for a ""big and important event"" Thursday, Reuters reported.

The analysts added that there was movement around one of the portals and in the main administrative area of the site as well as personnel seen at the command center.

South Korean officials downplayed any news signs that a test was coming, Bloomberg reported. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Roh Jae-cheon told reporters that Seoul saw no signs that North Korea was preparing any sort of provocative actions. Officials added that Pyongyang has maintained such readiness that it could conduct a missile test without warning, according to Reuters.

Chinese President Xi Jingping told Trump in a phone call Wednesday that he wants a peaceful solution to ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and would be willing to work with Washington on the matter.

""China insists on realizing the denuclearization of the peninsula ... and is willing to maintain communication and coordination with the American side over the issue on the peninsula,"" Xi was quoted as saying by state media.

Trump had warned North Korea Tuesday that he vowed to get Kim Jong –Un’s regime under control with or without China’s help.

Meanwhile, North Korea said Monday it would “hold the U.S. wholly accountable for the catastrophic consequences” if there was any further military action after the USS Carl Vinson arrives in the area of the Korean Peninsula.

396,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/04/15/north-korea-rolls-out-missiles-other-weaponry-at-annual-parade.html,2,"North Korea paraded its intercontinental ballistic missiles on Saturday in a massive military display in central Pyongyang amid rising tensions across the region.

Kim Jong-Un did not speak during the parade, the annual highlight of North Korea's most important holiday, which celebrates the 1912 birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the country’s founding ruler.

One of Kim’s top officials warned that North Korea would stand up to any threat posed by the United States. Choe Ryong Hae said President Donald Trump was guilty of ""creating a war situation"" on the Korean Peninsula by dispatching U.S. forces to the region. Outside analysts consider Choe to be North Korea's number two official.

""We will respond to an all-out war with an all-out war and a nuclear war with our style of a nuclear attack,"" Choe said.

The parade came amid growing international worries that North Korea may be preparing for its sixth nuclear test or a major missile launch, such as its first flight test of an ICBM capable of reaching U.S. shores.

But if the parade signaled a readiness for war, North Korea has long insisted that its goal is peace — and its own survival — with its growing arsenal a way to ensure that the government in Pyongyang is not easily overthrown.

North Korea saw the toppling of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Moammar Gadhafi in Libya — neither of whom had nuclear weapons — as proof of the weapons' power.

""It will be the largest of miscalculations if the United States treats us like Iraq and Libya, which are living out miserable fates as victims of aggression, and Syria, which didn't respond immediately even after it was attacked,"" said a Friday statement by the general staff of the North Korean army, according to the official Korean Central News Agency.

U.S. retaliatory strikes against Syria over a chemical weapons attack on civilians, coupled with Trump dispatching what he called an ""armada"" of ships to the region in a show of force, touched off fears in South Korea that the United States was preparing for military action against the North.

Pyongyang has also expressed anger over the ongoing annual spring military exercises the U.S. holds with South Korea, which it considers a rehearsal for invasion.

U.S. officials said on Friday that Trump’s advisers weighed a range of ideas for how to get North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. U.S. officials told The Associated Press that the administration had settled on a policy that will emphasize increasing pressure on Pyongyang with the help of China, North Korea's only major ally, instead of military options or trying to overthrow Kim's regime.

A U.S. military official, who spoke on anonymity, said the U.S. doesn't intend to use military force against North Korea in response to either a nuclear test or a missile launch.

Kim was greeted Saturday with thunderous applause as he stepped into view on a large podium, clapping to acknowledge the thousands of soldiers and civilians taking part in the parade at Kim Il Sung Square.

A series of what appeared to be KN-08 missiles were among the weaponry rolled out on trucks. Military analysts say the missiles could one day be capable of hitting targets as far as the continental United States, although North Korea has yet to flight test them.

The parade also included large rockets covered by canisters in two different types of transporter erector launcher trucks, or TELs.

Other military hardware at the parade included tanks, multiple rocket launchers and artillery, as well as a solid-fuel missile designed to be fired from submarines. Also on display was a powerful midrange missile that outside analysts call a ""Musudan,"" and which can potentially reach U.S. air bases in Guam, as well as a new solid-fuel midrange missile that can be fired from land mobile launchers, making them harder to detect before launch.

Kim emphasizes nuclear weapons as the foundation of his national defense strategy. During his New Year's address, Kim said the country’s preparations for an ICBM launch had ""reached the final stage.""

Satellite imagery suggests North Korea could conduct another underground nuclear test at any time. The country conducted two nuclear tests last year. North Korea also launched a long-range rocket last year that put a satellite into orbit, which Washington, Seoul and others saw as a banned test of missile technology.

397,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/04/13/mother-all-bombs-moab-has-been-dropped-on-afghanistan-heres-what-it-does-and-doesnt-mean.html,2,"On April 13, at 7:32 pm local time, U.S. Forces in Afghanistan struck an ISIS tunnel complex in Nangahar Province. What made this strike more newsworthy than most was its use of a GBU-43 bomb.

The Massive Ordnance Air Burst Bomb (MOAB), known more colloquially as the “mother of all bombs” is the most powerful conventional bomb in the U.S. arsenal.

The commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson noted that “this is the right munition to reduce these obstacles and maintain the momentum of our offensive against ISIS-K” (the Afghan branch of ISIS).

The MOAB was developed in 2002, but had never been used in combat. Thus, the strike in Nangahar Province will inevitably spark speculation about what it all means. Does this represent an escalation of the Afghan war effort? Is it another, extremely loud signal of seriousness from the Trump administration? Was it a response to the death of Staff Sergeant Mark De Alencar, a Special Forces soldier who was killed April 8 in the same province?

Most likely the MOAB was used for a simple reason: it was the right bomb for the right target.

Most likely, however, the MOAB was used for a far simpler reason: it was the right bomb for the right target.

Despite some reports to the contrary, the destructive force of the MOAB is nowhere near that of a nuclear weapon. The MOAB has the force of 11 tons of TNT. For comparison, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 had the force of 15 thousand tons of TNT.

The MOAB is designed to destroy surface targets in a contained environment such as a valley or a cave system. It does not have the capability to penetrate deeply into terrain and destroy a deeply buried target. It is, however, imminently well-suited to collapsing cave openings and killing combatants within the local area.

Now, consider Thursday’s target. Nangahar Province is a deeply mountainous area, making normal military operations difficult. In 2001, Usama bin Laden was believed to have taken refuge in caves in the Tora Bora region of the province. Back then, the U.S. used large BLU-82 15,000 lb. bombs, known as “daisy cutters” in an attempt to seal and deny the use of caves to bin Laden and his followers. The MOAB was not available then.

The MOAB contains a few thousand pounds more explosive than the BLU-82 daisy cutter. It also incorporates improvements in delivery, making it more precise than the daisy cutter.

Given the difficulty of military movement in the province, the MOAB is an excellent choice for reducing enemy infrastructure and forces in the area. For those reasons, the use of the MOAB probably represents neither an escalation nor a change in strategy or tactics by the Trump administration. It’s just the appropriate matching of ordnance to target.

Some will try to link the use of the MOAB to the death of Staff Sergeant De Alencar. That link does not align with U.S. past operational methods. U.S. forces do not operate on principles of retaliation or response. Rather, they apply military force to achieve specific outcomes based on the theater strategy. In this case, U.S. forces in Afghanistan have set the goal to destroy ISIS-K in Afghanistan.

Standing rules of engagement govern how U.S. forces employ deadly force to achieve effects and minimize civilian casualties. Even though the bomb was bigger than normal, the commanders involved in this operation are bound by those same rules. As Gen. Nicholson emphasized: “U.S. Forces took every precaution to avoid civilian casualties.”

It’s reassuring to note that Gen. Nicholson and the U.S. forces in Afghanistan appear to have been given the liberty to prosecute the war in the manner they think most effective, while at the same time, adhering to the standing rules of engagement."
398,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/04/07/gorsuch-confirmed-why-our-new-justice-may-be-even-better-than-scalia.html,2,"In spite of a scorched-earth campaign by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Neil Gorsuch has been confirmed to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia’s untimely death last year.

Gorsuch’s nomination was one of the most significant actions of the Trump presidency so far, and his confirmation will now have profound implications for our nation over the next several decades.

Here are four reasons why American citizens—especially Evangelical conservatives—should consider Gorsuch’s confirmation a great victory and why he might be better even than Scalia, whose place on the bench he would take.

1. He as a proven record defending religious liberty.

The First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution declares, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” This amendment is deeply significant because it declares that every citizen is free to hold his or her own convictions about ultimate reality, align his or her life with those convictions, and do so openly and without fear.

Justice Gorsuch has a proven track record defending religious liberty, stronger in fact than Scalia’s, as Nathan Diament noted recently. Two of the weightiest examples are Hobby Lobby (2013) and Little Sisters of the Poor (2015), cases heard by Judge Gorsuch and the 10th Circuit of Appeals. In both cases the defendants successfully invoked the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (1993) as reason to overturn the Obamacare contraceptive mandate, arguing that the mandate would force them to be complicit in actions that their faith prohibits.

2. He will interpret the law rather than arbitrate morality.

In a 2009 speech entitled, “Mullahs of the West: Judges as Moral Arbiters,” the late Justice Scalia lamented that many Americans have placed their faith in Supreme Court justices to give our nation moral guidance. Yet, the Constitution of the United States specifically guards against giving the justices such mullah-like power; it gives the “We the People” the right to decide questions of moral profundity.

Sadly, certain federal judges have taken this right away from us by embracing a “living document” view of the Constitution. This progressive view contends that judges have the right to reinterpret the Constitution in light of “the times.” It’s overall effect is that a SCOTUS majority can remove things from the Constitution that they do not like and insert things they do. The “living document” view enabled the Roe v. Wade (1973) and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) decisions.

We are not saying that the Constitution might never need to be revised or updated again in light of “the times.” Instead, we are saying that our Founding Fathers made clear amendment to the Constitution must reflect the will of the people; an amendment requires an overwhelming Congressional majority and ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures.

Justice Gorsuch—like Justice Scalia before him—rejects the “living document” view. He would refrain from the type of judicial activism that bypasses the will of the people.

3. He may be willing to reject unconstitutional precedents.

The most contentious debate, however, concerns the legal principle of stare decisis. A Latin phrase, stare decisis means that judges should respect legal precedents by letting them stand instead of overturning them. It is important to note, however, that stare decisis is not found in the Constitution or the Bill or Rights; it is not the law of the land, but a “rule of thumb.”

As Constitutional lawyer Robert McFarland points out , a number of Democratic congressmen have taken a sudden interest in this legal principle. But for what reason? There is no evidence that these Congressmen have an affection for the legal principle, in and of itself.

They wouldn’t want to let Plessy v. Ferguson (which established segregation) stand, would they? Of course not. Were they concerned about it during Obergefell v. Hodges? No, not a peep. Yet, suddenly they are interested because a strict adherence to stare decisis might safeguard certain of the left’s favorite decisions, even if those decisions were unconstitutional or poorly reasoned.

Justice Gorsuch likely would not adhere strictly to stare decisis; there is reason to believe he would reject the precedent of previous SCOTUS decisions if and when he thinks the courts have gotten it wrong.

4. No Need for Mullahs on the Supreme Court

Americans—especially Evangelicals—stand to benefit from Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation. He will defend religious liberty. He will confine himself to interpreting the law rather than setting himself up as a moral arbiter. And he may be willing to overturn bad legal precedents in which former jurists set themselves up as moral arbiters.

In so doing, he will send a message to the political community that we have no need for mullahs at 1 First Street in Washington."
399,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/15/tax-march-turns-into-demand-for-trumps-irs-filings-20-reported-arrests.html,2,"Thousands of protesters turned out Saturday in events across the country to demand President Trump release his full IRS returns, mostly large-but-peaceful events with several arrests reported in California.

That the events were held on the deadline for hundreds of millions of Americans to file their federal returns was largely coincidental. Their intent was to pressure Trump to release his tax documents and to help Trump opponents stake out their position ahead of the president’s pending tax reform plan.

“Today, across American we are taking the gloves off to say it’s time to knock off the tax rip-off,” Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden told a crowd of several hundred people gathered at the base of Capitol Hill.

“No more Cayman Islands tax breaks … no more Wall Street tax breaks,” he roared before the crowd marched several miles to the National Mall. “It’s time to knock off the secrecy Mr. President and release your own tax returns.”

TRUMP WON’T RELEASE TAX RETURNS

Twenty people were reportedly arrested when Trump protesters clashed with supporters in Berkley, Calif.

Several fights broke out and police in riot gear purportedly had to use pepper spray to subdue the crowd and confiscate fireworks that were set off at the event, according to The Mercury News.

Trump supporters were reportedly holding a free speech rally in a downtown park when they were met by opponents of the president and his policies, according to the newspaper.

About 150 protests were held across the county, largely organized by the group TaxMarch.org, whose executive committee includes a former Occupy Wall Street protester.

“The Tax March is a movement gaining momentum around the country to demand transparency and fairness from our commander in chief,"" the group says on its website.

That Trump will cave to the pressure and release his full tax returns appears unlikely, considering the president has said he won’t amid an ongoing IRS audit and the White House saying recently that he will not.

""Their whole message is they want to see the president's tax returns. I care far more about his policy than his tax returns,"" Trevor Dierdorff, El Paso County Republican Party chairman, told the Colorado Springs Gazette, ahead of a pro-Trump event there Saturday.

Two of the largest events are in Seattle, site of the World Trade Organization protests of the 1990s. In addition to the expected 25,000 marching in “Tax March Seattle,” as many as 7,000 Black Lives Matter activists plan to come out for their own rally focusing on Trump's tax returns.

Other events were held in Chicago, Florida and New York City.

Trump was met by protesters in south Florida, going from his golf club to his Mar-a-Lago resort home, as hundreds of people along his motorcade’s path demanded that he release his returns.

""Pay your taxes,"" several people, including some holding signs, yelled as they marched toward Mar-a-Lago.

One sign read, ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Czar, Putin Put You Where You Are,"" further making clear that Trump critics think his returns will finally reveal conclusive ties to the Kremlin, as they suspect.

Others helping organize events Saturday included labor unions and activist groups such as MoveOn.org and Common Cause.

The idea for the march has its roots in the response to a January appearance by White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. Asked her thoughts on an online petition demanding Trump release his tax returns, Conway replied that the White House would not release his tax returns and the issue was of little concern to Americans.

“We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care. They voted for him,” she said on ABC News’ “This Week.”

The comments lit up social media and grassroots organizers began circulating plans for this weekend’s events.

Voters may be split on the tax return issue. An April Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll found 53 percent of voters want Trump to release his tax returns, and 51 percent believe his returns are either very or somewhat important to them.

Whether it resonates beyond Tax Day -- which is typically April 15, though the IRS is pushing the deadline to Tuesday -- is unclear. But Democrats in Congress continue to use tax returns as a wedge issue.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said not releasing the returns would make getting bipartisan agreement on tax reform “much harder.”

In a much-hyped segment, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow also recently aired a leaked copy of part of an old Trump tax return.

But it wasn't exactly damning. The files showed Trump paid $38 million in federal income tax in 2005 on more than $150 million. The effective rate of 25 percent was higher than the rate paid by former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders."

Police have issued a nationwide search for Steve Stephens, 37, and asked residents of Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, and Michigan to be on alert.

UPDATE Homicide suspect Steve Stephens' actual vehicle has Ohio Temp tag E363630 pic.twitter.com/tE3r5u4BNN — Cleveland Police (@CLEpolice) April 17, 2017

Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said officers searched dozens of locations for Stephens with no success. The department is working with federal, state and other local agencies to find him.

“As far as we know right now, we don’t know where he’s at,"" Williams said at a Monday morning news conference. ""The last location we had him at was the homicide.”

Williams also urged Stephens to turn himself in or contact a friend, relative, or clergy.

“We definitely want to get it resolved as quickly as possible. The victim’s family deserves it,” said Williams.

“At this point he could be a lot of places,"" said Steve Anthony, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Cleveland division. ""He could be nearby, he could be far away or anywhere in-between.”

Police in Philadelphia said they have ""no indication"" Stephens is in the city despite 911 calls reporting he could be in or near Fairmount Park.

Officers were sent to check the area, and police say eight elementary schools and a high school were locked down as a precaution.

Authorities issued an arrest warrant for Stephens early Monday. He is charged with aggravated murder in the death of Robert Godwin.

Williams said detectives had spoken with Stephens via cellphone at one point, but hadn't made any other contact with him.

""Early in this investigation we did have contact with him, direct contact with our detectives,"" Williams said. ""They tried to convince him to turn himself in.""

Stephens had no previous criminal record, only ""a lot"" of traffic violations, Williams said.

The video of Godwin's murder posted to Facebook purportedly shows Stephens getting out of his car and targeting Godwin, 74, who is holding a plastic shopping bag. Stephens shouted the name of a woman, whom Godwin did not recognize.

""She's the reason that this is about to happen to you,"" Stephens told Godwin before pointing a gun at him. Godwin can be seen shielding his face with the shopping bag. The video of the killing was on the social media site for three hours before it was removed. Stephens' account also was removed.

Facebook said the suspect did go live on the social media website at one point during the day, but not during the killing. Police earlier had said that Stephens had broadcast it on Facebook Live.

Police said they have been talking with family and friends of Stephens, who is a case manager at Beech Brook, a behavioral health agency headquartered in Pepper Pike, near Cleveland.

""We were shocked and horrified to learn of this news today,"" agency spokeswoman Nancy Kortemeyer said in a statement. ""We are hoping that the Cleveland Police will be able to apprehend Mr. Stephens as soon as possible and before anyone else is injured.""

In one of the videos he posted to Facebook, Stephens can be seen holding up his Beech Brook employee identification badge.

Stephens also mentioned his fraternity, Omega Psi Phi, in one of his Facebook posts. The fraternity issued a statement Sunday night.

""On behalf of the Supreme Council and the members of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Incorporated, we lift our sincere and heartfelt prayers and condolences of comfort to the families impacted by the recent shooting in Cleveland, Ohio,"" it said.

401,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/04/15/north-koreas-latest-missile-test-fails-south-korea-says.html,2,"A North Korean missile fired from the east coast of the country Sunday “blew up almost immediately,” officials said.

The U.S. Pacific Command said the missile, which came near the city of Sinpo, “blew up almost immediately,” but the type of missile was still being assessed.

The failure came one day after Pyongyang celebrated one of the biggest propaganda events of the year – the 105th birthday of the late North Korea founder Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Un’s grandfather.

The failed launch also comes ahead of Vice President Pence’s arrival in Seoul, South Korea for talks about how to handle Kim’s regime. Pence had been in contact with President Trump about the test.

Trump did not release a statement on the launch. Defense Secretary Mattis said Trump and his military team ""are aware of North Korea's most recent unsuccessful missile launch. The president has no further comment.""

Washington and Seoul were trying to determine what North Korea exactly launched. North Korea regularly fires short-range missiles, but it is also developing mid-range and long-range missiles meant to target U.S. troops in Asia and, eventually, the U.S. mainland. North Korea is thought to have a small arsenal of atomic bombs and an impressive array of short- and medium-range missiles.

Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have quickly risen over the last week as the U.S. and South Korean conduct it is largest-ever war games and while the USS Carl Vinson steams toward waters off the coast.

Another missile test from Sinpo failed earlier this month, when the rocket spun out of control and plunged into the ocean. That launch came shortly before Trump's first meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. China is North Korea's only major ally.

The extended-range Scud missile in that earlier launch suffered an in-flight failure and fell into the sea off North Korea's east coast, according to U.S. imagery and assessments.

Despite Sunday's failure, the North's previous claim to have used ""standardized"" warheads has led to worries that it was making headway in its push to develop small and sophisticated warheads to be topped on long-range missiles.

Washington sees North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles as a threat to world security and to its Asian allies, Japan and South Korea. The United States, South Korea and other countries have vowed to apply more pressure on the North, but so far nothing has worked to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program.

Six-nation negotiations on dismantling North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for aid fell apart in early 2009.

The police officer, identified Friday as Xavier Jugele, was shot in the head Thursday by a reported Islamic radical known to police in what appeared to be the latest terror attack in the City of Lights. With Sunday’s first-round voting pitting hard-liner Marine Le Pen against a crowded field of 11 that includes a Republican, a centrist and a socialist, the event is likely to bolster National Front nominee Le Pen, analysts have said.

PARIS TERRORIST ATTACK THREATENS CITY'S REBOUNDING TOURISM, TRAVEL EXPERTS WARN

“I think this election is sufficiently unstable that it could still move things,” Bruno Jeanbart, head of political studies at pollster OpinionWay, told Bloomberg News. “Marine Le Pen is notably one to watch.”

“Marine Le Pen is notably one to watch.” — Bruno Jeanbart, OpinionWay

Le Pen, Republican Francois Fillon, centrist Emmanuel Macron and Socialist Benoit Hamon canceled Friday events and released statements vowing to get tough on terror. But Le Pen’s pledge could ring truer than most, as the 48-year-old attorney has made fighting Islamic radicalism one of the cornerstones of her campaign.

PARIS POLICE SEARCH HOME BELIEVED LINKED TO ISIS-CLAIMED ATTACK

“Because our country is at war, the response must be global, total,” Le Pen said Friday in a statement in which she criticized sitting President Francois Hollande as “weak” and “inadequate” on terror.

Le Pen, already the front-runner in Round 1, is expected to make it to a May 7 runoff, in which she would likely face either Melenchon or Fillon.

Thursday’s attack unfolded as the candidates appeared on a television news program. Although campaigning was stopped due to the incident, their appearance offered a unique opportunity for voters to see their immediate reactions.

Le Pen repeated calls for a crackdown on radical Islam, which Macron pronounced “nonsense.” Fillon called for greater cooperation with Russia and Iran and Melenchon warned that France must not give in to violence.

Although the attack left only one police officer and the killer dead, terror has been on the minds of the French for years. A January 2015 attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine targeted after mocking Islam, left a dozen dead. That was followed later in the year by coordinated attacks that killed 130 in Paris. Several other attacks have unfolded in France since then, including the shocking murder of a priest in his church in Normandy and a truck attack in Nice that killed 84.

Fillon’s position is closest to Le Pen’s, offering voters the possibility of a tough-on-terror choice without the far-right association Le Pen carries, in part due to the fact her extremist father founded the party.

“We are in a war that will last: The enemy is powerful, its networks are deep, its accomplices live among us,” Fillon said. “Some don’t seem to have understood the depth of the evil that’s attacking us and that I intend to combat with an iron fist.”

The Champs-Elysees attacker had a note defending the Islamic State terror group with him when he opened fire on police officers, anti-terrorism prosecutor Francois Molins said during a news conference. He identified the killer as Karim Cheurfi, a 39-year-old with a criminal record, and said the note apparently fell out of Cheurfi's pocket.



ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack and gave a pseudonym for the shooter, Abu Yusuf al-Beljiki, indicating he had ties to Belgium. The attacker opened fire on a police van on the avenue before being killed.

Paris' iconic Champs-Elysees boulevard was reopened and picking up its usual early-morning routine Friday. Delivery trucks were making their rounds. Traffic was going up and down the famous tree-lined street and police barriers have been taken down.

While candidates will be sidelined from the campaign trail, the attack looms large as the vote approaches. President Trump even weighed in, tweeting on Friday that the attack “will have a big effect on presidential election!”

403,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/19/georgia-congressional-race-democrat-ossoff-republican-handel-will-go-to-run-off.html,2,"A special election in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District failed to produce an outright winner Tuesday, forcing a June 20 runoff between upstart Democrat Jon Ossoff and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel.

Ossoff garnered 48 percent of the vote, falling just short of the majority threshold required in the so-called “jungle primary.” Handel was the top GOP vote-getter at 20 percent, finishing comfortably ahead of technology executive Bob Gray, who received 11 percent of the vote, and former State Senators Judson Hill and Dan Moody, who each received 9 percent of the vote.

“We are going to rally around Karen Handel,” Gray tweeted late Tuesday as it became clear he would not make the runoff. “We wish her Godspeed.”

The winner of the runoff between Handel and Ossoff will succeed Tom Price, who resigned to become Trump's health and human services secretary.

Ossoff, a 30-year-old documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide, had sought to parlay opposition to President Donald Trump into an outright victory that would have emboldened Democrats ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. His run attracted more than $8 million in donations, which largely came from outside the state.

Republicans nationally and in Georgia acknowledged before polls opened that Ossoff would top the slate of 11 Republicans, five Democrats and two independents who appeared together on one primary ballot. Earlier Tuesday, the GOP hit Ossoff hard for living outside the district, and sought to portray him as a conservatives' nightmare who would increase taxes and take away guns.

""These liberal Democrats failed to inspire voters with a candidate who couldn’t even vote for himself, received 97 percent of his donations from outside the district, and consistently lied about his own weak resume,"" the Republican National Committee said in a statement.

Ossoff acknowledged Tuesday that he lives just south of the district, in Atlanta, so that his girlfriend is close to her work at Emory University's medical complex.

Republican groups ran a blitz of ads trying to tie Ossoff to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; a political action committee backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. has spent more than $2 million on those and other attacks.

Trump himself posted several messages on Twitter encouraging Republicans to vote in the special election and recorded a get-out-the-vote call, saying “""Liberal Democrats from outside of Georgia are spending millions and millions of dollars trying to take your Republican congressional seat away from you. Don’t let them do it.”

Trump posted another tweet early Wednesday, saying “Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG ""R"" win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help!”

National attention on the Georgia race, already significant, intensified after last week's closer-than-expected GOP victory in a Kansas special House election. Trump did not perform as well as other Republicans last November in the Georgia district, an affluent, well-educated swath of Atlanta’s northern suburbs filled with the kind of voters Democrats need if they hope to reclaim a House majority next year.

Handel has maintained her distance from Trump, rarely discussing him unless asked.

Polling day took a bizarre turn in the district when key electronic voting logs were swiped from a Cobb County poll worker’s pickup truck. The chairman of the county’s Republican Party told Fox News the theft raised the specter of fraud. However, there were no reports of voting irregularities at Cobb County polling places Tuesday.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Trump said the plan will result in tax cuts for both individuals and businesses. He would not provide details of the plan, saying only that the tax cuts will be ""bigger I believe than any tax cut ever.""

The president said the package will be released on ""Wednesday or shortly thereafter"" — just before his 100 day mark in office. He will face opposition in Congress as the possibility of a government shutdown by the end of the month lingers.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin initially set a goal of getting tax reform passed by August, but that deadline has slipped. Mnuchin now says the administration still hoped to get a bill passed well before the end of the year.

Mnuchin on Thursday said economic growth from proposed tax cuts would come close to $2 trillion over 10 years.

Steve Forbes, in an interview on Fox Business’ ""Your World With Neil Cavuto,” said Trump is doing the right thing by aggressively pushing for tax cuts.

""I think he's recognized that if he doesn't get this economy moving in a way that people visibly feel it, he and the Republicans are going to be in deep trouble next year,"" Forbes said.

He added that Trump will have to push congressional Republicans to get the tax plan through as soon as possible, because even if it's approved in the short-term, it will take time for Americans to truly feel its effects.

""When you make an investment, it doesn't mean the building rises up the next day, or the factory rises up the next day, or the services are available the next day,"" Forbes said. ""It takes time to make these things happen. ... Why aren't they realistic about how the world works?""

In March, a Fox News poll found that 55 percent of participants believed they pay too much in taxes, The number was down from a record 63 percent in march 2015.

Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist said this week that he's confident that tax reform will be passed despite recent delays.

Norquist said there is agreement between the White House and Republicans in the House and Senate. That includes cutting the corporate rate from 35 to 20 percent, while small businesses would go from 40 down to 25 percent, which he called ""very important.""

In an exclusive Oval Office interview with Reuters ahead of the 100-day benchmark in his administration, Trump candidly acknowledged that the international situation could go off the rails.

""There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely,"" Trump said.

""There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea."" — President Trump

""We'd love to solve things diplomatically, but it's very difficult,"" he added.

Trump also said South Korea should pay for the $1 billion U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile defense system in place to protect it from an attack from the north.

The wide-ranging interview also included Trump's plan to defeat the Islamic State terror network.

""I have to say, there is an end. And it has to be humiliation,"" he said, when asked about what the endgame was for defeating Islamist violent extremism.

But talk was dominated by the North Korea situation, which has vexed past presidents, but seems to have reached a fever pitch amid repeated threats and new tests of missiles by Kim Jong-un.

""He's 27 years old. His father dies, took over a regime. So say what you want, but that is not easy, especially at that age,"" Trump said. ""I'm not giving him credit or not giving him credit, I'm just saying that's a very hard thing to do. As to whether or not he's rational, I have no opinion on it. I hope he's rational,"" he said.

Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping is helping to mitigate the issue.

""I believe he is trying very hard. He certainly doesn’t want to see turmoil and death. He doesn’t want to see it. He is a good man. He is a very good man, and I got to know him very well.""

Trump spoke just a day after he and his top national security advisers briefed U.S. lawmakers on the North Korean threat and one day before Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will press the United Nations Security Council on sanctions to further isolate Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs.

The Trump administration on Wednesday declared North Korea ""an urgent national security threat and top foreign policy priority."" It said it was focusing on economic and diplomatic pressure, including Chinese cooperation in containing its defiant neighbor and ally, and would remain open to negotiations.

U.S. officials said military strikes remained an option, but played down the prospect, though the administration has sent an aircraft carrier and a nuclear-powered submarine to the region in a show of force.

Any direct U.S. military action would run the risk of massive North Korean retaliation and huge casualties in Japan and South Korea, and among U.S. forces in both countries.

406,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/25/trumps-reported-shift-on-border-wall-money-could-prevent-govt-shutdown.html,2,"President Trump began to edge away Monday evening from demanding that funding for his promised border wall be included in a must-pass spending bill, reducing the chances of a government shutdown at the end of the week by making clear he’s flexible on that timeline.

Trump told a group of 20 conservative media reporters Monday evening that he would be willing to return to the wall funding issue in September, two people in the meeting said. His earlier demand that it be included represented a significant impasse in budget talks, and the latest comments potentially could pave the way for a bipartisan deal just days ahead of the government shutdown deadline.

White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway confirmed to “Fox & Friends” Tuesday morning that the wall does not need to be funded this week, but she said it remains a “very important priority to [Trump].”

“Building that wall and having it funded remains an important priority to him, but we also know that that can happen later this year and into next year,” she said.

Trump also took to Twitter Tuesday morning to make clear that his overall position has not changed.

“Don't let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL. It will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc,” he wrote.

Congress is under pressure to pass a $1 trillion spending bill that would pay for government agencies; if the bill fails to pass by midnight Friday, it will trigger a partial government shutdown.

In the wake of Trump’s border wall comments, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., welcomed the approach. ""It's good for the country that President Trump is taking the wall off the table in these negotiations,"" Schumer said late Monday. ""Now the bipartisan and bicameral negotiators can continue working on the outstanding issues.""

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also praised Trump’s announcement, calling it “welcomed news given the bipartisan opposition to the wall.”

The border wall was the most controversial issue facing lawmakers negotiating the spending bill. Trump insists that Mexico will pay for the wall in the end, a key pledge during his campaign. Cost estimates range past $20 billion, but the White House had been seeking $1.4 billion as a down payment in the spending bill in order to start the process.

Prior to the White House demand late last week for border wall money, it had largely been assumed on Capitol Hill that the spending measure would include funding for additional security steps along the border, but that there wouldn't be any money explicitly dedicated for new wall construction. With the president’s recent comments, that approach now appears likely to prevail.

""I'm optimistic. I don't think anybody wants a shutdown,"" Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said as he exited a meeting of GOP leadership. ""The White House and basically the minority leaders of the House and Senate have to have some level of agreement on the things that you're adding.""

407,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/26/trump-tax-plan-reportedly-would-cut-small-business-rate-to-15-percent.html,2,"President Trump's tax reform plan would cut the top rate for small business owners to 15 percent from 39.6 percent, an official with knowledge of the plan told the Associated Press Tuesday.

The official added that the top tax rate for individuals would be cut from 39.6 percent to the ""mid-30s."" White House officials had already revealed that Trump's plan would reduce the top corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent.

The plan, which will be formally unveiled by Trump Wednesday, will also include child-care benefits, a cause promoted by Trump's daughter Ivanka.

Republicans who slammed the growing national debt under Democrat Barack Obama said Tuesday they are open to Trump's tax plan, even though it could add trillions of dollars to the deficit over the next decade.

Echoing the White House, Republicans on Capitol Hill argued that tax cuts would spur economic growth, reducing or even eliminating any drop in tax revenue.

""I'm not convinced that cutting taxes is necessarily going to blow a hole in the deficit,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Finance Committee.

""I actually believe it could stimulate the economy and get the economy moving,"" Hatch added. ""Now, whether 15 percent is the right figure or not, that's a matter to be determined.""

The argument that tax cuts pay for themselves has been debunked by economists from across the political spectrum. On Tuesday, the official scorekeeper for Congress dealt the argument — and Trump's plan — another blow.

The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said Tuesday that a big cut in corporate taxes — even if it is temporary — would add to long-term budget deficits. This is a problem for Republicans because it means they would need Democratic support in the Senate to pass a tax overhaul that significantly cuts corporate taxes.

The assessment was requested by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who has been pushing a new tax on imports to fund lower overall tax rates. Senate Republicans have panned the idea, and officials in the Trump administration have sent mixed signals about it.

The import tax is not expected to be part of Trump's plan.

Trump dispatched his top lieutenants to Capitol Hill Tuesday to discuss his plan with Republican leaders. They met for about half an hour. No Democrat was invited.

Afterward, Hatch called it, ""a preliminary meeting.""

""They went into some suggestions that are mere suggestions, and we'll go from there.""

Republicans have been working under a budget maneuver that would allow them to pass a tax bill without Democratic support in the Senate — but only if it didn't add to long-term deficits.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate was sticking to that strategy.

""Regretfully we don't expect to have any Democratic involvement in"" a tax overhaul, McConnell said. ""So we'll have to reach an agreement among ourselves.""

Democrats said they smell hypocrisy over the growing national debt, which stands at nearly $20 trillion. For decades, Republican lawmakers railed against saddling future generations with trillions in debt.

But with Republicans controlling Congress and the White House, there is no appetite at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue to tackle the long-term drivers of debt — Social Security and Medicare. Instead, Republicans are pushing for tax cuts and increased defense spending.

""I'm particularly struck by how some of this seems to be turning on its head Republican economic theory,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.

Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said, ""On a lot of fronts, both the administration and Republicans have been contradictory, to say the least.""

""There's no question we should try to reduce (the corporate tax rate), but I don't see how you pay for getting it down that low,"" Casey said. ""Fifteen percent, that's a huge hole if you can't make the math work.""

The Trump administration on Tuesday stuck with its assertion that tax reform could push economic growth above 3 percent. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that the combination of changes on taxes, trade and regulations being pushed by the administration would accelerate the pace of economic gains.

""There is no reason that we should not be able to hit that — if not beat it,"" Ross said at the White House news briefing.

Many economists are skeptical that growth could consistently eclipse 3 percent. The flow of workers into the U.S. economy has slowed because of retirements by an aging baby boomer population, while improvements in productivity have been sluggish.

Officials with the Federal Reserve estimate that the economy will grow at a 2.1 percent clip this year and at 1.8 percent in the longer run.

408,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/04/trump-marks-national-day-prayer-signs-executive-order-on-religious-freedom.html,2,"President Trump marked the National Day of Prayer by signing an executive order aimed at boosting religious freedom by easing IRS restrictions against political activities by tax-exempt religious organizations, including churches.

Declaring ""no one should be censoring sermons,"" Trump announced the order, which fulfilled a campaign pledge, during a Rose Garden ceremony Thursday attended by religious leaders, activists and Vice President Pence.

“We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced again and we will never stand for religious discrimination,” Trump said before signing the order, which states it is now administration policy is “to protect and vigorously promote religious liberty.”

EXECUTIVE ORDER: PROMOTING FREE SPEECH AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY

The ban on political speech from the pulpit is rooted in an amendment introduced in 1954 by then-Democratic Sen. Lyndon Johnson that gave the IRS authority to punish tax-exempt charitable organizations, including churches, for making political endorsements or getting involved in political campaigns.

The order directs the IRS to exercise maximum enforcement discretion to alleviate the burden of the so-called Johnson Amendment.

In addition, it instructs the Treasury Department not to target the tax-exempt status of churches and other institutions if they express support for political candidates.

The order also directs the Department of Justice to ensure religious protections are afforded to individuals and groups, such as Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of nuns who take a vow of poverty in serving the elderly.

In his introductory remarks, Pence said the National Day of Prayer is a time to reaffirm “the vital role people of faith play in American society” and praised the president for marking the day in such a public manner.

Trump campaigned against the ban and pledged in his address to the Republican National Convention that he would “work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans.”

Trump called up several of the Little Sisters of the Poor members and congratulated them on their landmark victory in the Supreme Court over the issue of the contraceptive mandate included in ObamaCare.

According to Trump, more than 50 religious groups filed lawsuits against the Obama administration for violating their religious liberty.

Before the final order was released, several religious liberty groups expressed support for the administration’s actions.

“The first freedom in the Bill of Rights is religious freedom. America was born on the foundation of religious freedom and it is one of our most cherished liberties. There could be no better day to sign an executive order on religious freedom than the National Day of Prayer,” said Mat Staver, chairman of Liberty Counsel.

Mark Rienzi, counsel for The Becket Fund, said on Twitter he was encouraged by the “promise of the protection” coming from the White House and looked forward to seeing the final language.

The Becket Fund is the public interest law firm which has represented the Little Sisters of the Poor in their fight to be exempted from ObamaCare’s contraceptive mandate.

The executive order drew critics from the left and the right.

""If the … EO on religious liberty ends up being what media outlets are currently reporting, then it'll be woefully inadequate,"" tweeted Ryan Anderson, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

The American Civil Liberties Union argued the executive actions constitute “a broadside to our country’s long-standing commitment to the separation of church and state” that will divide the nation and permit discrimination.

""President Trump’s efforts to promote religious freedom are thinly-veiled efforts to unleash his conservative religious base into the political arena while also using religion to discriminate. It’s a dual dose of pandering to a base and denying reproductive care. We will see Trump in court, again,” said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero in a statement.

France's far-right National Front party is gearing up for a name change — but not a makeover of its ideas — after its decisive loss to centrist Emmanuel Macron.

In interviews Monday, the campaign director for Marine Le Pen, David Rachline, said the party founded by her father would get a new name as bait to pull in more supporters in France. Macron won the presidency with 66 percent of votes cast for a candidate. But a high number of blank or spoiled votes and unusually low turnout are signs of an electorate dissatisfied with its choices.

Legislative elections next month will determine wither Macron can cobble together a governing majority.

Rachline said Le Pen will lead the opposition to Macron."
410,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/05/07/france-election-voting-begins-in-major-election-that-could-shakeup-europe.html,2,"Emmanuel Macron, the centrist and political newcomer, defeated far-right candidate Marine Le Pen Sunday to win the French presidential election.

With all votes counted, the passionately pro-European Union Macron had garnered 66 percent of the vote to just 34 percent for Le Pen, who had promised a “Frexit” referendum should she win the election.

At a victory party outside the Louvre Museum in Paris, Macron supporters roared with delight at the news, waving red, white and blue tricolor flags. The jubilant crowd swelled to thousands as the night wore on.



""A new page in our long history is opening tonight. I want it to be one of hope and renewed confidence,"" Macron said. The 39-year-old investment banker became the youngest president in the 59-year-history of the French Fifth Republic with his victory.

The result amounted to an emphatic rejection of Le Pen's ""French-first nationalism."" The 48-year-old had hoped the same populist wave that led Donald Trump to the White House would also carry her to the Elysee Palace.

Macron, in a solemn televised victory speech, vowed to heal the social divisions exposed by France's acrimonious election campaign and bring ""hope and renewed confidence"" to his country.

""I know the divisions in our nation that led some to extreme votes. I respect them,"" he declared, unsmiling. ""I know the anger, the anxiety, the doubts that a large number of you also expressed. It is my responsibility to hear them.""

Macron's victory marked the third time in six months -- following elections in Austria and the Netherlands -- that European voters shot down far-right populists who wanted to restore borders across Europe. The election of a French president who championed European unity could also strengthen the EU's hand in its complex divorce proceedings with Britain.



After his initial televised speech, Macron took a motorcade to join the party at the Louvre, passing Parisians who had lined the streets outside his campaign headquarters. The European anthem ""Ode to Joy"" played as Macron strode out to address his supporters.



""France has won!"" he said. ""Everyone said it was impossible. But they did not know France!""



Saying Le Pen voters backed her because they were angry, he vowed: ""I will do everything in the five years to come so there is no more reason to vote for the extremes.""



Many French voters had backed Macron reluctantly and with the sole goal of keeping out Le Pen and her National Front party, which has a long anti-Semitic and racist history.



After the most closely watched and unpredictable French presidential campaign in recent memory, many voters rejected the runoff choices altogether. Pollsters projected that French voters cast blank or spoiled ballots in record numbers Sunday.



Congratulatory messages poured in from abroad. Trump tweeted congratulations on what he called Macron's ""big win"" and said he looked forward to working with the French leader. Macron has said he wants continued intelligence-sharing with the United States and cooperation at the United Nations and hopes to persuade Trump not to pull the U.S. out of a global accord fighting climate change.



Germany's foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, laced his welcome for Macron with a warning to the French, saying: ""If he fails, in five years Mrs. Le Pen will be president and the European project will go to the dogs.""



Until now, modern France had been governed either by the Socialists or the conservatives. Both Macron and Le Pen upended that right-left tradition.



""France has sent an incredible message to itself, to Europe and the world,"" said Macron ally Francois Bayrou, tipped among his possible choices for prime minister.



Unknown to voters before his turbulent 2014-16 tenure as France's pro-business economy minister, Macron took a giant gamble by quitting Socialist President Francois Hollande's government to run as an independent in his first campaign.



His startup political movement -- optimistically named ""En Marche! (Forward)"" -- caught fire in just one year, harnessing voters' hunger for new faces and new ideas.



""I'm so happy, it feels so good! I lived the election of Donald Trump in New York, and now finally, after Brexit, after Trump, populism has been beaten in France,"" said Pierre-Yves Colinet, a joyous Macron supporter at the Louvre victory party. ""Today, I'm proud to be French.""



Despite her loss, Le Pen's advancement to the runoff for the first time marked a personal and political breakthrough and underscored a growing acceptance of her fierce anti-immigration, platform. She had placed third in the 2012 presidential vote.



Le Pen immediately turned her focus to France's upcoming legislative election in June, where Macron will need a working majority to govern effectively. Le Pen said her ""historic and massive"" score turned her party into ""the leading opposition force against the new president's plans.""



""I call on all patriots to join us,"" Le Pen said. ""France will need you more than ever in the months ahead.""



Her supporters at a National Front election night gathering in Paris put on a brave face.



""Now we enter combat,"" said Didier Roxel, a National Front legislative candidate.



Le Pen said she got 11 million votes. If confirmed, that would be double the score of her father, National Front co-founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, at the same stage in the 2002 presidential election.



Macron and Le Pen's polar-opposite visions presented France's 47 million registered voters with the starkest possible choice. Le Pen's closed borders faced off against Macron's open ones; his commitment to free trade ran against her proposals to protect the French from global economic competition and immigration. Her desire to free France from the EU and the shared euro currency contrasted with his argument that both are essential for the future of Europe's third-largest economy.



As well as capitalizing on voter rejection of the left-right monopoly on power, Macron also got lucky. One of his most dangerous opponents, conservative former Prime Minister Francois Fillon, was hobbled by allegations that his family benefited from cushy taxpayer-funded jobs for years.



On the left, the Socialist Party imploded, its candidate abandoned by voters who wanted to punish Hollande, France's most unpopular president since World War II. Hollande himself decided not to run again.



Macron takes charge of a nation that, when Britain leaves the EU in 2019, will become the EU's only member with nuclear weapons and a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council.



But the vote also showed that France's 67 million people are deeply divided, riven by anxieties about terrorism and chronic unemployment, worried about the cultural and economic impact of immigration and fearful of France's ability to compete against giants like China and Google.



Macron has promised a France that would stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin but that also would seek to work with Putin on fighting the Islamic State group, whose extremists have claimed or inspired multiple attacks in France since 2015.



France has been in a state of emergency since then and 50,000 security forces safeguarded Sunday's vote.

411,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/03/obamacare-overhaul-are-republicans-getting-anywhere.html,2,"There’s an old joke from the Soviet Union that could help describe the current state of affairs on the GOP’s health care bill.

Soviet leaders Josef Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev are aboard a train in Siberia. The train breaks down. Passengers ask Stalin what to do. Stalin executes the crew, hires a relief crew and gets the train going again. The train stalls again. This time, it’s up to Khrushchev. Khrushchev fires the train crew but pardons them. Khrushchev then brings in yet another crew to restart the train. The train breaks down a third time. So everyone turns to Brezhnev. His solution? “Pull down the window shades and pretend we’re moving.”

Are Republicans getting anywhere? Or are they pretending they’re moving?

The problem is that the House Republican health care bill suffers from pre-existing conditions. It harbors too many maladies to pass through the marble risk corridors of Capitol Hill.

The package doesn’t lower costs enough, increase coverage, provide better care and save the federal government money. Otherwise, a minimum of 216 Republicans (the threshold necessary to pass legislation with 431 current House members) would vote yea and the plan would sail through. But this patient is now on life support.

We’ve heard bromides from House Republicans and White House officials for weeks that the GOP is on the verge of advancing a retrenched health care bill. Senior White House officials suggested to Fox News a vote would come Wednesday. Sources indicated the House was only “five or six votes” shy of muscling the plan to passage.

“We’re making progress,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. “The president has been nothing but helpful on health care.”

“I like the direction we’re heading,” said House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La.

But when might a vote come?

“That is a great question,” opined a senior GOP leadership aide.

The Republican leadership squad skated out of a morning press conference without saying when they could vote. Fox News buttonholed Scalise about where the whip count stood.

“It’s better,” said Scalise.

But if they had the votes, they’d pull the trigger. And Republicans were bleeding votes.

GOP congressional sources expressed concern about White House predictions of when the House may vote. They were exasperated with administration officials who leaked what is supposedly the vote tally.

“You don’t announce a whip count. You just don’t,” said a source.

The whip count is an extremely closely held figure. In many instances, just the whip along with a few key staffers and certain members actually know the true number. Several sources on Capitol Hill openly contested that the vote count was as close as administration figures let on.

“They just don’t know,” said one congressional source of the White House.

Republican leadership sources point out that they need more than a margin of one vote to win. They need several. No one wants to portray a given lawmaker as the one who cast the “deciding vote” to repeal and replace ObamaCare. You always need a cushion of a few votes. In addition, the leadership needs a couple of “in case emergency, break glass” votes, too. Such members would stand by during the vote and not cast a ballot. If Republicans have the votes to pass the bill, the whip would “release” these members to vote their conscience. If they’re short, the whip would ask those members to vote yea to lug the plan across the finish line.

Tracking undecided members could be an even more intriguing enterprise now than watching those who are noes. Lots of undecideds are moderate Republicans who represent battleground districts. A vote for the bill could make them vulnerable in the 2018 midterm elections, imperiling the Republican majority. Many of these Republicans don’t want to weigh-in at all. If the leadership calls the vote, they’re on the record, one way or the other. They secretly hope the GOP never schedules a vote. That way, they don’t have to declare their position.

GOP leaders are relentless in their pursuit. Perhaps fear of a second, brutal defeat clouds their judgment as they optimistically predict that success is just a handful of votes away. Health care was supposed to be the easiest venture of the year. Congress faces daunting challenges ahead to reform the tax code and raise the debt ceiling.

However, Ryan should find solace in one realm. The speaker may not have to fight to keep the government operating in September. The president tweeted about the merits of a shutdown Tuesday morning.

Everything is barreling toward Thursday, a make-or-break day for the bill. House Republicans already scheduled a members-only conference Thursday morning.

Could they vote even if they’re not sure of the outcome?

Certainly. But as they say in the movies, “You play a dangerous game, Mr. Bond.”

And then there is North Korea.

Pray tell, what does a bill that increases sanctions again North Korea have to do with health care? Everything. The House debated the widely bipartisan measure Tuesday. But no vote is likely until Thursday. Why? A vote on this measure could serve one of several purposes. First, it gives Republicans a major vote on a big issue right before a recess if they never try on health care. Republicans could also use the North Korea bill as a “bedcheck” vote. Almost everyone one on both sides of the aisle wants to vote to get tough with North Korea. Attendance for that vote would be high. As such, the GOP gets a good snapshot of precisely how many members are present from both sides of the aisle. That helps leaders predict how many votes they need to pass the health care package.

At the House Rules Committee Tuesday afternoon, Rep. Jim McGover, D-Mass., again pressed Chairman Pete Sessions, R-Texas, if they would vote this week.

“I have no clue what we are going to do,” replied Sessions.

And neither does anyone else.

The tweet came on the heels of Rouhani’s warning to Trump that hostile policies could lead to the “mother of all wars"" with Iran.

Trump called for Rouhani to stop the rhetoric or--in caps lock-- “suffer the consequences the like of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence and death. Be cautious!”

Within hours, Iranian state-owned news agency IRNA dismissed Trump's tweet, describing it as a ""passive reaction"" to Rouhani's remarks.

The agency, a government mouthpiece, also said Monday that Trump's comment was only mimicking and copying Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif who had in the past warned the West to ""never threaten an Iranian.""

Rouhani earlier warned Trump to stop ""playing with the lion's tail"" and threatening Iran, ""or else you will regret it.""

Trump earlier this year pulled the U.S. out of the international deal meant to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon and ordered increased American sanctions.

Trump has suggested Iranian leaders are ""going to call me and say 'let's make a deal'"" but Iran has rejected talks.

Rouhani has previously lashed out against Trump for threatening to re-impose the sanctions, as well as for moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and banning travel to the U.S. from certain Muslim-majority countries. Rouhani also said that a peace with Tehran is like ""the mother of all peace.""

Sources told Reuters that U.S. officials have launched an effort to foment unrest in Tehran and put pressure on the country’s leaders to end its nuclear program.

413,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/07/13/republicans-walked-right-into-peter-strzoks-trap-heres-what-missed-and-americans-need-to-know.html,2,"U.S. House members proved Thursday that they are more interested in political posturing and getting on TV with fiery soundbites than in fact-finding, as they questioned FBI official Peter Strzok about whether his anti-Trump bias influenced the investigation of the Trump presidential campaign for possible collusion with Russia.

Acting like they were cast members on a reality TV show – yelling, interrupting each other, and hurling insults – members of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees spent almost 10 hours alternately attacking and defending Strzok, a suspended FBI deputy assistant director.

The cable news networks televised the wild hearing, as Republicans led the attack on Strzok and Democrats defended him.

Strzok will likely be fired from the FBI in coming weeks for his disgraceful conduct at the agency, where he worked on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. He also headed the FBI team that investigated the email scandal surrounding Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Rather than getting a platform to speak to the nation in a daylong TV performance, Strzok should be summarily dismissed from the FBI, thoroughly investigated and prosecuted if the evidence shows he has broken the law.

Mueller removed Strzok from the Russia investigation last year after learning of numerous rabidly anti-Trump and pro-Clinton text messages that Strzok traded with his then-lover Lisa Page, who was an FBI lawyer at the time.

The texts made it crystal clear that Strzok and Page despised Donald Trump and wanted Hillary Clinton to defeat him in the 2016 presidential election.

In one text exchange, Page wrote to Strzok about Trump: “He’s not ever going to become president, right? Right?!” Strzok replied: “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.”

Strzok also said in a text that there was an unspecified “insurance policy” that would keep Trump out of the White House.

Strzok admitted at Thursday’s hearing that he “detested” Trump. However, he insisted vehemently and repeatedly that his personal political views had absolutely no impact on his conduct at the FBI in the investigations involving either the Trump campaign or Clinton. He said he had taken no improper action regarding either probe.

These claims are unbelievable and contradicted by the facts regarding Strzok’s conduct.

As an FBI agent for 24 years and former chief of all FBI criminal investigations, I was disgusted by the way Strzok tried to cloak himself in the FBI and characterize attacks against him as attacks against the FBI as an institution.

Strzok did his best to fuse himself to the good and dedicated men and women of the finest law enforcement agency in the world, but the truth is that his shabby conduct has done more to damage the FBI than any one person in its storied history.

Scores of current and retired FBI employees who gave their all to the organization have expressed to me that they deeply resent being unfairly forced to deal with the consequences of Strzok’s bad behavior.

For all the drama, fire and fury, the House hearing shed no new light on Strzok’s conduct at the FBI. It did, however, demonstrate the general uselessness of Congressional hearings.

Rather than uncover facts for their constituents, the hearing resembled a cross between “The People’s Court,” “The Jerry Springer Show,” and the trash talk between competitors at “WrestleMania.”

The sad truth is that in the Republicans’ zeal to administer a public flogging of Strzok – and by extension the FBI – the GOP House members walked right into a trap.

The hearing never had a chance of uncovering the truth. This is so because Strzok enjoyed the advantage of being able to shower the committees with self-serving protestations while hiding behind the restrictions on his testimony imposed by the FBI attorney hovering behind him.

Strzok understood this and exploited his opportunity to the hilt while snuggling up to the anti-Trump Democrats embracing him.

The savvy Strzok cleverly outmaneuvered the Republicans on the committees. That’s surprising, given the extensive experience of Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., as a former federal prosecutor. Gowdy should have known better than to take the bait.

The Republican members succeeded only in turning Strzok into a Democratic hero and giving him a national audience for his emphatic denials of Republican allegations that his anti-Trump and pro-Clinton political allegiance influenced his investigations involving the two candidates.

Not only did the Republican committee members fail to recognize Strzok’s public relations trap. They allowed Strzok’s former lover Lisa Page to delay her committee appearance – originally scheduled for Wednesday – until after she had ample opportunity to observe his televised testimony. All Page has to do now is tailor her answers to match Strzok’s.

This is a circus that only lacks a big tent.

Gowdy should have known that there was zero chance of a “Perry Mason” moment like those featured on the old TV show about a defense lawyer, when Strzok would break down under the withering questions of GOP members and confess to placing his thumb on the scale of the investigations.

Strzok is no dummy. He was not going incriminate himself at the hearing to set himself up to be charged with obstruction of justice for improperly influencing the investigations of the Trump campaign or the Clinton emails.

It also appears that Gowdy failed to anticipate the coordinated strategy of the Democratic members to obstruct the hearing and run interference for their new hero, who they painted as a patriot and noble martyr who sacrificed his FBI career for the good of the nation.

The simple and uncontroverted facts concerning Strzok’s actions and expressed intent can be found in the recent report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz that was thorough and detailed.

Horowitz ultimately came to the wrong overall conclusion, but did state that investigators had no confidence that Strzok did not improperly influence the Clinton email investigation by ignoring relevant evidence.

The Horowitz report described how Strzok, as the head of the Clinton email investigation, sat on his hands for well over three weeks after the New York FBI office reported to him that it had discovered new evidence relevant to the Clinton investigation.

This – when matched with Strzok’s contemporaneous statements – appears to amount to, at minimum, obstruction of justice. It would not be a stretch to convince a jury of 12 that Strzok’s expressed intent to improperly change the course of the investigation was accompanied by actions.

While Strzok’s testimony was uninformative, his arrogant and smug demeanor and feigned outrage during his testimony spoke loudly to anyone who observed it objectively. Does he really think we are so gullible that we would buy his absurd claim that his “we’ll stop it” text meant all of us – the American people – would act to stop Trump from becoming president?

Rather than getting a platform to speak to the nation in a daylong TV performance, Strzok should be summarily dismissed from the FBI, thoroughly investigated and prosecuted if the evidence shows he has broken the law."
414,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/21/doj-releases-carter-page-fisa-docs.html,2,"The Department of Justice has released documents used by the government to justify the FISA surveillance warrant against Carter Page, a former campaign adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump.

The materials released by the DOJ include an October 2016 application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to wiretap Page as well as several renewal applications. It is highly unusual for documents related to FISA wiretap applications to be released.

Though heavily redacted, the documents show that the infamous and unverified Steele Dossier was a major component of the 2016 surveillance warrant. The dossier, which was opposition research funded by the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign, contains salacious allegations against Trump. It was also a major component used to justify subsequent renewals.

The visible sections of the released FISA documents do not indicate the dossier was ever verified. Instead, the FBI claimed that Steele was “reliable” based on his previous work.

The FISA records also reveal that a September 2016 Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff was a significant part of the government's warrant application.

But London court records show, and Republicans emphasize, that Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS -- the opposition research firm behind the Steele Dossier.

WATCH: DARRELL ISSA REACTS TO RELEASE OF FISA DOCUMENTS

The newly released FISA warrant application, however, seems to indicate the Yahoo News article was an independent piece of corroborating information that justified the surveillance of Carter Page. Republicans question whether the story is an example of circular reporting that merely repeated information from Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that commissioned former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dossier.

Based on what is visible, the dossier is not described to the FISA court as a political document, as the Democrats have asserted; in fact, the FBI speculates to the FISA court that it was commissioned to damage Candidate 1, who is Donald Trump.

Page's denials of the Yahoo News reporting were included in the early renewals to the FISA application. The last renewal in late Spring 2017 is particularly important, because by that point, the FBI had dumped Steele as a source after he misled them over his media contacts.

One of the documents reads: “The FBI speculates to the FISA court that the U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit candidate 1’s campaign.""

Fox News believes that the U.S. person is Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS.

HOUSE MEMO: DISPUTED DOSSIER KEY TO FBI FISA WARRANT TO SURVEIL TRUMP TEAM

The unredacted FISA materials also contain only limited references to ex-Trump adviser George Papadopoulos. Media reports had speculated that Papadopoulos' 2016 meeting in London with a professor who had ties to Russia was a key justification for the FISA-authorized surveillance of Page.

Papadopoulos has since pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe.

Critics have charged that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who signed off on the FISA application renewals, should not have approved them without more reliable intelligence.

Reacting to the document release, Page told Fox News, ""I'm having trouble finding any small bit of this document that rises above complete ignorance and/or insanity.""

President Trump also weighed in on Twitter Sunday, calling the situation a ""scam.""

""Looking more & more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC,"" Trump wrote. ""Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam!""

The surveillance of Page became a contentious matter between Republican and Democratic lawmakers earlier this year. Republicans alleged the FBI had abused its surveillance powers and improperly obtained the warrant, a charge that Democrats rebutted as both sides characterized the documents in different ways. The documents, meanwhile, remained out of public view.

WATCH: CARTER PAGE SPEAKS OUT

House Democrats were quick to say that the documents bolstered their arguments.

""For more than a year, House Republicans have bullied the Department of Justice and FBI to release highly sensitive documents to derail the Special Counsel's and other legitimate national security investigations and cover for the President,"" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. ""For the sake of our national security and our democracy, these vital investigations must be allowed to continue unhindered by Republican interference. The GOP must cease their attacks on our law enforcement and intelligence communities, and finally decide where their loyalty lies.""

U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the documents underscore the ""legitimate concern"" the FBI had about Page's activities. Yet Schiff said the materials shouldn't have been released during an ongoing investigation because of national security.

Schiff blamed Trump for making public the House Republicans' initial memo about the FISA applications, a move by Trump that the congressman called ""nakedly political and self-interested, and designed to to (sic) interfere with the Special Counsel's investigation.""

Earlier this year, GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee voted to release a memo claiming the DOJ abused the FISA warrant process in order to hurt Trump's presidential campaign, claiming the warrant against Page was based in significant part on the Steele Dossier.

Trump declassified the memo over the objections of the FBI, which warned that the document contained “material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy,” the Hill report said.

415,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/19/slamming-script-why-press-is-dismissing-presidents-do-over.html,2,"The media seem determined not to give the president a do-over.

His attempt to clarify what he said in Helsinki is being widely dismissed, even mocked, by many in mainstream media land.

At a minimum, President Trump deserves credit for saying what he should have said to Vladimir Putin, that he accepts the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered with the 2016 election. He may have been pressured into saying it--not just by the media furor but by Mike Pence, John Kelly, Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, according to reports—but he said it nonetheless.

What drew particular skepticism was Trump's explanation that he misspoke one word, that he meant to say ""wouldn't"" and not ""would,"" as in ""I don't see any reason why it would"" be Russia.

The president's demeanor, as he read from a script, was less than enthusiastic. And he ad-libbed that in addition to Russian hackers, it could have been ""other people.""

I've seen many on-air references to ""hostage video,"" as if Trump was reciting these words under duress. And some anchors ripped him, in the new style of strong criticism of Trump from those who are not commentators.

CNN's Erin Burnett said Trump was making a ""dog ate my homework"" alibi, adding: ""How stupid does Trump think we Americans are? The president's excuse for his embarrassing press conference, where he sided with Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence chiefs, does not add up.""

Slate called Trump's Tuesday walkback ""only a little less disgraceful"" than Helsinki, under the headline: ""Nothing Trump Says Can Be Trusted.""

In a more sophisticated vein, The Washington Post offered these observations:

""The way he delivered his statement of retreat was classic Trump, a dual message — a ritual statement of confidence in U.S. intelligence officials for those who insist that the president respect the nation's systems and mores, but also winks and nods to those who like Trump expressly because he's eager to smash china and topple tradition ...

""The signals had been sent, a quick wave of a white flag for those who insist on such things, and a zesty little aside, a wink and a nod, to those who needed assurance that their renegade president would never cave to the swamp dwellers, never back away from his commitment to blow up the old, failed ways of Washington.""

There was another clarification yesterday after the press ran with a terse Trumpian response—""no""—to ABC reporter Cecilia Vega's question about whether he believes Russia is still meddling in American politics.

But Sarah Huckabee Sanders, pressed at the briefing, said Trump was simply saying ""no"" to the idea of taking questions, not addressing Moscow's current capabilities. Vega later said she believes Trump was in fact answering her question.

So is all this the indelible stain that the sustained media outrage would suggest? The New York Times deserves credit for posing the question:

""The question was whether he had reached a genuine turning point or simply endured another one of those episodes that seems decisive but ultimately fades into the next one.""

What makes this feel different is that some commentators are actually accusing Trump of being a traitor—including, by the way, Times columnist Charles Blow, who delivered the verdict before Trump met with Putin.

""While the accusation of treason has been thrown around on the edges of the political debate from time to time, never in the modern era has it become part of the national conversation in such a prominent way ...

""Whether this leads anywhere remains unclear. Past moments that seemed decisive, like the 'Access Hollywood' tape and Charlottesville, came and went. For now at least, hurling the treason charge seems more about making a point than making a case in a courtroom or impeachment hearing. But it is an explosive word to use and that by itself suggests how fraught this moment in the nation's history has become.""

It is also a charge that reveals how much some journalists detest Donald Trump. There’s a huge chasm between ripping the president for yielding to Putin over his own intel chiefs and condemning him as some kind of Benedict Arnold.

What I said on the air yesterday is that when the president makes a mistake or inflammatory comment, it may be a 10—but then the media often go to 11, or 13. That will make his supporters more likely to view this entire episode, walkback and all, as more media pummeling of Trump, rather than a grave self-inflicted wound on the international stage."
416,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/24/georgia-runoff-cagle-kemp-fight-scrambled-by-secret-tapes-late-trump-endorsement.html,2,"Georgia's voters on Tuesday will select one of two Trump-supporting candidates as the Republican nominee for governor, capping off an electric race rocked by a slow burn of secretly recorded tapes and eye-catching advertising, as well as a sudden and unexpected endorsement by the president himself.

Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp and Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle are locked in a contentious primary runoff, with both vying to position themselves as the true Trump conservative. The two have emerged from a crowded field of candidates, though neither won more than 50 percent of an earlier vote to avoid the July 24 runoff.

Kemp, who has called himself a ""politically incorrect conservative,"" made headlines in May for running an advertisement boasting that he has a pick-up truck ""in case I need to round up criminal illegals.""

Trump unexpectedly weighed in on the race last week, tweeting his ""full and total endorsement"" for Kemp. Trump's endorsement reportedly caught Kemp, who was in a press conference at the time, by surprise.

WHO ARE KEMP AND CAGLE? A CLOSER LOOK AT THE TWO CANDIDATES

Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Kemp said Georgia is a solid-red state that needs an ""unapologetic conservative.""

""We need a nominee that's going to keep the base fired up and keep Georgia red as it's been,"" Kemp said. He called Trump's endorsement on Wednesday ""huge,"" and compared it to ""pouring gasoline on a fire.""

Meanwhile, Cagle's candidacy has been thrown off-kilter by the release of several furtively-recorded audio tapes, including one in which Cagle allegedly offers to help pay off former gubernatorial candidate Clay Tippins' $300,000 in campaign debt in exchange for an endorsement.

“I’m well aware that we walked away from $300,000,” Tippins said. “It’s the best $300,000 we’ve ever walked away from.“

Cagle denied the allegations, saying he never offered a bribe for any reason and saying he was tiring of ""antics"" in the race.

In another secretly recorded tape, Cagle seemed to disparage some of his constituents, saying the race was about “who had the biggest gun, who had the biggest truck and who would be the craziest.”

Vice President Mike Pence made his presence felt Saturday in the race, headlining a rally for Kemp, whom he called ""tough on crime"" and ""strong on borders.""

WATCH: CAGLE DISCUSSES THE INCREASINGLY HOT PRIMARY RACE IN GEORGIA

One of the largest reactions from the crowd in Macon came when Pence trumpeted strong support for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

""Leading liberal Democrats in the country said they want to abolish ICE,"" Pence said. ""Abolish them!"" a member of the crowd yelled back.

""We will never abolish ICE,"" Pence said to applause from the crowd.

Kemp and Cagle are both seeking to stake out conservative positions on the coattails of Trump, each frequently evoking the president's name in television ads, stump speeches and debates. And Trump on Saturday tweeted anew that Kemp has his ""full endorsement,"" saying ""He will be a GREAT governor!""

Cagle, for his part, was making the rounds in northern Georgia on Saturday. He attended an early meet-and-greet in Cleveland, Ga., and another event in Hiawassee, near the North Carolina border.

""It's always good to be back ... in Cleveland. This is our third time during this election cycle & I know we'll be back soon. Especially with the great advertising on the sign! Proud to be supported by the Sheriff, Commission Chair, and Senator,"" Cagle tweeted.

The winner of Tuesday's Republican contest faces Democrat Stacey Abrams in the general election in November. Abrams is seeking to become the first black female governor in the U.S.

Pence's appearance in Georgia followed a stop earlier in the day in Tennessee, where Pence touted Republican tax cuts and campaigned with two GOP congresswomen waging tough campaigns for statewide offices.

In an appearance in Cleveland, Tenn., Pence praised U.S. Reps. Diane Black and Marsha Blackburn, who joined the rally and are hoping to lead Tennessee's statewide GOP ticket this fall. Trump has endorsed Blackburn in her bid for the U.S. Senate from Tennessee but has not formally backed a candidate in that state's GOP primary for governor, where Black is one of four leading contenders.

417,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/25/trump-and-his-allies-slam-michael-cohen-over-leaked-tape-question-cut-off.html,2,"President Trump and his legal allies fired back Wednesday at his former attorney Michael Cohen after the leak of a taped conversation in which the two appear to discuss the possibility of buying the rights to a Playboy model’s story claiming an affair with Trump.

“What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first, never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad!” Trump tweeted.

The president was referring to how the tape cut out immediately after the discussion in question. Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, claimed to Fox News that the rest of the recording would have been “exculpatory from the point of view of the president.”

The release of the tape amounted to a stunning release of evidence, seized as part of the FBI raid on Cohen earlier this year. It forced Trump’s legal team to scramble to counter suggestions that Trump was well aware of talks to buy the rights to model Karen McDougal’s story, despite claims to the contrary.

Giuliani, speaking with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, host of “The Ingraham Angle,” maintained Tuesday that Trump did not know about the proposed transaction before the conversation.

“There’s no indication of any crime being committed on this tape,” he said.

Alan Dershowitz, Harvard law professor emeritus, also told “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday morning the controversy amounts to a “big deal about nothing.”

“The end result is no payments were made, no cash was given,” he said. “There’s no crime here. There’s no impeachable offense here.”

Dershowitz also slammed Cohen, saying he’s “not as loyal to the president as he once was” and “shouldn’t have recorded this.”

Cohen for weeks has put distance between himself and Trump amid a federal investigation surrounding, among other things, a separate payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to stay quiet about a separate alleged sexual encounter with Trump. Cohen recently told ABC his family has his “first loyalty.”

The tape was provided to CNN Tuesday by Cohen's attorney and longtime Clinton confidant Lanny Davis. The recording, made before the 2016 election, has them discussing a possible payment to buy the story of former Playboy model McDougal.

Trump’s legal team says the transaction never occurred.

On the recording, Cohen tells Trump: ""I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David,"" a possible reference to David Pecker, Trump's friend and president of the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc. The conversation came weeks after the parent company reached a $150,000 deal to pay McDougal for her story of a 2006 affair, which it never published, a tabloid practice known as ""catch and kill.""

Cohen then starts to say: ""When it comes time for the financing,"" at which point Trump cuts him off and says, ""What financing?""

What comes next is garbled and ultimately unclear. Cohen says they’ll “have to pay” something, and Trump can be heard saying “pay with cash” – after which Cohen repeatedly says “no, no, no.”

A transcript provided by the Trump legal team, though, asserts that Trump said: “Don’t pay with cash . . . check.”

Giuliani told Fox News on Tuesday they listened numerous times to the tape and determined the then-candidate told Cohen, “Don’t pay with cash.”

Giuliani, speaking with Laura Ingraham, admitted that the audio was muffled, but said the rest of the recording -- had it not stopped -- would have been “exculpatory.” Dershowitz and Guiliani both said Trump wanted to make sure any such transaction had a record.

CNN on Tuesday played the secretly recorded audiotape from two months before the 2016 presidential election.

Davis told CNN that Trump’s lawyers “fear” Cohen because he “has the truth” about Trump. He questioned claims that Trump wasn’t talking about “cash.”

“Cohen has been disparaged. Cohen has been insulted and called all sorts of things by people around Donald Trump,” he said.

Trump denies the alleged affair ever happened and his campaign had said he knew nothing about the payment.

U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, posted on Twitter that the Cohen tape shows that Giuliani was ""untruthful"" when he said Trump didn't know about the payments. He said the move was ""campaign motivated"" and ""regardless of cash or check, whole point of phony corp. was to hide campaign expenditure.""

418,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/24/trump-very-concerned-russia-will-try-to-meddle-in-midterms.html,2,"President Trump on Tuesday expressed concern over the possibility of Russia interfering in this year’s midterm elections, the latest effort to show he’s willing to get tough with the country after facing criticism last week over his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“I’m very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election,” Trump tweeted.

Without citing evidence, Trump argued the Russians would prefer Democrats to win in November.

“Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats,” Trump said. “They definitely don’t want Trump!”

But it comes as Special Counsel Robert Mueller is prosecuting Russian operatives for targeting the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic Party during the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. During last week’s summit, Putin denied the accusations that Trump meddled in the election but he acknowledged that he preferred Trump over Clinton in the contest.

TRUMP RESUMES DEFENSE OF PUTIN SUMMIT AFTER WALK-BACK

Earlier this month, a federal grand jury indicted more 12 Russians for allegedly hacking emails during the campaign. “The internet allows foreign adversaries to attack America in new and unexpected ways,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said at the time.

In Helsinki last week, Trump said he didn’t “see any reason why” Russia would be behind election meddling in 2016. This and other comments led to bipartisan outrage and accusations that he was taking Putin’s word over the intelligence community’s.

But Trump, at the White House the next day, walked back those comments and said he meant the opposite. “I said the word ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn’t’…sort of a double negative,” Trump explained.

419,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/07/27/top-cbs-exec-les-moonves-accused-sexual-misconduct-in-latest-ronan-farrow-report.html,2,"Six women have accused CBS Chairman and CEO Les Moonves of sexual harassment, according to Ronan Farrow's latest report, published by The New Yorker on Friday.

Additionally, more than two dozen company employees, past and present, detailed incidents of harassment, gender discrimination or retaliation at CBS, the report said.

In response to the story, Moonves, 68, provided a statement to The New Yorker saying, ""I recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances.""

He continued: ""Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected -- and abided by the principle -- that 'no' means 'no,' and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone's career.""

Illeana Douglas, an actress who has had roles in ""Goodfellas,"" ""To Die For,"" and many other films, spoke to Farrow and recalled meeting Moonves in 1996 and was eventually given a role in a TV show, the report said. The following year, Moonves reportedly phoned Douglas' manager requesting a meeting for the pair to talk regarding an earlier script reading.

At that point, Douglas described the executive as being ""more than just my boss,"" adding that ""he was very much like a father figure,"" the report said.

""In a millisecond, he's got one arm over me, pinning me."" — Illeana Douglas

Once at the meeting, Douglas told Farrow that she began to talk about the script when Moonves abruptly allegedly asked her if she was single.

""I didn't know what to say at that point,"" Douglas recalled. ""I was, like, 'I'm single, yes, no, maybe.'""

Douglas claimed that the executive asked permission to kiss her and after she tried to talk about work again, he approached her and allegedly started ""violently kissing"" her, Farrow's report said.

""In a millisecond, he's got one arm over me, pinning me,"" she said.

Douglas claimed in the report that she lay motionless underneath Moonves, saying ""you sort of black out.""

""You think, How long is this going to go on? I was just looking at this nice picture of his family and his kids. I couldn't get him off me,"" she told Farrow.

She reportedly claimed the executive then lifted her skirt before asking, ""So, what do you think?""

""My decision was to get out of it by joking my way out, so he feels flattered,"" she told Farrow. She claimed she told him, ""Yes, for the head of the network, you're some good kisser.""

""It has stayed with me the rest of my life, that terror."" — Illeana Douglas

Moonves then allegedly got up off of her and she seized the moment to end the meeting. As she approached the door, she claimed he got in her way and closed in, in what she described as being a ""physically scary"" moment, according to the report.

""He says, 'We're going to keep this between you and me, right?'"" Douglas told Farrow.

""No, sir, we won't tell anyone that you're a good kisser,"" she recalled saying before she left.

""It was so invasive,"" Douglas told Farrow. ""It has stayed with me the rest of my life, that terror.""

Dinah Kirgo, an Emmy-award winning writer of “The Tracy Ullman Show,” told Farrow that she and her sister had meetings with Moonves in the 1980s about a potential television deal, but that it ultimately went nowhere after Kirgo allegedly turned down a one-on-one dinner with Moonves.

“He said, ‘That was a great meeting, now we have to go out to dinner,’” she told the outlet. When she allegedly replied that she would be happy to schedule something alongside her sister, Moonves demurred.

“He said, ‘No, just you and me.’ He said, ‘You’re very expensive, and I need to know you’re worth it,’” Kirgo told Farrow.

“I was sort of in shock and I said, ‘Well, Leslie, I don’t think your wife would appreciate us having that kind of dinner.’”

CBS told Farrow that Moonves did not recall the conversation. Kirgo said she believed that rejecting Moonves’ alleged overtures hurt her career.

“It’s very insidious, what he did,” she said.

A former child star, identified only as Kimberly in the report, recalled a 1992 dinner meeting with Moonves. When the friend who coordinated the dinner stepped away, the woman said, Moonves aggressively pursued her.

“Let’s go. Let’s just get a hotel room. Let’s just do this,” she claimed Moonves said. “I said, ‘What are you talking about?’” When she said she explained that she had a child and was married, the CBS president allegedly became angered and left the restaurant.

She told Farrow that the intention to turn the meeting from professional to sexual in nature appeared to be well rehearsed. “It was set up to be that way,” she said. “I thought, Wow, is this the way the world works and I just don’t get it?”

The allegations of misconduct in the report were not just limited to Moonves. They also extended to multiple senior staffers and the overall network.

Jeff Fager, who served as the CBS News chairman from 2011 until 2015 -- and currently serves as the executive producer of ""60 Minutes"" -- also had multiple alleged encounters detailed.

Half a dozen employees said Fager would become intoxicated at company parties and subsequently start touching people.

""It was always, 'Let's go say hello to Jeff, 'cause you have to pay homage to him, but let's do it early in the evening, before he starts getting really handsy,'"" a former employee recounted to Farrow.

""It is wrong that our culture can be falsely defined by a few people with an ax to grind who are using an important movement as a weapon to get even, and not by the hundreds of women and men that have thrived, both personally and professionally, at '60 Minutes,'"" Fager said in a statement provided to The New Yorker.

But Fager, another source told Farrow, is ""an enabler of this 'Mad Men' culture at '60 Minutes.'""

“I had several producers and editors over the age of sixty who would greet me by kissing me on the mouth. I had people touch my butt a couple times.” — Former CBS employee

Multiple women described CBS as a ""frat house"" to Farrow. ""I had several producers and editors over the age of sixty who would greet me by kissing me on the mouth,"" a former employee told him. ""I had people touch my butt a couple times.""

A ""60 Minutes"" producer, Ira Rosen, reportedly told a former journalist with the program to flirt with story sources. Rosen also made multiple sexual comments, she said. Two other women reiterated similar behavior to Farrow but Rosen dismissed the claims, stating that ""CBS extensively investigated these complaints and found them to be false, misleading and unsubstantiated.""

Fox News' request for comment from CBS was not immediately returned.

Farrow won a Pulitzer Prize and helped ignite the #MeToo movement when he exposed Hollywood heavy hitter Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator in The New Yorker. This, after NBC famously passed on the story.

Farrow is set to explain his side of why NBC passed in an upcoming book."

421,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/08/02/sarah-sanders-blasts-trump-hating-media-and-exposes-their-blatant-bias.html,2,"White House press secretary Sarah Sanders used her nationally televised press briefing Thursday to say some very important things about the round-the-clock unrelenting criticism of the president and his team coming from the Trump-hating mainstream media.

While journalists have focused much attention on President Trump’s criticism of media bias and “fake news” – along with his description of many in the media as “enemies of the people” – they focus far less attention on their own blatant bias against the president.

And you don’t see enough in the media about the bias of the most popular social media platforms against Republicans and other conservatives who want to express their opinions.

Speaking to CNN’s famously anti-Trump correspondent Jim Acosta, Sanders said Thursday: “It’s ironic, Jim, that not only you and the media attack the president for his rhetoric when they frequently lower the level of conversation in this country. Repeatedly, repeatedly the media resorts to personal attacks without any content other than to incite anger.”

Sanders went on to say to Acosta: “Repeatedly, the media has attacked me personally, on a number of occasions including your own network. Said I should be harassed as a life sentence. That I should be choked. ICE officials are not welcome in their place of worship and personal information is shared on the Internet. When I was hosted by the Correspondents Association, of which almost all of you are members of, you brought a comedian up to attack my appearance and call me a traitor to my own gender. In fact, as far as I know, I’m the first press secretary in the history of the United States that required Secret Service protection.”

And on Wednesday, Sanders in a tweet: “Trump Derangement Syndrome is becoming a major epidemic among Democrats. Instead of freaking out about the booming Trump economy why not celebrate it?” She should have mentioned that many in the media are in the grip of Trump Derangement Syndrome as well.

Yahoo, HuffPost, and a number of other liberal and far-left websites not only were offended by Sanders honest and accurate tweet, but cited evidence that the American people sided with them.

But most Americans don’t – not by a long shot.

Intense hatred of President Trump and his efforts to “drain the swamp,” put America First and end the uncontrolled flow of illegal immigration are driving Democrats, socialists (who have suddenly gone mainstream), the Hollywood crowd and their friends in the press nuts.

These folks are taking to Twitter and other social media platforms and being spotlighted in the media to such a disproportionate extent that we get the impression that they speak for the majority of Americans – but that’s far from the case.

This isn’t honest journalism. It’s magnified and made-up hysteria promulgated by the left for ideological reasons.

Unfortunately, at times it has worked. And it has had a chilling effect on both freedom of speech and the right of Republican, libertarian and conservative Americans to make their voices heard.

As we have discovered – based only upon their own partisan words and actions – Google, Facebook, and Twitter lean left to far-left with regard to the politics of their leadership. Because of that bias, they have used the pretext of “outrage from the twitterverse” to shut down or censor Republican, libertarian, conservative, and traditional Christian views.

This is a growing and dangerous trend recently outlined and challenged by a coalition called Conservatives Against Online Censorship.

President Trump himself recently spoke to this issue when he tweeted: “Twitter “SHADOW BANNING” prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints.”

While Twitter claims the “shadow banning” is the fault of an “algorithmic glitch,” there seem to be a lot of glitches censoring conservatives these days. With just a bit of digging and homework, it is easy to discover that this censorship truly is based only upon bias and an organized campaign by various far-left groups looking and hoping to delegitimize the increasingly successful Trump presidency.

Those behind these troubling efforts still don’t get that tens of millions of Americans – with that number growing every day – are on to them.

Millions of Republicans, independents and Democrats voted for Donald Trump because their voices, fears and hopes were ignored and disregarded by the liberal news media, entertainment industry, academia, and the elite-entrenched establishment from both political parties.

These same millions of Americans now side with Sarah Sanders in support of President Trump. Based upon their own lives, experiences, and evidence all around them, they realize that the Trump economy is a rising tide lifting all boats. And they recognize that Trump Derangement Syndrome is an epidemic threatening the welfare of our nation.

These pro-Trump Americans realize that the Trump-haters would rather destroy our economy than admit that President Trump is succeeding across the board. They are rooting for America to fail so Trump will fail and lose his bid for re-election.

While Trump Derangement Syndrome is spreading among the walled-off, out-of-touch elites, hardworking Americans know there is one antidote and one antidote only that can save the health of the nation: six more years of a Trump presidency."
422,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/07/tuesdays-primaries-test-trumps-influence-hold-potential-for-upsets-look-at-races-to-watch.html,2,"Several states are holding primary elections Tuesday, including some contests that could prove pivotal in determining whether Republicans or Democrats will control the Senate next year.

A tight special U.S. House election also is being held in Ohio as a young Democrat hopes to upset a Republican who has garnered the support of President Trump, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and other party leaders.

Early Tuesday, Trump urged Ohio voters to get out and vote for Republican State Sen. Troy Balderson for Congress, over his opponent, Democrat Danny O'Connor.

""Ohio, vote today for Troy Balderson for Congress. His opponent, controlled by Nancy Pelosi, is weak on Crime, the Border, Military, Vets, your 2nd Amendment - and will end your Tax Cuts. Troy will be a great Congressman. #MAGA,"" Trump tweeted early Tuesday.

The Ohio race and others could put Trump’s influence to the test. Read on for a preview of some of the major elections on Tuesday.

Missouri

Republicans are set to pick their candidate to take on Sen. Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent, in the fall. McCaskill has represented Missouri in the Senate since 2007, but Fox News has her bid for re-election rated as a toss-up.

Out of a crowded field of Republican candidates, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley has emerged as a favorite, even securing Trump’s endorsement months before the primary election.

A lawyer who helped successfully argue before the Supreme Court a case for Hobby Lobby to be exempted from certain ObamaCare rules, Hawley has investigated alleged misuse of a charity donor list by former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, while he was still in office. Greitens eventually resigned earlier this year after allegations of an affair that was at times violent and non-consensual surfaced.

Austin Petersen, who unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party nomination for president in 2016, and Tony Monetti, an Air Force veteran and restaurant owner, are also running for the Republican nomination.

MISSOURI SENATE CANDIDATE RAFFLING MACHINE THAT CAN PRINT ‘UNTRACEABLE’ GUN PARTS

Monetti has been endorsed by former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. Petersen is supported by the Republican Liberty Caucus.

Missouri voters will also decide on a so-called right-to-work referendum on whether the state should ban compulsory union fees in all private-sector workplaces.

Michigan

Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, can’t run for re-election due to term limits, but the race to replace him is anything but simple.

For the Democrats, Abdul El-Sayed, Shri Thanedar and Gretchen Whitmer are battling for the nomination. Whitmer, a former county prosecutor and member of the state legislature, has emerged as the establishment favorite. El-Sayed, on the other hand, has campaigned as a more progressive choice with Sen. Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez both lending their support to the man hoping to become Michigan’s first Muslim governor.

Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, state Sen. Pat Colbeck and Dr. Jim Hines are vying for the GOP nod.

Trump endorsed Schuette nearly a year ago, saying he will be good for job growth in Michigan.

As for Senate, two Republicans are hoping to secure the GOP nomination to take on incumbent Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat. African-American business executive and Iraq War pilot John E. James is taking on Sandy Pensler, a detergent manufacturer, in the August contest.

FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTIONS HEADQUARTERS

Trump has endorsed James, who he called “spectacular.”

“Rarely have I seen a candidate with such great potential,” Trump said in a July tweet.

While Fox News rates the gubernatorial race as a toss-up, the Senate election in November still remains likely safe for Democrats. In 2016, Trump narrowly eked out a victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in Michigan.

Voters in Michigan are able to cast so-called “straight ticket” ballots, meaning they would fill in one bubble to vote for all of one party’s candidates for office. Typically, voters were only able to pick Republicans or Democrats, but this year the Libertarian Party also qualified to nominate candidates for the ballot.

“It certainly is historic, both for Michigan and for Libertarians. Many people see it as a real opportunity to bring new blood and new activists into the party,” Michigan Libertarian Party chairman Bill Hall told MLive.com.

According to the Detroit News, Bill Gelineau and John Tatar are both battling for the Libertarian gubernatorial nomination as well, hoping to secure enough votes to ensure the party appears on the 2020 ballot.

Kansas

Gov. Jeff Colyer is seeking his first full term leading the state, but the race is expected to be tough. Colyer was serving as Kansas’ lieutenant governor when Trump selected Sam Brownback to be the U.S. ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom in January 2018 — thus elevating Colyer into the state’s top position.

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach is also vying for the Republican nomination. Kobach was the vice chairman of the White House’s controversial voter fraud commission, which was dismantled by Trump earlier this year as it faced multiple legal battles and oppositions from states. His involvement with the group has earned him the scorn of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has sent negative flyers to voters ahead of the primary election.

Trump endorsed Kobach the day before the primary, saying he has been ""a strong and early supporter"" of the president.

LIFELONG NEW YORKER JOINS STUDENTS IN KANSAS GOVERNOR RUN THAT HAS ‘NO RULES’

Former state Sen. Jim Barnett, Patrick Kucera, Tyler Ruzich, insurance commissioner Ken Selzer and Joseph Tutera Jr. are also running for the GOP nod. Barnett has been endorsed by the Kansas City Star and made headlines earlier this year when he picked his wife to be his running mate.

Fox News rates the gubernatorial race as lean-Republican, but Democrats are hoping to change the governorship back to blue for the first time since 2011 — especially if Kobach wins.

State Sen. Laura Kelly, former Wichita Mayor Carl Brewer and former Kansas Secretary of Agriculture Joshua Svaty have emerged as the three front-runners in the Democratic primary. The candidates have fought over ties to the National Rifle Association and plans for women’s reproductive health care in the state, according to KMUW public radio station.

Washington

Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, is running for her fourth term in the U.S. Senate — but not without a fight from nearly 30 challengers. That group that includes: 13 Republicans, four Democrats, five independents and one Libertarian, among others.

Former Washington GOP chairwoman Susan Hutchison has emerged as the leading Republican contender to take on Cantwell, according to the Seattle Times.

WASHINGTON STATE EMPLOYEES SUE TO ‘ESCAPE’ UNION AFTER JANUS SUPREME COURT RULING

According to FiveThirtyEight, Cantwell has voted with Trump’s agenda 25 percent of the time, including with the nomination of some Cabinet appointees: Robert Wilkie for secretary of veterans affairs, Robert Lighthizer for trade representative, Sonny Perdue for agriculture secretary and Dan Coats for director of national intelligence.

Fox News rates the Senate race as likely Democrat, but Hutchison told the Seattle Times, “We wouldn’t have this crowded ballot if Maria Cantwell wasn’t vulnerable.”

Clinton solidly beat Trump in Washington in the 2016 presidential election.

Ohio

It’s not a primary election, but Trump’s influence will certainly be tested in Tuesday’s special House election in Ohio.

The open seat came with the resignation of Rep. Pat Tiberi in the 12th district, which has been represented by Republicans for nearly 40 years. But Democrat Danny O’Connor is hoping to change that in his race against Republican state Sen. Troy Balderson.

Polls have shown a tight race between the two, even though Balderson has been endorsed by Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The president made an appearance in Ohio just a few days before the election to lend his support as well.

“A vote for Danny boy and the Democrats is a vote to let criminals and drugs pour into our country,” Trump said of Balderson’s opponent. “And to let MS-13 run wild in our communities. And you know what they do once they’re there.”

On Twitter, Trump has called O’Connor a “puppet” for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

Fox News’ Gregg Re and The Associated Press have contributed to this report."
423,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/08/07/west-hollywood-passes-resolution-to-remove-president-trumps-hollywood-walk-fame-star.html,2,"The West Hollywood City Council passed a resolution Monday night asking to have President Trump's star removed from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, according to a tweet by the city’s mayor.

“West Hollywood City council unanimously passes resolution asking the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to remove the Donald Trump star on Hollywood Walk of Fame,” announced Mayor John Duran on Twitter.

Trump was awarded his star on the prestigious stretch of Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, Calif. in 2007 during the height of his “Apprentice” fame, and it has been defaced and vandalized numerous times since he has been in office.

“The West Hollywood City Council did not pass the resolution because Donald Trump is a conservative or a Republican. Earning a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is an honor. When one belittles and attacks minorities, immigrants, Muslims, people with disabilities or women - the honor no longer exists,“ Mayor Duran told Fox News in a statement.

The resolution will be shared with the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. It's worth noting that the mayor's office has no direct authority over the Walk of Fame and the decision will ultimately be up to the Chamber of Commerce."
424,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/10/trump-tackles-nfl-and-national-anthem-timeline.html,2,"For football fans, the 2017 season was one filled with upsets, dramatic game-deciding calls from referees – and politics. And it looks like 2018 will be no different.

President Trump set his sights on the National Football League when he lashed out at athletes who protest the national anthem before games.

The response from the NFL and its players was swift and unavoidable as games brought opposing teams together, united against a common opponent: the president.

Read on for a look at Trump's gripes with the sport.

Kicking off the new season

As the 2018 preseason kicked off, many players continued to protest during the national anthem – either by kneeling or raising their fists into the air. And it did not go unnoticed.

“The NFL players are at it again – taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the National Anthem,” Trump said. “Numerous players, from different teams, wanted to show their ‘outrage’ at something that most of them are unable to define. They make a fortune doing what they love.”

“Be happy, be cool! A football game, that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy, is no place to protest,” he continued. “Most of that money goes to the players anyway. Find another way to protest. Stand proudly for your National Anthem or be Suspended Without Pay!”

The NFL released a statement on the preseason protests.

“The NFL has been engaged in constructive discussions with the NFL Players Association regarding the anthem and issues of equality and social justice that are of concern to many Americans,” the statement said. “While those discussions continue, the NFL has agreed to delay implementing or enforcing any club work rules that could result in players being disciplined for their conduct during the performance of the anthem.”

The statement went on to say that the league's national anthem policy remained unchanged: it will continue to be played before each game, and all players and team staff on the field are expected to stand for the flag and the anthem. Those who choose not to stand must remain in the locker rooms.

Trump's MVP

The league may still be deciding whether it's going to require players to stand at attention if on the field during the national anthem, but Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones already knows what his team will do.

""Our policy is you stand during the anthem, toe on the line,"" Jones said ahead of the 2018 season.

Trump praised Jones' decision, saying his move ""is what the league should do.""

Jones instructed Cowboys players to stand for the anthem last year as well.

Trump benches the Eagles

Trump announced June 4 that the Philadelphia Eagles would not visit the White House to celebrate the team's Super Bowl win amid the national anthem dispute.

Trump, in a statement, said the team is ""unable"" to visit the ceremony because they don't agree with his belief that NFL players should ""proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.""

The Eagles apparently wanted to send a smaller group of players — as a handful did not plan to attend — but Trump seemingly uninvited the entire team.

A group of 1,000 fans, however, are still invited to attend a ""different type"" of event, one which Trump said ""will honor our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it, and loudly and proudly play the National Anthem.""

Trump cheers on the NFL

After the NFL decided players should stand for the national anthem or face a fine in the future, Trump praised the league, telling Fox News the team owners “did the right thing with that.”

The league has adopted a new policy which mandates that players and personnel have to “stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem” or be fined. Those who do not wish to stand for the national anthem can stay in the locker room “or in a similar location off the field” until it’s over, the NFL said.

“I don’t think people should be staying in the locker rooms, but still I think it’s good. You have to stand proudly for the national anthem,” Trump said. “You shouldn’t be playing, you shouldn’t be there. Maybe they shouldn’t be in the country.”

Trump credited “the people” for enacting the policy change at the NFL. “I brought it out. I think the people pushed it forward,” he said.

Post-game problems

Several Philadelphia Eagles players said they would skip the customary White House visit even before Trump made the June 4 announcement.

Safety Malcolm Jenkins confirmed to a WTXF-TV reporter in May that he would not be visiting the White House. And in April, defensive end Brandon Graham reportedly commented, ""as of right now, I won't be there.""

Prior to their Super Bowl win, both defensive end Chris Long and wide receiver Torrey Smith -- who is now with the Carolina Panthers -- said they, too, wouldn’t attend the usual celebration at the White House should the invitation be extended.

""We are in the process of working through the logistics of a trip to Washington D.C., including a visit to the White House on June 5,"" an Eagles spokesman told NFL.com on May 17.

Pre-game announcement

In a Super Bowl LII presidential message, Trump spoke about U.S. service members and standing for “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

Trump said, “We owe these heroes the greatest respect for defending our liberty and our American way of life. Their sacrifice is stitched into each star and every stripe of our Star-Spangled Banner. We hold them in our hearts and thank them for our freedom as we proudly stand for the National Anthem.”

State of the NFL

During Trump’s first State of the Union address – less than a week before Super Bowl LII – Trump seemingly took a jab at those who protest the national anthem.

While acknowledging White House guest Preston Sharp, a young boy who organized a campaign to put American flags on veterans’ graves, Trump said he “reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.”

Trump takes on Roger Goodell

Trump said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell “lost control of the hemorrhaging league,” on Twitter.

“Can you believe that the disrespect for our Country, our Flag, our Anthem continues without penalty to the players,” Trump said. “The Commissioner has lost control of the hemorrhaging league. Players are the boss!”

Marshawn Lynch’s defense

After Trump publicly criticized Oakland Raiders’ running back Marshawn Lynch on social media, his mother and his coach’s wife jumped to his defense.

Trump said on Twitter that Lynch should be suspended for the remainder of the football season if he does what he did before a game: sit in protest during the playing of the national anthem but stand for Mexico’s anthem.

Delisa Lynch, the football player’s mother, fired back, hitting the president for his past failures to become an NFL team owner.

And Linda Del Rio, the wife of Raiders Coach Jack Del Rio, reportedly said on Twitter, “President Trump I voted for you, which I now regret. Football is a powerful platform – here’s the charitable work we did in Mexico City #NFLproud.” Her account appears to have been deactivated.

Pence out of the game

Vice President Mike Pence attended the Indianapolis Colts game in his home state in October – but not for very long.

Pence and his wife walked out of the game after players from the San Francisco 49ers kneeled during the national anthem.

Trump later tweeted that he was “proud” of Pence and his wife, Karen, for leaving the stadium.

Jerry Jones’ play call

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said his players must stand for the national anthem – if they don’t want to remain seated on the bench for the game.

""I know this, we cannot ... in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,"" Jones said after a team loss. “We know that there is a serious debate in this country about those issues, but there is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag. So we're clear.""

When pressed on other signs of protest, such as players holding up a fist at the end of the song, Jones reiterated that “if there’s anything that is disrespectful to the flag, then [they] will not play.”

Cowboys gain ground with Trump

Along with Jones, the Cowboys briefly knelt together before the national anthem. But when the “Star-Spangled Banner” played, the Cowboys stood with locked arms. The Arizona Cardinals did the same.

“The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was the loudest I have ever heard. Great anger,” Trump tweeted.

“But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem,” he continued. “Big progress being made – we all love our country.”

Trump has said that he had spoken to Jones, calling him a “winner who knows how to get things done.” He also said athletes “will stand for our Country!”

Sarah Sanders takes a shot

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended Trump’s comments on the NFL and its players, saying it’s “always appropriate for the President of the United States to defend our flag, to defend the national anthem and to defend the men and women who fought and died to defend it.”

Sanders also suggested athletes protest “the [police] officers on the field who are protecting them instead of the American flag.”

Race versus respect

Trump said that his issue with athletes’ protests was about “respect” for the U.S. and not race.

“The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our country, flag and national anthem. NFL must respect this!” he said.

Brady breaks Trump’s tackle

Despite his oft-reported friendship with Trump, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said he disagreed with the president’s remarks on the NFL.

“I certainly disagree with what he said. I thought it was just divisive,” Brady said.

Game time decisions

After the president’s speech and tweets, multiple NFL teams and players decided to take a stand – by taking a knee or remaining in the locker room during the Sept. 24 games.

The Pittsburgh Steelers, Seattle Seahawks and Tennessee Titans all remained in their locker rooms while “The Star-Spangled Banner” played.

Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said the decision was made by the team “not to be disrespectful to the anthem, but to remove ourselves from this circumstance.” However, Alejandro Villanueva, an offensive tackle and former Army Ranger, was outside when the anthem began to play and stood alone.

Multiple teams, including the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars, took a knee or locked arms during the national anthem.

And while the locked arms was meant to be a display of unity among NFL players, Trump tweeted his support for the gesture.

""Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!"" he said.

Trump tweeted a total of six times that Sunday about the American flag and protests.

Trump tackles athlete protesters

While in Alabama to campaign for a Republican special Senate election candidate, Trump took a moment to slam athletes who kneel in protest during the national anthem.

""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say 'get that son of a b---- off the field right now, out, he's fired,'"" Trump said to cheers.

“You know, the NFL ratings are down massively, massively,” Trump said as he railed against the league’s officiating on certain tackles. “A referee gets on television, his wife is sitting at home, she’s so proud of him. They’re ruining the game.”

Trump accused ""those people taking a knee"" during the anthem of ""hurting"" football and encouraged people to ""leave the stadium"" if just one player protests.

Buffalo Bills come up short

Before he became president, Trump owned the New Jersey Generals of the now-defunct United States Football League (USFL). Trump pushed for the league's games to be played in the fall, in competition with the NFL, and was widely blamed for the collapse of the league.

After the USFL folded in 1985, Trump unsuccessfully tried to become a NFL team owner.

Trump lost a bidding war to become the Buffalo Bills' new owner in 2014. He was outbid by Terry Pegula, 66, who reportedly paid $1.4 billion for the team.

Trump decried the NFL and the team on Twitter multiple times after losing the ownership fight.

“The [NFL] games are so boring now that actually, I’m glad I didn’t get the Bills. Boring games, too many flags, too soft!” Trump said on Oct. 13, 2014.

Hallquist, 62, is being supported by The Victory Fund, a political action committee that backs LGBTQ candidates across the country, but she says she hopes to be elected on her platform, which includes higher wages for workers in the state, better health care for families and improved education for children.

""Vermonters are going to elect me on the platform. They are not going to elect me because of the fact that I'm transgender — that's the reality,"" Hallquist said, adding: ""Obviously, nationwide it's significant, the first transgender governor. It is pioneering.""

The Victory Fund calls Hallquist a ""game changer.""

""Because she is open and authentic about the fact that she is transgender, that immediately takes away all the questions, all the whispers, and instead allows people to focus on her personality and what she wants to do,"" said Elliot Imse, communications director for the Victory Fund. ""People are liking what they're hearing and that's what's really cool about Christine.""

Hallquist moved to Vermont in 1976. In 1998, well before she transitioned from male to female, she went to work for the Vermont Electric Co-operative, becoming CEO in 2005. She was open about her 2015 transition and allowed news organizations to chronicle the change.

She quit her job at the co-op earlier this year so she could run for office, saying Gov. Phil Scott his ignored the interests of rural Vermonters.

Hallquist defeated environmental activist James Ehlers, dance festival organizer Brenda Siegel, and 14-year-old Ethan Sonneborn -- who got on the ticket because a loophole in the state law doesn’t require candidates to be of voting age.

If she wins in November, she would go on to be the nation’s first transgender governor.

Roughly 200 LGBT candidates are expected to be on the November ballot across the country for state and federal office, the most ever, according to the Victory Fund. They include Alexandra Chandler, Massachusetts' first openly transgender candidate for Congress, and Kim Coco Iwamoto, who would be Hawaii's first transgender lieutenant governor if elected. Like Hallquist, both are Democrats.

426,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/13/fbi-fires-peter-strzok-months-after-anti-trump-texts-revealed.html,2,"FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in both the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes but became a political lightning rod after the revelation of anti-Trump text messages, has been fired.

Strzok attorney Aitan Goelman said in a statement Monday that his client, a 21-year FBI veteran, was fired Friday afternoon, claiming this was a departure from standard practice and politically motivated. Goelman said bureau Deputy Director David Bowdich “overruled” the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility to remove him.

“This decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans,” the attorney said.

The FBI responded: “Mr. Strzok was subject to the standard FBI review and disciplinary process after conduct highlighted in the IG report was referred to the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR). OPR reviewed the investigative materials, as well as the written and oral responses of Mr. Strzok and his counsel, and issued OPR's decision. The Deputy Director, as the senior career FBI official, has the delegated authority to review and modify any disciplinary findings and/or penalty as deemed necessary in the best interest of the FBI.”

Strzok appeared to launch a new Twitter account to fire back, saying he's ""deeply saddened"" by the decision and linking to a GoFundMe page.

President Trump and his allies for months, though, have hammered the former FBI agent and cast him as the poster child for anti-Trump bias within the bureau and Justice Department.

Reacting to the firing, the president tweeted, ""finally,"" while asking whether the Russia case will now be dropped:

""Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The list of bad players in the FBI & DOJ gets longer & longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back!""

The president over the weekend had tweeted that Strzok and others have “badly damaged” the FBI’s reputation, referring to them as “clowns and losers!”

Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year after the discovery that he exchanged anti-Trump and other politically charged messages with colleague and lover Lisa Page.

FBI TEXTING SCANDAL EXPLAINED

In June, he was then escorted from his FBI office and lost his security clearance amid the release of a scathing DOJ inspector general report that largely dealt with the DOJ and FBI’s handling of the investigation into Clinton’s private email server but uncovered messages that “appeared to mix political opinion with discussions” about that probe -- namely, between Strzok and Page.

The IG ultimately found no evidence that the bias among the several FBI agents impacted prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton email probe. But Republicans have repeatedly raised concerns that anti-Trump bias played a role in the start of the investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump associates in 2016.

One Strzok text in particular vowed to ""stop"" Trump from becoming president.

In an explosive congressional hearing last month, Strzok sought to clear his name and address the many controversial messages. He claimed his personal opinions did not affect his work. But Republicans tore into the FBI official, with House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy saying he exhibited ""textbook bias.""

Trump's allies cheered the former agent's termination on Monday.

""Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI because of what his own written words plainly showed: he was willing to use his official FBI position to try and stop President Trump from getting elected. He tarnished the FBI's sterling reputation and severely damaged public trust in an institution where trust is paramount. His conduct should deeply concern every American,"" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said in a statement to Fox News.

Strzok’s attorney, meanwhile, blasted the bureau on Monday, saying the deputy director “reversed the decision of the career FBI official responsible for employee discipline who concluded, through an independent review process, that a 60-day suspension and demotion from supervisory duties was the appropriate punishment.”

He added, “A lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of Congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzok’s personal views ever affected his work.”

The Justice Department declined to comment for this report.

Text messages first emerged last year, showing Strzok and Page discussing 2016 campaign politics and repeatedly blasting Trump. In one message, Strzok called Trump an ""idiot.""

Messages continued to trickle out, including some reflecting apparent concern about being too tough on Clinton during the investigation into her private email system use.

The inspector general report, meanwhile, referred a total of five FBI employees for investigation in connection with politically charged texts, suggesting more disciplinary action could be considered for additional employees. Lisa Page left the bureau earlier this year."
427,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/08/republican-law-limiting-labor-powers-defeated-in-missouri.html,2,"The national push to check union power was dealt a rare blow Tuesday when voters in Missouri rejected a right-to-work law that would have prevented private-sector unions from collecting compulsory fees from workers who do not join.

The law was defeated by a 2-1 margin and came after unions had secured a referendum on the measure, signed into law by then-Gov. Eric Greitens in February 2017. Unions immediately cheered the result on Tuesday, which comes as a relief for Big Labor as a break from a series of blows to union power.

“The defeat of this poisonous anti-worker legislation is a victory for all workers across the country,” AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement.

“The victory in Missouri follows a national wave of inspiring activism that is leading to life-changing collective bargaining agreements and electoral triumphs that remind America the path to power runs through the labor movement,” he said.

The result was also hailed by left-wing Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who called on right-to-work legislation to be defeated “nationwide.”

“We must stand together, beat back union busters, and continue to build and grow the trade union movement in this country,” he said.

The referendum comes on the heels of the Supreme Court’s Janus decision, which dealt a significant blow to unions by ruling that government workers can’t be forced to pay union fees for collective bargaining. Missouri’s law would have extended protection to all private-sector employees.

A number of states had previously brought in right-to-work laws, despite fierce opposition from union leaders. Since 2012, five strong union states -- Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Kentucky -- have adopted such laws, bringing the total of right-to-work states to 27.

In Missouri, unions had massively outspent right-to-work supporters, pouring more than $15 million into the fight.

“No miscalculation. It was a deluge of money coming in from out of state that helped them get to $20 million to buy the election,” Dan Mehan, executive director of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “We just got blown out.”

Unions argue that since they must represent employees even if they don’t join the union, it is right that those employees contribute to the union bargaining for them. But right-to-work supporters say that workers should not be forced to contribute to unions, many of which engage in political activity.

District 27J officially slashed Mondays off the school calendar and started a four-day school week in a move designed to cut costs and attract teachers -- but parents are concerned it will cost them money instead.

Students who attend school in the district had their first day of school on Tuesday. Middle and high school students will attend school from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Tuesdays through Fridays and be off on Mondays, FOX 31 reported. Teachers will have to attend work one Monday a month, but only for half the day.

The school district, which serves about 18,000 students in Brighton, Commerce City, Henderson, Thornton and Aurora, said the move will save about $1 million per year in costs that would have otherwise gone to paying substitute teachers and running school buses.

Monday was chosen because it gives the students an extra “day to prepare,” District 27J Superintendent Chris Fiedler said.

""We really feel like Monday is the day to prepare and to be better for kids,"" Fiedler told USA Today. ""This will give people a chance to have a weekend and then come in on Monday — whether they're paid to or not because they're doing that work anyway to be prepared for kids and to be better for kids.""

429,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/08/23/after-mollie-tibbetts-tragic-death-owe-it-to-her-to-fix-our-broken-immigration-system.html,2,"The tragic killing of 20-year-old University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts – allegedly by an illegal immigrant from Mexico – appears to be yet another example of America’s dangerous and failed immigration policy.

Authorities in Iowa charged a man identified as Cristhian Rivera with first-degree murder Tuesday in Tibbetts’ death. He is being held in jail on a $5 million cash-only bond.

According to authorities, Rivera – if that is really his name – is a 24-year old illegal immigrant from Mexico, whose movements driving a black SUV in the area of Tibbetts’ disappearance were caught on security cameras. Tibbets disappeared July 18 while she was running in the rural central Iowa town of Brooklyn.

How many more needless deaths will it take for our immigration policies to change?

Apologists for illegal immigration are already trying to deflect public attention from this horrific case.

When asked about Tibbetts’ killing on CNN, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. – beloved by far-left Democrats and a possible presidential contender in 2020 – said that she knows this is hard for the Tibbetts family. However, she said that our focus should be “on where the real problems are,” which she said is the separation of “mamas and babies” who entered the U.S. illegally at the border.

Fordham University Professor Christina Greer lamented on MSNBC that “Fox News is talking about a girl in Iowa” instead of devoting more air time to court proceedings Tuesday resulting in felony convictions for former Trump presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a guilty plea to other crimes by President Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen. Greer later backtracked for what she called her “flippant” remark about Tibbetts.

Americans should not be distracted by the chirping of these and other advocates of open borders, including the Cato Institute, which claims misleadingly that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than Americans. Even if that statement was factual (it isn’t), it is completely irrelevant to this case, and no comfort to the victims.

The reality is that while most illegal immigrants are not violent, many do commit crimes, sometimes horrific ones, just like Americans do.

The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office estimates in a new report that since 1974 there have been more than 32,000 immigrants incarcerated for homicide in federal and state prisons. Other government reports show that most of these criminal immigrants are in the country illegally. They are not usually legal immigrants, who are vetted for criminal records.

It sounds obvious, but nowadays it is necessary to remind lawmakers that these homicides and many other crimes could have been prevented with better border security to block illegal entry into the U.S.

The fact that illegal immigration exacerbates crime is not lost on America’s local law enforcement agencies. Sheriffs and police leaders have become more and more outspoken in recent years urging the federal government – and especially Congress – to shore up our immigration enforcement.

Hundreds of sheriffs signed a letter to Congress in the spring, asking for the passage of a House bill to improve enforcement. The letter states: “Year after year, we have been warning the Federal government about detrimental increases in transnational drug trafficking, gang violence, sex trafficking, murder, and other escalating incidents of crime by illegal aliens entering our country.”

Not only are criminal immigrants a threat to the community, they are a strain on taxpayers. The same GAO report found that federal and state governments spent about $2.5 billion on incarcerating foreign criminals in 2015 – not including the additional cost of arrest, prosecution, deportation, and of course, the cost to the victims. Now we see how high the cost can be to Iowans for some of the low-wage workers demanded by local farmers.

The killing of Mollie Tibbetts also highlights the role of identity fraud in facilitating the illegal employment that draws most illegal immigrants to this country.

Rivera reportedly used a false identity to secure an Iowa photo ID card and may have used these documents to secure employment at a farm, where he apparently worked for four years. It has not been revealed if he used these same documents to get a driver’s license.

Authorities said the Chevy Malibu that Rivera used to stalk Tibbetts and then transport her body to the corn field where she was later found was not registered in his name. That’s a common practice for unlicensed drivers, and another in the list of crimes of “otherwise law-abiding” illegal immigrants.

An estimated 75 percent of illegal immigrants obtain false documents. Counterfeit green cards are not difficult to detect, but incidents of total identity theft – in which the illegal immigrant uses the name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a real person – have become more common.

The Trump administration is cracking down on this practice. Last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions traveled to Boston to announce the results of Operation Double Trouble. Under the enforcement operation, dozens of illegal immigrants were charged with identity theft-related crimes, including fraudulently obtaining Medicaid and other welfare benefits, and registering to vote.

Some of those charged are heroin traffickers, who have obtained U.S. passports to facilitate their deadly illicit commerce.

More can be done, even without passing new laws.

The Social Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, and immigration agencies must be empowered to work together to act on instances of the multiple use of Social Security numbers that are easily detectable within government tax and crime databases.

Citizens should be notified when their Social Security numbers have been compromised. Employers should have to terminate illegal workers when detected. Agencies should use facial recognition technology more frequently to detect imposters.

As long as prospective illegal immigrants believe that after making it past border and visa controls they will be able to get a job, a driver’s license, and live as if they were in the U.S. legally, they will continue to come.

Like the smuggling rings, the identity document industry is part of the infrastructure of illegal immigration. And like the smugglers, the document vendors do not care whether their clients are harmless workers, drug traffickers, terrorists or criminals.

When authorities allow such illicit enterprises to flourish, they are inviting more illegal immigration, and setting the stage for more atrocities committed by people who should not have found it so easy to get here and stay here illegally."
430,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/23/trump-rips-cohen-for-flipping-praises-manafort-in-exclusive-fnc-interview.html,2,"President Trump blasted his former attorney, Michael Cohen, for “flipping” on him and praised another ex-lieutenant with legal trouble, Paul Manafort, in an exclusive “Fox & Friends” interview with Ainsely Earhardt airing Thursday morning.

The sit-down comes during a dizzying week that saw Cohen plead guilty and Manafort get convicted for crimes that mostly had to do with their personal business dealings. But Cohen also admitted making hush money payments on behalf of Trump in what prosecutors say amounted to campaign violations.

“[Cohen] makes a better deal when he uses me, like everybody else,” Trump said. “And one of the reasons I respect Paul Manafort so much is he went through that trial—you know they make up stories. People make up stories. This whole thing about flipping, they call it, I know all about flipping.”

He continued: “For 30, 40 years I’ve been watching flippers. Everything’s wonderful and then they get 10 years in jail and they—they flip on whoever the next highest one is, or as high as you can go.”

Cohen, Trump's former longtime personal attorney and self-described “fixer,” pleaded guilty Tuesday to five counts of tax evasion, one count of bank fraud, one count linked to an unlawful corporate contribution, and one count stemming from an illegal campaign contribution. The tax and fraud charges were tied to his dealings with a taxi business, while the campaign finance charges related to arranging payments to adult film star Storm Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal “at the direction” of then-candidate Trump.

Cohen is facing up to 65 years in prison on all the counts, but prosecutors have pledged to reduce his sentence sharply as part of the plea deal.

“It almost ought to be outlawed. It’s not fair. Because if somebody’s going to give—spend five years like Michael Cohen, or 10 years, or 15 years in jail because of a taxi cab industry, because he defrauded some bank—the last two were tiny ones,” Trump explained. “You know, campaign violations are considered not a big deal, frankly. But if somebody defrauded a bank and he’s going to get 10 years in jail or 20 years in jail, but if you can say something bad about Donald Trump and you’ll go down to two or three years, which is the deal he made.”

Trump said that “in all fairness” to Cohen, “most people are going to do that.”

“I’ve seen it many times,” Trump said. “I’ve had many friends involved in this stuff. It’s called flipping and it almost ought to be illegal.”

He laid out a scenario in which “you get 10 years in jail, but if you say bad things about somebody in other words, make up stories if you don’t know. Make up. They just make up lies. I’ve seen it many times.”

“They make up things and now they go from 10 years to they’re a national hero. They have a statue erected in their honor. It’s not a fair thing, but that’s why [Cohen] did it,” Trump said.

Trump also seemingly distanced himself from Cohen, downplaying a relationship which spanned over a decade.

“He was a lawyer for me, one of many,"" Trump said. ""You know, they always say, 'the lawyer,' and then they like to add 'the fixer.'” Well, I don’t know if he was a 'fixer.' I don’t know where that term came from. But he’s been a lawyer for me. Didn’t do big deals, did small deals. Not somebody that was with me that much.”

He added: “You know, they make it sound like I didn’t live with—without him. I understood Michael Cohen very well. He—well, it turned out he wasn’t a very good lawyer, frankly.”

Trump said that Cohen worked for him for about 10 years, and he would “see him sometimes,” but noted that while Cohen was involved in big deals, Trump had “outside lawyers” and “inside lawyers, too.”

“I always found him to be a nice guy,” Trump said.

At issue involving the president is the $130,000 payment to Daniels in the weeks prior to the 2016 presidential election in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump, as well as the McDougal case. McDougal was paid $150,000 by the parent company of the National Enquirer for her, separate, story about an alleged 2006 affair with Trump, which it never published. Cohen admitted Tuesday to making an excessive campaign contribution and causing an unlawful corporate contribution.

But Trump insisted he only knew about hush-money payments made by Cohen “later on,” despite Cohen’s claims to the contrary.

“Later on I knew. Later on. What he did –and they weren’t taken out of the campaign finance, that’s the big thing. That’s a much bigger thing,” Trump said. “Did they come out of the campaign? They didn’t come out of the campaign, they came from me.”

He added: “In fact, my first question when I heard about it was, did they come out of the campaign, because that could be a little dicey. And they didn’t come out of the campaign and that’s big. But they weren’t…that’s not even a campaign violation.”

“If you look at President Obama, he had a massive campaign violation but he had a different attorney general and they viewed it a lot differently,” Trump said. Trump was referring to Obama's 2008 campaign being fined $375,000 by the Federal Election Commission for a series of missing notices for more than 1,300 contributions. They totaled $1.8 million.

Trump, though, went on to criticize Attorney General Jeff Sessions, saying he “never took control of the Justice Department."" When asked whether he would fire Sessions or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he maintained that he wants to “stay uninvolved” with the DOJ.

“Jeff Sessions recused himself, which he shouldn’t have done. Or he should have told me,” Trump said. “Even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself and then you wouldn’t have put him in. He took the job and then he said I’m going to recuse myself. I said, ‘what kind of man is this?’”

Trump added that the “only reason” he appointed him as attorney general was “because I felt loyalty.”

“He was an original supporter. He was on the campaign. He knows there was no collusion,” Trump said. “And what’s come out of Manafort? No collusion. What’s come out of Michael Cohen? No collusion.”

This week, Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, was charged on eight counts of tax fraud as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Unlike Cohen, Trump noted in the exclusive interview with “Fox & Friends,” Manafort did not ‘flip.’

""I have great respect for what he's done in terms of what he's going through. You know, he worked for Ronald Reagan for years. He worked for Bob Dole. He worked, I guess his firm worked, for [Sen. John] McCain. He worked for many, many people many, many years, and I would say what he did, some of the charges they threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does,"" Trump said.

He added: ""If you look at Hillary Clinton's person, you take a look at the people that work for Hillary Clinton, and look at the crimes that Clinton did with the emails and she deletes 33,000 emails after she gets a subpoena from Congress, and this Justice Department does nothing about it and all of the other crimes that they've done.""

Trump said he ""didn't know Manafort well,"" and that his charges were ""on things totally unrelated to the campaign.""

""And by the way, they got Cohen on [charges] totally unrelated to the campaign,"" Trump explained. ""I'm not involved. I wasn't charged with anything. You know, people don't like to say that, but I wasn't charged."""
431,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/25/amid-cancer-treatment-mccain-exercised-significant-political-clout-from-afar.html,2,"The family of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., says the senator is suspending treatment for his brain cancer. But it’s notable the statement came from the family and not the senator.

McCain last voted on the Senate floor on an interim government funding bill on December 7 last year. He hasn’t visited the Capitol since.

That said, McCain has exercised significant influence from afar amid his convalescence.

I have tracked McCain’s statements for months. I would take notice if I hadn’t seen a statement from McCain for a while. But then a statement would pop into the in-box.

The statements didn’t quote McCain’s press team. They’re directly from McCain himself, revealing engagement from afar.

McCain’s office pushed out statements of late on the Senate’s passage of the defense authorization bill, named after the senator himself. On July 13, McCain weighed in on the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers.

“Today’s indictment is a result of the hard work of America’s law enforcement and intelligence officials who dedicate their lives to bringing to justice those who wish to do us harm. These revelations add to a body of evidence confirming an extensive plot by Vladimir Putin’s government to attack the 2016 election, sow chaos and dissention among the American electorate, and undermine faith in our democracy,” said McCain.

On July 12, McCain applauded the House’s passage of a bill to implement a water settlement with Arizona’s White Mountain Apache Tribe.

“The federal government owes it to the White Mountain Apache Tribe to follow through on the commitment it made seven years ago to build the Miner Flat Dam,” said McCain in a statement. “This legislation would resolve the tribe’s claims to the Salt River in Arizona and pave the way for the completion of the Miner Flat Dam and Reservoir, which are key to protecting the Tribe’s at-risk water supply.”

McCain joined Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., on August 2 to write Romanian Prime Minister Dancila about the firing of the Chief Prosecutor of Romania’s anti-corruption agency.

“We urge the Romanian government not to retreat in the important fight against corruption,” wrote the senators.

On August 13, President Trump signed the John. S. McCain Defense Authorization Act into law. In a statement, the senator said he was “humbled that my colleagues” would name the annual defense bill after him. McCain also said the legislation would “help deliver our service members the resources they need to rise to the challenges of a dangerous world.”

And then nothing from McCain until today’s statement from his family.

Conversations about about McCain’s future, health and even the process for a potential successor have been taboo around the Capitol for some time now. Senators who had even visited with McCain were circumspect in their remarks about their colleague. If anything was said, it was done in hushed tones and so far off the record. That’s because everyone on Capitol Hill - ranging from senators to aides to reporters and Senate staff - suspected they’d see a statement like this at some point from McCain’s office. And as much as no one wanted to admit it, they knew it was just a matter of when.

There was a point when some senators, perhaps wishfully, thought McCain may return to the Capitol and even vote. But that was never in the offing.

In May, McCain published a statement announcing his opposition to the nomination of CIA Director Gina Haspel. A former prisoner of war, McCain often spoke about the government’s use of “enhanced interrogation techniques.” After all, no one would say that McCain was subjected to “enhanced interrogation techniques” in Vietnam. McCain was tortured. McCain harbored reservations about Haspel’s role at the CIA when it came to prisoners of war or “enemy combatants.”

“I believe Gina Haspel is a patriot who loves our country and has devoted her professional life to its service and defense,” wrote McCain. “However, Ms. Haspel’s role in overseeing the use of torture by Americans is disturbing. Her refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality is disqualifying. I believe the Senate should exercise its duty of advice and consent and reject this nomination.”

At no point did McCain suggest he would vote on Haspel nor declare he would “vote no.” The Arizona Republican simply stated what he thought his colleagues should do about Haspel.

A similar scenario played out in July when President Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. Most senators put out boiler plate statements about “meeting the nominee” or making up their mind after an in-person chat. McCain’s statement didn’t hint at any of that.

“I look forward to the Senate fulfilling this critical duty through a fair and thorough confirmation process,” said McCain.

What’s also interesting is how much sway McCain continued to have on Capitol Hill in absentia. Reporters squawked when President Trump signed the defense bill and never mentioned McCain. Or, there were various occasions when the President appeared at a campaign rally and mocked the senator – also not invoking McCain.

Still, McCain’s absence cast a long shadow through the Senate corridors. Senators listened to him this spring when he expressed concerns about Haspel.

“His opinion carries a lot of weight with a lot of people, me included,” said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., in May.

McCain’s absence also amplified the narrow Senate Republican majority. With McCain, the GOP holds a tenuous 51-49 Senate advantage. The difference is but a single vote. This is why the Republican leadership sometimes sweated big votes. It magnified the votes of maverick Republicans who sometimes buck the party: Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Rand Paul, R-Ky.

No event augmented the Republican’s narrow majority more than the abortive effort last summer to repeal and replace Obamacare. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., made a dramatic, Saturday nightdecision to postpone consideration of the keystone GOP issue once it became apparent McCain couldn’t make it to the Senate to vote. McConnell would need McCain’s vote to to approve a motion to launch the debate. In addition, McCain’s vote was critical to passing the legislation.

McCain returned to Washington some days later and voted to initiate debate on the Republican repeal and replace gambit. And then, finding the bill not to his liking, McCain torched the GOP efforts.

Even frank and reliable Republican sources are resistant to comment about what’s next. But Arizona law works like this: Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) would appoint another Republican until a special election is called in 2020. Arizona law requires the appointee “be of the same political party as the person vacating the office.” Arizona voters re-elected McCain to the Senate in 2016. The winner of the 2020 special election would serve until 2022, the balance of McCain’s unexpired term.

432,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/28/trump-threatens-google-over-alleged-biased-search-results.html,2,"President Trump threatened Google in an early Tuesday morning tweet, saying the Internet giant’s search engine is biased against conservative media and promised that the situation “will be addressed.”

“Google search results for “Trump News” shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Illegal?” Trump wrote in a tweet.

“96% of results on “Trump News” are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!” he added.

Google, however, pushed back and denied ranking results to ""manipulate"" political sentiment.

""When users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. ""Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology. Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users' queries. We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.""

This is the first time Trump raised the issue of Google search engine’s alleged bias. Just weeks ago Trump attacked other tech giants such as Twitter and Facebook for silencing non-left wing voices, saying “too many voices are being destroyed” and pledged to address the problem as well.

Facebook and Twitter have been under fire for allegedly censoring conservative and Republican accounts on their platforms, while taking a more lenient approach to liberal and left-wing users.

The president previously pointed out to the problem of so-called “shadow banning” on social media platforms, where users while technically not banned but their posts aren’t visible to most users, saying the practice was “discriminatory and illegal.”

TRUMP SAYS ‘TOO MANY VOCIES ARE BEING DESTROYED’ BY SOCIAL MEDIA CENSORSHIP

Earlier this summer, California Republican Rep. Devin Nunes said Google and other tech giants could face hearings over alleged anti-conservative bias.

“I think what the American people need to understand is there is bias against conservatives and Republicans all across this country,” he said during an interview on Fox Business. “And now as you see things, it’s always been there with newspapers and television, but now as you see it getting into the internet it's one of the challenges we have with millennials.”

His remarks came after Google came under fire for inadvertently listed “Nazism” as one of the ideologies of the California Republican party. Google immediately fixed the issue after widespread criticism and blamed the search result on “vandalism” on one of its sources.

A U.S. House committee announced last week that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and other tech executives will appear before the panel on Capitol Hill Sept. 5.

Dorsey will discuss his company’s “algorithms and content judgment calls” before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the committee announced via Twitter."
433,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/26/us-and-mexico-close-to-reaching-nafta-deal-sources-say.html,2,"The United States and Mexico look close to resolving key differences on the North American Free Trade Agreement and may have a complete deal worked out by as early as Monday, according to sources close to the talks.

Three people familiar with the progress told Bloomberg that there have been significant breakthroughs over the past few days on issues ranging from automobiles to energy, although it is unclear if any of the progress will be made public as Mexico’s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo has said the country won’t make an announcement on NAFTA until Canada also signs on to a new deal.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Sunday morning that the administration has “no announcements or anything finalized at this time,” despite President Trump’s enthusiastic tweet on Saturday that there could be a “big Trade Agreement” soon.

More on this...

“Our relationship with Mexico is getting closer by the hour,” Trump tweeted. “Some really good people within both the new and old government, and all working closely together....A big Trade Agreement with Mexico could be happening soon!”

Despite Trump’s oftentimes contentious relationship with Mexico, his administration and that of outgoing Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto have been working for the past five weeks to iron out their bilateral differences so Canada can rejoin the talks to update NAFTA. Both countries want to finalize an agreement this month so that it can be signed ahead of Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s inauguration in December.

One of the biggest issues on the negotiating table deals with car manufacturing jobs, as the Trump administration pushes for a deal that would boost factory employment in the U.S.

The U.S. on Thursday agreed to keep the 2.5 percent tariff currently applied under World Trade Organization rules if the cars are made at factories that already exist, which leaves open the possibility that automobiles that are built at new plants could face tariffs of 20 percent to 25 percent.

Trump has also signaled that he is open to negotiating trade deals with Mexico and Canada separately, while both countries have said they want to keep the three-nation trade deal that dates back to 1994.

Earlier in August, Trump threatened Canada with auto tariffs if the U.S. and Canada can't forge a deal.

""Canada must wait,"" Trump tweeted. ""Their Tariffs and Trade Barriers are far too high. Will tax cars if we can't make a deal!""

Canada responded with a statement Friday night, saying: ""Our focus is unchanged. We'll keep standing up for Canadian interests as we work toward a modernized trilateral NAFTA agreement.""

Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canada's foreign minister, added: ""We're glad Mexico and the U.S. continue to work out their bilateral issues. It's the only way we'll get to a deal.""

Ron DeSantis, the GOP nominee for governor, clarified comments he made earlier Wednesday in which he warned voters not to “monkey this up” by voting for his Democratic opponent, who is black.



“We've got to work hard to make sure that we continue Florida going in a good direction, let’s build off the success we’ve had with Governor [Rick] Scott,” DeSantis, fresh off his Republican primary victory, said on Fox News' ""America’s Newsroom” earlier in the day.

“The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state.”



The remark drew instant fire from Democrats, who accused him of using “racist dog whistles,” considering the Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum is black.



“It's disgusting that Ron DeSantis is launching his general election campaign with racist dog whistles,” Florida Democratic Party Chair Terrie Rizzo said.



Gillum spokesman Geoff Burgan told The Tallahassee Democrat that the campaign was leaving it to the party to respond.



""DeSantis' comments speak for themselves,"" Burgan said.

TRUMP-ENDORSED RON DESANTIS TO FACE BERNIE-BACKED ANDREW GILLUM IN FLORIDA GOVERNOR'S RACE



But DeSantis’ office dismissed claims that his remarks had a racial dimension as “absurd.”



“Ron DeSantis was obviously talking about Florida not making the wrong decision to embrace the socialist policies that Andrew Gillum espouses,” spokesman Stephen Lawson said in a statement. “To characterize it as anything else is absurd.”



“Florida’s economy has been on the move for the last eight years and the last thing we need is a far-left Democrat trying to stop our success,” the statement said.



Gillum, a Bernie Sanders-backed Tallahassee mayor, pulled off a major upset in defeating a half a dozen rivals, including former Rep. Gwen Graham, in Tuesday's Democratic primary.

DeSantis and Gillum will face each other in November's general election. If he triumphs, Gillum would be the state's first black governor.

""I'm truly honored to represent people across the state as the Democratic nominee -- and I promise to stand up for everyday Floridians and the issues that matter most,"" Gillum tweeted after his win.

""The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great,' McCain's daughter said, in what appeared to be a reference to Trump's presidential campaign slogan: ""Make America Great Again.""

The remarks were made during a funeral service at Washington National Cathedral for the Arizona Republican, who died last week of brain cancer.

Obama's jabs were more subtle but still appeared to be directed at the current occupant of the White House. He derided those in politics who traffic in ""bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage.""

He also attacked ""a politics that pretends to be brave and tough but in fact is born of fear.""

""John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that,” he said.

It was Meghan McCain who had the most searing swipes at the president however. Notably she said that her father's passing represented the passing of ""American greatness. The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.""

Former President George W. Bush also paid tribute to McCain.

""John – as he was the first to tell you – was not a perfect man. But he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have yet conceived,"" he said. ""He was motivated by a vision of America carried ever forward, ever upward, on the strength of its principles.""

The funeral service notably did not feature President Trump, who had feuded with McCain, particularly during the presidential campaign. In 2015, after McCain had said Trump's platform had ""fired up the crazies,"" Trump had mocked McCain's imprisonment in the Vietnam War, saying: ""I like people that weren't captured."" Trump has also fumed about McCain's vote last year to kill off a bill to reform ObamaCare.

Both Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner were in attendance. Trump, meanwhile, went to the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. He also tweeted about subjects including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Russian investigation.

A six-term senator and a Vietnam veteran who was held as a prisoner of war for more than five years, McCain pushed for bipartisanship on the Hill. He ran against Bush for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. He clinched the nomination in 2008 but was defeated in the presidential election by Obama.

FAREWELL STATEMENT FROM JOHN MCCAIN

Other notable speakers included former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman.

""His death seems to have reminded the American people that these values are what makes us a great nation, not the tribal partisanship and personal attack politics that have recently characterized our life, "" Lieberman, who McCain considered for his vice-presidential nominee, said.

McCain’s pallbearers included actor Warren Beatty and Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Earlier Saturday, his casket traveled to the cathedral after stopping at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where McCain’s wife Cindy laid a wreath. Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly accompanied her.

On Friday colleagues, family and friends paid tribute to his service both in the military and the Congress as he lay in state underneath the Capitol rotunda.

JOHN MCCAIN HONORED AT US CAPITOL, LAWMAKERS PAY TRIBUTE TO 'GENERATIONAL LEADER'

With members of McCain’s family in attendance, Vice President Mike Pence said Americans “marveled at the iron will of John McCain” and praised him for holding fast “to his faith in America through six decades of service.”

“Generations of Americans will continue to marvel at the man who lies before us, the cocky, handsome naval aviator who barely scraped through school, and then fought for freedom in the skies; who witnessed to our highest values, even through terrible torture; and who became a generational leader in the United States Senate, where our nation airs its great debates,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said.

Tributes have poured in from both sides of the aisle for the Republican senator and 2008 presidential nominee. On Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden remembered McCain as a brother, and said the two were “cockeyed optimists” in a memorial service for McCain at a church in Phoenix.

Biden, a Democrat, declared that McCain’s “legacy is going to continue to inspire generations.”

McCain is to be buried Sunday at his alma mater, the U.S. Naval Academy, next to his best friend from the Class of 1958, Adm. Chuck Larson.

436,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/29/why-cnn-is-standing-by-michael-cohen-story-that-his-lawyer-calls-false.html,2,"Lanny Davis, who has been engaged in high-stakes crisis management and political lawyering for decades, says he made a mistake.

CNN, which relied on Davis at least in part for a story he now says is false, won't say it made a mistake.

And the contretemps contains a revealing look at the sausage-making of investigative reporting and the sometimes murky dance between reporters and their unnamed sources.

Davis, who I've found to be a straight shooter over a quarter century dating back to the Clinton scandals, told me in a telephone interview yesterday that he had made an error and regrets it.

""I should not be talking to reporters on background about something I'm not certain about,"" Davis told me, describing his interactions with CNN reporters. ""The combination of big stakes and a big mistake is a bad moment for me. If I had a redo in life, I wouldn't have said anything about the subject.""

He added: ""I don't blame anyone other than myself.""

After initially saying nothing, here is the sum total of CNN's comment: ""We stand by our story, and are confident in our reporting of it."" A CNN report yesterday said that Davis kept changing his story in his dealings with the network.



Here's the backstory: CNN dropped a bombshell last month by reporting that Davis' client, Michael Cohen, had information that Donald Trump knew in advance of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between his son, his son-in-law, campaign chairman and a Russian lawyer. ""Cohen is willing to make that assertion to special counsel Robert Mueller,"" according to ""the sources,"" CNN said.

The president has repeatedly denied any advance knowledge of the meeting.

The story, whose bylines included Carl Bernstein and Jim Sciutto, was picked up by the broadcast networks and many other major media organizations.

But now Davis has outed himself as an anonymous source for CNN, and says Cohen has no such information about advance knowledge by the president.

In my interview, Davis said he told CNN reporters that he couldn't confirm the Trump Tower allegation but encouraged them to check it out. He now believes they may have interpreted this as giving them a green light.

""When I work for a client, whether it's the White House or anybody else, and there's something that might be true but I'm not sure, I have to not expect reporters to get it right,"" Davis told me. He said he should have been more explicit in telling the CNN journalists not to pursue an unsubstantiated story.

Davis added that he did not intentionally mislead CNN's Anderson Cooper in saying he wasn't a source for the network. He meant that he wasn't a confirming source on the Trump Tower allegation and says he should have been more clear.

Implicit in CNN standing by the story is that the network has other sources for the Trump Tower allegation. But how could others have information about what Cohen believes when the president's former lawyer is essentially saying, through Davis, that he has no such information?

Cohen, of course, pleaded guilty last week to bank fraud, tax evasion and campaign finance violations related to hush money payments to two women making accusations against Trump.

The president, of course, has boasted about Davis' admission on Twitter.

The Washington Post handled its dealings with Davis very differently. The Post had also dealt with him as an unnamed source.

As the paper recounts, the day after the CNN story, ""The Post reported that Cohen had told associates that he witnessed an exchange in which Trump Jr. told his father about an upcoming gathering in which he expected to get information about Clinton. The Post did not report that Trump Jr. told his father that the information was coming from Russians.

""The information in the Post story, which was attributed to one person familiar with discussions among Cohen's friends, came from Davis, who is now acknowledging his role on the record.""

And that’s the thing. CNN doesn’t have to protect Davis, who has come clean about his role in the matter.

When the White House makes a mistake or clings to an unsubstantiated charge, news organizations hammer top officials about it. Shouldn't a network have the same obligation to explain itself when an explosive story is denied by one of its own sources?

Davis says he has learned a valuable lesson, and is ""pulling back"" on other claims he has made. The Washington lawyer told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow there were indications that Trump knew in advance of the hacking of Democratic emails.

He said that was his belief but that he had no hard evidence to back it up.

Lanny Davis has owned up to his mistake. We'll have to see what lessons are drawn by other players in this melodrama."
437,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/09/04/white-house-fires-back-at-woodward-book-detailing-infighting-insults-administrative-coup-detat.html,2,"The White House hit back Tuesday after excerpts were released from a forthcoming book by veteran reporter Bob Woodward detailing a White House beset by infighting and facing an ""administrative coup d'etat"" in the ranks.

“This book is nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the President look bad,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

Meanwhile, President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani blasted those officials talking trash to Woodward.

""If they said it, they should be questioning why they are there. Why don't they go get another job? That's the kind of disloyalty that leads to you leaving, not staying and undermining the president,"" Giuliani told CNBC.

An early copy of The Washington Post associate editor’s book was obtained by The Washington Post. According to the Post, it portrays a chaotic Trump White House filled with second-guessing by members of Trump’s staff, who repeatedly bad-mouth him behind closed doors.

The book is to be released on Sept. 11.

According to The Post, the book alleges that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told associates of the president that he had the understanding of “a fifth- or sixth-grader.” After Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a chemical attack on Syrians in April 2017, Trump is said to have demanded Mattis launch an assassination attempt.

“Let’s f---ing kill him! Let’s go in. Let’s kill the f---ing lot of them,” Trump reportedly said. But Mattis told an aide: “We’re not going to do any of that. We’re going to be much more measured.”

Mattis responded Tuesday: “The contemptuous words about the President attributed to me in Woodward’s book were never uttered by me or in my presence. While I generally enjoy reading fiction, this is a uniquely Washington brand of literature, and his anonymous sources do not lend credibility.”

He continued: “In serving in this administration, the idea that I would show contempt for the elected Commander-in-Chief president Trump, or tolerate disrespect to the office of the President from within out Department of Defense, is a product of someone’s rich imagination.”

Former White House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, meanwhile, is alleged to have stolen a letter from Trump’s desk that would have withdrawn the U.S. from a trade agreement with South Korea. Cohn is reported to have said that he did it to protect national security and that Trump didn't notice that it was missing.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly is reported to have frequently lost his temper, and described Trump as “an idiot.”

“It’s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He’s gone off the rails. We’re in Crazytown,” Kelly said, according to Woodward. “I don’t even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I’ve ever had.”

On Tuesday, Kelly said that the account was false.

“The idea I ever called the President an idiot is not true,"" he said in a statement. ""As I stated back in May and still firmly stand behind: 'I spend more time with the President than anyone else, and we have an incredibly candid and strong relationship. He always knows where I stand, and he and I both know this story is total BS. I'm committed to the President, his agenda, and our country. This is another pathetic attempt to smear people close to President Trump and distract from the administration’s many successes.""

Former Trump attorney John Dowd, meanwhile, denied claims that he held a practice session of a potential interview with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, called Trump a liar, and told Trump he could end up in an ""orange jumpsuit"" if he interviewed with Mueller.

He also said Woodward's book appears to be ""the most recent in an endless cycle of accusations and misrepresentations based on anonymous statements from unknown malcontents.""

Trump is reported not to have held back from criticism of members of his Cabinet. He allegedly called Attorney General Jeff Sessions a “traitor” for recusing himself from overseeing the Russia probe.

“This guy is mentally retarded. He’s this dumb Southerner. … He couldn’t even be a one-person country lawyer down in Alabama,” Trump reportedly said.

Trump was not interviewed for the book, despite what Woodward said were repeated attempts to contact him. Trump called Woodward in August and told him that his staff hadn’t informed him of the request and expressed concern that the book would be “inaccurate.”

“So I have another bad book coming out,” Trump says, according to a tape of that conversation published by The Post. “Big deal.""

But publicly, at least, the league is playing nice with its corporate partner.

“The National Football League believes in dialogue, understanding and unity. We embrace the role and responsibility of everyone involved with this game to promote meaningful, positive change in our communities,” NFL Executive Vice President Jocelyn Moore said in a statement. “The social justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised deserve our attention and action.”

While the NFL issued a gentle statement, some league office staffers have expressed annoyance that a corporate partner would throw the national anthem controversy back into the news cycle only four days before the season's start.

The Daily Caller reported that President Trump said in an interview Tuesday, “I think it’s a terrible message.” However, the president continued, “It is what this country is all about, that you have certain freedoms to do things that other people think you shouldn’t do, but I personally am on a different side of it.”

Nike and the NFL have a deal in place that runs through 2028, with the company supplying game-day uniforms and sideline apparel to all 32 franchises. Indeed, Nike’s iconic swoosh logo is a prominent part of all NFL events.

“Pretty much want to burn my shoes,” one current NFL employee told Fox News.

The 2018 season begins on Thursday night when the Atlanta Falcons visit the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. The week leading up to the season's first weekend is usually filled with fantasy drafts, bold predictions and anticipation. However, Nike announced on Monday that the jobless quarterback, known for his role in starting players' anthem protests, would be the face of a new ad campaign to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the “Just Do It” slogan.

Conservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News that Nike’s decision to ruffle the feathers of a partner is “a truly baffling move” at a time when the NFL is “desperately trying” to move on from the anthem issue and focus on football.

“Nike chooses to pour gasoline on the smoldering fire. And let's be completely honest here: Nike isn't 'honoring' Kaepernick, they are intentionally stoking the embers of a divisive issue to try to sell shoes,” Barron said. “The losers here are the NFL and its fans.”

Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem during a 2016 pre-season game when he was a member of the San Francisco 49ers to protest racial injustices and police brutality. The protest has enraged many veterans who feel it is disrespectful to the flag, and Trump has criticized the NFL for not being hard enough on participants.

“I think this is likely to be the single most disastrous marketing decision in the history of sports."" — Clay Travis

Kaepernick opted out of his contract with the 49ers at the conclusion of the 2016 season and has not been signed by another team. He is now heading to court, claiming that team owners conspired to keep him out because of the anthem protests.

“Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything. #JustDoIt,” Kaepernick posted on Twitter.

Disgruntled fans immediately took to social media to post images of Nike merchandise being set on fire. The National Association of Police Organizations has condemned the company.

“The inclusion of Mr. Kaepernick in Nike’s ‘Just Do It’ ad campaign also perpetuates the falsehood that police are racist and aiming to use force against African-Americans and persons of color,” NAPO President Michael McHale wrote in a letter to Nike’s chairman.

Nike stock fell more than 2 percent in early trading on Tuesday and “#NikeBoycott” was trending on Twitter.

In an ironic twist, , sports talk radio host Clay Travis has an upcoming book titled “Republicans Buy Sneakers, Too: How the Left Is Ruining Sports With Politics.” The book’s cover features an illustration of Trump dunking a basketball on Kaepernick.

""Kaepernick has also led to a mass exodus of viewership from the NFL as fans like myself do not want to see politics injected into sports."" — Nine Line Apparel CEO Tyler Merritt

Travis called Nike’s decision “disastrous” and “pathetic,” and reiterated his theory that politics is bad for sports.

“I think this is likely to be the single most disastrous marketing decision in the history of sports. I think it will end up costing Nike billions of dollars in sales,” Travis wrote. “ I don’t want to think about politics when I buy shoes or jerseys for my kids. I don’t want every purchasing decision in my household to be a referendum on whether I agree or disagree with a company’s politics. But that’s what Nike is forcing me to do.”

Several players have kneeled during the anthem since Kaepernick started the trend, and the league attempted to implement a new policy forcing players to stand – but it is currently on hold as the players' association negotiates details with owners.

Tyler Merritt is the CEO of Nine Line Apparel, which bills itself as a “patriotic lifestyle brand” that is owned and operated by veterans. Merritt -- himself is a former Apache helicopter pilot and Special Operations air mission commander – thinks it’s absurd for Nike to make waves when football season is about to start.

“Kaepernick has also led to a mass exodus of viewership from the NFL, as fans like myself do not want to see politics injected into sports,"" he said. ""It is ludicrous for Nike, a partner of the NFL, to support a man that has actively sought to bring down the league.""

Not everyone agrees with Travis and Merritt that Nike should have stayed away from the controversy surrounding Kaepernick. Investment banker Porter Bibb told Fox News that it could turn out to be a good business decision.

“Nike feels it has more to gain from consumers empathetic with both Nike and Kaepernick than it does from partners like the NFL, which is struggling these days with its own non-Kaepernick problems,” Bibb said, pointing to rising concern over player concussions and declining TV ratings.

“I think Nike did the right thing, and you will see iconic stars like Serena [Williams] backing Colin and Nike in this situation,” Bibb said.

The NFL’s TV audience dropped 10 percent last season, according to Forbes. Many watchdogs blame Kaepernick and players protesting during the anthem for the dip.

While some fans might stop purchasing Nike sneakers, TheWrap TV editor and ratings guru Tony Maglio doesn’t think the brand bringing attention to the anthem controversy will cause ratings to slip further.

“Anyone who was already boycotting NFL games because of the ongoing national anthem controversy will be doing so anyway on Thursday, Sunday and Monday,” Maglio told Fox News.

“While news of Kaepernick's new role at Nike has re-energized those passionately for and against Colin's protest,"" he said, ""the non-NFL-related ad campaign is unlikely to influence new people to ignore Kickoff Weekend.”

439,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/09/06/kavanaugh-questioning-enters-final-stretch-as-dems-seem-to-lay-traps.html,2,"In yet another bizarre turn of events at Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Republicans have revealed that documents Democratic Sen. Cory Booker published Thursday morning in supposed defiance of Senate rules had already been cleared for release.

“All of this drama this morning apparently was for nothing and it’s unfortunate,” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters after a chaotic start to the third day of Kavanaugh’s hearing.

Earlier Thursday, Booker dramatically said he would “knowingly” violate Senate rules to release emails marked ""committee confidential"" that showed Kavanaugh discussing racial profiling as a White House lawyer in 2002. Booker referred to his actions as an act of “civil disobedience” and said he was prepared to face punishment.

“I am going to release the e-mail about racial profiling and I understand that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate,” said Booker, a possible 2020 Democratic candidate for president.

At another point, Booker said, “This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an, ‘I am Spartacus’ moment.”

But it turns out, Booker didn’t actually break any rules with that release. The Republicans on the Judiciary Committee said they worked with the George W. Bush library and the Justice Department overnight to clear the emails. The restrictions were waived early Thursday morning.

“We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Booker’s staff asked us to,” said Bill Burck, a lawyer for Bush involved in the release of documents. “We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker’s histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly.""

""Apparently, some just wanted to break the rules and make a scene, but didn’t check their email,"" a spokesman for committee Republicans said in a statement. The committee posted the same documents.

""Clearly, he is running for president,"" GOP Sen. John Thune later told Fox News, speaking of Booker.

A spokeswoman for Booker said the lawmaker and Senate Democrats “were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last night’s documents publicly available.” But she did not address when Booker first learned the materials had been cleared.

“Cory said this morning that he was releasing committee confidential documents, and that’s exactly what he’s done,” Booker spokeswoman Kristin Lynch said.

Later Thursday, speaking to Fox News, Booker still insisted he violated the rules of the Senate.

“I released the documents last night by reading from them in violation of the Senate rules,” he said.

Further, he posted even more emails via Twitter later Thursday afternoon which may have been designated ""confidential.""

The emails related to Kavanaugh's comments on racial profiling appeared to be cleared in part because of the involvement of Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee.

“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: I will happily work with any of my colleagues from across the aisle to go through the necessary steps and processes to try and get specific classified documents released to the public,” Lee tweeted.

Booker released 12 pages of emails – which had been marked “committee confidential” – online for the public to read. The emails included internal post-9/11 discussions surrounding issues of racial profiling.

In a 2002 email, Kavanaugh, who was working as a lawyer in the Bush White House, said he “generally” favored race-neutral security measures, but said they need to “grapple” with the “interim question of what to do before a truly effective and comprehensive race-neutral system is developed and implemented.”

Kavanaugh wrote that the “interim question” is of “critical importance to the security of the airlines and American people in the next 6 months or so, especially given Al Qaeda’s track record of timing between terrorist incidents.”

The episode began a day earlier when Booker first implied Kavanaugh had been open to racial profiling tactics, citing the email exchange between Kavanaugh and a colleague.

However, Booker at the time did not provide Kavanaugh a copy of the emails to review while questioning him about it, prompting an objection from Lee, who charged that it was inappropriate to “cross-examine” Kavanaugh about documents that he “can’t see.”

The emails had been marked ""committee confidential."" But Booker said Thursday he would release them anyway, saying the document is a “great illustration of the absurdity of the process” because there’s nothing in it that’s “national security-related.”

Top Republicans mocked and denounced Booker for the move.

“Running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate or of confidentiality of the documents that we are privy to,” Cornyn told Booker, before he was informed there was no violation.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, dinged Booker for repeating his point.

“Can I ask you how long you’re going to say the same thing three or four times?” Grassley asked.

“I’m saying I’m knowingly violating the rules,” Booker replied. “Senator Cornyn has called me out for it.”

“How many times are you going to tell us that?” Grassley replied.

Cornyn, at one point, read the Senate rule that said senators who disclose confidential business could suffer expulsion from the body.

Booker replied, “Bring it.”

A number of Democrats, including Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, threw their support behind Booker’s move.

“I completely agree with you. I concur with what you are doing…So if there is going to be some retribution against the senator from New Jersey, count me in,” Durbin said.

“We support what Sen. Booker is doing here,” Klobuchar said.

Meanwhile, outbursts from protesters continued to interrupt the proceedings, as they have all week.

“Confirmation hearings are supposed to be an opportunity for the American people to hear from the nominee,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said. ""Unfortunately, it seems that some on the political left have decided to try to turn this hearing into a circus.”

It came as Kavanaugh entered the final stretch of questioning in his confirmation hearing Thursday with Democrats springing a series of cryptic questions – in an apparent attempt to box the nominee into an embarrassing admission or at least throw him off what has been a relatively steady performance.

Under questioning, Kavanaugh denied that he once suggested the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion rights is not settled law. Kavanaugh has repeatedly described the abortion ruling as important Supreme Court precedent difficult to overturn.

Kavanaugh was asked about a 2003 email which was disclosed Thursday, where he wrote: ""I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.""

Kavanaugh said he was not discussing his views, but rather ""what legal scholars might say.""

Other lines of questioning from Democrats have been more mysterious, suggesting an effort to lay a trap.

In an especially combative moment late Wednesday, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked Kavanaugh whether he ever had discussed Special Counsel Robert Mueller or his Russia probe with anyone at Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by Marc Kasowitz, a former personal attorney to President Trump.

“I don’t recall any conversations of that kind with anyone at that law firm… I haven’t had any inappropriate conversations about that investigation with anyone,” Kavanaugh said Thursday, when given the chance to elaborate on Harris' question from a day earlier.

He added, “I’ve never given anyone any hints, forecasts, previews, winks, nothing about my view as a judge or how I would rule as a judge on that or anything related to that.”

For the most part, the hearings have focused on Kavanaugh’s writings and, in particular, key opinions he authored while serving on the nation’s most prestigious appellate court.

The confirmation hearing has been chaotic at times, with Democrats trying to delay the proceedings as they complain they haven’t received enough records from Kavanaugh’s past work.

Kavanaugh served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel’s office in the George W. Bush administration. He also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.

Kavanaugh’s elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court, raising the stakes beyond those of last year’s nomination of Neil Gorsuch.

The judge’s nomination, though, will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators, including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee.

Republicans command a narrow 51-49 Senate majority. Party leaders have said they hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by a floor vote by early October, when the next Supreme Court term begins.

440,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/09/04/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-hearings-launch-amid-partisan-fireworks-high-stakes-for-supreme-court.html,2,"The Senate Judiciary Committee launched confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday, kicking off what is expected to be a bitterly partisan gauntlet as Democrats vow to scrutinize his lengthy record as an appellate judge and lawyer in the Bush administration.

In excerpts of his opening statement released by the White House Tuesday morning, Kavanaugh vowed to be an objective ""pro-law judge.""

""A good judge must be an umpire—a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy,"" he plans to say. ""I don’t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences. I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge. ... If confirmed to the Court, I would be part of a Team of Nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States.""

Kavanaugh's elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court, raising the stakes beyond those of last year's nomination of Neil Gorsuch and leading Democrats to ratchet up their rhetoric.

Last month, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., accused anyone who supports Kavanaugh of being ""complicit in evil."" After ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen’s guilty plea – which was used by Democrats to push for Kavanaugh delays – Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, even nixed a one-on-one meeting with the nominee, claiming Trump had picked him ""purposely ... to protect, as we say in Hawaii, his own okole"" from possible criminal charges. Some Democrats, including Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., had rejected Trump's selection before they even knew who it was, predicting the nomination process would be a ""corrupt bargain with the far Right, big corporations, and Washington special interests.""

WATCH: 'OUTNUMBERED' CALLS OUT CORY BOOKER'S DOOMSDAY RHETORIC ON KAVANAUGH

But Kavanaugh steadily has gathered support from legal circles, former colleagues and Republican lawmakers. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called him ""perhaps the most qualified person ever nominated to the Supreme Court.""

The judge's nomination, though, will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators, including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee.

Republicans command a narrow 50-49 Senate majority, which would return to 51-49 once a Republican successor to the late Sen. John McCain is appointed. Republicans have little margin for error, though Vice President Pence can break a tie.

Who are the senators to watch?

Among the key votes on the Democratic side are Indiana's Joe Donnelly, West Virginia's Joe Manchin and North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp. All three voted to confirm Gorsuch to the Supreme Court last year, and all are up for re-election in November in states that went for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Each has also met with Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill, and has promised to carefully weigh the upcoming hearings before making a final call.

Alabama Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, who recently won a special election and will be up for election in 2020, is also considered a potential yes vote on the nominee. But he recently said he wanted to delay Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, citing the ""cloud"" of suspicion around Trump and his desire to see more documents from his time in the Bush White House. Jones claimed his view was shared by “everybody else around here on the Democratic side of the aisle"" -- but some Democrats, including Manchin, dismissed those last-minute concerns, saying there was no basis to delay the hearings.

Even before former Trump attorney Cohen pleaded guilty last month to several federal charges, Democrats had already called for Kavanaugh's hearings to be postponed until after the November midterms, in retaliation for Senate Republicans' decision to deny a vote on then-President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in 2016.

DEMS CALL COHEN GUILTY PLEA 'GAME CHANGER,' CALL FOR POSTPONING KAVANAUGH HEARINGS

Meanwhile, outside groups have been pressuring moderate Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Both have promised to remain independent and carefully consider the results of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, but have given some clues on their leanings.

Last month, Murkowski vowed to take a ""similar, if not identical … approach I took for Justices Gorsuch, Kagan, Sotomayor, Alito and Roberts"" in vetting the nomination. Murkowski voted to confirm Kavanaugh to a seat on the influential D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006.

And Collins, who also voted to confirm Kavanaugh in 2006, acknowledged shortly after Trump nominated him to the Supreme Court that he has ""impressive credentials and extensive experience, having served more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.""

Notably, Collins has rejected calls from Democrats to delay Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, saying there was ""no basis"" for the move. After meeting with Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill, Collins said Kavanaugh had reassured her that Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case that established a constitutional right to an abortion, was ""settled law.""

NARAL Pro-Choice America and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars targeting Murkowski and Collins specifically, Politico reported, in an effort to sway them against Kavanaugh.

Another influential liberal group opposing Kavanaugh, the Alliance for Justice (AFJ), told Fox News that both Collins and Murkowski would jeopardize their reputations by failing to vote down his confirmation.

""For someone like Collins or Murkowski, their legacy is really on the line here,"" AFJ Legal Director Dan Goldberg said. ""Whatever votes they had in the past to protect women, to protect health care, would long be forgotten -- they would have to own every decision Brett Kavanaugh makes.""

Goldberg added that Kavanaugh's national poll numbers are ""consistent with Robert Bork and Harriet Miers"" when they were under consideration for Supreme Court posts they ultimately didn't receive. A Fox News poll last month showed voters evenly divided on Kavanaugh.

After his sit-down with Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill last month, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also made his case to Murkowski and Collins.

SCHUMER SUGGESTS KAVANAUGH LYING ABOUT HIS TIME IN THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE: 'THIS IS A BRIGHT MAN'

""He would not give me any reassurance that he believed Roe or [Planned Parenthood v. Casey] were correctly decided or should be left alone,"" Schumer claimed. ""That should send shivers down the spine of any American who believes in reproductive freedom.""

Sen. Booker echoed that line of attack after his own meeting with Kavanaugh, telling reporters, ""A lot of folks were wondering that he might not overturn Roe v. Wade. ... He confirmed with me that that door was still wide open.""

Still, Schumer, who also implied Kavanaugh was lying about the details of his time in the Bush White House, acknowledged that Kavanaugh had told Collins that Roe was settled law.

""I understand that the judge told other members today that he considered Roe v. Wade settled law,"" Schumer said, before adding, ""He did not say that to me.""

Kavanaugh's paper trail -- asset or liability?

Kavanaugh has left one of the longest paper trails of any recent Supreme Court nominee, having served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office in the George W. Bush administration. Kavanaugh also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.

In looking at Kavanaugh's jurisprudence, Democrats will likely focus on Kavanaugh's decisions in cases like Priests for Life v. HHS, in which Kavanaugh wrote a dissent arguing that ObamaCare's contraceptive coverage requirements put undue burdens on some religious beliefs.

Both parties are also likely to grill Kavanaugh on his 2011 dissent in an ObamaCare case, Sevensky v. Holder, which Republican critics have claimed effectively provided the Supreme Court with a roadmap to uphold the law's contentious individual mandate provision. In his dissent, Kavanaugh wrote that only a ""minor tweak"" to the text of ObamaCare -- which required individuals to purchase health coverage or pay a monetary cost -- would bring it within the ambit of Congress' established power under the Constitution's Taxing Clause.

Chief Justice John Roberts would later provide the swing vote to uphold to ObamaCare's individual mandate by citing Congress' power under the Taxing Clause, instead of adopting the Obama administration's arguments that the law was justified broadly under the Constitution's expansive authority to generally regulate interstate commerce.

But others, including a former Kavanuagh law clerk, called that interpretation ""nonsense"" and argued that Kavanaugh, in fact, was outlining why Congress' Taxing Clause could not save ObamaCare from unconstitutionality.

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT EMERGES AS NEXT DEM LITMUS TEST

Democrats are also expected to question Kavanaugh about Garza v. Hargan, a recent case in which Kavanaugh dissented from a ruling that the Trump administration should permit an illegal immigrant in federal custody to have an abortion. Kavanaugh's dissent managed to anger both sides of the abortion debate, because while Kavanaugh did not endorse the immigrant's right to an abortion, his dissent also did not specifically deny her that right in all cases.

In the wake of several high-profile school shootings, Democrats may further zero in on Kavanaugh's position on gun rights. Kavanaugh dissented in the landmark Heller case when it was before the D.C. Circuit, arguing that a D.C. ordinance unconstitutionally infringed on residents' right to own semi-automatic weapons by requiring them to keep them unloaded and unassembled, or bound by a trigger lock.

Additionally, liberal groups have highlighted Kavanaugh's record on the environment, saying that he has overzealously struck down Environmental Protection Agency regulations. In a case last year, Mexichem Flour v. EPA, Kavanaugh wrote a majority opinion that struck down a 2015 EPA rule regulating hydrofluorocarbons, which analysts say led to substantially increased greenhouse gasses. Kavanaugh reviewed the text of the Clean Air Act and the legislative history before writing that the EPA's rule had exceeded the agency's statutory authority under the Clean Air Act -- although he sounded a note of regret in the process.

""However much we might sympathize or agree with EPA's policy objectives, EPA may act only within the boundaries of its statutory authority,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""Here, EPA exceeded that authority.""

MEDIA'S BIGGEST MISSES: ASPIRING KAVANAUGH HIT PIECES DRAW MOCKERY

But Supreme Court nominees are typically unwilling to offer much insight into their legal philosophies during confirmation hearings, which carries a major political risk and could prejudice future cases before the Supreme Court. There was also a greater potential for Democrats to score points by questioning Kavanaugh on his record as a Bush administration lawyer and adviser to Kenneth Starr, especially given that his writings in those capacities were less guarded than a typical judicial opinion.

During the Clinton investigation, for example, Kavanaugh unloaded on Clinton, telling Starr that the president should be impeached, citing his ""revolting"" behavior in the Oval Office and ""sheer number of wrongful acts."" But since his time in the Bush White House, Kavanaugh has argued that presidents should not have to endure lengthy probes during their time in office, saying in 2009 that indicting sitting presidents would ""ill serve the public interest,"" especially in times of financial or national security crisis.

He wrote in an article that year: “[T]he nation certainly would have been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots.”

That language has alarmed top Democrats, who have voiced concerns that Kavanaugh would vote to shoot down a subpoena or even indictment of President Trump if one were filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller or other federal prosecutors.

Meanwhile, Democratic concerns that Kavanaugh may have misled the Senate Judiciary Committee during his 2006 confirmation hearings for his D.C. Circuit post have fizzled in recent weeks. A document dump last month from Kavanaugh's time in the Bush White House suggested that he had, in fact, offered legal advice on attorney-client privilege issues surrounding terror detainees, even though he said under oath that he had no involvement in ""rules governing the detention of combatants."" The White House has maintained Kavanaugh's statements were truthful, and the controversy died down.

Nevertheless, Goldberg, the AFJ legal director, said he anticipates that Democrats will hammer the issue during this week's hearings.

""There are certainly questions about his candor and veracity in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee when he was first confirmed --- issues that I know Sen. [Patrick] Leahy will press him on in the hearing,"" Goldberg told Fox News, referring to the long-time Vermont Democratic senator who serves on the Judiciary Committee. Leahy has opposed Kavanaugh dating back to his 2003 nomination to the D.C. Circuit, saying he had ""failed to demonstrate his capacity for independence."" Democrats stalled Kavanaugh's appellate court nomination until 2006.

In recent days, Democrats, including Leahy, have cried foul that the Kavanaugh paper trail is actually not long enough, saying they have been denied access to all the documents they need to vet his nomination. Schumer has threatened to sue the National Archives, which is handling their requests for documents from Kavanaugh's public service. He has also sharply criticized the procedure for the ongoing document production, saying it's inappropriate that a Republican lawyer is vetting all documents before their release.

Despite Kavanaugh's voluminous record -- and the all-out contentious rhetoric surrounding it -- Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, has said Republicans hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by a floor vote by early October, when the next Supreme Court term begins.

The hurricane, which was downgraded to a Category 3 early Wednesday afterrnoon, remains strong as it continues its approach to the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph, the National Hurricane Center said in its 2 p.m. advisory. Florence was 435 miles southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and moving northwest at 16 mph.

It's expected to go back up to a Category 4 by Thursday morning.

Steve Goldstein, FEMA's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration liaison, said Wednesday morning that the agency expected the storm to hit late Thursday or early Friday morning.

HURRICANE FLORENCE'S PATH: TRACK THE STORM HERE

Jeff Byard, associate administrator for the Office of Response and Recovery at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), urged residents in the mandatory evacuation zones across the region to pack up and leave the area sooner rather than later.

“It’s a very dangerous storm – heed the warnings and evacuate if you are in one of those zones. Today is the day,” he said Wednesday morning. “This is going to be a Mike Tyson punch to the Carolina coast.”

According to Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean, Florence could stall upon reaching the Carolina coast and make a slight shift south once it makes landfall, becoming a “major flooding event.”

HURRICANE FLORENCE COULD BRING CATASTROPHIC STORM SURGES: WHAT ARE THEY, AND HOW CAN YOU PREPARE?

In addition to the hurricane-strength winds blowing ashore Friday, Florence has the potential to bring a storm surge upwards of 6 feet in parts of the coastline including up to 13 feet from Cape Fear north to Cape Lookout.

The hurricane could also produce heavy and excessive rainfall – up to 40 inches in isolated areas in the Carolinas and anywhere between 6 to 12 inches elsewhere in the Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic region.

It will also pass directly over two nuclear power plants -- the Brunswick Nuclear Plant, which is located 30 miles south of Wilmington, as well as the Shearon Harris Nuclear Plant in New Hill, about 23 miles from Raleigh.

Flooding well inland could wreck environmental havoc by washing over industrial waste sites and hog farms.

HURRICANE FLORENCE EMERGENCY CONTACTS TO NOTE AS 'EXTREMELY DANGEROUS' STORM HITS EAST COAST

On Wednesday morning, President Trump urged caution to residents refusing to evacuate coastal towns, saying Florence is “bigger than anticipated.”

“Hurricane Florence is looking bigger than anticipated,” Trump tweeted. “It will be arriving soon. FEMA, First Responders and Law Enforcement are supplied and ready. Be safe!”

He then released a video urging residents in affected areas to “get out of its way.

“Don’t play games with it – it’s a big one, may be as big as they’ve seen,” Trump added.

Earlier this week Trump declared states of emergency for North and South Carolina and Virginia, opening the way for federal aid. All three states ordered mass evacuations along the coast. But getting out of harm’s way has proved difficult.

Local resident Michelle Stober loaded up valuables on Tuesday at her home on Wrightsville Beach to drive back to her primary residence in Cary, N.C. Finding fuel for the journey was tough.

""This morning I drove around for an hour looking for gas in Cary. Everyone was sold out,"" she said.

People across the region rushed to buy bottled water and other supplies, board up their homes, pull their boats out of the water and get out of town.

Long lines formed at service stations, and some started running out of gas as far west as Raleigh, with bright yellow bags, signs or rags placed over the pumps to show they were out of order. Some store shelves were picked clean.

""There's no water. There's no juices. There's no canned goods,"" Kristin Harrington said as she shopped at a Walmart in Wilmington.

Trouble is, the purchase was approved in 2016, under the Obama administration.

The New York Times reported this week that $52,701 was spent last year on buying customized and mechanized curtains for the picture windows in Haley’s New York City residence, for which rent is $58,000 a month.

But the paper didn't mention until the sixth paragraph that Haley's spokesman said the Trump administration had no input in the purchase decision.

Some online critics apparently missed that detail.

""How can you, on the one hand, tell diplomats that basic needs cannot be met and, on the other hand, spend more than $50,000 on a customized curtain system for the ambassador to the U.N.?"" — Brett Bruen, a White House official in the Obama administration

“How can you, on the one hand, tell diplomats that basic needs cannot be met and, on the other hand, spend more than $50,000 on a customized curtain system for the ambassador to the U.N.?” Brett Bruen, a White House official in the Obama administration, told the Times.

“When @nikkihaley's not busy rejecting the idea of universal human rights, she's busy spending $52,701 of US tax payer money on curtains for her residence. Milk the people, screw the world. Fine priorities you got there,” Andrew Stroehlein, Human Rights Watch’s European Media Director, wrote in a tweet.

The curtains themselves reportedly cost nearly $30,000, but the hardware needed to operate them cost an additional $22,801. The curtains were installed last year.

Patrick Kennedy, the top management official at the State Department during the Obama administration, defended the spending, saying the curtains will be used by future officials and cited security and entertainment purposes.

“All she’s got is a part-time maid, and the ability to open and close the curtains quickly is important,” Kennedy told the newspaper.

The State Department, under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, had frozen hiring, reduced diplomatic staff and proposed cutting the department’s budget by 31 percent."

Andrew Cuomo soundly defeated insurgent progressive Cynthia Nixon in Thursday's gubernatorial primary, denying far-left liberals a victory they had long sought against the establishment Democrat.

And incumbent Kathy Hochul defeated Jumaane Williams, another so-called ""resistance"" candidate, in the race for lieutenant governor. Hochul, a former congresswoman from Buffalo, now moves on to the November general election as Cuomo's running mate.

Rounding out the day's key races, Cuomo-backed New York City Public Advocate Letitia James, 59, won a four-way Democratic primary for attorney general, triumphing over progressive law professor Zephyr Teachout.

Teachout had campaigned with Nixon against Cuomo, and pledged to make fighting state corruption a priority. She had said she'd use the ""law as a sword, not just a shield"" in cracking down on President Trump.

Teachout had run unsuccessfully against Cuomo for governor in 2014, claiming more than 30 percent of the vote in a surprisingly strong showing.

The losses were a one-two-three punch for so-called ""resistance"" Democrats seeking to defy polls -- and better-funded opponents -- to upend the New York party establishment.

Still, there was some good news on the night for supporters of democratic socialist U.S. House candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Julia Salazar, a democratic socialist whose campaign for a seat in the state Senate was overshadowed by a series of bizarre revelations about her past, unseated a 16-year incumbent in Thursday's Democratic primary.

And the evening could end up making history. James, who would become the first black woman to hold statewide elected office in New York if she prevails in the general election for attorney general, might soon see the president in court. New York has filed several lawsuits against Trump's policies and his charitable foundation.



The current attorney general, Barbara Underwood, was appointed in May when Eric Schneiderman resigned after he was accused of physically abusing women. Underwood declined to run for election.

The results, on the whole, were mostly expected, even if this primary season has shown that upsets are almost the new normal. Williams, the lieutenant general candidate, had reportedly faced significant financial troubles and was found guilty of obstructing an emergency vehicle after he blocked an ambulance at an immigrants' rights rally last month.

OPINION: CUOMO, AMERICA'S ALWAYS BEEN GREAT -- AND MY ANCESTORS WERE SLAVES!

Williams was impeding an ambulance carrying his friend, an immigrant rights activist who had been informed he would be detained, and then fainted. Williams also was booked for blocking traffic outside Trump Tower in the wake of the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

The state's gubernatorial race commanded most of the fanfare on the evening. Nixon, a former ""Sex and the City"" co-star, was widely predicted to lose the race, even as she insisted polls were underestimating her support. She had sought to mirror the success of Ocasio-Cortez and capitalize on a series of missteps by Cuomo, who was roundly mocked last month for saying America ""was never that great.""



DEEP DIVE: WHERE DO NEW YORK'S KEY CANDIDATES STAND ON THE ISSUES?



With nearly half of precincts reporting, though, Nixon was trailing Cuomo by more than 30 percentage points -- putting her more in line with the dismal performance of Bernie Sanders' son Levi in New Hampshire earlier this week.



Nixon had received the endorsement of the Working Families Party (WFP), an influential, progressive third party in New York. She was seeking to join the handful of insurgent liberal candidates who have sent shockwaves through the Democratic political establishment by unseating party favorites ahead of November's midterm elections.



The race had featured bitter attacks, with Nixon calling Cuomo a ""bully"" and Cuomo's campaign dismissing her as ""unhinged.""

Both Cuomo and Nixon sought to make the election about Trump. ""Together, we can show the entire country that in the era of Donald Trump, New Yorkers will come together and lead our nation forward,"" Nixon wrote Wednesday evening in a final message to supporters.

Cuomo, for his part, spent millions on ads to argue that he's the most qualified candidate to push back against the White House. He also touted liberal accomplishments such as gun control, free public college tuition and a higher minimum wage.

Cuomo is set to face Republican Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro, Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins and former Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner, an independent, in the November general election.

In an unusual move, Cuomo was a no-show at his own election night victory party and instead celebrated his win at the governor's mansion in Albany.

The further downgrading of what had been a powerful hurricane several days ago came in a 5 a.m. ET Sunday advisory from the National Hurricane Center.

With the update, the NHC also announced that a tropical storm warning stretching from South Santee River, S.C., to Surf City, N.C., had been discontinued, and that no coastal watches or warnings remained in effect.

On Saturday, officials in South Carolina confirmed the state’s first fatality from Florence, bringing the region-wide death toll from the storm to at least 11 -- though the News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., was reporting at least 14 deaths.

Police said a 62-year-old woman was killed late Friday when the vehicle she was driving struck a tree that had fallen across Highway 18 near the town of Union.

Capt. Kelly Hughes of the South Carolina Highway Patrol said the woman, who was wearing a seat belt, died at the scene and no passengers were in the vehicle at the time.

A mother and her 8-month old child were among the first confirmed dead after a massive tree crushed their brick home in Wilmington, North Carolina on Friday.

Another man, 81, died Friday while trying to evacuate Wayne County, North Carolina, and a husband and wife were killed in a house fire, according to the medical examiner’s office.

Lenoir County spokesman Bryan Hanks said a 78-year-old man was electrocuted in the rain while trying to connect extension cords for a generator and that another man, 77, died after he went outside to check on his hunting dogs and was blown down.

Duplin County Sheriff’s Office confirmed three more deaths due to ""flash flooding and swift water on roadways.""

Authorities in North Carolina have confirmed 10 deaths so far. Early Saturday, the state tally fluctuated when officials initially counted, then subtracted, two deaths now thought to have been the result of a murder-suicide during the storm. That case is under investigation.

Mandatory evacuations were issued for areas surrounding the banks of Cape Fear River in North Carolina.

The National Hurricane Center said on Saturday afternoon that ""catastrophic flooding"" is expected in certain parts of the Carolinas.

HURRICANE FLORENCE'S PATH: TRACK THE STORM HERE

Florence parked itself over the Carolinas on Saturday, bringing with it torrential downpours, dangerous winds and coastal flooding that required hundreds of water rescues and ended in multiple deaths.

""It's like being stalked by a turtle,"" FEMA associate director Jeffrey Byard said about the slow-moving storm. ""There's a lot of rain to come. There's a lot of rain that's fallen.""

Emergency workers have been going door to door in North Carolina, pleading with people who have chosen to ride out the storm to leave.

""I cannot overstate it: Floodwaters are rising, and if you aren’t watching for them, you are risking your life,"" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said Saturday.

More than 2 feet of rain over the course of 24 hours has fallen in some places in North Carolina, with forecasters calling for an additional 1½ feet by the end of the weekend. The fear is that flash flooding could devastate communities, endanger dams and block bridges. The storm also knocked out power to nearly a million people.

Aerial photos along the coast near New Bern showed homes floating in water and rescuers racing to reach the people who were trapped inside.

Cooper called Florence an ""uninvited brute"" that could wipe out entire communities as it grinds its way across land.

""The fact is, this storm is deadly and we know we are days away from an ending,"" he said.

NEW BERN RESCUES CONTINUE AMID FLORENCE FLOODWATERS IN NC

Since Thursday, more than 360 people have been carried to higher ground amid rising waters from a river swelled by both rain and salty storm surge.

New Bern, North Carolina, Mayor Dana Outlaw urged residents not to return just yet.

""We have a lot of downed power lines,"" he told Fox News. ""We're very concerned with these energized lines and folks could get hurt. So give the city time to get out and assess our infrastructure and get the roads safe for you to travel.""

Shaken after seeing waves crashing on the Neuse River just outside his house in New Bern, restaurant owner and hurricane veteran Tom Ballance wished he had evacuated.

""I feel like the dumbest human being who ever walked the face of the earth,"" he said.

Since its roared ashore, Florence has flattened trees, buckled buildings and crumpled roads. Storm surges -- the bulge of ocean water pushed ashore by the hurricane -- were as high as 10 feet.

COMPLETE COVERAGE OF HURRICANE FLORENCE

Florence peaked at a Category 4 with top winds of 140 mph over warm ocean water before making landfall as a Category 1. It blew ashore along a mostly boarded-up, emptied-out stretch of coastline.

By midmorning Saturday, Florence lazily inched its way about 40 miles west of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina at 2 mph – slower than most humans walk.

""It's like being stalked by a turtle,"" FEMA associate director Jeffrey Byard said about the slow-moving storm. ""There's a lot of rain to come. There's a lot of rain that's fallen.""

South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice described the storm to Fox News as a ""slow poison.""

Florence’s devastation has less to do with wind and more to do with water.

Morehead City, North Carolina, had received 23 inches of rain by Friday night, and forecasters warned Saturday morning that parts of the Carolinas could get up to 15 inches more.

WEATHER CHANNEL DEFENDS REPORTER CAPTURED SWAYING IN FLORENCE WINDS AS 2 PEOPLE WALK BEHIND HIM

At times, Florence was moving forward no faster than a human can walk, and it has remained such a wide storm that its counter-clockwise winds keep scooping up massive amounts of moisture from the sea. The flooding began on barrier islands in North Carolina and then spread into coastal and river communities there and in South Carolina, swamping the white sands and golf courses in North Myrtle Beach.

For people living inland in the Carolinas, maximum peril could come days later as all that water drains, overflowing rivers and causing flash floods.

Authorities warned, too, of risks of mudslides and environmental disasters from floodwaters washing over industrial waste sites and hog farms.

About 9,700 National Guard troops and civilians were deployed with high-water vehicles, helicopters and boats.

Florence could become a major test for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was heavily criticized as slow and unprepared last year for Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, where the death toll was put at nearly 3,000.

The hurricane center said the storm will eventually break up over the southern Appalachians and make a right hook to the northeast, its rainy remnants moving into the Mid-Atlantic states and New England by the middle of next week.

Meteorologist Ryan Maue, of weathermodels.com, calculated that Florence could dump a staggering 18 trillion gallons of rain over a week on North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Maryland. That's enough to fill the Chesapeake Bay or cover the entire state of Texas with nearly 4 inches of water.

North Carolina alone is forecast to get 9.6 trillion gallons, enough to cover the Tar Heel state to a depth of about 10 inches.

In Jacksonville, North Carolina, next to Camp Lejeune, firefighters and police fought wind and rain as they went door to door to pull more than 60 people out as the Triangle Motor Inn began to crumble.

In New Bern, population 29,000, flooding on the Neuse River left 500 people in peril.

Ashley Warren and boyfriend Chris Smith managed to paddle away from their home in a boat with their two dogs and were left shaken.

""Honestly, I grew up in Wilmington. I love hurricanes. But this one has been an experience for me,"" she said. ""We might leave.""

445,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/09/14/paul-manafort-to-plead-guilty-as-part-plea-deal-with-special-counsel.html,2,"Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort pleaded guilty in federal court Friday as part of a plea agreement that involves cooperation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller and allows him to avoid a second trial.

“I plead guilty,"" Manafort, 69, told U.S. District Judge Amy Berman in Washington.

Prosecutor Andrew Weissmann told the judge that Manafort's deal includes a cooperation agreement with prosecutors, who are investigating whether any Trump associates played a role in Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. That could include interviews with prosecutors and testifying in court.

A defense attorney for Manafort told Fox News the deal includes ""full cooperation.""

But the president's team downplayed the significance of Manafort's plea.

“Once again an investigation has concluded with a plea having nothing to do with President Trump or the Trump campaign,"" Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in a statement to Fox News. ""The reason: the president did nothing wrong.""

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Friday that Manafort's decision is ""totally unrelated"" to the president.

Manafort, in a trial set to begin Sept. 24, had been facing seven counts of foreign lobbying violations and witness tampering in federal court in Washington.

In August, in a separate trial in Virginia, a federal jury found Manafort guilty on eight counts of federal tax and banking crimes.

Manafort faces up to 10 years on these charges in Washington. He still faces sentencing for his guilty verdict in Virginia.

As part of this agreement, Manafort has forfeited multiple bank accounts and several properties in New York. However, he will keep his properties in Florida and Virginia, where his family live.

Manafort attorney Kevin Downing told reporters after the court hearing it was a “tough day” for his client, “who has accepted responsibility.” He said Manafort “wanted to make sure that his family was able to remain safe and live a good life.”

The case was brought by Mueller's team, which is probing potential crimes related to the 2016 election. But Manafort has not been charged with anything related to the campaign.

In August, Manafort’s bank and tax fraud conviction made him the first campaign associate of Trump found guilty by a jury as part of Mueller’s probe.

“I feel very badly for Paul Manafort,” Trump told reporters after the August verdict, adding that it had ""nothing to do with Russian collusion."" The president has called Mueller's probe a ""witch hunt.""



Trump also said he had “such respect” for Manafort and called him a “brave man.” In comments interpreted to mean he was open to pardoning Manafort, Trump commended Manafort, saying he “refused to break” and “make up stories in order to get a deal.”

In the Virginia trial, prosecutors said Manafort hid income earned from political work overseas from the IRS while fraudulently obtaining millions in bank loans. Manafort had pleaded not guilty to all counts.

The prosecution’s star witness, Rick Gates – Manafort’s former business partner who struck a plea deal to cooperate with the government -- testified during the trial that he and Manafort committed bank and tax fraud together.

Downing, Manafort's attorney, suggested after the guilty verdict in August that Manafort was open to striking a deal before the second trial.

“He is evaluating all of his options at this point,” Downing said of Manafort.

446,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/09/22/tentative-agreement-reached-for-kavanaugh-ford-hearing-on-thursday-source-says.html,2,"A tentative agreement for a Thursday hearing with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford has been reached, a source with knowledge of the discussions has told Fox News.

Earlier on Saturday, Ford had indicated she'd accept the Senate Judiciary Committee’s request to discuss an alleged sexual assault by Kavanaugh, although the terms under which she might testify remained largely unclear.

In a letter to the committee, Ford’s lawyers said that she had accepted the request to provide “her first-hand knowledge of Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual misconduct next week” after Republicans on the committee set a 2:30 p.m. deadline for her to say whether she would do so. Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, had said a vote would proceed in the absence of a response from Ford's team by the cutoff time.

In the letter from Ford's lawyers, they said “many aspects of the proposal you provided ... are fundamentally inconsistent with the Committee’s promise of a fair, impartial investigation into her allegations,” yet they also expressed hope that an agreement would be reached, as now appears to be the case.

Ahead of news about a tentative Thursday meeting, a senior White House official had told Fox News that the Ford team's letter represented a request to continue negotiations without any firm commitment.

White House spokesperson Kerri Kupec later issued a separate statement, noting that Kavanaugh has denied the allegation ""and is eager to testify publicly to defend his integrity and clear his good name.""

Ford alleges that Kavanaugh assaulted her during a house party in high school in the 1980s. Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the allegation. Democrats have called for the vote on his confirmation to the nation’s highest court to be delayed, pending a full FBI investigation, something that Republicans have dismissed as unnecessary.

DEMOCRATS FLOAT MORE KAVANAUGH INVESTIGATIONS, IMPEACHMENT EVEN IF HE IS CONFIRMED

Republicans have accused Democrats of sitting on the doctor's allegation during the hearings and looking to delay the vote until after the midterms in November.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement that he will support Ford's ""steadfast bravery against the arbitrary, unfair, irrational constraints set by Chairman Grassley.""

""I remain deeply disturbed by the conduct of my colleagues over the last week, and am committed to ensuring that Dr. Ford’s safety and security is made a top priority,” he said.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said Ford had demonstrated ""impressive courage"" in her willingness to come forward ""in spite of Republicans’ astounding disregard for basic due process in failing to order the completion of a background investigation.""

“Even in accommodating Dr. Blasey Ford’s request for a few additional days, Chairman Grassley has rejected many of her reasonable requests to ensure a fair process,"" his statement said. ""Next week’s hearing, as currently contemplated, will be a kangaroo court, because the Republicans have done everything in their power to prevent the consideration of any outside evidence, whether corroborating or exculpatory. Republicans should respect Dr. Blasey Ford’s wishes, as they should respect the wishes of all victims of sexual assault.""

447,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/09/27/christine-ford-testifies-brett-kavanaugh-sexually-assaulted-me.html,2,"A visibly angry and emotional Brett Kavanaugh denied under oath that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford, telling senators Thursday his name has been ""totally and permanently destroyed"" by these ""false"" allegations – after his accuser testified she's ""one-hundred percent"" sure he tried to force himself on her 36 years ago.

The drastically conflicting statements, delivered to the Senate Judiciary Committee in dramatic testimony that carried echoes of the 1991 Anita Hill hearings, left senators to make a judgment call on whose story is accurate. Kavanaugh's confirmation process was thrown into chaos by the 11th-hour charges, and it remains unclear whether the hearing will sway enough senators to secure confirmation.

Kavanaugh let loose in his hearing appearance, abandoning much of his prepared remarks to blast the process as a ""disgrace"" and a ""circus,"" and later sparring with Democratic senators. The hearing ended Thursday evening after eight hours worth of testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh.

""This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,"" Kavanaugh told the committee. ""The Constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process. But you have replaced advise and consent with search and destroy.""

Earlier in the same hearing room, Ford appeared in public for the first time to testify on her allegations and told lawmakers in no uncertain terms that the Supreme Court nominee ""sexually assaulted me."" She insisted she was not mistaking him for another person.

""Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life,"" Ford told the committee.

But Kavanaugh described the allegations, from Ford and others, as part of a calculated political hit deployed by Democrats when he was getting too close to confirmation.

""I am innocent of this charge,"" he said repeatedly. Kavanaugh told senators he has ""categorically and unequivocally"" denied the allegations since they first aired.

He described the toll taken by those charges, especially others that emerged in recent days: ""My family and my name have been totally and permanently destroyed by vicious and false additional accusations.""

As the hearing continued into the late afternoon, the proceedings got more heated. In one tense exchange, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., repeatedly asked Kavanaugh to support a FBI investigation. ""If there is no truth to the charges, the FBI investigation will show that,"" Durbin said. ""Are you afraid that they might not?""

After Durbin's comments, a fired-up Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., lashed out at the Democrats. ""This is the most unethical sham since I have been in politics,"" Graham said, raising his voice at the Democrats. ""And if you really wanted to know the truth, you sure as hell wouldn't have done what you have done to this guy.""

At another point, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told Kavanaugh, ""Judge, I can't think of a more embarrassing scandal for the United States Senate since the McCarthy hearings.""

When Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse repeatedly pressed Kavanaugh about alcohol, the nominee shot back: ""I like beer. I don't know if you like beer, senator, or not? What do you like to drink?""

Similarly, when Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar asked Kavanaugh if he’d ever blacked out while drinking, Kavanaugh said no, and then said, ""I'm curious if you have?""

""I have no drinking problem, judge,"" Klobuchar said.

""Nor do I,"" Kavanaugh said.

Later in the hearing, after a brief break, Kavanaugh expressed regret over his question.

""I’m sorry I did that,"" he told Klobuchar. ""This is a tough process.""

The judged choked up repeatedly throughout his opening statement, including recounting how his 10-year-old daughter said of Ford, ""We should pray for the woman.""

At another point, Kavanaugh said, ""I am never going to get my reputation back. My life is totally and permanently altered."" Cornyn replied, ""Judge, don't give up.""

Kavanaugh insisted the allegations aren't true, and said, ""I’ve never sexually assaulted anyone."" He added, ""I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process.""

Kavanaugh rebutted a number of claims from Ford, who said he attempted to rape her at a party in 1982: Kavanaugh said he didn’t run in the same crowd as Ford; he referenced that the others listed as being at the party said later they didn't remember it; he pointed out how Ford didn’t remember where the party was or how she got there; and he said his personal calendars from the time didn’t indicate he attended a party like the one described.

""I'm not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time,"" he said. ""But I have never done this to her or to anyone. That's not who I am, it is not who I was. I am innocent of this charge.""

Ford, however, was equally adamant in standing by her account. She, too, choked up at times but voiced confidence, under sustained questioning, that the judge attacked her.

""So what you are telling us is that this could not be a case of mistaken identity?"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asked.

""Absolutely not,"" Ford replied. She added she's ""100 percent"" certain it was Kavanaugh who attacked her.

As her testimony was winding down, Ford was pressed by questioner Rachel Mitchell about how the four people named by Ford as being at the party have said they have no memory of the event. She dismissed the significance of that, saying ""nothing remarkable happened"" to two of them that evening; the other two are the ones being accused.

And in a striking moment, Ford said the one female there, her friend Leland Ingham, has ""significant health challenges"" and is getting treatment. Ford said Ingham texted her an apology following her statement claiming no recollection of the party, while saying she wouldn't expect her to remember the incident since she was downstairs.

The partisan divide over the allegations was on full display, with Democrats assuring Ford they support her. ""I want to thank you for your courage and I want to tell you I believe you,"" California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris told Ford during the hearing.

Republicans still expressed skepticism about the allegations but did not criticize Ford herself. Cornyn said after her testimony he found no reason ""to find her not credible"" but said ""there are obviously gaps in her story."" Graham said he wasn't convinced: ""I did not find her allegations to be corroborated against Mr. Kavanaugh.""

In her opening remarks, Ford choked up as she described growing up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., and hanging out with boys from different schools in the area, including Kavanaugh, ""the boy who sexually assaulted me.""

Ford then described a drunk Kavanaugh attacking her in the 1980s at a high school party. She told senators she ""thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me."" Ford said she was able to run away.

On Thursday, Ford said she was ""terrified"" to detail her accusations but felt it was her ""civic duty.""

She continued, ""I believed he was going to rape me.""

Ford said Kavanaugh caught her in a room, while a friend, Mark Judge, was present. Ford said the strongest memory she had of the event was the ""uproarious laughter between the two, and they're having fun at my expense.""

Thursday’s hearing followed days of negotiations between Senate Republicans and Ford’s attorneys – and amid more lurid last-minute allegations from other women who have accused Kavanaugh of improper sexual behavior in high school and college.

The stakes for Kavanaugh could not be higher: Key swing-vote senators have said Thursday's hearing would present a pivotal opportunity to assess Ford's credibility and determine whether to advance Kavanaugh to the nation's highest court.

Republicans retained Mitchell, an experienced sex-crimes prosecutor, to handle some of their questioning, hoping it would help avoid an overtly political atmosphere. Republicans, through Mitchell, questioned Ford on apparent discrepancies or holes in the story.

In one curious exchange, Ford acknowledged she didn’t personally pay for the polygraph examination she took in August, and said she doesn’t know who did. Later in the hearing, her attorney Debra Katz said Ford’s ""lawyers have paid for her polygraph.""

Another Ford attorney, Michael Bromwich, said during the hearing that Ford's attorneys have been working pro bono.

READ THE TESTIMONY: FORD'S PREPARED COMMENTS

Pressed by Mitchell, Ford said she couldn’t be more specific about the date of the incident, other than it was likely in 1982.

""I can't give the exact date,"" she said.

Under questioning from Mitchell, Ford said the area of the party was probably about a 20-minute drive from her parents’ home. She said someone probably drove her there, but she could not remember who it was.

""Has anyone come forward to say to you, 'hey, remember, I was one who drove you home?"" Mitchell asked.

""No,"" Ford replied.

Mitchell pressed Ford over her reported comments that she was reluctant to give an interview to the committee because of her fear of flying. Asked how she traveled from California to Washington for Thursday's hearing, Ford acknowledged she flew.

""I eventually was able to get up the gumption with the help of some friends and get on the plane,"" she said. Ford acknowledged she regularly flies – including once a year during the summer to visit family on the East Coast.

The hearing, which for days had been in doubt, was the first chance for the public to see Ford, in person, explain in detail what she claimed happened at the Maryland house party in 1982 where Kavanaugh allegedly jumped on top of her and tried to muffle her screams -- and why she didn't tell anyone about the episode until 2012.

""He began running his hands over my body and grinding into me,"" Ford testified on Thursday, describing that day. ""I tried to get away from him, but his weight was heavy. Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes.""

She said she eventually got away, locking herself in a bathroom as the two eventually went downstairs.

In her opening statement, Ford said she remembered ""four boys"" being at the party, including one ""whose name I cannot recall."" The people she did name -- Kavanaugh and his classmates Mark Judge and P.J. Smyth -- have denied under penalty of felony knowing anything about the alleged episode.

KAVANAUGH CLASHES WITH DEMOCRATIC SENATOR OVER YEARBOOK ENTRIES

Ford also named a girl, ""my friend Leland Ingham,"" as also being in attendance. Ingham, in a previously released statement, has denied knowing Kavanaugh or having information about the alleged assault.

Ford told senators she finally decided to disclose the alleged assault during a therapy session in 2012 because during a remodeling of her house that year, she insisted on installing a ""second front door"" -- leaving her husband and others wondering why.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley kicked off Thursday’s highly anticipated hearing before the panel by noting past FBI background checks of Kavanaugh turned up no evidence of any wrongdoing.

""Nowhere in any of these six FBI reports, which committee investigators have reviewed on a bipartisan basis, was there a whiff of any issue,"" Grassley said.

Feinstein, the committee's top Democrat, defended her decision not to turn over the accusations earlier to the FBI and other lawmakers. She said Ford wanted it to ""be held confidential.""

Though she learned of the allegations in July, Feinstein didn't disclose them to her Senate colleagues or federal authorities until days before a crucial Judiciary Committee vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation earlier this month.

Ford said Thursday she decided to go public with her allegations after reporters began staking out her home and work.

The proceedings were jolted by late-breaking developments: In a statement released Wednesday evening, Judiciary Committee Republicans revealed that on Monday, they conducted interviews with two separate men who claimed they, and not Kavanaugh, had the encounter with Dr. Ford in 1982.

In response, an aide to Democrats on the Judiciary Committee reportedly unloaded on Senate Republicans, accusing them of ""desperately trying to muddy the waters.""

Several other allegations have emerged over the last week -- and Kavanaugh has denied them all. Republicans repeatedly have pointed out that none of the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh has first-hand corroboration.

LINDSEY GRAHAM TEARS INTO DEMS OVER 'SHAM' KAVANAUGH HEARING

In The New Yorker on Sunday, former Kavanaugh classmate Deborah Ramirez claimed that Kavanaugh had exposed his penis to her at a party decades ago.

Another woman, Julie Swetnick, emerged Wednesday to accuse Kavanaugh of participating in ""gang rapes"" and rape ""trains"" in the 1980s. Swetnick has been represented by anti-Trump lawyer Michael Avenatti.

""The Swetnick thing is a joke,"" Kavanaugh said Thursday, raising his voice. ""It's a farce.""

On Tuesday, a constituent told the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., that in 1985, two ""heavily inebriated men"" referred to as ""Brett and Mark"" had sexually assaulted a ""close friend"" on a boat. But that person recanted the claim Wednesday night on Twitter.

In another case, Kavanaugh was asked by GOP investigators this week about a new claim in a letter received by Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., from an anonymous individual apparently in Denver, alleging that Kavanaugh ""shoved"" someone up against a wall ""very aggressively and sexually"" during an outing in front of four witnesses in 1998.

Speaking to Judiciary Committee investigators, Kavanaugh maintained his innocence and lamented the ""total feeding frenzy"" of last-minute accusations.

""We're dealing with an anonymous letter about an anonymous person and an anonymous friend,"" Kavanaugh told committee investigators earlier this week about the alleged episode. ""It's ridiculous. Total Twilight Zone. And no, I've never done anything like that.""

In his sometimes tearful delivery, Kavanaugh, with his wife, Ashley, family and friends behind him, immediately denied Ford’s allegation that 36-years ago he pinned her down and attempted to remove her clothing.

“I will not be intimidated by withdrawing from this process. Your coordinated and well-funded effort to destroy my good name and destroy my family will not drive me out,” Kavanaugh said. “You may defeat me in the final vote, but you’ll never get me to quit. Ever.”

He also detailed the “10 long days” between when Ford first publicly made the accusation and Thursday’s hearing.

“In those 10 long days, as was predictable and I predicted, my family and my name have been totally and permanently destroyed,” Kavanaugh said. “The 10-day delay has been harmful to me and my family, to the Supreme Court, and to the country.”

Kavanaugh said he welcomed “any kind of investigation.”

“Senate, FBI, or otherwise. The committee has now conducted a thorough investigation,” Kavanaugh said. “I know any kind of investigation—Senate, FBI, Montgomery County Police—will clear me.”

He added: “Listen to the people I’ve grown up with and played with and coached with and dated and had beers with and listen to the witnesses who allegedly were at this event.”

“This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,” Kavanaugh said, detailing the derogatory words used to describe him in recent days, such as “evil” and someone who would “threaten the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come.”

“I understand the passions of the moment, but I would say to senators, your words have meaning. Millions of Americans listened carefully to you. Given comments like those, it isn’t any surprise that people are willing to do anything to make any physical threat against my family, or send any violent email to my wife.”

In a passionate and tearful delivery, Kavanaugh said: “This has destroyed my family and my good name. A good name built up through decades of very hard work.”

“This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit,” Kavanaugh said. “This grotesque and coordinated character assassination will dissuade good people from serving our country.”

Kavanaugh denied Ford’s allegations, repeatedly, throughout his statement.

“I’m here to tell the truth. I’ve never sexually assaulted anyone. Not in high school. Not in college. Not ever. Sexual assault is horrific,” Kavanaugh said. “Allegations of sexual assault must always be taken seriously, those who make allegations must always be heard. At the same time, the person who is the subject of those allegations must also be heard. Due process means listening to both sides.”

Kavanaugh also defended his record, as being in “high-profile” public service roles for more than 20 years.

“No one ever accused me of any kind of sexual misconduct. No one. Ever. A lifetime of high profile of public service at the highest levels of American government,” Kavanaugh said. “Never a hint of anything of this kind and that’s because nothing of this kind ever happened.”

Kavanaugh detailed his, and his father’s, practice of keeping detailed calendars that serve as both calendars and “diaries.”

Kavanaugh also said he did not doubt that Ford experienced some sort of sexual assault, but maintained that it was not him.

“I am not questioning that Dr. Ford was sexually assaulted. But I have never done this to her or to anyone. It’s not who I am. It is not who I was,” Kavanaugh said. “I am innocent of this charge. I intend no ill will to Dr. Ford or her family.”

Kavanaugh, in tears, said that his daughters even were praying “for the woman.” Kavanaugh praised his wife, Ashley, whom he said “has been a rock.”

“I thank God every day for Ashley and my family. We live in a country devoted to due process and the rule of law. That means taking allegations seriously. But if the mere allegation, mere assertion of an allegation, a refuted allegation from 36 years ago is enough to destroy a person’s life and career, we have abandoned the due process that defines our legal system in our country,” Kavanaugh said.

“I ask you to judge me by the standard you would want applied to your father, your husband, your brother or your son,” Kavanaugh said. “My family and I intend no ill will toward Dr. Ford or her family, but I swear today, under oath, before the Senate and the nation, before my family, and God, I am innocent of this charge.”"

In a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Friday, Mark Judge, denied the latest round of accusations brought against him and Kavanaugh by Julie Swetnick—the client of Stormy Daniels’ attorney Michael Avenatti.

Swetnick accused Kavanaugh and Judge of making unwanted sexual advances at women while at parties in high school in the early 1980s, drugging the “punch” at parties, and participating in “gang rapes” and “train rapes.” Swetnick claims she is a victim of gang rape, and said that both Judge and Kavanaugh were there to watch the incident.

“In response to the Committee’s request for information, I, MARK JUDGE, declare: The allegations in the Swetnick affidavit are so bizarre that, even while suffering from my addiction, I would remember actions so outlandish. I categorically deny them,” Judge, a recovering alcoholic, said in the letter.

“I do not know Julie Swetnick,” he continued. “I do not recall attending parties during 1981-1983 when I fondled or grabbed women in an aggressive or unwanted manner.”

Judge went on to say that he has “never spiked punch to get anyone drunk or disoriented.”

“Nor have I witnessed Brett Kavanaugh spike punch,” Judge wrote. “I have never engaged in any gang rape of any woman, including Ms. Swetnick.”

Judge said he would “cooperate with any law enforcement agency that is assigned to confidentially investigate these allegations,” and signed the statement “under penalty of felony.”

Another Kavanaugh accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, testified on Capitol Hill before the committee Thursday, and claimed that Kavanaugh, while at a high school party 36 years ago, pinned her down and tried to remove her clothing. Ford claimed that Judge was in the room, and jumped on top of them on the bed.

Judge, as recently as Thursday, denied Ford’s allegations, while sharing personal information to support his desire to remain out of the public eye.

“We have told the Committee that I do not want to comment about these events publicly. As a recovering alcoholic and a cancer survivor, I have struggled with depression and anxiety,” Judge wrote in a letter to the committee Thursday. “As a result, I avoid public speaking.”

He added: “I do not recall the events described by Dr. Ford in her testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee today. I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes.”

Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations leveled against him by Ford and Swetnick on Thursday before the committee. Another woman, Deborah Ramirez, claimed that while they were freshmen at Yale University, Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a dorm party. Kavanaugh has also denied this allegation.

The Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday, following a vote in the affirmative to recommend Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate for a vote, has requested a delay in order for a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations.

“The Senate Judiciary Committee will request that the administration instruct the FBI to conduct a supplemental background investigation with respect to the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court,” the committee statement read. “The supplemental FBI background investigation would be limited to current credible allegations against the nominee and must be completed no later than one week from today.”

If the committee request is fulfilled, the FBI supplemental probe will be complete next Friday, Oct. 5

Friday afternoon, President Trump said that he would “rely” on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

An attorney for Deborah Ramirez, who claims that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a Yale college party in the 1980s, said that the FBI had reached out to her.

""We can confirm the FBI has reached out to interview Ms. Ramirez and she has agreed to cooperate with their investigation,"" attorney John Clune said in a statement. ""Out of respect for the integrity of the process, we will have no further comment at this time.""

The development was first reported by The Washington Post.

Before heading to West Virginia on Saturday for a political rally, President Trump expressed confidence in Kavanaugh.

""I would expect it's going to turn out very well for the judge,"" he said. ""There's never been anybody that's been looked at like Judge Kavanaugh.""

Trump said he had no backup plan concerning his nomination, and didn't need one.

The president also voiced confidence in the investigative process. ""The FBI I believe is doing a really great job,"" he said. They have been all over already. They have free rein. They're going to do whatever they have to do, whatever it is they do. They'll be doing things that we've never even thought of, and hopefully at the conclusion everything will be fine.""

In the added inquiry, which he expects to take less than a week, Trump said there might be ""a blessing in disguise,"" exposing Democrats' machinations over the past several days.

The FBI background check comes after Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., joined Democrats on Friday in calling for the investigation into sexual assault allegations made against Kavanaugh.

Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied all accusations against him.

FLAKE DEFENDS CALL FOR KAVANAUGH DELAY: 'WE'RE COMING APART AT THE SEAMS'

On Thursday Kavanaugh testified to a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing after Christine Blasey Ford testified that he had assaulted her at a high school party in 1982. In a blistering response, he called the circumstances surrounding his nomination a ""circus.""

On Friday, the committee voted to recommend Kavanaugh to the Senate for confirmation to the high court post, but Flake requested the “limited” weeklong background check. With Republicans holding a very slim majority in the Senate, Trump ordered the investigation despite GOP leaders having previously argued there was no need for further investigation.

The inquiry is expected to wrap by Friday.

In a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Saturday, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, requested that the bureau notify the White House Counsel's Office immediately if any witnesses attempt to in any way delay the investigation or decline to cooperate.

One key reason for his concern, wrote Hatch, a member and former chairman of the Senate Judicary Committee, ""comes from testimony during the hearing this past Thursday. According to Dr. Ford, she would have preferred to have been interviewed in California, away from the spectacle of a public hearing. But her lawyers apparently refused to convey to their client numerous offers by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to conduct a public or private interview in a location of her choosing. The lawyers’ refusal led directly to a public hearing, against Dr. Ford’s express wishes. This is deeply troubling.""



Republicans have accused Democrats of trying to delay the vote until after the midterms, when Democrats are hoping to have retaken control of the Senate. Democrats, in turn, have assailed what they say has been a rush toward confirmation regardless of the allegations against the judge.

On Friday Flake defended his decision to press for the further inquiry, saying he wanted to protect the credibility of America’s institutions.

“Two institutions, really,” he told the Atlantic. “One, the Supreme Court is the lone institution where most Americans still have some faith. And then the U.S. Senate as an institution — we’re coming apart at the seams. There’s no currency, no market for reaching across the aisle. It just makes it so difficult.”

However, he also said that the delay could eventually help both Republicans, and Kavanaugh himself.

“Obviously. I’ve felt that this delay is as much to help him as us. My hope is that some Democrats will say, “Hey, we may not change our vote, but this process was worthy of the institution, and we feel satisfied.”

""That means something,” he said. “The country needs to hear that.”

A third woman has also leveled charges against Kavanaugh. As was the case with Ford and Ramirez, she said the events occurred decades ago.

In a sworn declaration, Julie Swetnick of Washington, D.C., said she witnessed him ""consistently engage in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women in the early 1980s"" and that Kavanaugh was involved in ""gang"" rapes of girls at parties.

As with the other cases, the judge has maintained his innocence.

451,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kavanaugh-accuser-swetnick-faces-credibility-questions-amid-changing-story-details-from-past,2,"Julie Swetnick, who has made uncorroborated and lurid sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, is facing credibility questions as she appears to partially walk back some of her more salacious claims about the embattled nominee and details about her past emerge.

Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy even suggested the FBI scrutinize her in response, tweeting:

""A criminal referral should be sent to the FBI/DOJ regarding the apparently false affidavit signed by Julie Swetnick that was submitted to the Senate by @MichaelAvenatti.""

Swetnick, in a sworn statement last month, claimed she had seen Kavanaugh “engage in abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls” including “grinding” against girls and attempting to remove their clothes in the early '80s. She also claimed she “became aware of efforts by [friend] Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to ‘spike’ the ‘punch’ at house parties” with drugs or alcohols to lower girls’ defenses and get them disoriented so they could be “gang raped” in a side room by a “train” of boys.

“I have a firm recollection of seeing boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their 'turn' with a girl inside the room,” she said. “These boys included Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh.” She said she later became a victim of one of these gang rapes, at which she said Kavanaugh and Judge were present. The allegations represented the third sexual assault claim against Kavanaugh, but by far the most lurid and serious.

Yet in an interview with NBC News, she appeared to walk back some of the claims about Kavanaugh, while standing by her claims of sexually aggressive behavior. While she said in her statement she became aware of “efforts” by Kavanaugh to spike the punch, she said in the interview she was unclear about what Kavanaugh was actually doing.

“Well I saw—I saw him giving red solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame, and there was grain punch at those parties,"" she said. ""I saw him around the punch—I won’t say bowls, the punch containers. I don’t know what he did, but I saw him by them.”

As for the claim about “trains” of boys lining up outside rooms to rape girls, she said in the interview she saw boys including Kavanaugh and Judge ""huddled by doors."" Asked if she was suggesting she thought Kavanaugh was involved, she answered: ""I would say yes, it's just too coincidental."" She did not offer further details to support the claim he was waiting his ""turn.""

She also clarified that while she saw Kavanaugh and Judge at the party and where other boys were gathered, she “cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me” -- her original statement did not specifically accuse them of assaulting her, either.

Meanwhile, she said she told her mother and the Montgomery County Police the next day. Police officials told NBC News it could take up to a month to recover documents related to any report she may have made. Further, NBC reported that both her mother and the officer she said she spoke with have died.

Swetnick has struggled to provide corroborating witnesses, though her statement said she was aware of other witnesses who could ""attest to the truthfulness"" of her account. Swetnick provided four names to NBC News to back up her story: One is dead, two did not respond to NBC requests and one other said he didn’t remember Swetnick and didn’t think he had socialized with her.

Swetnick’s shifting, uncorroborated claims also led NBC News to issue a statement ahead of the interview.

""NBC News, for the record, has not been able to independently verify her claims. There are things she told us on camera that differ from her written statements last week,"" host Kate Snow told viewers.

Kavanaugh has called Swetnick's accusations a ""joke,"" while Judge has said he ""categorically"" denies her claims.

Lawyer Michael Avenatti, who is representing her, responded to some of the controversy by saying that Swetnick is willing to take a polygraph test and told CNN he had done “significant due diligence” before going ahead with them. Avenatti, who has also represented adult film star Stormy Daniels in her legal fight against President Trump and has floated the possibility of a 2020 Democratic presidential run, has fueled Republican claims that the impetus behind the sexual assault claims is politically motivated.

RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel questioned her claims, as well as Avenatti's involvement.

Sen. Orrin Hatch, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, mocked Democrats for entertaining Swetnick’s claims as “credible allegations.”

But other questions about Swetnick’s account were fueled by those who know her.

Swetnick’s ex-boyfriend, Richard Vinneccy, told Fox News' “The Ingraham Angle” Monday that she had threatened to kill his unborn child. He also said that although they dated on-and-off for seven years, she never mentioned her Kavanaugh claims to him, and was known for wanting to be the center of attention.

“She was exaggerating everything. Everything that came out of her mouth was just exaggerations,"" he said.

EX-BOYFRIEND SAYS KAVANAUGH ACCUSER JULIE SWETNICK THREATENED TO KILL HIS UNBORN CHILD, 'WAS EXAGGERATING EVERYTHING'

Meanwhile, it was revealed this week that Swetnick was sued in 2000 by her former employer, Portland-based Webtrends, for allegedly falsifying her educational background and concocting false sexual harassment allegations. The suit, which Avenatti has called ""bogus,"" was voluntarily dismissed by Webtrends shortly afterwards.

The Associated Press reported on Sunday that Swetnick has been involved in at least six legal cases in the last 25 years. Avenatti told The Associated Press that court cases involving her have no bearing on the credibility of her claims about Kavanaugh.

The FBI is currently conducting a background investigation into sexual assault claims made against Kavanaugh. The agency is expected to wrap up its investigation by Friday.

452,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-restricts-same-sex-visas-for-diplomat-partners-sets-january-deadline-to-get-married-or-get-out,2,"The State Department has started enforcing a new directive from the Trump administration that restricts visas for the same-sex partners of diplomats and other staff of U.S.-based international organizations like the United Nations.

The new policy reverses a 2009 procedure put in place by then-Secretary of Sate Hillary Clinton that allowed same-sex partners to obtain a G-4 or spousal visa. The new policy only allows entry into the United States if the partners are legally married.

""Effective immediately, U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses,"" the State Department said on its website.

Diplomats with same-sex partners will have until the end of the year to get married or their partners will be sent home at the beginning of 2019.

The change poses a problem for some same-sex couples who are not legally allowed to marry in their home country. Gay marriage is only legal in about 10 percent of the countries in the United Nations.

""The change in policy reflects the Department's goal to help ensure and promote equal treatment, consistent with the Department's policies regarding opposite-sex couples and derivative eligibility for visas in other visa categories,"" a State spokesperson in a statement.

Alfonso Nam, president of UN-GLOBE, a group that advocates on behalf of the U.N.'s LGBTI employees, told The Washington Blade that the new rule would ""have a chilling effect on all couples in the United States under a U.N.-sponsored visa who are in legal unions other than marriage.""

Nam, during a telephone interview with Fox News, said the new rule puts people slated to start assignments in New York at a greater risk in their home countries.

""It's not an option to get married,"" he said, adding that in some countries coming out not only puts the person in danger but also their families.

David Pressman, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Security Council in the Obama administration, slammed the rule reversal because the U.N. is ""composed of probably one of the most diverse workforces of any organization in the world.""

""If that's how you advance equality between same-sex and opposite sex partners, then we have an enormous problem on our hands,"" he told NBC News. He went on to describe the policy as a ""creative and cynical way to use the expansion of equality at home to vindictively target same-sex couples abroad.""

Calls to the State Department and United Nations were not immediately returned."
453,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/a-kavanaugh-confirmation-would-likely-pave-way-for-a-more-conservative-supreme-court,2,"The imminent confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will likely mean the dawn of a conservative high court for decades to come.

The U.S. Senate is set to hold a final vote Saturday to confirm Kavanaugh as the next Supreme Court justice. While most Republicans and Democrats differ in their views on whether President Trump's pick should be confirmed, there’s a general bipartisan agreement that the nominee will swing the Supreme Court toward the right.

COLLINS, MANCHIN SAY 'AYE,' APPEARING TO CEMENT KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION

Kavanaugh will replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy who, while being a Republican, acted as a swing vote and a gatekeeper of a more moderate high court and often sided with his liberal-leaning colleagues.

The presumptive justice’s judicial record on a federal appeals court indicates he’s likely to align with the four other conservative justices, raising questions about what that will mean on issues such as federal regulatory power, guns, abortion, religious freedom and immigration.

In a 2015 dissent Kavanaugh argued that ObamaCare’s mandate for contraception coverage violated the rights of religious organizations. Last year, he also dissented from a decision that allowed an illegal teenage immigrant to have an abortion, according to a summary of his rulings by Politico.

Kavanaugh opposed granting special visas for foreign workers from Brazil when American workers could do the same jobs. He also argued that a union election was invalid because illegal immigrants participated, and therefore “tainted” the result.

On federal regulatory power, Kavanaugh indicated he may not be on board with the so-called “Chevron doctrine,” which claims courts should defer to federal agencies’ regulatory decisions when such agencies are interpreting ambiguous statutes. That would give more power to the state and, in particular, the executive branch.

On the environment, Kavanaugh leaned toward curbing the power of the federal government to enact environmental rules. In a 2012 decision, Kavanaugh rejected the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s efforts to reduce air pollution across state lines. He also claimed that the agency lacks authority and power to enact some of its policies.

The rulings and opinions made Kavanaugh a popular judge among conservatives, but also attracted a number of detractors, with most liberal activist groups unequivocally coming out against his confirmation, even before the allegations of sexual misconduct, for which the FBI found “no corroboration.”

After it appeared that Kavanaugh will be confirmed, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he opposes the nomination because Kavanaugh was evasive in his answers on key topics during his confirmation hearings. Schumer said Kavanaugh's views were “deeply at odds with the progress America has made in the last century of jurisprudence and at odds with what most Americans believe.”

Associate Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan also took an apparent swipe at Kavanaugh, warning Friday that the high court may lose legitimacy if there’s no justice who acts like a swing vote on issues, the Hill reported.

She praised Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Justice Anthony Kennedy for being the jurists “who found the center or people [you] couldn't predict in that sort of way.”

“It’s not so clear, that I think going forward, that sort of middle position — it's not so clear whether we’ll have it,"" Kagan said at Princeton University just hours after it appeared that Senate Republicans secured enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh's nomination Saturday.

""All of us need to be aware of that — every single one of us — and to realize how precious the court’s legitimacy is. It's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being impartial, being neutral and not being simply an extension of a terribly polarizing process."" — Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan

“All of us need to be aware of that — every single one of us — and to realize how precious the court’s legitimacy is,” Kagan added. “It's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being impartial, being neutral and not being simply an extension of a terribly polarizing process.”

Some Democrats also say Kavanaugh will be more inclined to rule with other conservatives following the contentious hearing last month on the allegations raised by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, where Kavanaugh lashed out against Democrats for turning his confirmation into a “calculated and orchestrated political hit.”

He called the proceedings a “national disgrace” and said the opposition from the left was based on “revenge on behalf of the Clintons.”

He has since backtracked some of the rhetoric, penning a Wall Street Journal op-ed, in which he reiterated that he will maintain his independence.

""Going forward, you can count on me to be the same kind of judge and person I have been for my entire 28-year legal career: hardworking, even-keeled, open-minded, independent and dedicated to the Constitution and the public good,” he wrote.

""Going forward, you can count on me to be the same kind of judge and person I have been for my entire 28-year legal career: hardworking, even-keeled, open-minded, independent and dedicated to the Constitution and the public good."" — Judge Brett Kavanaugh

Kavanaugh’s words may have struck a chord with U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who gave a blistering speech Friday afternoon, explaining her reasoning behind voting for Kavanaugh and ultimately deciding to support his confirmation -- and suggesting that speculation on how he will rule was overblown.

“That Judge Kavanaugh is more of a centrist than some of his critics maintain is reflected in the fact that he and Chief Judge Merrick Garland voted the same way in 93 percent of the cases that they heard together,” Collins said, referring to the judge whom former President Barack Obama had nominated to the court.

Collins then made the case that Kavanaugh is within the mainstream legal opinion and far from the bogeyman some activists and Democratic opponents painted him with “over-the-top rhetoric.” The opposition to the nomination, in her view, has little to do with Kavanaugh’s actual record -- as Democrats announced their opposition even before his name was revealed.

454,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kavanaugh-confirmed-to-supreme-court-after-bitter-fight-securing-rightward-shift,2,"Judge Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as the 114th Supreme Court justice late Saturday, just hours after the Senate voted to approve President Trump's nominee to the nation's highest court after a rancorous confirmation battle.

Kavanaugh was sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts in a private ceremony, accompanied by his wife and children. The ceremonial swearing in is expected to happen on Monday evening at the White House. It means that now-Justice Kavanaugh will begin hearing cases before the court on Tuesday.

The Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh, mostly along party lines, after a weeklong FBI probe helped settle concerns among most wavering senators about the sexual assault allegations that nearly derailed his nomination and led to a dramatic second hearing. Saturday’s roll call marked the tightest successful Supreme Court confirmation vote in over 100 years, closer than even that of Clarence Thomas who similarly faced sexual misconduct allegations.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was the sole Democrat to vote “yes.” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, was a “no,” but voted “present” as a courtesy to Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., who was attending his daughter’s wedding in Montana.

Democrats reacted to the vote by urging supporters to turn out to the polls in November for the midterms.

“The American people are raising their voices to a deafening roar today. We will not stop marching, we will not stop fighting, and we will vote on Election Day for leaders who share our values,” Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez said in a statement.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said it was a ""heartbreaking day for women, girls and families across America."" She also announced she is filing a Freedom of Information Act request so the public can view documents connected to the FBI's background investigation into sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh.

“The conduct of the Senate Republican Majority did violence to the reputation of both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court. We must proceed in a judicious manner to set the record straight and ensure that this never happens again,” she said.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., brushed off criticism from Democrats and said it was ""a good day for America and an important day for the Senate.""

""We stood up for the presumption of innocence, we refused to be intimidated by the mob of people coming after Republican members at their homes and hallways,"" he said.

At a rally in Topeka, Kansas, President Trump hailed the confirmation as a ""tremendous victory"" and slammed Democrats for their treatment of Kavanaugh during the contentious confirmation hearing.

""What he and his family endured at the hands of Democrats is unthinkable. In their quest for power, the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob, you saw that today with the screaming and shouting,"" he said, referring to protests outside the Senate and Supreme Court earlier in the day.

The confirmation vote was all but secured Friday night when undecided Sens. Manchin and Susan Collins, R-Maine, announced they would vote to confirm Kavanaugh, along with Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who threw a curveball into the process when he requested the supplemental background probe last week as a virtual condition for support. Collins, on the Senate floor Friday, dismissed claims that Kavanaugh would be an extremist judge, and said the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh failed to meet the “more likely than not” standard.

The explosive battle over his seating as the ninth justice extended Saturday into the vote itself, with protesters shouting from the gallery and packing the Capitol and Supreme Court grounds – vowing to inflict payback against Republicans in November, and indicating Kavanaugh will be a lightning rod for years to come.

“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh today is a vote to end this brief, dark chapter in the Senate’s history and turn the page toward a brighter tomorrow,” McConnell said ahead of the vote, over which Vice President Pence presided.

While emerging from his formal confirmation hearing largely unscathed, Kavanaugh faced a late burst of sexual assault allegations from multiple women from when he was in high school and college. At the hastily convened second hearing that also featured accuser Christine Blasey Ford, he furiously and at-times emotionally denied the claims and attacked Democrats and left-wing activists for their handling of the allegations.

Ford, though, maintained she was “100 percent” sure he groped her and tried to force himself on her at a high school party.

Democrats said the claims were credible and called for further investigation, or even for Kavanaugh to withdraw. Ford’s account represented just one battleground. After she first came forward, prodded into the public eye by press leaks, another woman, Deborah Ramirez, said Kavanaugh exposed himself to her when they were at Yale. Another still, Julie Swetnick, claimed he and his friend Mark Judge (also accused of being in the room during the Ford incident) were involved in or present at “gang” rapes. Kavanaugh and Judge adamantly denied it all.

While Kavanaugh’s confirmation sometimes looked in doubt, particularly after the testimony of Ford, Republicans and the White House rallied to Kavanaugh’s side -- pointing to alleged inconsistencies and also a lack of corroborating evidence on the part of the accusers. They also slammed Democrats, accusing them of politicizing the accusations and trying to destroy Kavanaugh.

“Boy, y’all want power. God, I hope you never get it. I hope the American people can see through this sham,” a visibly angry Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Democrats at last week’s hearing.

Republicans conceded to the demand for a limited FBI investigation by Sen. Flake last Friday. Democrats had been demanding such an investigation into the assault claims, but criticized this one as not being thorough enough even before it had finished earlier this week.

On the Senate floor Saturday, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said the investigation was not comprehensive, and was ""a sham, a fig leaf for the Republicans to hide behind.""

Democrats expressed concern not only about the sexual assault allegations, but also his judicial record, arguing that he would overturn Roe v. Wade and rule from the extreme right. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Friday that Kavanaugh’s views are “deeply at odds with the progress America has made in the last century of jurisprudence and at odds with what most Americans believe.”

They also said they were troubled by his fiery attack on Democrats.

“This behavior revealed a hostility and belligerence unbecoming of someone seeking to be elevated to the Supreme Court,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif, said Friday.

Protesters and activists had been a ubiquitous presence on Capitol Hill in recent days. On Saturday approximately 1,000 protesters marched to the Capitol steps, chanting “November is coming.”

Republicans said that the fight had motivated the conservative base ahead of the November midterms. McConnell meanwhile, told the Washington Post that the Democratic and left-wing opposition was a ""great political gift for us.""

“I want to thank the mob, because they’ve done the one thing we were having trouble doing, which was energizing our base,” he said.

Kavanaugh replaces Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired at the end of July and was known as the swing justice, although he often sided with the conservative side of the bench.

Pop star Taylor Swift decided to shake off years of political speculation and come out against a female candidate and back a liberal man. Even better, that man recently endorsed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

Not a convenient media narrative. But Swift declared that Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn wasn’t liberal enough and that “her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me.” Apparently, it’s not just Kanye West who vexes her. It’s successful women.

The mega-wealthy singer (net worth $400 million) timed her newly woke political self to just two days before headlining the American Music Awards. Her open liberalism was clearly designed as a change in the narrative after the Hollywood left lost the Supreme Court fight. Because the left never just doubles down. It keeps on with the same old strategy — in this case, liberal celebrities.

ANTI-TRUMP MEDIA COULDN'T STOP KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION, DESPITE FRANTIC ALL-OUT EFFORT

The news media loved it. Fresh off their Kavanaugh defeat, journalists are clinging to Taylor like back-up dancers. The Hollywood Reporter went gaga over it and bizarrely claimed she “Speaks Out Against Anti-Gay Senate Candidate.” People gleefully headlined she was “Slamming Republican Candidate.”

Such is the state of liberalism today that The Washington Post asked: “Can Taylor Swift, revered by young Americans, help lead Democrats out of the woods?” If Taylor Swift is Moses, Hollywood has to be the Promised Land.

Only that’s not where three-fourths of the public wants to go. According to a Media Research Center/McLaughlin & Associates poll of likely voters, 74 percent don’t want politics in their entertainment or sports. Forty-three percent say they are less likely to watch political shows, which bodes ill for the AMAs.

Fox News obtained data from Vote.org on Tuesday that shows new voter registration spiked nationwide, and in her home state of Tennessee, after the singer’s post.

Kamari Guthrie, the director of communications for Vote.org, told BuzzFeed News that the organization was “up to 65,000 registrations in a single 24-hour period” since Swift’s post.

Vote.org said 56,669 people registered nationwide in August, and 190,178 registered in September.

So far, 153,978 people have registered nationwide in October, and we're just nine days in.

""Taylor's post has helped bring out young voters: a majority of new registrations since Sunday have been from people between 18 and 29 years old (about 64K out of the 105K total new registrations),” Vote.org said in a statement regarding Swift’s Instagram post. “We're especially happy to see that because we know voting is habit-forming; statistically, a young person who votes in 2018 is 55 percent more likely to vote again in 2020.”

The organization also said it received at least 2,144 voter registrations from Tennessee residents in the past 36 hours since her post, almost half of the 5,183 people who have registered to vote there in October.

TRUMP SAYS HE LIKES TAYLOR SWIFT ‘ABOUT 25 PERCENT LESS’ AFTER MARSHA BLACKBURN DIG

On Sunday, Swift broke her political silence with an Instagram message. She bashed Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn, currently a state congresswoman.

""As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn,"" Swift told her 112 million Instagram followers. ""Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me.""

Swift said the congresswoman ""voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry.""

TAYLOR SWIFT BASHES BLACKBURN IN FAVOR OF TENNESSEE DEMS, BREAKING POLITICAL SILENCE

""These are not MY Tennessee values,"" the ""Fearless"" singer said online.

Swift wrote she will be voting for Democrat Phil Bredesen for the Senate, and also for Rep. Jim Cooper, a Democrat who's running for re-election.

In 2016, Blackburn won her House re-election race, defeating Democrat Tharon Chandler. She represented Tennessee’s 7th congressional district. Blackburn received more than 72 percent of the vote, The New York Times reported. Blackburn is running to replace Republican Sen. Bob Corker’s seat. Corker announced last year that he will be retiring from the Senate. Bredesen is running against Blackburn.

Following Swift's endorsements, President Trump told reporters on Monday that he likes her music “about 25 percent less.”

""I'm sure Taylor Swift has nothing or doesn't know anything about her,"" Trump said of the 28-year-old singer. ""Let's say that I like Taylor's music about 25 percent less now, OK?""

West began the much-anticipated sit-down by praising Trump's efforts in North Korea saying, ""On day one you solved one of [Obama's] biggest troubles. We solved one of the biggest problems.""

The conversation turned to West discussing the lack of support he received from his Hollywood cohorts with regards to his support of the president.

""They tried to scare me to not wear this hat,"" West said, referring to his ""Make America Great Again"" hat he wore to the meeting and on a recent appearance on ""Saturday Night Live.""

""When I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman - my favorite superhero. You made a Superman cape for me.""

The rapper went on to chastise the NBC sketch show and other liberal-leaning media members for their portrayal of the American president.

""What I need 'SNL' and liberals to improve on is, if he don't look good, we don't look good. He has to be the freshest, the flyest, have the flyest planes. He has to look good!"" West said. ""When we make everything in China and not America, we’re cheating on our country.""

West discussed many topics in a rambling dialogue that included everything from bringing manufacturing to the country, his personal business deals, ending stop-and-frisk in Chicago and the 13th Amendment.

""There's a lot of things that affect our mental health that put us into this trap door that is the 13th Amendment,"" West said.

West went on to reference his recent bipolar disorder diagnosis saying that he was misdiagnosed by a doctor and said he was merely sleep-deprived.

The chat was then turned over to reporters who asked West about his feelings on gun control.

""Illegal guns is the problem, not legal guns, we have the right to bear arms,"" he said bluntly.

Overall, West was complimentary to the president, even at one point saying he loved him and running around the Resolute desk to hug him.

The rapper's statement lasted nearly 10 minutes before the president chimed in to compliment West on his honesty.

""I tell you what, that was pretty impressive,"" Trump said after West seemed to run out of steam. ""That was quite something.""

""It was from the soul. I just channeled it,"" West replied.

Trump continued to compliment the rapper, who talked about spreading love through the country.

“He can speak for me any time he wants, he’s a smart cookie,” Trump said. “He gets it.”

When asked if West’s previous declarations that he’ll run for president seem reasonable to Trump, he noted that he thinks Kanye “could very well be” candidate material.

“Only after 2024,” West said.

Former NFL legend and actor Jim Brown was in the meeting along with senior advisor and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump asked Brown what he thought of the scene, to which he replied, “I’m here to serve.”

The Chicago-raised rapper and the New York real estate mogul-turned president have a long friendship that goes back before the 2016 election.

When West declared in 2015 he would run for president in 2020 during a 2015 VMAs acceptance speech, Trump, then just a presidential candidate, was not fazed, and welcomed the competition.

“I hope to run against him someday,” Trump told Rolling Stone magazine.

Trump also defended West as a “nice guy” and “actually a different kind of person than people think.”

TRUMP AND KANYE WEST'S RELATIONSHIP THROUGH THE YEARS

“He’s said very nice things about me in the past … extremely positive things,” Trump said.

A year later, West visited the then president-elect at Trump Tower in New York in December 2016.

“We’ve been friends for a long time,” Trump said at the time. He said the bombastic pair discussed “life.”

West later said online that he met with Trump in 2016 “to discuss multiracial issues” such as “bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculum and violence in Chicago.”

“I feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change,” he said in the since-deleted tweets.

West has received a lot of backlash from fans and his fellow celebrities for his support of the president including a recent slew of criticism from several members of “Saturday Night Live” who bashed West after going on a pro-Trump rant at the end of the show earlier this month.

“What Kanye said after we went off the air last week was one of the worst, most awkward things I’ve seen here, and I’ve seen Chevy Chase speak to an intern,” ""SNL"" star Pete Davidson joked in a skit the following week.

West explained to the New York Times in June why he supports Trump, saying there are many more Trump supporters in Hollywood who are just afraid to come forward.

“There were people who said Trump would never win,” West said in the interview. “I’m talking about the it-will-never-happens of the world, people in high school told you things would never happen.”

'He’s said very nice things about me in the past … extremely positive things' — President Trump on Kanye West

West said he had been an underdog his entire career, and that drew him to Trump, a man who many felt could never win the presidency. He claimed the two shared “dragon energy.""

“I felt that I knew people who voted for Trump that were celebrities that were scared to say that they liked him,” he said. ""But they told me, and I liked him, and I’m not scared to say what I like. Let me come over here and get in this fight with you.”

The star went on to describe breaking free of the ""mob-thought"" that made him feel obligated to support Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election because of his celebrity and status.

Trump returned the love at a campaign-style rally in Michigan in April.

“Kanye West gets it,” Trump said. “When he sees that African-American unemployment is the lowest in history, you know people are watching. That’s a very important thing he’s done for his legacy.”

Trump also returned the accolades tweeting in April, “Kanye West has performed a great service to the Black Community – Big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in Decades – Legacy stuff.”

458,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-meets-with-freed-american-pastor-andrew-brunson-in-oval-office,2,"Freed American pastor Andrew Brunson met and prayed with President Trump in the Oval Office Saturday, thanking him for having ""really fought for us"" -- a day after his release from house arrest in Turkey.

Brunson, from North Carolina, arrived in the U.S. earlier Saturday after stopping in Germany on Friday. Brunson was imprisoned in October 2016 due to his alleged ties to an outlawed group as part of a crackdown on a failed coup in Turkey against President Recep Erdogan’s government. A Turkish judge on Friday ordered him freed from house arrest on Friday after sentencing him to time served on terror and treason charges.

Brunson thanked Trump in the Oval Office, saying ""you really fought for us, unusually so, from the time you took office."" He also thanked members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who had worked for his release.

""We're so grateful to so many people in Congress who stood with us, who prayed for us, who fought for us,"" he said.

In a dramatic moment, Brunson knelt down and prayed with the President -- asking God for ""supernatural wisdom to accomplish all the plans you have for this country and for him.""

In his remarks, Trump said it was a ""great honor"" to have Brunson in the White House and thanked a number of lawmakers and members of the Cabinet for their assistance in securing Bunson's release.

""If ever there was a bipartisan effort, this was it,"" he said. A number of senators, as well as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton, were in attendance in the Oval Office. Trump also appeared to take something of a swipe at the previous administration when he said: ""We do not pay ransom in this country, at least any longer.""

Brunson said he and his wife looked forward to spending time with children and praying to see what God wants next from him.

Trump, who had thanked Turkish President Erdogan ""for his help"" earlier in the day, expressed hope that Brunson's release would mark the start of better relations between the two countries. Trump said on Twitter that while there was “great appreciation” and a hope of good relations between the U.S. and Turkey, but there was “no deal” made for Brunson’s return.

ANDREW BRUNSON, AMERICAN PASTOR DETAINED IN TURKEY, IS FREED, SENTENCED TO TIME SERVED

“There was NO DEAL made with Turkey for the release and return of Pastor Andrew Brunson. I don’t make deals for hostages,” he tweeted. “There was, however, great appreciation on behalf of the United States, which will lead to good, perhaps great, relations between the United States & Turkey!”

The Trump administration advocated persistently for Brunson's release, leading to an intense economic showdown between the two NATO allies. In August, the U.S. slapped sanctions on an array of Turkish officials and on some goods, sending Turkish currency into freefall. Brunson's release still leaves Turkey frustrated by the Trump administration's refusal to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric accused by Turkey of engineering the failed coup.

Brunson was accused of committing crimes on behalf of Gulen and Kurdish militants who have been fighting the Turkish state for decades. He faced up to 35 years in jail if convicted of all the charges against him.

459,https://www.foxnews.com/world/jamal-khashoggi-search-turkish-officials-sought-toxic-materials-inside-saudi-consulate-pompeo-has-meetings,2,"Investigators looking for clues on Jamal Khashoggi’s whereabouts searched for traces of “toxic materials” at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul where he was last seen two weeks ago, Turkish media reports say, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo landed in Saudi Arabia for talks over the matter.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan revealed some details about the consulate search while speaking to journalists Tuesday, the Associated Press reported, citing Turkey's NTV.

The AP also cited a high-level Turkish official as saying that during the search, ""certain evidence"" was found by police proving that Khashoggi was killed at the consulate. But the official did not elaborate.

The announcements came as Khashoggi’s family released a statement saying they are “traumatized” over his disappearance. The activist and opinion columnist – who was a critic of the Saudi government -- was last seen entering the Saudi consulate on Oct. 2, reportedly to obtain documents related to his upcoming marriage to a Turkish woman.

Saudi Arabia, which has repeatedly claimed Khashoggi walked out of the building on his own, reportedly is now considering whether to say rogue intelligence operatives murdered him by mistake during an interrogation.

""We are sadly and anxiously following the conflicting news regarding the fate of our father after losing contact with him two weeks ago, when he disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul,"" the family's statement said. “Our family is traumatized and yearns to be together during this painful time. The strong moral and legal responsibility which our father instilled in us obliges us to call for the establishment of an independent and impartial international commission to inquire into the circumstances of his death.”

In addition to the consulate search that took place Monday, a Turkish official revealed Tuesday the top Saudi diplomat’s home in Istanbul will also be investigated, the Associated Press reported. The official did not say when that search will happen, but Turkish media has reported that the diplomat, Mohammed al-Otaibi, left the country on an afternoon flight just hours it was announced.

Surveillance footage leaked to Turkish media showed that shortly after Khashoggi disappeared, vehicles were seen moving between the consulate and the diplomat’s home, according to the Associated Press.

Pompeo – who is currently meeting with Saudi King Salman over the Khashoggi case – arrived in Riyadh on Tuesday.

""The Secretary and the King discussed a number of regional and bilateral issues,"" State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said. ""The Secretary also thanked the King for his commitment to supporting a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation of Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance.""

Pompeo also met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is accused of ordering the detention of Khashoggi.

“We are strong and old allies,"" he told Pompeo. ""So we face our challenges together, the past, the day of, tomorrow.”

460,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-releases-dna-analysis-on-native-american-heritage-firing-back-at-trump-attacks,2,"Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren took the rare step Monday of releasing DNA test results examining her possible Native American ancestry, in apparent response to persistent criticism from President Trump and other Republicans.

The results, as shared with The Boston Globe, reportedly reveal “strong evidence” the Massachusetts senator had a Native American ancestor dating back six to 10 generations. At the same time, the report could embolden critics by showing only trace amounts of that heritage -- which Republicans have charged she used to advance her career at Harvard.

According to the analysis, if Warren’s great-great-great-grandmother were Native American, she would be considered 1/64 Native American. Should Warren’s ancestor date back 10 generations, she would be only 1/1,024 Native American. (The newspaper originally pegged the figures as 1/32 and 1/512, but in a correction that didn't do Warren any favors, later added a note saying, ""Due to a math error, a story about Elizabeth Warren misstated the ancestry percentage of a potential 6th to 10th generation relative. The generational range based on the ancestor that the report identified suggests she’s between 1/64th and 1/1,024th Native American."")

""To put that in perspective, Warren might even be less Native American than the average European American,"" Republican National Committee Deputy Communications Director Mike Reed said in an email, while saying this would ""not give you the right to claim minority status.""

But as Warren mulls a presidential run in 2020, her Senate re-election campaign produced a video playing up the results.

In it, Warren says: “The president likes to call my mom a liar. What do the facts say?”

Stanford University Professor Carlos D. Bustamante replies: “The facts suggest that you absolutely have Native American ancestry in your pedigree.”

Bustamante, according to the Globe, authored the six-page report and conducted the analysis after Warren released a sample of her DNA to a private lab in Georgia over the summer. Warren did not use a commercial service for her DNA analysis, according to The Globe, but rather Bustamante, who is on the scientific advisory board for Ancestry. He also worked on projects for other commercial services like 23andMe.

Bustamante found that “the vast majority” of Warren’s family tree is European, but added that “the results strongly support the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor ... in the range of 6-10 generations ago.”

Warren has been repeatedly criticized by Trump over her heritage claims—including last week at a rally, when he once again used his “Pocahontas” nickname for her.

“I’ve got more Indian blood in me than Pocahontas, and I have none,” Trump said. “Hey, I have high cheekbones too, maybe I’m Indian.”

Over the summer, Trump said that if Warren did mount a presidential run in 2020 and the two faced off in a general election debate, he would offer $1 million to her favorite charity on the spot if she took a DNA test to prove her Native American heritage.

The DNA results report could, at least, eliminate that as a line of attack.

Trump, though, brushed off Warren's DNA test when asked about it Monday morning, while claiming he never made the million-dollar offer (he did, at a rally over the summer).

""Who cares?"" Trump said. ""I didn't say that. You better read it again.""

Trump added that he ""hopes"" Warren runs for president.

""I think she'd be very easy. I do not think she'd be difficult at all. She'll destroy the country. She'll make our country into Venezuela,"" Trump told reporters on the White House lawn. ""It's going to be a long process for the Democrats.""

Meanwhile, Warren used the Globe report to directly respond to Trump's challenge.

""By the way, @ realDonaldTrump: Remember saying on 7/5 that you’d give $1M to a charity of my choice if my DNA showed Native American ancestry? I remember – and here's the verdict. Please send the check to the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center,"" Warren tweeted, including a link to the group's website.

Warren for years has been accused of exaggerating her Native American heritage to help get a job as a Harvard law professor. Last month, the Globe reported that her heritage was not considered by Harvard Law faculty when analyzing her application in the 1990s. The report also said that her race was not considered when she applied to work at Rutgers University, the University of Houston, the University of Texas or the University of Pennsylvania.

Warren’s move to release her DNA results is yet another indication that she is considering a run for president. Warren has already released 10 years of tax returns and made her personnel files available to the Globe.

461,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rep-steve-scalise-democrats-must-stand-up-to-violence-against-republicans,2,"We are less than 20 days out from Election Day and the shocking reports of attacks against Republican candidates and volunteers keep getting worse.



In Minnesota, two Republican candidates for state office were punched.

Shane Mekeland is a first-time candidate who is unfortunately entering politics at a time when violence seems to be condoned or shrugged off by leading voices on the left.

Mekeland became a victim of this violent hysteria while at a restaurant speaking with local voters. He is now recovering from a concussion that resulted from a completely unprovoked sucker-punch to his head.



Minnesota state Rep. Sarah Anderson was punched by a man for having the courage to confront him as he committed the criminal act of destroying campaign yard signs. As she took action to defend her fellow Americans’ freedom of speech, she was violently assaulted in a gross intimidation attempt.



Late Wednesday, we learned of yet another alleged assault, this time against Nevada Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt’s campaign manager, Kristin Davidson. Mike Stark, an employee of a liberal, George Soros-backed campaign group, has been accused of violently holding Davidson against her will while she was at work campaigning for Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who is the GOP candidate for governor.

As we continue to hear new reports of violence being committed against Republicans, simply because of their political views, it is clear that the most radical elements of the Democratic Party are taking over.

This isn’t the first time he has been accused of assaulting a woman for her political views. The press secretary for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke allegedly experienced a similar violent intimidation attack from Stark. She filed charges and yet this Soros-funded group chose to continue employing him and sending him into situations where he could assault even more women.



As we continue to hear new reports of violence being committed against Republicans, simply because of their political views, it is clear that the most radical elements of the Democratic Party are taking over.

Democratic Party leaders have been reluctant to stop this. Remarkably few have spoken out forcefully against this violence, and what’s worse, some continue to stoke this hysteria instead.

We’ve heard Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former Attorney General Eric Holder, all call on their supporters to harass Republicans. Hillary Clinton even admitted, “You cannot be civil” as long as Democrats are in the minority in Congress.



Words have consequences and as all of these Democratic Party leaders know, they are in positions of great influence. Their supporters respond to their leadership. But instead of using this authority to strengthen our democracy, their calls for bullying and harassment have undermined it and have incited violence.



This might be the kind of intimidation you would expect from a tyrannical dictator in a Third World nation, but not from the freest country in the world.

I’m calling on all of us, my Democratic colleagues especially, to stand up to this bullying and harassment. With more Americans politically engaged than ever, this could be a turning point for our democracy.



As candidates throughout the country meet with voters to share their views and ask for their votes, they should do so without fear of being physically attacked for their beliefs.

Only when someone is losing the debate does he or she resort to violence, and there is no place in American discourse for harassment or intimidation. It is not who we are as Americans.

Getting this right is critical to the future of our democracy. That’s why it’s so disappointing that many on the left would seemingly rather stoke or condone aggression by their base than forcefully condemn political harassment and violence.

The American voters are wiser than those who think they can win by mob rule. In this race for the future direction of our country, it will be the party with the best ideas, not the party with the most bullies, that will be victorious on Election Day."
462,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-very-dangerous-decision-to-abandon-nuclear-accord-has-mankind-facing-full-chaos-russia-says,2,"Hours after President Trump announced that the U.S. will pull out of a decades-old bilateral nuclear agreement that he said Russia had been ""violating for many years,"" top Russian officials lined up to hit back in no uncertain terms, calling the president's move a ""very dangerous"" provocation that would lead to ""full chaos.""

""We condemn the ongoing attempts by blackmail to achieve concessions from Russia,"" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told a state news agency. ""This would be a very dangerous step.""

Konstatin Kosachev, who chairs the foreign affairs committee in the Federation Council, Russia's upper house of parliament, wrote on Facebook that Trump's decision meant ""mankind is facing full chaos in the nuclear weapons sphere.""

And prominent Russian senator Aleksey Pushkov charged that Trump's move meant ""United States is bringing the world back to the Cold War,"" saying the U.S.' withdrawal from the treaty would be a ""massive blow to the entire system of strategic stability in the world."" Pushkov had previously criticized claims that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, arguing those suggestions are part of a plan to continue a ""new Cold War.""

RUSSIAN NATIONAL CHARGED WITH INTERFERING IN 2018 US ELECTIONS

The 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty ostensibly prevents both the United States and Russia from possessing, producing or test-flying any ground-launched cruise missile with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles. President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev inked the deal because of an unfolding crisis.

""We’re not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement."" — President Trump

But the Trump administration has said Russia broke the deal by deploying Novator 9M729 land-based cruise missiles, which can exceed that range and strike NATO countries quickly. The U.S. has previously acknowledged that Russia was violating the treaty in 2012 under the Obama administration, and for their part, Russian officials have also suggested the U.S. hasn't complied with the treaty by placing missiles in European bases.

After speaking at a campaign rally in Elko, Nevada, on Saturday, Trump said the agreement did little more than interfere with U.S. military development.

""We’re going to terminate the agreement, and we’re going to pull out,” Trump told reporters. ""They have been violating it for many years. I don't know why President [Barack] Obama didn't negotiate or pull out. ... We’re not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement and go out and do weapons, and we’re not allowed to.""

ANALYSIS: PUTIN ATE TRUMP'S LUNCH AT PREVIOUS SUMMIT IN HELSINKI

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg concurred with Trump's assessment earlier this month. (The Defense Department concluded in February that Russia was actively violating its arms treaty agreements, as well.)

""This treaty abolishes a whole category of weapons and is a crucial element of our security. Now this treaty is in danger because of Russia's actions,"" Stoltenberg said. ""After years of denials, Russia recently acknowledged the existence of a new missile system, called 9M729. Russia has not provided any credible answers on this new missile. All allies agree that the most plausible assessment would be that Russia is in violation of the treaty. It is therefore urgent that Russia addresses these concerns in a substantial and transparent manner.""

On Saturday, Trump went on to say he would be open to a new, similar agreement only if Russia and China signed on and demonstrated a sincere commitment.

“We'll have to develop those weapons, unless Russia comes to us, and China comes to us, and they all come to us and they say ‘let's really get smart and let's none of us develop those weapons,"" Trump said.

UK Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson forcefully backed the U.S. in an interview with The Financial Times, saying that Russia had made a ""mockery"" of the agreement.

“Our close and long-term ally, of course, is the United States and we will be absolutely resolute with the United States in hammering home a clear message that Russia needs to respect the treaty obligation that it signed,"" Williamson said.

GORBACHEV: TRUMP, PUTIN SHOULD FOCUS ON ARMS CONTROL

But Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Trump's pullout a ""big, big mistake"" on ""Fox News Sunday,"" echoing comments he made Saturday on Twitter.

Trump's announcement comes as National Security Adviser John Bolton makes his way to Moscow on Monday and Tuesday, before a trip to countries elsewhere in the region. Bolton is expected to discuss a range of issues with his Russian counterparts, including Russia's deployment of a S-300 missile defense system in Syria, the recent poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britian, and the nuclear accord.

Also expected to headline discussions are renegotiations of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which is slated to expire in 2021. Signed by Obama and former Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, the deal limits the number of strategic warheads both countries are allowed to deploy.

Trump and Putin are expected to attend another high-level summit, following their widely-criticized meeting in Helsinki, Finland in July. Critics charged Trump was too ready to accept Putin's denials of any meddling in U.S. elections.

""This is the most severe crisis in nuclear arms control since the 1980s,” Malcolm Chalmers, the deputy director general of the Royal United Services Institute, said in an interview. “If the INF treaty collapses, and with the New Start treaty on strategic arms due to expire in 2021, the world could be left without any limits on the nuclear arsenals of nuclear states for the first time since 1972.”"
463,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-faces-tough-choices-on-saudi-arabia-in-wake-of-khashoggi-killing,2,"A lot of tough talk about Saudi Arabia now cascades down Capitol Hill after the suspected death of Jamal Khashoggi.

Talk is one thing. Action is another.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., contends he “can’t imagine there will be no response” after the Khashoggi incident. The Kentucky Republican noted there are periodically “strains” in the American-Saudi relationship. But McConnell asserted the U.S. deals with the Saudis because of “aligned interests” in the region. The Majority Leader called it a “pragmatic relationship.”

But what exactly can Congress do to the Saudis? What is it willing to do? And when?

First, nothing will likely happen regarding Saudi Arabia for a while - if at all. Both bodies of Congress are out for the midterm elections until November 13.

Lawmakers of both parties have been vocal about Khashoggi’s fate. And when it comes to Congress, volume doesn’t always equate proportional action.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox the U.S. should “sanction the hell” out of Saudi Arabia and warned of “a bipartisan tsunami building here against Saudi Arabia if they did in fact (kill Khashoggi).” Graham predicted that such Saudi culpability “would be a game changer to the Nth degree.”

“With the exception of Israel, I trust every country in the Middle East as much as I trust gas station sushi,” said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.

“Murder is murder,” thundered Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., adding that the U.S. shouldn’t “bow and scrape” just to curry favor with the Saudis.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., called the U.S.-Saudi Arabia alliance a “complex and complicated relationship.” But Durbin added “if we can’t draw a clear line, shame on us.”

“I don’t care who will get upset,” said Leahy about possible retribution for the Saudis.

And there’s the problem. Which side needs the other more? The U.S. or Saudi Arabia? The U.S. needs a reasonably steady hand in the Middle East besides just Israel and Jordan. But there’s concern that the use of even harsh words by the Americans against the Saudis - let alone Congressionally-approved sanctions, restricted diplomatic relations, diminished arms sales or other ramifications - could inflame the kingdom. Unrest in Saudi Arabia could easily destabilize the region. On one hand, the best-case scenario is that the U.S. has an ebb in relations with the Saudis. But as one Congressional source confided to Fox, the worst case scenario would “prompt another 9-11” if Washington pushes too far.

The U.S. has long tried to operate on both sides of the fence with Saudi Arabia. Such duality is likely essential when dealing with Saudi Arabia.

“We deal with imperfect allies all the time,” said Graham.

This is why Leahy’s comment about not worrying who will get “upset” is critical. It’s always a juggling act with Saudi Arabia. Even inside the kingdom. And rattling the wrong Saudi factions could reap grave consequences.

Still, how much impact can Congress have on Saudi Arabia? Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., joined the top Democrat on the panel Sen. Bob Menendez, D-NJ, asking the Trump Administration to launch an “investigation and Global Magnitsky sanctions determination.”

The 2012 Magnitsky Act is a lever Congress can pull to punish foreign powers for extrajudicial killings, torture, or detention. President Obama signed the act into law after Russia arrested lawyer Sergei Magnitsky and beat him to death while in custody in 2008. Magnitsky faced scrutiny after unearthing a Kremlin tax fraud scheme.

Under the law, a clock began to run once Corker and Menendez fired off their missive to the White House. The Trump Administration has four months to investigate if a foreign power committed human rights abuses. If so, the U.S. can impose sanctions.

Congress and the President can certainly move more quickly if the situation merits. But it’s hard to see how that could happen with lawmakers entering a lame duck session after the midterm elections. It’s likely that the new Congress would tackle any prospective discipline for Saudi Arabia in 2019.

Lawmakers of both parties have long been suspect of Saudi Arabia. In 2016, Congress approved a measure to allow victims of those killed on 9/11 to sue the Saudi government over purported terrorism ties. President Obama vetoed the plan. But Congress successfully overrode the President, the only veto override of Mr. Obama’s career.

The Khashoggi affair also flags a credibility problem for the administration.

President Trump this week applauded Rep. Greg Gianforte, R-Mont., for body slamming reporter Ben Jacobs last year.

“Never wrestle him,” proclaimed Mr. Trump about Gianforte to howls of laughter. “Any guy that can do a body slam – he’s my guy.”

In other words, is the Trump Administration truly concerned about violence against journalists when it engages on the Khashoggi affair in one breath and then Mr. Trump makes light of physical violence against the press in another?

There are also questions about how some Republicans in Congress may ignore the Khashoggi issue depending on Mr. Trump’s disposition toward the Saudis. Congressional outrage may simmer regardless. But Corker will be gone. The late-Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is no longer with us. Moderate Republicans are poised to lose or are retiring after the election. It’s unclear who on the GOP side of the aisle may be willing to call out the Trump Administration if they bungle this matter.

There are now impassioned conversations about Saudi Arabia on Capitol Hill. The language and potential action would be more intense if Congress were in session now. But it’s doubtful anything will unfold on the Khashoggi front for months due to the special complexities between Washington and Riyadh. A new Congress will tangle with this issue after January 3. By then, it’s quite possible that lawmakers may have moved on, tip-toeing through whatever may be the next international crisis.

464,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/suspicious-package-found-at-clintons-home-police-say,2,"Packages containing suspected explosive devices were intercepted en route to some of the most prominent political figures in the country – including former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton – putting law enforcement on high alert Wednesday and prompting evacuations and sweeps of several facilities.

CNN's New York office was among those evacuated due to the discovery of an apparent explosive device. Law enforcement officers said the incidents appear related, and the devices appear to be pipe bombs. A law enforcement official directly involved in the investigation tells Fox News that the devices have similar packaging, labelling and postage -- leading investigators to believe that one person or group is responsible.

In his first public remarks on the packages which largely targeted Democratic figures, President Trump said Wednesday afternoon that the devices are being inspected, ""and a major federal investigation is now underway.""

""We have to unify. We have to come together,"" Trump said, at a bill-signing for opioid legislation. ""Acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.""

Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a joint statement Wednesday afternoon saying that ""Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence.

""Time and time again, the President has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and his actions,"" said Schumer and Pelosi. ""[E]xpressing support for the Congressman [Greg Gianforte] who body-slammed a reporter, the neo-Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville, his supporters at rallies who get violent with protestors, dictators around the world who murder their own citizens, and referring to the free press as the enemy of the people.""

In the latest incident, a law enforcement source told Fox News that U.S. Capitol Police are investigating a suspicious package addressed to Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters. The package is at the Capitol Hill screening facility in Maryland.

The rapidly evolving security scare went public when the Secret Service confirmed Wednesday morning its officers had ""intercepted"" two suspicious packages identified as ""potential explosive devices"" sent to Obama and Clinton.

CNN employees, shortly afterward, were evacuated from their New York office, due to a suspicious package at the Time Warner Center reportedly addressed to ex-CIA director John Brennan (who is an analyst for NBC). At a New York press conference, NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill said officers on the scene identified what ""appeared to be a live explosive device"" as well as an envelope containing white powder, which is now being investigated.

Meanwhile, the focus turned to Sunrise, Fla. as the building housing the office of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., the former Democratic Party chairwoman, was evacuated over a suspicious package.

One source told Fox News that all the packages in question had a return address affiliated with that location. The package discovered at Wasserman Schultz's office, according to another law enforcement source, was originally sent to ex-Attorney General Eric Holder under the wrong address -- and then returned to Wasserman Schultz' office due to the return label.

In a statement, Wasserman Schultz said she was ""deeply disturbed by the way my name was used."" She added that a second office, in nearby Aventura, was evacuated ""in an abundance of caution.""

""We will not be intimidated by this attempted act of violence,"" she said. "" ... Today, my staff and I will hug each other and our loved ones tightly, and tomorrow get back to work serving the people I was elected to represent.""

Some of the scares turned out to be false alarms.

In San Diego, the building housing the offices of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and the San Diego Union-Tribune was evacuated due to a suspicious package. But police later said the package was merely ""abandoned property,"" and a Harris spokeswoman said the ""suspicious packages"" were not addressed to the senator or their office. New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo also announced at a press conference that a ""device"" was sent to his Manhattan office. But it was later reported the device was a hoax, and unrelated.

This comes after an explosive device was found Monday evening in the mailbox of liberal billionaire George Soros.

The discovery of the packages injected more tension into the country's already-fraught political environment, in which lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been publicly accosted and faced a steady stream of threats, all coming days before the midterms.

""What we saw here today was an effort to terrorize,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said of the events in Manhattan. ""This clearly is an act of terror.""

As teams across the country investigate, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, in a written statement, condemned what she described as the ""attempted violent attacks"" against the Clintons and Obama.

“We condemn the attempted violent attacks recently made against President Obama, President Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and other public figures. These terrorizing acts are despicable, and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. The United States Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and will take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards,” she said, joined by Trump and Vice President Pence, who at a separate event said those responsible will be ""brought to justice.""

The news of the packages to Clinton and Obama unfolded quickly Wednesday morning. It first emerged that the FBI was investigating one suspicious package found by the home of Bill and Hillary Clinton in Chappaqua, New York. But in a statement, the Secret Service said after that package addressed to Hillary Clinton was caught late Tuesday, a second package addressed to Obama's residence ""was intercepted by Secret Service personnel in Washington, DC"" on Wednesday morning.

""The packages were immediately identified during routine mail screening procedures as potential explosive devices and were appropriately handled as such. The protectees did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them,"" the Secret Service said in its statement.

The Secret Service said it has launched a ""full scope criminal investigation that will leverage all available federal, state, and local resources to determine the source of the packages and identify those responsible.”

Speaking at an event early Wednesday afternoon, Hillary Clinton said her family is fine and ""grateful"" for the work of the Secret Service which caught the package before it got to their home. She said this is a ""troubling time.""

Sources told Fox News that former President Bill Clinton was at home in Chappaqua when the suspicious package was found, but that it was screened in Westchester County--not at the Clinton residence. A spokesperson for Hillary Clinton told Fox News that the former secretary of state has been in Florida for the last several days.

“I stand with all Americans in condemning today’s attempted acts of domestic terrorism. As we continue to learn more, Americans are united in gratitude for the first responders — the Secret Service, the Postal Service, and other law enforcement — who protect our leaders and public figures from such unconscionable acts,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said.

In New York, the New Castle Police Department and the Westchester County Police are assisting in their investigation into the first suspicious package.

“The matter is currently under federal investigation,” a spokesman for the New Castle Police Department said in a statement to Fox News.

The FBI's New York Field Office tweeted Wednesday morning that the investigation is ongoing.

According to The New York Times, the explosive device in Chappaqua was found by a technician who screens mail for the Clintons. Chappaqua is approximately 20 minutes from Bedford. Both towns are about one hour outside of New York City.

465,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-mulls-plan-to-bar-entry-of-all-migrants-at-us-mexico-border,2,"President Trump is considering a sweeping executive order that would block migrants, including asylum seekers, from entering the U.S. at the southern border in a bid to stop the caravan traveling north through Mexico.

The White House, if it goes ahead with the measure, would issue new regulations restricting certain migrants from seeking asylum. The rules would effectively block most if not all the migrants who are taking part in the caravan, Politico first reported.

Fox News has learned the proposal originated out of the White House and is one of several being considered. No final decision has been made.

“The Administration is considering a wide range of administrative, legal and legislative options to address the Democrat-created crisis of mass illegal immigration. No decisions have been made at this time. Nor will we forecast to smugglers or caravans what precise strategies will or will not be deployed,” a White House official said.

The order would be akin to Trump's previous aggressive immigration-blocking executive orders, such as the travel ban aimed at halting people from some Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.

Any attempt to block the entry of Central American migrants is likely to prompt legal challenges, though Trump is likely emboldened following a Supreme Court ruling earlier this summer that affirmed the president’s right to bar the entry of migrants who “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.”

The plan for the executive order comes just in the final stretch before the upcoming midterm elections, with Trump trying to make the issue of caravan the defining topic as voters head to the polls.

""Every time you see a caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws!"" Trump wrote in a tweet Monday. ""Remember the midterms!""

Hundreds of U.S. troops are also set to make their way to the southern border to help Homeland Security and the National Guard as the caravan pushes north.

An official told Fox News on Thursday roughly 800 soldiers will be sent to the area to offer “logistical support,"" including providing tents and vehicles.

It’s not immediately clear which units are being tasked with the mission as details are still being finalized. There are currently 2,100 National Guard troops on the southern border assisting Homeland Security.

Democrats, while previously outspoken regarding Trump’s immigration policies, are staying largely silent on the issue, instead preferring to remain focused on tackling the GOP on issues like health care, saying it’s the winning issue this election cycle.

DEMOCRATS AVOID SPARRING WITH TRUMP ON CARAVAN AS MIDTERM NEARS

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrats in the country, slammed Trump in a statement earlier this week regarding the caravan of migrants, saying the president is “desperate” to change the conversation because “health care is the number one issue Americans care about.”

According to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey published last week, which surveyed people since the beginning of the caravan earlier this month, the issue of immigration isn’t the top concern for voters. It ranks below health care, which has consistently been viewed as the most important issue. Other key issues have been the economy, jobs and policies concerning gun rights.

466,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-for-death-penalty-after-synagogue-shooting-leaders-react-to-tragedy-with-sorrow-anger-and-frustration,2,"President Trump said that the suspect responsible for killing and injuring multiple people and police officers at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday “should get the death penalty,” saying the suspect should “pay the ultimate price.”

Speaking to reporters ahead of boarding Air Force One, Trump addressed the “devastating” shooting that occurred Saturday morning at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, which is predominantly Jewish.

Multiple fatalities were reported, and there were also injuries, including four police officers.

""People who do this should get the death penalty,” Trump said. “I think they should stiffen up laws and I think they should very much bring the death penalty to anybody who does a thing like this to innocent people.”

He added: “They should really suffer the ultimate price — pay the ultimate price. I’ve felt this way for a very long time. People disagree with me, and I can’t imagine why.”

Later Saturday, the president ordered that flags be flown at half-staff at federal buildings in ""solemn respect"" for the synagogue shooting victims.

Earlier this month, the president called for the death penalty to be brought against “criminals” who kill police officers. The president has issued calls for a stricter death penalty policy since the 2016 presidential campaign.

The death penalty is legal in Pennsylvania, though current Gov. Tom Wolf halted the process when he took office in 2015. The last person executed under the death penalty in Pennsylvania was in 1999--the first since 1962.

Trump was asked about tighter gun laws, which he discounted, saying they had “little to do with it.”

“If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better. If they had some kind of protection inside the temple, maybe it could have been a very much different situation,” Trump said. “They didn’t have protection. They had a maniac walk in and they didn’t have any protection.”

He added: ""If there was an armed guard inside the temple they would have been able to stop him.""

""Maybe there would have been nobody killed except for him, frankly,"" Trump continued. ""Isn't it a shame that you have to think of that inside a temple or inside a church? But certainly, the result would have been far better.""

The president's comments were among the multitude of reactions from leaders on Saturday, as the story continued to develop. Those reactions ranged from solemn expressions of sympathy to angry denunciations of divisive rhetoric and urgent calls for action.

House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said he was ""horrified"" by the shooting, but criticized the president's suggestion to have armed guards in houses of worship.

“The President’s suggestion that Americans need to worship under armed guard is absurd,"" Hoyer said in a statement. ""We must address the ease by which someone can obtain the most dangerous weapons of war and use them to commit mass violence in this country.”

The president added that “the world is a violent world.”

“You think when you’re over it, it just goes away,” Trump said. “But then it comes back in the form of a madman—a whacko.”

Trump added that prior to taking office he “watched instances like this,” calling it a “shame.”

“But it’s even tougher when you’re the president of the United States,” Trump said. “You have to watch this kind of a thing happen, and it’s so sad to see.”

Trump tweeted earlier Saturday morning, saying the events in Pittsburgh were ""far more devastating than originally thought,"" adding that he ""spoke with Mayor and Governor to inform them that the Federal Government has been, and will be, with them all the way.""

The president's daughter, Ivanka Trump, who converted to the Orthodox Jewish faith with her husband Jared Kushner, condemned the events.

""America is stronger than the acts of a depraved bigot and anti-semite. All good Americans stand with the Jewish people to oppose acts of terror & share the horror, disgust & outrage over the massacre in Pittsburgh. We must unite against hatred & evil. God bless those affected,"" Ivanka Trump tweeted.

Vice President Pence also tweeted, ""praying for the fallen,"" while counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway, called the event ""horrifying.""

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders also reacted, saying she is ""Saddened and appalled by the cowardly act of evil committed at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We stand in total solidarity with the victims and all of the Jewish community against bigotry and hate.""

First lady Melania Trump also tweeted, saying that ""the violence needs to stop.""

""My heart breaks over the news out of #Pittsburgh. The violence needs to stop. May God bless, guide & unite the United States of America.""

Also issuing a strongly worded condemnation of the shooting Saturday afternoon was House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who, like so many others, voiced disgust and dismay over the bloodshed and racist overtones.

""This morning, a solemn celebration of life and faith turned to horror and chaos. We are deeply devastated by this tragedy, the roots of which appear to be especially repulsive,"" Ryan said in his statement. ""The sickening reality is that anti-Semitism in America continues to rear its ugly head. It is an ideology of hate that must be eradicated wherever it may surface. This is a time to mourn and heal, but also to reaffirm that we will not tolerate this bigotry.""

Others, like U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., chided politicians for feeding divisions in society with their rhetoric.

""We cannot continue down this path -- something must change,” his statement read. “Certainly, our loose gun laws are to blame, but we are also dealing with a much more insidious problem. Access to online cesspools of racial and religious hatred comes too easily today, and too often, political leaders are trading in the kind divisive rhetoric that caused people to fear those that look, or worship differently than them, and then act on those fears.”"
467,https://www.foxnews.com/world/far-right-congressman-wins-brazils-presidency,2,"Brazil’s Supreme Electoral Tribunal declared Sunday that anti-establishment congressman Jair Bolsonaro, a champion of traditional Brazilian values, has won the country's election for the presidency of Latin America’s biggest country and the world’s fourth-largest democracy.

Bolsonaro, who cast himself as a political outsider despite a 27-year career in Congress, is the latest of several leaders around the globe to gain prominence by mixing tough, often violent talk with right-wing positions. But he also is very much a product of a political tempest in Brazil that made his messages less marginalized: widespread anger at the political class amid years of corruption, an economy that has struggled to recover after a punishing recession and a surge in violence. The name of his party, PSL, translates to ""Social Liberal Party,"" although it largely abandoned its socially liberal platforms after he joined.

Bolstering his rebel image is his reputation for offensive statements and sometimes extreme views, including insulting women, black people and the LGBT community.

“I’m afraid to go out at night when it gets dark,” said Raquel Nunes, 27, a secretary from Sao Paulo and an avid Bolsonaro supporter, as The Wall Street Journal reported. “But he’s going to solve this, he’s going to be firm, talking didn’t get us anywhere so we need to respond with force.”

In a highly unusual moment, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Jose Dias Toffoli, read out part of the Constitution to reporters after he voted.

“The future president must respect institutions, must respect democracy, the rule of law, the judiciary branch, the national Congress and the legislative branch,” Toffoli said in remarks many took to be a rebuke of Bolsonaro and his more extreme positions.

With 96 percent of ballots counted, Bolsonaro had 55.5 percent of the votes. Leftist Fernando Haddad of the Workers’ Party had 44.5 percent.

MIGRANT CARAVAN STOPS IN MEXICO

“We have everything we need to become a great nation,” Bolsonaro said Sunday night in a video broadcast on his Facebook account shortly after he won, as The New York Times noted. “Together we will change the destiny of Brazil.”

Voters in Sunday’s runoff election apparently looked past warnings that the brash former army captain could erode democracy, and embraced a chance for radical change after years of turmoil.

“I feel in my heart that things will change,” said Sandra Coccato, a 68-year-old small business owner, after she voted for Bolsonaro in Sao Paulo. “Lots of bad people are leaving, and lots of new, good people are entering. There’s a light at the end of the tunnel.”

Bolsonaro’s campaign first gained traction with his promises to go after violent crime in a country that leads the world in homicides and where many Brazilians live in daily fear of muggings or burglaries. However, his vows to loosen gun laws and give police a freer hand to use force against suspects also have raised concerns that a Bolsonaro presidency could lead to a bloody crackdown and an erosion of civil rights.

The campaign gained momentum by winning over much of the business community with promises of enacting market-friendly reforms that would reduce the size of the Brazilian state, including cutting ministries and privatizing state companies.

His divisive politics have heightened disharmony between Brazilians.

In Rio de Janeiro, his supporters set off fireworks on iconic Copacabana Beach. In Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, cars horns could be heard honking and crowds celebrated as the results came in. In that same city, crowds gathered on a central avenue with banners and flags and people cheered and set off firecrackers in other neighborhoods as results came in.

MATTIS: U.S. MILITARY DEPLOYING RESOURCES TO MEXICO BORDER

Riot police separated supporters of Bolsonaro and those of his leftist rival Haddad when they briefly scuffled in Sao Paulo.

Bolsonaro went into the election the clear front-runner after getting 46 percent of the votes to Haddad’s 29 percent in the first round of the election Oct. 7.

After opinion polls in recent weeks had Bolsonaro leading by as much as 18 percentage points, the race had tightened in recent days. But Haddad was unable to make up the difference.

“I’m not crazy about Bolsonaro. But he is our way to keep the Workers’ Party out of office,” said Rafaela Rosa, a 32-year-old teacher, after voting Sunday in Sao Paulo. “We have had enough corruption and now we need to clean up.”

468,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cage-free-eggs-on-the-midterm-ballot-for-californians,2,"Ken Klippen lives in Philadelphia, but he's trying to save egg farmers in the Midwest from a ballot measure in California.

As the president of the National Association of Egg Farmers, Klippen says that Proposition 12 on the ballot in California this November, will cause ""some major changes in the way eggs are produced.""

The measure, which Klippen calls ""precedent setting,"" is titled the Farm Animal Confinement Initiative. It would ban the sale of eggs in California that come from hens raised in small cages. It would do the same for pigs and calves.

That means most farmers who sell their produce in the state of California will either have to change their farming practices or lose one of the biggest markets in the country. The Association of California Egg Farmers and National Pork Producers Council both oppose the measure.

Fox News spoke with a third-generation egg farmer, Chris Nichols of Chino Valley Ranchers, who also opposes Prop 12.

""I would say the people who do suffer in the end are the consumer,"" Nichols explained, ""because your price is going up.""

Cage-free eggs can cost as much as twice as regular eggs. Some worry that this measure will take away consumer choice, if it passes.

Josh Balk of the Humane Society of the United States, the group that supports the proposition, disagrees. Balk said that ""everyone from Walmart to McDonald's to Safeway to Denny's to IHOP are all switching to cage-free eggs.""

Klippen said that although the Humane Society pretends to be a shelter organization, it is simply pushing a secret national agenda: getting people to stop eating meat altogether.

""Not only meat,"" Klippen added, ""but stop [drinking] milk and stop eating eggs. So, meat, milk and eggs, that's their agenda.""

469,https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkish-prosecutor-says-saudi-writer-strangled-dismembered,2,"Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was strangled as soon as he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul as part of a premeditated killing, and his body was dismembered before being disposed of, a top Turkish prosecutor said Wednesday.

A statement from chief Istanbul prosecutor Irfan Fidan's office also said that discussions with Saudi chief prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb have yielded no ""concrete results"" despite ""good-willed efforts"" by Turkey to uncover the truth.

The statement is the first public confirmation by a Turkish official that Khashoggi was strangled and dismembered after he entered the Saudi Consulate on Oct. 2 to collect paperwork needed to marry his Turkish fiancee.

The announcement came as Saudi Arabia's chief prosecutor, Saud al-Mojeb, ended a three-day visit to Istanbul during which he held talks with Fidan and other Turkish officials.

Turkey is seeking the extradition of 18 Saudi suspects detained in Saudi Arabia over the killing of Khashoggi. It is also pressing Saudi Arabia for information concerning Khashoggi's remains, which still haven't been found, as well as who ordered the journalist's slaying. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has also called on Riyadh to disclose the identity of an alleged local collaborator said to have been involved in disposing of Khashoggi's body.

Khashoggi, a 59-year-old columnist for The Washington Post, vanished after entering the consulate in Istanbul to pick up paperwork for his upcoming marriage to his fiancee, who was waiting for him outside. A critic of the Saudi royal family, Khashoggi had been living in exile in the United States.

Turkey alleges a Saudi hit squad from Saudi Arabia — including a member of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's entourage during a trip to the United States— traveled to Istanbul to kill the journalist and then tried to cover it up.

Under mounting pressure, Saudi Arabia changed its narrative about Khashoggi's killing several times, eventually admitting that Khashoggi died inside the consulate and only recently acknowledging that Turkish evidence shows his killing was premeditated.

Saudi Arabia has not commented on the prosecutor's visit.

470,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-misses-first-oral-argument-in-supreme-court-tenure,2,"Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is missing oral arguments on Monday for the first time since she joined the court in 1993, as she recuperates from a recent cancer surgery.

A Supreme Court spokesperson told Fox News that Ginsburg, who underwent lung surgery in New York City last month to remove cancerous growths, is continuing to recuperate from the surgery.

The spokesperson said that Ginsburg would participate in the consideration of the cases through written briefs and transcripts, but there has yet to be a date decided for when she will return to the bench.

Ginsburg, 85, last month underwent a pulmonary lobectomy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center after two nodules in the lower lobe of her left lung were discovered, the Supreme Court said in a statement. The discovery came incidentally during tests after she fractured several ribs during a fall in November.

The news release said both nodules removed during surgery were found to be malignant, but scans performed before surgery indicated no evidence of disease elsewhere in the body. No further treatment was planned.

After sustaining a fall in November, Ginsburg initially missed a non-argument session when justices took the bench for routine business.

Ginsburg has dealt with a series of health concerns in recent years. She broke two ribs in 2012, and previously battled two bouts of cancer, in 1999 and 2009. She also had a stent implanted in her heart to open a blocked artery in 2014.

The Harvard Law School-educated justice was nominated to the Supreme Court by former President Bill Clinton in 1993 to replace retiring Justice Byron R. White. Ginsburg was Clinton’s first Supreme Court pick.

Prior to ascending to the Supreme Court, Ginsburg became the first woman to receive tenure at Columbia University Law School and is also the co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Women’s Rights Project.

Ginsburg is the oldest member on the Supreme Court, and her retirement has been a topic of great speculation. However, she reportedly hired clerks for the term that extends into 2020, indicating she has no plans to leave soon.

Bill Haslam granted clemency Monday to Cyntoia Brown, an alleged sex traffic victim who was sentenced to life in prison when she was 16 after killing a man and whose case was championed by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian West, Rihanna and LeBron James.

Haslam commuted her life sentence and Brown will be released to parole supervision on Aug. 7, he said in a statement. Brown had served 15 years in prison before the governor’s decision.

“Cyntoia Brown committed, by her own admission, a horrific crime at the age of 16,” Haslam said. “Yet, imposing a life sentence on a juvenile that would require her to serve at least 51 years before even being eligible for parole consideration is too harsh, especially in light of the extraordinary steps Ms. Brown has taken to rebuild her life.”

Brown will be subjected to certain restrictions upon her release, according to The Tennessean. Brown must report to counseling sessions and will need to complete 50 hours of community service. Brown will also be required to work with at-risk youth and be required to get a job.

Brown thanked Haslam in a statement through her lawyers for his “act of mercy in giving me a second chance.”

“With God's help, I am committed to live the rest of my life helping others, especially young people. My hope is to help other young girls avoid ending up where I have been,” Brown’s statement read.

Brown’s case resurfaced late last year after several celebrities called on authorities to release her from prison. Rihanna, Kardashian West and James were among Brown’s supporters.

“The system has failed. It’s heartbreaking to see a young girl sex trafficked then when she has the courage to fight back is jailed for life!” Kardashian said in a November 2017 tweet. “We have to do better & do what’s right. I’ve called my attorneys yesterday to see what can be done to fix this.”

Brown, now 30, was convicted of first-degree murder in 2006, for killing 43-year-old Johnny Allen. Brown said at the time she was forced into prostitution and was scared for her life before she shot and killed Allen. At the time, prosecutors said Brown killed Allen to rob him.

She was tried as an adult in 2006 and convicted of first-degree murder. Since she’s been in prison, Brown has earned her associates degree from Lipscomb University, WZTV-TV reported. She is also working on a bachelor's degree, according to the news station.

The showdown between President Trump and Democrats, which began Dec. 22 over funding for Trump’s proposed border wall, has led to employee furloughs and some having to work without pay.

As some 800,000 federal workers received blank pay statements Friday, Congress voted to guarantee them back pay whenever the shutdown is resolved -- and then lawmakers adjourned for the weekend.

SHUTDOWN FALLOUT INTENSIFIES AS FEDERAL WORKERS MISS FIRST PAYCHECKS

The missing paychecks have put pressure on lawmakers and Trump to end the impasse. Some workers posted photos of empty pay stubs on Twitter and vented their frustration.

“I saw the zeros in my pay stub today, and it’s a combination of reality setting in and just sadness,” air traffic controller Josh Maria told the Associated Press.

Trump has floated the possibility of declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress to fund the wall but has walked back his stance in recent days. The White House has also explored diverting money for border wall construction from other accounts, including some of the $13.9 billion allocated to the Army Corps of Engineers.

REP. BIGGS: TRUMP SHOULD STAND FIRM TO FIGHT FOR THE BORDER WALL

""What we're not looking to do right now is national emergency,"" Trump said. He insisted that he had the authority to do that, adding that he's ""not going to do it so fast"" because he'd still prefer to work a deal with Congress.

That has led to an outcry from officials in Puerto Rico and some states recovering from natural disasters.

“It’s going to p--- off a lot of members,” Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, told the Wall Street Journal.

Some Republicans are pushing for Trump to declare a national emergency.

“Mr. President, Declare a national emergency NOW,” U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said on Twitter on Friday. “Build a wall NOW.”

473,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-rejects-report-he-hid-key-details-of-conversations-with-putin-i-dont-care,2,"President Trump on Saturday night strongly denied a report that he had taken unusual steps to hide the details of his private conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July 2017 in Hamburg, Germany, telling Fox News in an exclusive interview that he had followed typical protocols in the wake of other high-profile leaks of his sensitive communications with foreign leaders.

Trump's version of events about the meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit was seemingly backed up by former Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, whom Trump fired in March and who has, on occasion, publicly criticized the president.

Citing ""current and former U.S. officials,"" The Washington Post reported that the president told interpreters not to discuss the substance of his talks with Putin and, at one point, seized an interpreter's notes. One interpreter, according to the Post, told officials that Trump had told Putin he believed his explanation that Russia had not improperly meddled in the 2016 presidential election -- contradicting Tillerson's contemporaneous statements at a press conference.

Tillerson, who has publicly and colorfully sparred with the president in recent weeks, told The Post for its article that he ""was present for the entirety of the two presidents’ official bilateral meeting in Hamburg."" Tillerson, despite his open criticisms of Trump in December as someone who became ""frustrated"" easily and who frequently needed to be reminded of the law, did not ""respond"" to The Post's allegations when the paper presented the claims to him.

TRUMP WARNS NATIONAL EMERGENCY WILL BE DECLARED IF DEMS 'DON'T COME TO THEIR SENSES'

“I would. I don’t care,"" Trump told ""Justice with Judge Jeanine"" host Jeanine Pirro, referring to disclosing details of his talks with Putin . ""I had a conversation like every president does. You sit with the president of various countries. I do it with all countries. We had a great conversation. We were talking about Israel and securing Israel, and lots of other things. It was a great conversation. I'm not keeping anything under wraps. I couldn't care less.""

The White House also sharply pushed back on The Post's reporting.

""The Washington Post story is so outrageously inaccurate it doesn’t even warrant a response,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Sunday. ""The liberal media has wasted two years trying to manufacture a fake collusion scandal instead of reporting the fact that unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia.”

Trump has described Tillerson as ""dumb as a rock,"" writing on Twitter that he was also ""lazy as hell"" and claiming he couldn't ""get rid of him fast enough."" The Post did not explain why Tillerson had refused to respond to its reporting that Trump's version of events conflicted with what he had personally witnessed. Tillerson, 66, has said there is “no question” Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and said Russia seeks to “undermine our confidence and undermine the world’s confidence in us.

""The president pressed Putin, on multiple occasions -- Putin denied involvement, as I believe he has done in the past,"" Tillerson said in an off-camera briefing with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin immediately following Trump's talks with Putin at the G-20 summit in Hamburg. “The two agreed this was a substantial hindrance to the ability to move the Russian, U.S. relationship forward,” Tillerson said, adding that the Syria conflict had been the primary point of discussion following a ""robust"" talk about Russia's involvement in purported election meddling.

Leaks have roiled the Trump administration since it took office, and the president's talks with foreign leaders and dignitaries have regularly found thier way to print. Trump was reportedly furious when The Post published complete, leaked transcripts of his private conversations with the leaders of Australia and Mexico in August 2017. Even the Post's own Jennifer Rubin called the brazen high-level leaks ""frightening,"" noting that ""it's shocking to see presidential conversations released in this way.""

In May 2017, shortly before Trump's meeting with Putin in Hamburg, The Post, again citing ""current and former U.S. officials,"" reported that the president had disclosed ""highly classified"" information to the Russian ambassador and foreign minister during an Oval Office meeting that month.

The secretive information, which Trump had the legal authority to declassify as president, concerned a plan by ISIS terrorists that was reportedly unearthed by a U.S. intelligence asset overseas. Trump, according to The Post, disclosed the location of the city in which the asset discovered the plot, potentially endangering the source of the information.

""The security and integrity of the technology systems at the White House is a top priority for the Trump administration and therefore starting next week the use of all personal devices for both guests and staff will no longer be allowed in the West Wing,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement at the time.

“Staff will be able to conduct business on their government-issued devices and continue working hard on behalf of the American people,"" she added.

Trump, speaking to Pirro on Saturday, asserted that political bias underlied the recent reporting about his conversations with Putin. He also unloaded in personal terms on The Washington Post and its owner, Amazon founder and billionaire Jeff Bezos, who recently announced he will divorce his wife.

""It's so ridiculous. These people make it up. The Washington Post -- that's basically the lobbyist for Amazon. You know, Bezos has bigger problems than anyone right now. ... The Washington Post is almost as bad, and probably as bad, as The New York Times.""

Trump further derided a New York Times piece describing the FBI's decision to investigate whether he was working on behalf of Russia as the ""most insulting article"" ever written about him. The FBI reportedly opened the probe after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.

“I think it’s the most insulting thing I have ever been asked,"" Trump said. ""I think it’s the most insulting article I’ve ever had written, and if you read the article you see that they found absolutely nothing.”"
474,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-ag-nominee-william-barr-to-face-questions-from-several-dems-with-eyes-on-white-house,2,"Several Democratic senators thought to be potential presidential contenders in 2020 -- including Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Amy Klobuchar -- are set to grill William Barr, President Trump's attorney general nominee, during his confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.

Although the 68-year-old nominee is expected to ultimately win confirmation in the Republican-controlled Senate, Tuesday's questioning affords Democrats another major opportunity to send sparks flying and promote their own White House ambitions.

During now-Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearings late last year, Booker compared himself to the Thracian gladiator Spartacus and openly suggested he would be expelled from the Senate for defying a procedural norm, even though no one else raised that possibility. And Harris, in a dramatic made-for-social-media moment, openly suggested Kavanaugh was lying and hiding ties to Trump's inner circle, only to reveal hours later she had no evidence to back up her assertion.

Overseeing Tuesday's hearing will be Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who excoriated Democrats during the Kavanaugh hearings for hiding -- then promoting -- a series of lurid, uncorroborated sexual misconduct allegations against the judge dating back decades.

Graham, who will lead off the hearing with an opening statement before each senator has approximately ten minutes to question Barr, has said he will ask the nominee for his thoughts on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Barr, as head of the Justice Department, would take over from acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker and oversee Mueller's work.

""I’m going to ask him, ‘Do you see any reason to fire Mr. Mueller based on what you know now for cause?’"" Graham told ""Fox News Sunday"" host Chris Wallace. ""‘Do you trust Mr. Mueller to be fair to the President and the country?’ ‘Will you make sure he can finish his job?’ ‘If you get the report, will you be as transparent as possible?’ I’ve asked him those questions, and I’m very comfortable with his answers.""

Barr, who like Kavanaugh is a practicing Catholic, will tell the committee that he believes Mueller should be permitted to conclude his investigation and that he thinks Congress and the public should be able to see the results of Mueller's labor. Those statements, released ahead of the hearing, were aimed at pre-empting some of the most significant questions Barr will face from Democrats.

Separately, Graham sounded a note of caution to the Democrats he chastised during the Kavanaugh hearings.

“I’m going to let it be up to [Democrats],"" Graham told Politico. ""You pick these fights at your own peril. [Barr will] be challenged for sure. Hopefully respectfully.""

In her own statement to the paper, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono -- who has said Kavanaugh did not deserve due process because of his conservative beliefs -- countered: “I hope that Lindsey Graham can be the Lindsey Graham that I worked on immigration reform with, and not the Lindsey Graham who yelled during the Kavanaugh hearing.”

FLASHBACK: HIRONO SAYS KAVANUAGH DOESN'T DESERVE FAIR TREATMENT BECAUSE HE'S A CONSERVATIVE

Barr, like Kavanaugh, will not be attending his first confirmation hearing on Tuesday. He previously served as attorney general from 1991 to 1993, and his confirmation hearings nearly 30 years ago went off largely without incident.

But the stakes are wildly distinct this time around, as Democrats seek assurances that Mueller will be allowed to continue his work. Whitaker has refused to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia probe that he had publicly said was nearing its legal limits. (House Democrats have ordered Whitaker to testify about that decision.)

""I’m keeping an open mind; we had a very constructive meeting this last week,"" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

""I would need a firm commitment that he wouldn’t allow any interference in the Mueller investigation --- that he will allow it to reach its conclusion and he will release his report to the public,"" Coons continued.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who formerly chaired the Judiciary Committee, said Barr's prepared remarks should have already put those concerns to rest.

TODD STARNES: HIRONO, HARRIS ARE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTS

""What more assurance can he give to Democrats?"" Grassley asked Monday evening on Fox News' ""The Story with Martha MacCallum."" He added: ""If that's the big thing that's holding up their support of him, he ought to be able to get through the Senate like he did three times earlier in his career.""

Barr's own comments about the Mueller investigation have attracted scrutiny, including an unsolicited memo he sent the Justice Department last year criticizing the special counsel's inquiry into whether Trump had sought to obstruct justice. Barr has asserted that the memo was narrowly focused on a single theory of obstruction and didn't touch the broader questions surrounding Russian election interference.

In his statement, Barr also called Mueller a friend he's known personally and professionally for 30 years. Barr's oversight is especially significant since Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller and who has overseen his day-to-day work, is expected to step down soon after Barr is confirmed.

The nominee must also convince Republicans he's sufficiently supportive of Trump's tough-on-crime and hardline immigration agenda, although there are no serious concerns he will have difficulty garnering the simple majority of votes necessary to win confirmation. Republicans currently hold 53 of the Senate's 100 seats.

Democrats will almost certainly grill Barr on the expansive view of presidential power he's displayed at the Justice Department and in the years since.

As deputy attorney general, Barr advised then-President George H.W. Bush that he did not need congressional approval to attack Iraq. Earlier, when he led the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, he wrote opinions that allowed the U.S. government to invade Panama and arrest its dictator, Manuel Noriega, as well as to capture suspects without the consent of their host nations.

As attorney general in 1992, he endorsed Bush's pardons of Reagan administration officials in the Iran-Contra scandal.

Barr has discussed those decisions in depth in the past but may be pressed on them again, especially in the context of the Mueller investigation.

In the wake of the bipartisan criminal justice reform legislation that the White House has touted as one of Trump's signature achievements, Barr can also expect questions concerning his past work on criminal justice. During his first stint as attorney general, Barr advocated building more prisons, making penalties more severe and swift and using laws to keep criminals behind bars longer.

Now, Barr will tell lawmakers that he supports the First Step Act, the sweeping criminal justice overhaul. Trump has touted the law as a bipartisan effort to address concerns that too many Americans were imprisoned for nonviolent crimes as a result of the drug war. Barr opposed a 2015 bill that contained many of the same key elements as the First Step Act.

His prepared remarks show Barr will tell lawmakers that he would ""diligently implement"" the First Step Act. The measure ""recognizes the progress we have made over the past three decades,"" he says.

Still, Barr says the Justice Department must ""keep up the pressure"" on chronic, violent criminals. Advocates fear Barr's views have not significantly changed since the early 1990s.

And, as the ongoing partial federal government shutdown over funding for Trump's proposed border wall drags on, immigration policy is also expected to take center stage on Tuesday.

In his prepared remarks, Barr says he'll continue to prioritize immigration enforcement and adds the government must be able to hold and remove people who illegally enter the country.

Barr's comments reflect similar thinking to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who drew heavy criticism from immigration activists for enforcing immigration laws that led to an increase in family separations among illegal immigrants caught crossing the border.

Sessions also used his authority to narrow the scope of possible asylum claims, which he charged were often fraudulent efforts to gain access to the U.S., rather than legitimate attempts to avoid particularized persecution based on protected characteristics like politics or religion.

Barr, based on his prepared remarks, will tell senators that the Justice Department cannot allow people to flout America's legal system by ""crashing in through the back door.""

GINSBURG ABSENCE SHAKES COURT: WHITE HOUSE MAKES PREPARATIONS, COMING WEEKS SEEN AS KEY

The 85-year-old’s absence this week from oral arguments -- her first since joining the bench -- after her surgery in December sparked speculation about a possible departure, and even led to low-key planning by the White House for that scenario.

Sources confirmed to Fox News that the White House has quietly reached out to a small number of GOP lawmakers and conservative legal advocates, reassuring them it would be ready for any court vacancy.

The court has not yet offered a timetable on Ginsburg’s return. Oral arguments resume next week, before the court goes on a month-long recess.

Two doctors contacted by Fox News with experience in performing pulmonary lobectomies said, given her age and procedure, a home recovery of about six-to-eight weeks is common – and they would expect the justice to be ready to resume normal duties next month.

But should she not return for the Feb. 19 public sessions, there will likely be renewed concern for the liberal justice’s future.

476,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gregg-jarrett-an-fbi-that-is-corrupt-and-dishonest-latest-reports-offer-only-more-proof,2,"Dishonesty and corruption are endemic at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The latest proof comes in a New York Times report that the FBI initiated an investigation in May of 2017 into whether President Donald Trump was serving as a covert Russian agent. The accusation itself was ludicrous on its face. But from a legal standpoint, the FBI's probe constituted an egregious abuse of power. The Bureau had no probable cause, no evidence, and no reasonable suspicions. They investigated Trump because they could. They defied the law, ignored or perverted facts, and debased the integrity of a heretofore-respected law enforcement agency.

Why did these rogue officials commit such an outrageous act of malfeasance? In a word, vengeance. Already incensed that Trump had defeated their preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton, they grew furious when the president fired Director James Comey on May 9, 2017. In reaction, they sought retribution. What better way to avenge Comey's firing than to launch a counterintelligence investigation of Trump under the false pretense that he committed treasonous acts for the benefit of the Kremlin and at the direction of President Vladimir Putin. Absent credible proof, information could be manipulated to frame Trump while a compliant media would gobble up the leaks and report the damaging charge. The election results could then be undone when the president was driven from office.

MARK PENN: FBI TRUMP-RUSSIA INVESTIGATION SHOWS DEEP STATE WAS WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT

To readers of my book, ""The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton And Frame Donald Trump,” this comes as no surprise. As detailed therein, Comey and his faithful confederates at the Bureau twisted facts and contorted the law to absolve Clinton of all criminal acts she most certainly committed in the mishandling of her classified emails while Secretary of State.

On the same day Comey exonerated Clinton, his FBI was furtively meeting with the author of the fictitious anti-Trump ""dossier"" funded by Clinton and the Democrats. Although nothing in the phony document was true or ever verified, the FBI used it as a pretext to commence and advance a malicious investigation into whether Trump ""colluded"" with Russia to steal the 2016 presidential election. They also exploited the ""dossier"" as the basis to gain a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, concealing the truth from the intelligence court and deceiving the judges.

Over the next ten months, the FBI failed to corroborate anything in the ""dossier."" Bureau agents uncovered no evidence that Trump had somehow conspired or coordinated with Russia to influence the election. Then came the firing of Comey for just cause. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Comey's direct boss, volunteered to author a memorandum recommending his termination for multiple acts of misconduct and serious violations of Justice Department and FBI rules in the Clinton case. Six former Attorneys General and Deputy Attorneys General from different eras and both political parties endorsed his termination. Comey was canned for reasons that were entirely merited and had nothing whatsoever to do with the Russia probe. The president was constitutionally authorized to take such action, which Comey confirmed in a letter to his colleagues at the FBI.

As I noted in my book, ""Almost immediately, demands for impeachment of President Trump were heard in the corridors of Congress. The liberal media were crazed with excitement over the prospect that the president had obstructed justice in trying to block the Russian investigation. In truth and in law, neither scenarios were remotely rational.""

When the people we entrust to enforce the law become the lawbreakers, they must be held accountable.

Among those who were aggrieved over Comey's firing was his loyal lieutenant, Andrew McCabe, who became Acting FBI Director, as well as bureau lawyer Lisa Page and her paramour, Peter Strzok, a top counterintelligence agent. Page and Strzok were intimately involved in the ""collusion"" investigation and were virulently opposed to the president both politically and personally, as evidence by their numerous anti-Trump text messages.

In the eight-day period after Comey's termination, top officials at the FBI decided to take action. They would originate a counterintelligence investigation of Trump for being a foreign agent of Russia. Critically, they had no evidence or even reasonable suspicion to support their operation. They simply despised Trump and chose to misuse their positions of power in an illegal act of reprisal.

Once again, the FBI needed a pretext.They coalesced around the idea that Comey's firing might constitute obstruction of justice if it was intended to stop or impede the original Russian probe. In other words, the president must surely be a Russian agent if it can be shown that he wanted to halt the Russian probe. According to the New York Times, Trump made two comments that served the FBI's improper purpose. They are worth examining.

First, Trump wrote a letter to Comey thanking him for telling him three times that he was not under investigation. Comey later confirmed that he had, in fact, told the president he was not under investigation. Obviously, Trump wanted the American public to learn that he was not personally being investigated for Russian ""collusion."" Yet, Comey refused to disclose this truth. How this letter can, therefore, be viewed plausibly as obstruction of an investigation is baffling. Trump wanted to promote the truth, not conceal it.

Second, Trump gave an interview to NBC News two days after Comey was dismissed in which he made reference to the Russia investigation. How is this evidence of obstruction? It is not. As I explained in my book, ""A rigorous reading of what Trump said confirms that his intent was not to interfere with or end the Russia investigation, but to place someone who was neutral and competent in charge."" In fact, Trump told NBC that he might want to lengthen the investigation to get to the bottom of any wrongdoing. This is hardly evidence of a corrupt purpose to interfere in an investigation as the law of obstruction demands.

The FBI's illegitimate decision to begin an investigation of Trump as a Russian agent based on an obstruction premise was a false and fabricated excuse. This is shown by the testimony of McCabe who appeared before the Senate Intelligence committee after Comey was fired. He stated, ""There has been no effort to impede our investigation to date."" Days later, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told Congress, ""There never has been...any political interference in any matter under my supervision in the Department of Justice."" Six days before he was fired, Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee that no one had told him to stop something for a political reason. ""It's not happened in my experience,"" he said.

Not only did these key people involved in the Russia case affirm that the president never interfered or obstructed, there was no other evidence that Trump was working for the Russians that would have justified the FBI's punitive decision to launch its investigation. Both Comey and Page testified before House investigators that by the time the director was fired and Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed there was no hard evidence of ""collusion."" The investigation had been running for ten months. Comey admitted, ""In fact, when I was fired as director, I still didn't know whether there was anything to it."" Nevertheless, top officials at the FBI opened their investigation of Trump in May of 2017 without sufficient evidence and in direct violation of FBI and DOJ regulations. They broke the law. And they did it to depose Trump.

The FBI was not alone in its attempt to remove Trump from office. According to another New York Times story, Rosenstein also sought retribution by proposing to secretly record the president in an attempt to gain some damaging information about him. He allegedly suggested that he and others wear hidden devices to record their conversations with Trump and discussed recruiting Cabinet members to remove him under the Constitution's 25th Amendment. Three top FBI officials confirmed various elements of Rosenstein's efforts to mount the equivalent of a palace coup. The Deputy Attorney General has consistently resisted requests by Congress to question him about his actions.

It is now undeniable that critical decisions made by senior FBI leadership were driven by political bias and personal animus, not sustainable facts or credible evidence. These powerful officials could not abide that Donald Trump had emerged, against their wishes, as the duly elected president of the United States. They could not accept that he had unceremoniously shown Comey the door. In an act of rank retaliation, they decided to abuse their positions of power to drive him from office. They invented facts and ignored the law to subvert our system of justice and undermine the democratic process. They compromised essential principles and betrayed the nation's trust. Their conduct was, and is, unconscionable.

When William Barr takes office as our nation's next Attorney General, he must review their actions and present all evidence of wrongdoing to federal prosecutors and, if appropriate, a grand jury. When the people we entrust to enforce the law become the lawbreakers, they must be held accountable. No one is above the law.

477,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-immigration-offer-brings-polarized-reactions-from-dems-and-gop,2,"President Trump’s immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown drew sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike.

In a televised White House address on Saturday afternoon, Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico.

HOYER URGES TRUMP, MCCONNELL TO STOP HOLDING GOVERNMENT HOSTAGE

“Our immigration system should be a source of pride ... not a source of shame as it is all over the world,” Trump said in his plea.

The president’s proposal was met with disdain from an array of top Democratic lawmakers. Many used the same language in their critiques, accusing Trump of holding the government and federal workers ""hostage.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted, “What we didn’t hear from the President was any sympathy for the federal workers who face so much uncertainty because of the chaos of the #TrumpShutdown.”

Before Trump made his announcement, Pelosi had called his anticipated proposal “a non-starter.”

TRUMP OFFERS IMMIGRATION COMPROMISE

“For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.”

For his part, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, called Trump's proposal ""one-sided and ineffective.""

""It's clear the President realizes that by closing the government and hurting so many American workers and their families, he has put himself and the country in an untenable position. Unfortunately, he keeps putting forward one-sided and ineffective remedies. There's only one way out: open the government, Mr. President, and then Democrats and Republicans can have a civil discussion and come up with bipartisan solutions.""

Schumer, D-N.Y., concluded, ""It was the President who single-handedly took away DACA and TPS protections in the first place – offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking.""

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer shared a similar sentiment, urging Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell to ""stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown"" immediately.

“The president must stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown so federal employees can get back to work serving the American people. There is no reason for Americans to be shut out of work and without a paycheck while negotiations take place on the best way to secure our borders,” he said.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Hoyer said negotiation can progress after the government reopens.

“With the government open, we can negotiate an agreement to strengthen border security that both sides can support and that is in the best interests of the American people.”

Another leading Dem, Sen. Kristen Gillibrand of New York, who announced her White House bid on Jan. 15 in an episode of ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" said Trump's offer was a ""bad deal.""

Gillibrand tweeted: ""Trump ordered the end of DACA and TPS. Then he shut down the government. Now he's holding federal workers hostage, saying he'll temporarily give back what he took away -- only if we give him a pointless, ineffective wall he falsely promised Mexico would pay for. This is a bad deal.""

Then there was New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez's response. He bluntly accused Trump of forcing ""a pointless shutdown"" to pay for the border wall.

""This is about more than 800,000 Americans who are being held hostage by a President who has forced a pointless shutdown to pay for an expensive, ineffective wall. This is not about immigration. Dreamers and TPS recipients are not bargaining chips. It's unacceptable that after taking away DACA protections, eliminating the TPS program for thousands of immigrants and creating a humanitarian crisis at the border, President Trump is offering temporary solutions in exchange for a permanent wall.""

The Democratic senator also said ""a legitimate negotiation"" can proceed after the government is reopened.

Fellow Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware slammed McConnell for refusing ""to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats,"" but also called Trump's offer ""a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform.""

""This senseless government shutdown is hurting millions of Americans, and its impacts are only getting worse. The President should re-open the government so that Republicans and Democrats in Congress can work with the White House to find a sensible solution on border security and immigration. I am confident that a reasonable compromise can be reached, but not while President Trump continues to keep significant parts of the government shut down and Leader McConnell refuses to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats,"" he said.

""Some relief for Dreamers and an extension of Temporary Protected Status represent a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform, but more ideas from members of both parties should be taken up and debated. Republicans and Democrats stand ready to work toward a solution, but the fact remains that there is no reason to have large parts of the federal government shut down while we debate appropriate border security and immigration policies.""

Republican lawmakers, at the opposite end of the reaction spectrum, praised the president for his willingness to negotiate.

Senate Majority Leader McConnell, for instance, commended the president ""for taking bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues.""

In his statement, he said; “Compromise in divided government means that everyone can’t get everything they want every time. The president’s proposal reflects that. It strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle.""

“This bill takes a bipartisan approach to re-opening the closed portions of the federal government. It pairs the border security investment that our nation needs with additional immigration measures that both Democrat and Republican members of Congress believe are necessary. Unlike the bills that have come from the House over the past few weeks, this proposal could actually resolve this impasse. It has the full support of the President and could be signed into law to quickly reopen the government.""

Republican Whip Steve Scalise called on Democrats to match Trump's willingness to negotiate.

""The time for political games has long passed. Democrats must put their personal dislike of the president aside, end their obstruction, and finally come to the negotiating table. It's time Democrats do what is right for the functioning and security of our nation and agree to a deal that opens our government, and includes funding for a border wall and other measures to solve this serious immigration crisis at our southern border,"" he said in a statement.

Also on the Republican side, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she was ""hopeful"" for a ""constructive debate"" with Democrats.

“Compromise is not a sign of weakness — it’s a sign of strength, particularly when hundreds of thousands of families are being harmed. The Administration, Senate Republicans, and Democrats must now resolve this stalemate before 800,000 federal workers and their families miss yet another paycheck, and our economy is further damaged,” she said.

Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose views on the president and his policies have fluctuated, said Trump ""put forth a reasonable, good faith proposal that will reopen the government and help secure the border.""

He tweeted, ""I look forward to voting for it and will work to encourage my Republican and Democratic colleagues to do the same.

Earlier, while speaking in Ogden, Utah, Romney said he did not understand Pelosi's position on border security.

""You (Pelosi) and your fellow Democrats have voted for over 600 miles of border fence in the past, why won't you vote for another few miles now? I don't understand their position, I really don't,"" the Republican senator said.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio took a positive view of Trump's proposed deal, like his fellow Republicans. He said Trump made ""a very reasonable offer"" and urged Democrats to work with him.

“The way to end this shutdown is for both sides to make mutual concessions in order to reach an agreement. The president has made a very reasonable offer to extend DACA and TPS protections in exchange for the border security measures he supports. I hope that instead of choosing the road of endless obstruction, Democrats will decide to work with him to reach an agreement and end the shutdown,” he said.

Likewise, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy called the president's immigration offer ""reasonable.""

McCarthy tweeted: ""President Trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government. The moment now turns to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The country is watching.""

478,https://www.foxnews.com/us/kentucky-student-seen-in-viral-confrontation-with-native-american-speaks-out,2,"The Kentucky high school student seen in a viral video standing-face-to-face with a Native American protester at a Washington rally spoke out for the first time Sunday evening, claiming in a statement that he and his classmates were taunted by a group of African-American protesters and saying that he and his family had received death threats.

Nick Sandmann, a junior at Covington Catholic High School, said he was ""mortified that so many people have come to believe something that did not happen -- that students from my school were chanting or acting in a racist fashion toward African Americans or Native Americans. I did not do that, do not have hateful feelings in my heart and did not witness any of my classmates doing that.""

The students initially were accused of mocking a Native American participant in the Indigenous Peoples March, which coincided with the March for Life. A snippet of video from the apparent confrontation quickly gained traction on social media, with many condemning the students -- some of whom were wearing ""Make America Great Again"" apparel -- and some calling for them to be identified and harassed. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Covington and the high school issued a joint statement apologizing to the activist, identified as Nathan Phillips Saturday.

VIDEO SHOWS TENSION BETWEEN NATIVE AMERICANS, HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS BEFORE VIRAL CLIP

However, the emergence of longer video that appears to show some students being harassed prompted some conservatives to take back their earlier criticisms of the students.

Sandmann said he and his classmates had taken part in the March for Life and had arrived at the Lincoln Memorial to meet the buses that would take them back to Kentucky.

However, Sandmann said, the students were confronted by four members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, who ""called us 'racists,' 'bigots,' 'white crackers,' 'f----ts,' and 'incest kids.' They also taunted an African-American student from my school by telling him that we would 'harvest his organs.'""

Sandmann said one of the students asked a teacher chaperoning the trip for permission to ""begin our school spirit chants"" to drown out the hecklers.

In one chant, the group appeared to perform the haka, a traditional Maori dance. Marcus Frejo, a member of the Pawnee and Seminole tribes who witnessed the chant, said he considered it mockery.

""At no time did I hear any student chant anything other than the school spirit chants,"" Sandmann said. ""I did not witness or hear any other students chant 'build that wall' or anything hateful or racist at any time. Assertions to the contrary are simply false.""

At that point, Phillips came toward the group with his drum and, according to Sandmann, ""locked eyes with me and approached me, coming within inches of my face"" and ""played his drum the entire time he was in my face.""

Sandmann said he was trying to defuse the tense situation by remaining ""motionless and calm."" He also denied taunting Phillips by making faces at him, but said he smiled at the protester ""because I wanted him to know I was not going to become angry, intimidated or be provoked into a larger confrontation.""

CATHOLIC DIOCESE, HIGH SCHOOL APOLOGIZES AFTER VIDEO SHOWS STUDENTS IN CONFRONTATION WITH NATIVE AMERICANS

For his part, Phillips told The Associated Press Sunday that he was trying to keep the peace between the students and members of the group who were heckling them. He also insisted that the students were making disparaging remarks about Native Americans.

""They were making remarks to each other ... (such as) 'In my state those Indians are nothing but a bunch of drunks.' How do I report that?"" he said. ""These young people were just roughshodding through our space, like what's been going on for 500 years here — just walking through our territories, feeling like 'this is ours.""

Frejo said he joined Phillips to defuse the tense situation, singing the anthem from the American Indian Movement with both men beating out the tempo on hand drums.

""I am being called every name in the book, including a racist, and I will not stand for this mob-like character assassination of my family's name,"" Sandmann said. "" ... One person threatened to harm me at school and one person claims to live in my neighborhood. My parents are receiving death and professional threats because of the social media mob that has formed over this issue.""

In a curt letter, Trump said her trip has been “postponed.”

“Due to the Shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed. We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the Shutdown is over. In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate,” Trump wrote.

“I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement to end the Shutdown. Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative.”

Asked if lawmakers might still be able to find another way to travel overseas, a senior congressional official told Fox News Thursday evening only, ""I don't know.""

According to sources, the president pulled the plug on Pelosi's aircraft as she was about to leave for her overseas trip. Her congressional delegation's military aircraft was slated to depart at 3 p.m. ET.

A senior White House official also told Fox News that all congressional delegation travel by military aircraft is now postponed.

SHUTDOWN STANDOFF: PELOSI RENEWS CALL TO DELAY STATE OF THE UNION, TRUMP SAYS DEMS 'HIJACKED' BY 'FRINGE'

An official said that “as soon as the president found out about the trip today, he took immediate action.” A source told Fox News that when moving to cancel Thursday's flight, the White House reasoned that the trip would keep Pelosi out of the country beyond next Tuesday night—when the next government pay period would occur.

""If she had gone on this trip she would have guaranteed that 800,000 federal workers would not receive their second paycheck because she would not have been here to negotiate any kind of deal,"" a senior White House official said Thursday.

But Pelosi's office fired back, with spokesman Drew Hammill saying the purpose was to meet with allies and ""express appreciation & thanks to our men & women in uniform for their service & dedication"" -- while noting there was no planned stop in Egypt.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., called the move ""petty"" and ""small.""

""It is unbecoming of the president of the United States. But it is unfortunately a daily occurrence,"" he said.

Republicans had a split response over the president's decision.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said it was ""completely appropriate."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called it ""inappropriate.""

""One sophomoric response does not deserve another. Speaker Pelosi’s threat to cancel the State of the Union is very irresponsible and blatantly political,"" he tweeted.

The president's move to cancel Pelosi's trip came after the House speaker's request to delay his annual State of the Union address -- though one White House official claimed the aircraft decision was not a ""response"" to Pelosi's letter.

The president has been slated to deliver his message to a Joint Session of Congress on Jan. 29, yet Pelosi on Wednesday urged the president to delay his delivery until the government re-opens, or deliver the address in writing.

The speaker stood by that call earlier Thursday.

“The date of the State of the Union is not a sacred date. It’s not constitutionally required. It’s not the president’s birthday. It’s just a date we agreed to,” Pelosi told reporters during a press conference on Capitol Hill Thursday. “That’s why I said to the president, if you don’t open up government, let’s discuss a mutually agreeable date.”

PELOSI TAKES HEAT FOR BID TO DELAY STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS

She added: “It could be a week later—if the government is reopened.”

For more than 24 hours, Trump did not respond to Pelosi's request, even as fellow Republicans condemned her push for delay.

Congressional lawmakers, meanwhile, were left sitting on a bus waiting to see if they could depart. They included House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. Fox News is told Capitol Hill security officials got an emergency call from the Pentagon canceling the overseas trip due to the shutdown.

Amid mounting confusion, Fox News is told there were furious calls going back and forth among Capitol Hill, State, Pentagon and White House offices. The bus later returned to the Capitol, where members filed back into the building.

When asked for additional context about the congressional delegation and the apparent trip delay, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders reiterated that Pelosi could fly commercial: ""The Department of Defense has to approve military air travel. As he made clear in the letter she can still go, she just has to travel commercial.""

The rhetoric continues to show both sides of the standoff refusing to step off their positions that triggered the funding lapse shortly before the holidays last month.

Trump wants nearly $6 billion for a border wall, while Pelosi and fellow Democrats have described such a project as immoral. The two sides have been unable to strike a deal that both bridges their differences and re-opens a slew of shuttered agencies.

The shutdown, which is now the longest in U.S. history, has left more than 800,000 federal workers and contractors without pay. Some federal employees have been deemed essential to government function and are required to work without pay. Others have been furloughed, but still are left unpaid.

480,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-howard-schultz-as-ex-starbucks-ceo-takes-heat-from-both-sides-of-the-aisle,2,"President Trump on Monday fired back at Howard Schultz, saying the former Starbucks CEO doesn’t have the “guts” to run for president after he announced he was mulling a 2020 White House bid as an independent -- and took a few shots at Trump himself.

“Howard Schultz doesn’t have the ‘guts’ to run for President! Watched him on @60Minutes last night and I agree with him that he is not the ‘smartest person.’ Besides, America already has that! I only hope that Starbucks is still paying me their rent in Trump Tower!” Trump tweeted Monday morning.

EX-STARBUCKS CEO HOWARD SCHULTZ 'SERIOUSLY' MULLS PRESIDENTIAL RUN, BASHES TRUMP AS 'NOT QUALIFIED'

The president’s tweet comes after Schultz's interview on CBS News’ “60 Minutes,” where he revealed he was “seriously thinking” about running for president in 2020 as a “centrist independent,” and challenged Trump’s fitness for office.

“We’re living at a most fragile time, not only the fact that this president is not qualified to be the president, but the fact that both parties are consistently not doing what’s necessary on behalf of the American people,” Schultz said, specifically citing the national debt as “a reckless example, not only of Republicans but of Democrats, as well, as a reckless failure of their constitutional responsibility.”

A fiery response from Trump was expected. When told during the interview that Trump would be tweeting about him in response, Schultz said, ""I've become bored with President Trump and his tweets.""

Schultz, though, is taking heat from both sides amid fears from Democrats he could play the role of spoiler, especially considering Schultz described himself as a “lifelong Democrat” yet is now contemplating a run as an independent.

“Howard Shultz running as an independent isn’t about bringing people together,” Tina Podlodowski, the Democratic Party chair in Schultz’s home state of Washington, said in a statement Sunday. “It’s about one person: Howard Schultz.”

Neera Tanden, the president for the liberal Center for American Progress, also blasted Schultz, saying she would boycott Starbucks if he ran.

“Vanity projects that help destroy democracy are disgusting,” she tweeted. “I’m not giving a penny that will end up in the election coffers of a guy who will help Trump win.”

However, some of his views might also clash with a Democratic Party gearing up to unseat Trump. Some potential nominees, including Massachusetts 2020 candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris, have endorsed single-payer health care, heavily taxing the rich or free tuition at public colleges. Schultz has criticized such proposals as unrealistic and instead emphasized expanding the economy and curbing entitlements.

2020 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY GETS CROWDED

""It concerns me that so many voices within the Democratic Party are going so far to the left,"" Schultz told CNBC last June. ""I ask myself, 'How are we going to pay for all these things?' in terms of things like single-payer or people espousing the fact that the government is going to give everyone a job. I don't think that's realistic.""

During his “60 Minutes” interview, Schultz dodged a question about whether his potential independent run would make him a spoiler for the Democratic nominee.

“I wanna see the American people win,” he said. “I wanna see America win. I don’t care if you’re a Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, Republican. Bring me your ideas. And I will be an independent person, who will embrace those ideas. Because I’m not, in any way, in bed with a party.”

No third-party or independent candidate has won over 5 percent of the popular vote since Ross Perot in 1996. But Schultz argued that a majority of the electorate is “exhausted” with politics.

“What we know, factually, is that over 40 percent of the electorate is either a registered Independent or currently affiliates themselves as an Independent,” he said. “Their trust has been broken. And they are looking for a better choice.”

481,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/roger-stone-indicted-on-several-charges-as-part-of-muellers-russia-collusion-probe,2,"Roger Stone, the colorful former longtime political adviser to President Trump, has been indicted on charges of obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's wide-ranging Russia collusion probe.

For months, Stone has warned that he could be indicted, saying in public he believed Mueller was investigating whether he had advance knowledge of WikiLeaks releasing hacked emails of Democrats during the 2016 campaign. Stone has repeatedly denied the accusation.

A spokesman for Mueller’s office said Stone, 66, was arrested in Fort Lauderdale on Friday morning after being indicted by a federal grand jury a day earlier. Video aired by CNN shows numerous FBI agents with guns banging on Stone’s door and demanding that he come outside -- something the president decried in a tweet.

""Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country! NO COLLUSION! Border Coyotes, Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better,"" Trump tweeted. ""Who alerted CNN to be there?""

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Friday, ""This doesn't have anything to do with the president. It doesn't have anything to do with the White House.""

And Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow said, ""The indictment today does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else. Rather, the indictment focuses on alleged false statements Mr. Stone made to Congress.”

Stone, a self-described political dirty trickster who famously has a tattoo of Richard Nixon on his back, will make an initial appearance later Friday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Lurana S. Snow at the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale.

The 24-page indictment alleges that Stone worked to obstruct the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election by making false statements to the committee, denying he had records sought by the committee and persuading a witness to provide false testimony.

DEFIANT ROGER STONE VOWS TO NEVER TESTIFY AGAINST TRUMP: 'WHERE IS THE CRIME? I ENGAGED IN POLITICS'

The indictment does not charge Stone with conspiring with WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy website that published the emails, or with the Russian officers Mueller says hacked them. Instead, it accuses him of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements about his interactions related to WikiLeaks' release.

The indictment says Stone spoke to Trump campaign officials during the summer of 2016 about WikiLeaks and information the organization had that might be damaging to the Clinton campaign. It also says Stone was contacted by “senior Trump campaign officials” to inquire about future WikiLeaks releases of hacked Democratic emails.

During an appearance Wednesday night on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” Stone insisted he would not turn on the president and cooperate with prosecutors, like former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.

“No matter how much pressure they put on me, no matter what they say I will not bear false witness against Donald Trump,” Stone said. “I will not do what Michael Cohen has done and make up lies to ease the pressure on myself.”

In a tweet Friday, former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, whose emails were hacked, wrote that it was now ""Roger's time in the barrel."" That was a play on Stone's own words. Stone had tweeted cryptically before the Podesta emails were disclosed that it would soon be Podesta's ""time in the barrel.""

Stone served as an adviser to Trump for years before he ran for president. He left Trump’s campaign in August 2015, but maintained regular contact with and publicly supported the Trump campaign through the 2016 election.

Mueller’s investigation, which was initially ordered to look into the 2016 election, has gone on for more than a year and half. It has expanded to probe financial crimes of Trump associates before the election, conversations Trump’s national security adviser had with the Russians during the transition and whether Trump obstructed justice with his comments and actions related to the probe.

WHO'S BEEN CHARGED BY MUELLER IN THE RUSSIA PROBE SO FAR?

Twenty six Russian nationals and three Russian companies have been charged with interfering in the 2016 presidential election. But none of the Trump associates connected to Trump have been charged with crimes related to collusion.

Other convictions include: former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who both pleaded guilty to making false statements in 2017. Former campaign adviser Rick Gates in 2018 pleaded guilty and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted and later pleaded guilty in a separate financial crimes case dating back before the 2016 election.

Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements in a case brought by Mueller in November. Alex van der Zwaan, a London-based lawyer, pleaded guilty to making false statements this year, and Richard Pinedo, a California man, pleaded guilty to identity fraud in 2018.

On the roster: Harris fumbles on health insurance - Dems embrace left wing for Trump rebuttal - Dems delay vote on attorney general - Biden’s non-campaign rolls on - Pittsburgh vs. All yinz



HARRIS FUMBLES ON HEALTH INSURANCE

Imagine if the Los Angeles Rams had to play the Super Bowl against the Patriots and the NFC Championship against the Saints at the same time.



That’s what running for president is like. We think of the primaries and the general election as two different games, but the truth is that whomever Democrats nominate is already auditioning for the general electorate – including loosely attached Democrats, independents and even some Republicans.



As Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., is finding out today, the demands of the two games are often quite contradictory. Her glib, facile answer to a serious question about health insurance is the political equivalent to a fumble on her own ten-yard line.



Being the frontrunner isn’t all puff pieces and pep rallies.



In an interview with CNN, Harris was asked about the downstream consequences of her proposal to make Medicare, the entitlement program which provides health insurance for Americans age 65 and older, available to every citizen, regardless of age.



The proposal is the key policy of one of her rivals, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and has become a litmus test for liberal activists assessing the 2020 Democratic contenders. It would also blow the bottom out of the private, employer-based health insurance which provides coverage for about half of all Americans.



Employers generally hate having to be in the insurance business and many, especially those with large workforces, would be delighted to be able to shunt that responsibility over to Medicare. They chip in for extra coverage or otherwise defray costs and get to kiss goodbye one of the biggest hassles for companies in labor-intensive businesses. That reduced pool of customers would make insurance more expensive for those that remain in the private sector, which would cause more employers to follow suit, and so on and so on.



Proponents and opponents of the proposal agree on where the road would end: the demolition of the system as it has mostly existed since the 1960s. They disagree about how quickly or chaotically that would happen and certainly are at odds about whether that is good or needful, but agree that it would begin the end of health insurance as we know it.



Asked about this consequence, Harris was dismissive to the point of blitheness.



“The idea is that everyone gets access to medical care and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through all the paperwork, all of the delay that may require,” Harris said. “Who of all us have not had that situation where you have to wait for approval and the doctor says, ‘I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this.’”

“Let’s eliminate all of that,” she added. “Let’s move on.”



Now, we want to be generous of spirit here and assume that Harris was blowing off another part of the question and entirely ignoring the downstream consequences. The elimination of the insurance that covers something like 160 million people isn’t something even the most oblivious politician would do.



But that phrase “let’s eliminate all of that” will now be stuck to her until she comes to the end of the trail. John “I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it” Kerry knows what we’re talking about.



As the excellent and useful polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows, Democrats enjoy a substantial advantage on the question of health insurance and health care. That’s traditionally a better issue for the Blue Team and the Republicans’ 2017 ObamaCare debacle erased the considerable damage that the original passage and enacting of the law did to the Democratic brand.



Buuuuuuttttt…



Here’s Kaiser: “Net favorability towards a national Medicare-for-all plan (measured as the share in favor minus the share opposed) … ranges as high as +45 percentage points… Yet, on the other side of the debate, net favorability drops as low as -44 percentage points when people hear the argument that this would lead to delays in some people getting some medical tests and treatments. Net favorability is also negative if people hear it would threaten the current Medicare program (-28 percentage points), require most Americans to pay more in taxes (-23 percentage points), or eliminate private health insurance companies (-21 percentage points).”



Everybody wants a unicorn. Nobody wants to have to clean all that glittery manure out of the stall.



Republicans know this and will absolutely hammer Harris or any Democrat on the subject. The scaremongering around ObamaCare will look like kids’ stuff compared to what is said about the big government health insurance program backed by a self-described socialist Senator from Vermont. It’s a fact.



Harris and other Democrats have glommed on to Sanders’ plan as a bumper-sticker solution. And given the fact that the number of uninsured Americans is climbing and voters are increasingly anxious about the situation, Democrats certainly are right to want something the sounds generous, simple and direct.



But as Barack Obama learned and then Donald Trump said, “Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.” Lolz.



Voters don’t like surprises and deeply mistrust any change that involves their policies or care. Democrats loved being able to run in 2018 on “saving ObamaCare” or “protecting your insurance.” It will be less fun to say exactly what they want to do.



And that goes double with a plan that involves millions of Americans potentially being dumped into government-run health insurance and new pressures it will apply on doctors who already dislike the complexity and measly rates of Medicare.



It tells us a lot about how Harris’ background in California politics is insufficient preparation for the national version. But it also tells us even more about the dangers ahead for Democrats as Sanders to continue to exact his revenge on the party that passed him over in 2016. If he succeeds in sticking his party with this one, Democrats will kiss off millions of votes from the very group they need so much: Suburban, middle and upper-middle class moms who are very skeptical about Trump.



The lesson of ObamaCare is that American voters are compassionate and want to make sure everyone has access to care. But the moment that plan affects those who already have coverage, it gets chilly out there real quick.



THE RULEBOOK: CHA-CHING

“When the demand is equal to the quantity of goods at market, the consumer generally pays the duty; but when the markets happen to be overstocked, a great proportion falls upon the merchant, and sometimes not only exhausts his profits, but breaks in upon his capital. I am apt to think that a division of the duty, between the seller and the buyer, more often happens than is commonly imagined.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 35



TIME OUT: SHOOTING HOOPS TO MOVIE SHOOTS

Variety: “NBA Star Kyrie Irving will star in and executive produce a currently untitled horror movie with Imagine Entertainment about an Oklahoma hotel that has a reputation of being haunted. Imagine Entertainment has preemptively optioned an upcoming Players’ Tribune article, an oral history of experiences from NBA stars who have stayed at the Skirvin Hotel in Oklahoma City. The hotel is frequented by traveling NBA teams, but some players refuse to stay there because of its reputation. The hotel was opened in 1911 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. … The project is being developed as a horror film blending scares, satire, wit and social commentary inspired by the folklore of the Skirvin Hotel. The hauntings are believed to have started in the 1930s when the hotel’s owner had an affair with a chambermaid which led to her tragic demise.”

Average approval: 41 percent

Average disapproval: 55.2 percent

Net Score: -14.2 points

Change from one week ago: up 1.6 points

[Average includes: Quinnipiac University: 38% approve - 57% disapprove; Monmouth University: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; ABC News/WaPo: 38% approve - 58% disapprove; Fox News: 43% approve - 54% disapprove.]

DEMS EMBRACE LEFT WING FOR TRUMP REBUTTAL

WaPo: “Democrats have tapped Georgia’s Stacey Abrams to deliver the response to President Trump’s State of the Union address, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced Tuesday. Abrams narrowly lost the state’s race for governor in November after a lengthy dispute over blocked votes. She will address the nation in a prime-time speech shortly after Trump finishes his address to a joint session of Congress next Tuesday night. ‘She is just a great spokesperson. She’s an incredible leader. She has led the charge for voting rights, which is at the root of just about everything else. … I’m very excited that she’s agreed to be the respondent to the president,’ Schumer told reporters. Abrams’s political future is the source of much speculation. Earlier this month, she met in Washington with Schumer, who is seeking candidates to run against Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) in 2020.”



Republicans may block Trump from another shutdown - Politico: “Senate Republicans can’t stomach another shutdown. After weathering 35 days of a partial government closure, the Senate GOP is dreading the possibility another one will hit in less than three weeks — a sentiment that could prevent President Donald Trump from closing the government again. … Most GOP lawmakers dutifully stuck with Trump in public as the partial government shutdown dragged on. But privately, Republican support began to crack as their polling and the economy both suffered. After a half-dozen GOP senators defected last week, Trump dropped his demands for border wall money before a full-scale revolt unfolded. … But while White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that Trump ‘doesn’t want to go through another shutdown,’ she declined to rule it out if Congress doesn’t come up with a border security plan to Trump’s liking. Neither did House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a close Trump confidant.”



Perdue says Trump wants ‘simple’ border wall deal - WaPo: “Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who lunched privately with the president Sunday at the White House, also indicated that Trump is prepared to act on his own should a new committee on Capitol Hill struggle to come up with an agreement on the wall that satisfies him. Trump is mulling the prospect of issuing a national emergency declaration to start wall construction without congressional approval — a move that will almost certainly face an immediate challenge in the courts. ‘He wants as simple of a solution as we can get,’ Perdue said in an interview Monday. While the president would like a more sweeping immigration package at some point, Perdue said Trump acknowledges ‘that’s just not realistic in three weeks.’”



Pergram: ‘Why Democrats are unlikely to budge on next round of border security negotiations’ - Fox News: “Does anyone really think we won’t be back here in three weeks, trying to avert another crisis and fund the government? … If the president agreed to re-open the government after achieving nothing and Republicans started taking the blame, why does the president think the matrix changes in mid-February? Democrats gave nothing. They have very little to lose in the next round. … The key to the three-week window is a conference committee, a blend of bipartisan House and Senate negotiators, charged with forging a border security agreement before Feb. 15. Otherwise, we might be right back where we were. … There’s a reason the government shut down in the fall of 1995 during an epic standoff between President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich re-opened later, and then shut down again. The sides thought they were on a track to resolve their issues. But they weren’t.”



DEMS DELAY VOTE ON ATTORNEY GENERAL

WaPo: “A planned Senate Judiciary Committee vote on William P. Barr’s nomination to serve as attorney general has been delayed for a week, as Democrats continue to raise concerns about whether he would allow special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to finish his probe and publicize the results unimpeded. The delay … is the latest reflection of the deep partisan tension surrounding Barr’s nomination, most of which centers on Democrats’ desire to protect Mueller’s probe from being unduly constrained. The committee postponed its vote on Barr as one of 46 nominations the panel was scheduled to vote on Tuesday but decided to delay until its next meeting. In both his public testimony and his written answers to senators’ questions, Barr has repeatedly refused to give senators any firm guarantee that he will release Mueller’s report to Congress and the public free of redactions.”



Whittaker: Mueller report ‘close to being completed’ - WaPo: “The head of the Justice Department said Monday that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia investigation is nearing an end, the first official acknowledgment that the probe ensnaring President Trump may soon reach a conclusion. Acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker made the comment during a news conference to announce indictments against a Chinese technology firm. Asked about his view of the Mueller probe in light of critical comments he made while working as a television pundit in 2017, Whitaker said those statements were offered while he was a private citizen. ‘I have been fully briefed on the investigation and I look forward to Director Mueller delivering the final report,’ Whitaker said. ‘I am comfortable that the decisions that were made are going to be reviewed. . . . Right now, you know, the investigation is, I think, close to being completed.’”



Dems get antsier waiting for end date of Mueller probe - Politico: “Before taking power, House Democrats vowed to give special counsel Robert Mueller the space needed to finish his work. Just four weeks in, however, sticking to that pledge is proving difficult. The possible clashes will be on display Tuesday morning when the new House Democratic Caucus meets for the first time to discuss Mueller’s investigation into President Donald Trump’s ties to Russia, a probe with no clear end in sight and ever-expanding subplots. For Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her committee chairs, the uncertainty surrounding the special counsel’s work presents a major challenge for keeping their liberal, rabble-rousing members in check… For now, the Democrats say they are proceeding on two tracks: Letting Mueller pursue criminal charges like the ones unsealed Friday against longtime Trump associate Roger Stone; while lawmakers get to work examining whether anything the president has done rises to ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’ definition for impeachment.”



BIDEN’S NON-CAMPAIGN ROLLS ON

Politico: “Joe Biden brought his not-yet-a-campaign campaign to Florida’s biggest liberal bastion on Tuesday and said he’s ‘a lot closer’ to deciding to run for president in 2020 and plans to make ‘the decision soon.’ Biden made his remarks about his future plans during a question-and-answer portion of an event billed as ‘An Evening with Vice President Joe Biden’ at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts, which had so many people in attendance that Biden said even his daughter wondered about 2020. … Tuesday’s event, one in a string of public appearances by Biden, had all the rhetorical trappings of a campaign speech for a Democratic candidate. He made sure to play up his civil rights bona fides, recounting stories of how he opposed segregation as a kid and then a lawmaker. He referenced in passing how he almost always ‘voted with labor’ unions.”



Bloomberg takes on Trump’s business record - Fox News: “Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Tuesday took aim at President Trump during his first public stop during a two-day trip to New Hampshire, accusing the president of being a failure in both business and government. And the billionaire media mogul who’s seriously considering a run for the Democratic presidential nomination said if he made it to the White House, he’d put his philanthropic foundation into a blind trust. At the start of a speech he delivered on climate change at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, the environmental and gun safety advocate said that Trump ‘failed at business and now I think it’s fair to say he’s failing at governing.’”



Flake will not challenge Trump in a 2020 - Fox News: “Former Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., announced Tuesday morning that he will not challenge President Trump in a 2020 Republican primary. Speaking on CBS – where he has signed on as a contributor – Flake said that he still believes that some Republican needs to challenge Trump in the primaries, but that it won’t be him. ‘I have always said that I do hope that there is a Republican who challenges the president in the primary. I still hope that somebody does, but that somebody won't be me. I will not be a candidate,’ Flake said on ‘CBS This Morning.’ … Flake himself fueled those rumors in November by saying he had ‘not ruled it out.’ But on Tuesday Flake said that it will be an uphill battle for any Republican trying to challenge Trump.”

PITTSBURGH VS. ALL YINZ

Sports Illustrated: “Not everyone is pleased to see Tom Brady in yet another Super Bowl. Like in Pittsburgh, for instance, where the Patriots-Steelers rivalry lives on even though the Steelers missed the playoffs this year. During yesterday’s late afternoon news on KDKA, the Pittsburgh CBS affiliate, the station ran a chyron identifying Brady not as ‘Patriots quarterback’ but as ‘known cheater.’ … If the Patriots end up winning on Sunday, there will be a non-zero number of fans at the championship parade wearing anti-KDKA T-shirts.

483,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-virginia-gov-mcauliffe-calls-on-northam-to-resign-amid-yearbook-photo-scandal,2,"Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said Sunday that the man currently holding that seat, Gov. Ralph Northam, will resign soon amid the mounting scandal over a photo on his medical school yearbook page that showed what appeared to be a man in blackface and a second person cloaked in Ku Klux Klan garb.

""Once that picture with the blackface and klansman came out, there is no way you can continue to be the governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia,"" McAuliffe said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Northam served as McAuliffe's lieutenant governor.

McAuliffe added: ""Ralph is a good, moral, decent man. And may have made some mistakes in his past. We all have made mistakes. Ralph will do the right thing for the Commonwealth of Virginia. He will put Virginia first. And I think that will happen relatively soon.”

NORTHAM APOLOGIZES FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL YEARBOOK PHOTO WITH BLACKFACE, KKK ROBE

The scandal began Friday when The Virginian-Pilot on Friday released the photo from Northam's 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook.

Northam quickly apologized for appearing in a photograph, but by Saturday, he reversed course and said the racist photo on his yearbook profile page did not feature him after all. The Democratic governor said he had not seen the photo before Friday, since he had not purchased the commemorative book or been involved in its preparation more than three decades ago.

""It has taken time for me to make sure that it's not me, but I am convinced, I am convinced that I am not in that picture,"" he told reporters gathered at the Executive Mansion in Richmond, calling the shot offensive and horrific.

While talking with reporters on Saturday, Northam admitted that he had previously worn blackface around that time, saying he once had used shoe polish to darken his face as part of a Michael Jackson costume he fashioned for a 1984 dance contest in San Antonio, Texas, when he was in the U.S. Army. Northam said he regrets that he didn't understand ""the harmful legacy of an action like that.""

Northam's explanation didn't put a dent in the clamor for his resignation.

VIRGINIA GOV. NORTHAM FACES BACKLASH FOR COMMENTS ON 3RD-TRIMESTER ABORTION BILL: 'MORALLY REPUGNANT'

Both of Virginia's U.S. senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, joined the dean of Virginia's congressional delegation, congressman Bobby Scott, in a statement Saturday night that says they have told Northam that they no longer believe he can effectively serve as governor.

McAuliffe, who is rumored to be a possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, said Sunday that he doubted Northam could have been mistaken about whether he was in the photo.

""You know if you put black paint on your face,"" he said. ""You know if you put a hood on. And so if it isn't you, you come out immediately and say this is not me.""

McAuliffe added that whether or not it was Northam in the photo, the governor still should resign in order to allow Virginia to move on.

""It doesn't matter whether he was in the photo or not at this point,"" McAuliffe said. ""We have to close that chapter. We have to move Virginia forward. Justin Fairfax, African-American lieutenant governor, will do a great job of bringing folks back together.""

“You know how MSM journalists could avoid having to spend millions on a #superbowl commercial to gain some underserved credibility?” Trump Jr. tweeted. “How about report the news and not their leftist BS for a change.”

The paper’s ad, which ran 60 seconds, was narrated by actor Tom Hanks, who co-starred in the 2017 film “The Post.” The ad showcased the importance of journalism and the Jeff Bezos-owned publication's slogan, ""Democracy dies in darkness.""

485,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-state-of-the-union-to-condemn-resistance-and-retribution-politics,2,"President Trump is set to renew his call for unity during Tuesday's primetime State of the Union address, but prominent Democrats are already signaling they have no intention of reconciliation amid ongoing fights over border wall funding and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

Historian Douglas Brinkley called Trump's upcoming address -- his first before a Congress not completely controlled by Republicans -- ""a strange and bizarre State of the Union."" It comes less than two weeks before a Feb. 15 funding deadline could lead to another partial federal government shutdown.

Among the president's guests will be Delaware 6th-grade student Joshua Trump, who says he has been bullied at school because of his name. Family members of Gerald and Sharon David, the Nevada couple allegedly murdered last month by an illegal immigrant, will also be in attendance, as well as Alice Johnson, whom Trump granted clemency last year while she was serving a life-term sentence without parole for a nonviolent drug crime. Johnson had been incarcerated for nearly 22 years.

FULL LIST OF TRUMP'S SOTU GUESTS

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has vowed never to fund a border wall, will be seated behind the president — a visual reminder of Trump's emboldened political opposition, and the wins they secured across the country in last year's midterm elections.

While White House officials cautioned that Trump's remarks were still being finalized late Monday, the president was expected to use some of his televised address to showcase a growing economy. Despite the shutdown, the U.S. economy added a robust 304,000 jobs in January, marking 100 straight months of job growth. That's the longest such period on record.

Trump and his top aides have also hinted that he is likely to use the address to announce a major milestone in the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria. Despite the objections of some advisers, Trump announced in December that he was withdrawing U.S. forces in Syria.

In a weekend interview with CBS News, Trump said efforts to defeat the IS group were ""at 99 percent right now. We'll be at 100.""

MIGRANT CARAVAN SET TO REACH US BORDER JUST BEFORE TRUMP'S STATE OF THE UNION

Speaking to Fox News on Monday, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway said Trump will repeat two of the messages of last year's State of the Union address: the need for the country to put aside partisan political differences, and the urgency of securing the southern border.

""He certainly will address the border wall, but also national security and border security -- immigration overall. This is an address to the nation, but he's in the chamber in front of the Congress that has failed to do its job for any number of years, if not decades, on getting us an immigration plan in our country that of course secures our southern border, but also tackles the chain migration, the visa lottery system, TPS [Temporary Protected Status recipients], DACA, the Dreamers, all these things that this president has put forward.""

Trump in January announced that, in exchange for $5.7 billion in border wall funding, he was prepared to back a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 immigrants who came to the country illegally as children and were shielded from deportation under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

The White House would also extend protections for 300,000 recipients of the TPS program -- which protects immigrants from designated countries with conditions that prevent nationals from returning safely. Democratic leaders rejected the offer immediately.

Conway continued: ""Most importantly, in this State of the Union, the president is calling for an end to resistance and retribution politics, and calling for cooperation and compromise. He really wants to unify the nation as its commander-in-chief and its president -- the leader of the nation, not the leader of a political party. And he's really using very specific examples of how Congress and he have done this already, and how he'd like to do it in the near future as well.""

But, she added, Trump will not back down on his pledge to build a wall on the nation's southern border.

""Call it what you want -- call it a wall, call it a physical barrier. ... It must be a physical barrier that you can't crawl under, climb over, drive through, or walk around,"" Conway said. ""We need to impede and deter these drugs, the human trafficking, the people coming over here and risking these small children.""

Speaking exclusively to ""Fox News Sunday,"" a top Democrat on the bipartisan congressional committee negotiating a border security compromise indicated that his party would support ""some sort of enhanced barrier"" -- but not a ""wall"" like the one Trump has demanded.

DEMS TROLL TRUMP WITH STATE OF THE UNION GUESTS

Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar said that ultimately the ""local Border Patrol chief"" should ""have the say-so"" on the matter. The chief of U.S. Border Patrol during Barack Obama's presidency said on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" in January that walls ""absolutely work"" and that there is no real argument against building and implementing one.

""You'll hear the State of the Union, and then you'll see what happens right after the State of the Union."" — President Trump

And the current Border Patrol chief, Carla Provost, told Fox News last year: ""We certainly do need a wall. Talk to any border agent and they will tell you that.""

Under pressure from conservative backers, Trump refused to sign a government funding bill that did not include money for the border wall late last year. With hundreds of thousands of Americans missing paychecks, Trump ultimately agreed to reopen the government in January for three weeks to allow negotiations on border security to continue.

But with the new Feb. 15 funding deadline looming, Trump has teased the possibility of declaring a national emergency to secure wall funding if Congress doesn't act, though it appeared unlikely he would take that step Tuesday night. Advisers have also been reviewing options to secure some funding without making such a declaration.

""You'll hear the State of the Union, and then you'll see what happens right after the State of the Union,"" Trump told reporters.

In the audience will be several Democrats running to challenge Trump in 2020, including Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.

Cabinet officials, members of Congress, military leaders, top diplomats and Supreme Court justices will also all be in the same place at the same time for all the world to see -- creating a series of security challenges for multiple law enforcement agencies, led by the U.S. Secret Service.

DHS REJECTS PELOSI'S SUGGESTION THAT SHUTDOWN WOULD HAVE COMPROMISED STATE OF THE UNION SECURITY

The tradition and familiarity of the event poses its the biggest security challenge; it's basically the same every year, officials said. And there are only so many ways officials can vary traffic routes or arrivals and departures.

""You have to be creative,"" Wes Schwark, assistant to the special agent in charge of the Dignitary Protective Division, said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""You try not to stick our head out in the same place twice.""

The streets around the building are frozen and secured. The Capitol Plaza is locked down and those inside are limited from moving around the building. The president and his entourage typically gather in a room off the House floor to await their entrances to the House chamber.

Metro stations are checked, counter-sniper teams with long-arm rifles perch on rooftops, bomb-sniffing dogs, uniformed officers and plainclothes agents patrol. Traffic is locked down. The House Chamber is swept randomly and consistently for explosives.

EXCLUSIVE: CA FIREFIGHTER REFLECTS ON BEING PART OF TRUMP'S FIRST STATE OF THE UNION

But even the security of the event had been politicized. Last month, as part of a back-and-forth with the White House over the federal government shutdown, Pelosi suggested that unpaid federal agents could not reliably secure the State of the Union address. DHS officials, speaking to Fox News, rejected that contention.

Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders announced Monday that will deliver his own response to Trump's State of the Union. Sanders, who is considering a 2020 presidential run, similarly delivered his own rebuttal to Trump's nationally televised primetime address on border security last year.

Meanwhile, a Democratic star, Stacey Abrams, will deliver the party's response to Trump. Abrams narrowly lost her bid in November to become Georgia's first black governor, and party leaders are aggressively recruiting her to run for Senate. Abrams has repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of her defeat.

There were other indicators that Democrats have no intention of heeding Trump's call for unity. New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's guest for the speech is a woman who cornered former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake on live television to protest his support for now-Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

Ana Maria Archila, who lives in the progressive firebrand's New York District, said this week she will wear white and a pin that the congresswoman gave her that says, ""Well-behaved women rarely make history.""

And Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D- N.J., invited Victorina Morales, a Guatemalan woman living in the U.S. illegally who reportedly was fired from the Trump National Golf Club.

Administration officials, meanwhile, say the White House has also been weighing several ""moonshot"" goals for the State of the Union address. One that is expected to be announced is a new initiative aimed at ending transmissions of HIV by 2030.

Trump has a track record of announcing lofty goals during the traditional speech. In his Jan. 30, 2018 State of the Union address last year, Trump set out a range of objectives, many of which his administration and Congress achieved.

For example, Trump vowed to ""work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones."" The White House renegotiated a revised North America trade pact that scored wins for autoworkers and dairy farmers, although the deal needs approval from Congress.

And Trump got South Korea to agree to a rewrite of a 2012 trade deal in which Seoul submitted to quotas on its steel and aluminum exports to the United States and modestly opened South Korea's auto market to U.S. automakers. Trump's effort to reset trade with China, meanwhile, has resulted in both nations increasing the tariffs that importers pay.

Similarly, Trump promised to ""embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance."" In December, Trump signed into law the First Step Act, a major overhaul of the criminal justice system which gave federal judges more leeway when sentencing some drug offenders and boosted prisoner rehabilitation efforts.

It reduced life sentences for some drug offenders with three convictions, or ""three strikes,"" to 25 years. Another provision allowed about 2,600 federal prisoners sentenced for crack cocaine offenses before August 2010 the opportunity to petition for a reduced penalty.

Trump also told Congress that those ""who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure — I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the 'right to try.'""

Congress passed such legislation, and Trump signed it into law in May. The bill helps people suffering from deadly diseases access experimental treatments.

But not all of the president's proposals from last year's address were realized in 2018. His plans for comprehensive immigration reform, for example, collapsed despite numerous GOP-led efforts. And perhaps more evidently, his call for unity and bipartisanship fell largely on deaf ears.

""Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve,"" Trump said last year.

486,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-rejects-socialism-at-sotu-as-expressionless-dems-sit-unmoved,2,"President Trump drew a clear line Tuesday night between his party's policies and the creeping socialism some see on the left, declaring at the State of the Union ""America will never be a Socialist country"" as many nonplussed Democrats appeared to shift uncomfortably in their seats.

The vow from Trump, whose speech was delayed a week amid a partial government shutdown, came as Democrats have proposed an evolving agenda of ""Medicare-for-all,"" free college tuition, minimum wage increases and even guaranteed basic income. Trump cited the ongoing disaster in Venezuela, where socialist policies have wrought ""abject poverty and despair,"" and pledged to maintain free-market economics in the U.S.

“America was founded on liberty and independence and not government coercion, domination and control,"" he said to Republican applause. ""We are born free and we will stay free.”

DAVID BOSSIE: TRUMP TOLD DEMS IN SOTU SPEECH HE WANTS TO WORK WITH THEM. I'M OPTIMISTIC

“Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a Socialist country,” Trump added as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sat stone-faced behind him.

Viewers at home were treated to a tight shot of a frowning Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an avowed Socialist and modern-day godfather of a movement that has produced a host of far-left young Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D- N.Y., who also was shown expressionless. Other Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, applauded the line.

Sanders would tweet following the speech: “Trump said tonight, ‘We are born free, and we will stay free.’ I say to Trump: People are not truly free when they can’t afford health care, prescription drugs, or a place to live. People are not free when they cannot retire with dignity or feed their families.”

""We are born free and we will stay free."" — President Trump

The socialism storyline was just one of several dividing lines Trump highlighted in a speech that simultaneously called for bipartisanship and unity.

Trump pledged to pursue his signature project, the wall on the Mexican border, saying: ""I will build it.""

""I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country,"" Trump said, in a speech that variously referred to both ""walls"" and ""barriers"" at the border.

“Simply put, walls work and walls save lives,"" Trump added. ""So let’s work together, compromise and reach a deal that will truly make America safe. ... This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier -- not just a simple concrete wall.""

Trump framed border security as a matter of preventing human trafficking, stopping the flow of illegal drugs from Mexico and maintaining federal resources for legal citizens. Democrats, including Ocasio-Cortez, sat on their hands as Trump praised an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, Elvin Hernandez, for breaking up a notorious human trafficking ring.

WHAT WAS NANCY PELOSI READING BEHIND TRUMP?

But perhaps more than any other issue, the socialism schism brought into sharp relief the differences between the two parties as 2020 looms.

Trump began the portion of his 82-minute speech by citing the economic decline and civil disorder in Venezuela as a cautionary tale, after his administration last week imposed sweeping sanctions against the regime of Nicolas Maduro.

The country's government in recent years limited citizens' access to foreign currency, implemented substantial subsidies and price controls on food and other items, and fell victim to sweeping corruption -- before effectively collapsing last month.

""Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim president, Juan Guaido,"" Trump said. ""We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom -- and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose Socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.

BERNIE SANDERS ACKNOWLEDGES ECONOMY IS A 'DISASTER' IN VENEZUELA

""Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,"" Trump continued, prompting boos from Republicans in the chamber. ""America was founded on liberty and independence -- not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free, and we will stay free.""

Then, after a prolonged chant of ""USA"" broke out, Trump concluded, ""Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a Socialist country.""

Democrats largely remained seated as Republicans resumed the ""USA"" chant and applauded for several seconds.

Still, Democrats did find enough common ground to applaud many of Trump's remarks.

“We stood up and cheered dozens of times. I stood up and cheered more often than last time I was at a Dodgers game,"" Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., told Fox News Channel's Laura Ingraham Tuesday night. ""We stood up and cheered dozens of times. Not as often as the Republicans did, we cheered more than when Obama was cheered for by Republicans, we cheered plenty, but you can’t stand up after every half a sentence and give a standing ovation.”"
