http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/19/us/us-fast-furious-report/index.html?hpt=po_c2",0,"Federal agents and prosecutors in Phoenix ignored risks to the public and were primarily responsible for the botched effort to infiltrate weapons-smuggling rings in the operation dubbed ""Fast and Furious,"" according to a report released Wednesday by the Justice Department's inspector general. The long-awaited report also criticized senior officials at the Justice Department and its Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Washington for lax oversight of the attempt to block the flow of weapons to Mexico’s violent drug cartels. Many of the weapons later turned up at crime scenes in Mexico and the United States, including one where a U.S. Border Patrol agent was killed.

The inspector general's report recommended that the Justice Department review the actions of 14 officials and consider whether disciplinary action is warranted. Among them are former acting deputy attorney general Gary Grindler, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, former acting ATF director Kenneth Melson, former ATF special agent in charge William Newell and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein.

The inquiry “did not find persuasive evidence that any supervisor in Phoenix, at either the U.S. Attorney’s Office or ATF, raised serious questions or concerns about the risk to public safety posed by the continuing firearms purchases or by the delay in arresting individuals who were engaging in the trafficking,” Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department’s inspector general, wrote in the 471-page report. “This failure reflected a significant lack of oversight and urgency by both ATF and the U.S. Attorney’s Office.”

In describing the actions of officials in Washington, the report said that “Fast and Furious received little to no supervision by ATF Headquarters despite its connection to a dangerous narcotics cartel in Mexico, the serious risk it created to public safety in the United States and Mexico, and its potential impact on the country’s relationship with Mexico.”

While the report criticized officials in Washington, it said Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had no advance knowledge of the tactics and risks involved in the operation until after it was stopped.

Holder issued a statement saying that the report’s conclusions were consistent with the Justice Department’s assessment that the strategy was flawed and that the agency’s leadership did not attempt to “cover up information or mislead Congress about it.”

He said that Melson, who had been transferred from the acting ATF director post to another position at Justice, has resigned. Weinstein, a deputy assistant attorney general under Breuer in the criminal division, also has resigned, Holder said.

A Justice official said Breuer has been “admonished” by Holder but will not be disciplined. The inspector general’s report said that Breuer did not authorize the investigative activities in Fast and Furious and that there is no evidence indicating he was aware in 2009 or 2010 that ATF agents were not interdicting firearms.

But the report criticized Breuer for not informing the deputy attorney general or the attorney general in April 2010 when he learned that the ATF had used similar tactics in another Arizona case called ""Operation Wide Receiver."" Breuer has already publicly apologized for that inaction.

The Justice official also said that Holder will not be taking any further disciplinary actions against department employees, including Grindler, who is now his chief of staff.

Fast and Furious allowed weapons from the United States to pass into the hands of suspected firearms smugglers so that they could be tracked to the upper levels of Mexican drug cartels. But the ATF lost track of about 2,000 guns, including AK-47-style rifles, and the report said the agency seized only about 100 weapons. Two guns linked to a suspected trafficker were found at the scene of the fatal shooting of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry in December 2010.

The report was based on interviews with 130 witnesses and a review of 100,000 documents over the past 18 months, according to the inspector general.

In a historic move in late June, the House of Representatives voted to find Holder in contempt for refusing to turn over some internal communications about the operation and its aftermath. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who praised the inspector general's report, has requested that Horowitz testify at a hearing Thursday morning.

The report’s conclusions were harsher than expected, although not surprising to officials who have followed the unfolding story of Fast and Furious. Last year, after Holder requested the inspector general’s investigation, the Justice Department forced Dennis Burke, the U.S. attorney in Phoenix, to resign. Several other officials were reassigned, including Melson; Emory Hurley, the lead prosecutor for the case in Phoenix; and Newell, the special agent in charge of the Phoenix ATF office.

Phoenix ATF agents testified that they watched as gun-trafficking suspects bought hundreds of weapons. Some agents said they were ordered to let the guns “walk” so the agency could trace them to a firearms-trafficking ring. Several of their supervisors said that they never allowed gun-walking but instead were told by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Phoenix that they did not have enough evidence to seize the weapons at the time.

ATF Acting Director B. Todd Jones accepted responsibility Wednesday for the failed gun operation."

Outside the Beltway THE BUSING DEBATE: Kamala Harris’s broadside against Joe Biden’s record on busing during last week’s Democratic presidential debate has done more than just re-energize the California senator’s presidential campaign.

Experts who study the country's school system say Harris renewed attention on an issue still roiling America's public schools in a way that hasn't been seen in decades. And the 2020 presidential candidates are divided about how they feel about the continuing practice of trying to integrate the education system by moving diverse kids from one part of town to another to get an education.

Harris's confrontation of Biden during the second Democratic debate seems to have sparked a surge in her poll numbers: According to a CNN poll released last night, Biden fell 10 points among primary voters since the last survey was taken in May, while Harris gained enough post-debate traction to rank second in the field, followed by Elizabeth Warren. Significantly, Biden's support is falling with black voters: in April and May, per CNN, his support with African Americans was 49 percent and has now fallen to 36 percent; while Harris has seen a rise with the demographic from 6 to 24 percent.

WHAT IS IT?: Busing refers to the use of school buses to desegregate schools either voluntarily or through a court-ordered mandate. During the debate, Harris slammed Biden for opposing government-mandated busing, which she described using to get to school as a little girl in California.

STILL HAPPENING: Busing isn't a relic of the 1970s. As both a voluntary or court-ordered approach, it's still used by cities around the country.

Berkeley: Harris’s hometown in California, where she was part of the second class of kids to integrate Thousand Oaks Elementary, still uses buses though it has since modified its plan “that is based on socioeconomic and demographic data instead of a student's race. The original desegregation policy remains a source of civic pride,” Harris’s hometown in California, where she was part of the second class of kids to integrate Thousand Oaks Elementary, still uses buses though it has since modified its plan “that is based on socioeconomic and demographic data instead of a student's race. The original desegregation policy remains a source of civic pride,” the Los Angeles Times’ Michael Finnegan, Seema Mehta and Melanie Mason report

Other voluntary efforts: Erica Frankenberg, an education and demography professor at Penn State University, Erica Frankenberg, an education and demography professor at Penn State University, identified 59 school districts across the country that have taken concrete steps toward voluntary desegregation, many of which include some form of busing.

However: "" . . . even voluntary school integration has been dealt a setback, thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District #1, which limited the ways in which districts can choose to promote diversity and reduce racial isolation,” per Frankenberg.

Alabama: Frankenberg pointed to a case just last year in Birmingham, Ala., where a 1971 segregation order remains in place. A federal appellate court found that the city of Gardendale, a Birmingham suburb, could not secede from the county and start its own school district because “the plan’s express purpose was to exclude black children,” Frankenberg pointed to a case just last year in Birmingham, Ala., where a 1971 segregation order remains in place. A federal appellate court found that the city of Gardendale, a Birmingham suburb, could not secede from the county and start its own school district because “the plan’s express purpose was to exclude black children,” NBC News’s Alex Johnson reported

WHY IT MATTERS: Sixty-five years after the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, the initial progress of integrating America’s public schools is backsliding, according to Frankenberg. A growing number of school districts are resegregating, despite the sea change in demographics across the country.

“I think it's unfortunate that we can't use the term busing,” Frankenberg told us. “In fact, when I write books I ask the book publishers not to put a picture of a bus on the front cover for example, because I think it’s an unfortunate and sort of reductionist way to think of school desegregation, which is incredibly more complex.”

The situation is getting worse: “In the 1990s, a series of Supreme Court decisions led to the end of hundreds of desegregation orders and plans across the nation,” “In the 1990s, a series of Supreme Court decisions led to the end of hundreds of desegregation orders and plans across the nation,” the authors of a UCLA's Civil Rights Project wrote in a report . “This report shows that the growth of racial and economic segregation that began then has now continued unchecked for nearly three decades, placing the promise of Brown at grave risk.”

Who?: “White students, on average, attend a school in which 69 percent of the students are white, while Latino students attend a school in which 55 percent of the students are Latino,” the report concludes, pointing out that white students have not made up the majority of the country’s school population for awhile.

Black students do not fare any better: “Segregation for black students is rising in all parts of the U.S. Black students, who account for 15 percent of enrollment, as they did in 1970, are in schools that average 47 percent black students,” the authors write.

Nationwide: The report found that most segregated schools in 2016 were in traditionally blue states like New York, California, Illinois and Maryland. In fact, of the top 10 states with segregated schools, six of them are in the northern United States.

Double segregation: The report also found that racial segregation was closely tied to socioeconomic status, meaning that “Black and Latino students, on average attend schools with a far higher share of poverty, measured by eligibility free/reduced price lunch.”

WHERE THE CANDIDATES STAND: Biden has been at the center of scrutiny, but he’s not the only candidate in the field to comment on the issue.

Harris: “I support the busing,” Harris said on Sunday to reporters. “The schools of America are as segregated or more segregated today than when I was in elementary school. And we need to put every effort, including busing, into play to desegregate the schools.”

Biden: “ Believes that often better policies address the root causes segregation like rezoning school districts, putting public housing in white neighborhoods and combating redlining,” Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo Believes that often better policies address the root causes segregation like rezoning school districts, putting public housing in white neighborhoods and combating redlining,” Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo wrote in a series of messages on Twitter , in a back-and-forth with Harris spokesman Ian Sams. Ducklo’s comments came after Biden expanded on his views during a post-debate interview

Bernie Sanders: “We need to make sure that kids go to community schools, which are integrated and that means we have to focus on fair housing legislation and enforcement,” “We need to make sure that kids go to community schools, which are integrated and that means we have to focus on fair housing legislation and enforcement,” Sanders said on ABC News's This Week . “No, we've — busing is certainly an option that is necessary in certain cases, but it is not the optimal. Does anybody think it's a good idea to put a kid on a bus, travel an hour to another school and to another neighborhood that he or she doesn't know? That's not the optimal. What is the optimal is to have great community schools which are integrated, that's what I think most people want to see. That's what I want to see.”

Elizabeth Warren: “I’m already on record on busing and using busing as a way to help communities that are diversifying,” she told reporters on Friday, “I’m already on record on busing and using busing as a way to help communities that are diversifying,” she told reporters on Friday, according to Politico

Julián Castro: Did not respond to a request for comment, but on his webs ite says he would “Fulfill the promise of Brown v. Board of Education through a progressive housing policy that includes affirmatively furthering fair housing, implementing zoning reform, and expanding affordable housing in high opportunity areas.”

Kirsten Gillibrand: : “I think every child should be able to go to a good public school. And as president I will assure that. If it needs busing, it needs busing.” The New York senator told reporters after the debate : “I think every child should be able to go to a good public school. And as president I will assure that.

Donald Trump: “Well, that’s something that they’ve done for a long period of time. You know, there aren’t that many ways you’re going to get people to schools. So this is something that’s been done. In some cases, it’s been done with a hammer instead of a velvet glove. But it is certainly a primary method of getting people to schools.” Trump said “Well, that’s something that they’ve done for a long period of time. You know, there aren’t that many ways you’re going to get people to schools. So this is something that’s been done. In some cases, it’s been done with a hammer instead of a velvet glove. But it is certainly a primary method of getting people to schools.” Trump said during a news conference in Osaka, Japan last week after NBC News's Kristen Welker asked Trump if he thought busing was a “viable way of integrating schools.”

Coming: “And as far as that, I will tell you in about four weeks, because we’re coming out with a certain policy that’s going to be very interesting and very surprising, I think, to a lot of people,”

HOW BUSING BECAME BUSING: As you can tell by now, segregation in public schools did not end with Brown in 1954. A year later, the court ordered states to end school segregation “with all deliberate speed.” But even then, efforts to slow-walk and thwart integration continued.

1/Controversial 'busing' era in 1970s is being framed through the lens of 2019. High unpopularity of busing (most whites & many blacks) resulted in a liberal candidate for VA GOV losing his race to the R in a squeaker after he had led handily earlier. Why? On election day, he was — Larry Sabato (@LarrySabato) June 28, 2019

LOOKING BACK:

“When people today talk about busing and say it was controversial, all they're saying is that efforts to uproot entrenched racism and segregation in the country didn't please everyone,” Matthew Delmont, professor of history at Dartmouth College and author of "" Why Busing Failed: Race, Media, and the National Resistance to School Desegregation ,"" told Power Up.

“School buses have been used within the 20th century of the United States to move students to schools, it's what made the modern American school system possible moving from one-room school houses to multiple grade elementary and then comprehensive high schools,” Delmont said. “In fact, school buses were often used to maintain segregation . . . so during that whole time period the 1920s through the 1950s and 60s the use of school buses wasn't controversial at all to white parents, it was only when busing became linked to school desegregation that it became an issue.”

At the White House

FOURTH OF TRUMP-LY: “President Trump has asked the Pentagon to marshal a broadening array of military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, to showcase his planned Fourth of July address to the nation — dramatically escalating the gathering’s cost and sparking concerns about the potentially damaging impact on the Mall and other infrastructure,” my colleagues Juliet Eilperin, Josh Dawsey and Dan Lamothe report.

“Trump, who had already ordered up a flyover by military aircraft including Air Force One and the Navy’s Blue Angels, has pressed to expand his “Salute to America” event further with an F-35 stealth fighter and the involvement of Marine Helicopter Squadron One, which flies the presidential helicopter, according to government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.”

“He also pushed to bring military tanks to the site of his planned speech at the Lincoln Memorial, prompting National Park Service officials to warn that such a deployment could damage the site, these individuals said.”

$$$: “The Defense Department has not released any estimates of how much the celebration could cost. But the use of numerous aircraft could drive it well into the millions of dollars when counting fuel and maintenance.”

Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) tweeted: “Risking damage to local infrastructure and dumping huge piles of taxpayer money onto the never-ending bonfire of Donald Trump’s vanity. My constituents and the other people who live here overwhelmingly do NOT want this.” “Risking damage to local infrastructure and dumping huge piles of taxpayer money onto the never-ending bonfire of Donald Trump’s vanity.

TANKS SPOTTED: The Associated Press’s photog Pat Semansky found at least two of the Army tanks ahead of the celebration:

“ . . . the two M1A1 Abrams tanks are with four other military vehicles on a freight train in a rail yard at the southeastern edge of Washington. The vehicles are being guarded by military police but are visible to passersby on nearby paths. A military official earlier told the AP that the tanks were transported north from Fort Stewart in Georgia.”

(See above for the photo capture.)

HIJACKED: HuffPost’s S.V. Date reports on the administration's doling out of tickets to the nonpolitical celebration on the National Mall to political appointees and Republican donors.

“The Republican National Committee has been offering major donors tickets to Trump’s speech, as have political appointees at the White House and executive branch agencies.”

“This partisan appropriation of a public event is consistent with the record of an administration that has no regard for lines between personal or partisan interests and its public obligations,” Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, told Date.

The People

DRINKING WATER FROM THE TOILET: U.S. lawmakers visited border detention facilities in El Paso and Clint, Texas yesterday, describing a ""broken"" and ""horrifying"" ""system of immigration detention at the nation's southern border where women in one cell were allegedly told to drink water from a toilet,"" reports El Paso Times's Lauren Villagran.

Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman and Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) said the group of lawmakers ""met 15 to 20 mothers who had been detained at the Border Patrol Station in Northeast El Paso 'for over 50 days,' he said. Some had been separated from their children, and the cell where they were held didn’t have running water to drink, he said,'"" per Villagran.

""Lawmakers said one of the women at the Northeast station alleged that border agents told her to drink water from the toilet.""

However, it's impossible to verify these claims since reporters are not allowed into the facilities. ""A Department of Homeland Security official, who was not authorized to discuss the visit and spoke on the condition of anonymity, insisted that no Border Patrol agent would make a migrant in their custody drink from a toilet and said there was water available,"" per my colleagues Bob Moore, John Wagner and Mike DeBonis

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted about the ""haunting visit"":

""After I forced myself into a cell w/ women&began speaking to them, one of them described their treatment at the hands of officers as 'psychological warfare' - waking them at odd hours for no reason, calling them wh*res, etc. Tell me what about that is due to a 'lack of funding?',"" she tweeted after visiting one of two Border Patrol processing centers.

PROPUBLICA SCOOP: The visit coincided with the publishing of a report by ProPublica's A.C. Thompson about a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents who ""joked about the deaths of migrants, discussed throwing burritos at Latino members of Congress visiting a detention facility in Texas on Monday and posted a vulgar illustration depicting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with a detained migrant, according to screenshots of their postings.""

""ProPublica received images of several recent discussions in the 10-15 Facebook group and was able to link the participants in those online conversations to apparently legitimate Facebook profiles belonging to Border Patrol agents, including a supervisor based in El Paso, Texas, and an agent in Eagle Pass, Texas. ProPublica has so far been unable to reach the group members who made the postings.""

“It’s very tough to back them up when their active and retired members are part of this Facebook page,” Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) told The Post in an interview before they lawmakers toured the facilities in El Paso. “Even if it’s a very small percentage, it’s unfortunate they harbor some very dark imagery and very dark thoughts about migrants and members of Congress.”

""Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost, who responded to the ProPublica report, described the online group as 'completely inappropriate and contrary to the honor and integrity I see — and expect — from our agents day in and day out' and she vowed to hold accountable any employee found to have violated the agency’s rules of conduct,"" per Bob, John and Mike.

On The Hill

JUST IN 🚨: Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) has sent a letter (see below) to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo demanding an investigation after Libyan government fighters discovered American missiles at a rebel base in Tripoli. First reported by the New York Times's Declan Walsh, Eric Schmitt, and John Ismay, the ""markings on the missiles’ shipping containers indicate that they were originally sold to the United Arab Emirates, an important American partner, in 2008.""

Advertisement

If the Emirates transferred the weapons to Gen. Khalifa Hifter, ""whose forces are waging a military campaign to take over Libya and overthrow a government the United States supports... it would likely violate the sales agreement with the United States as well as a United Nations arms embargo.""

Menendez, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Pomepo that the discovery of American missiles in the rebel compound is ""particularly alarming given that you recently tried to bypass Congressional authorization for these specific weapons to the UAE in May through a dubious ‘emergency’ action to counter a supposed Iranian threat.""

Menendez added that he would like the State Department's inspector general to investigate Pompeo and his knowledge of the transaction.

""The Senate just last week on a bipartisan basis passed 22 of my resolutions to reject the arms sales subject to your mistaken emergency declaration, including those to the UAE,"" Menendez writes. ""The Senate Foreign Relations Committee also passed my “Saudi Arabia False Emergencies” (SAFE) Act to restrict your and your successors’ ability to abuse the emergency authorities in the Arms Export Control Act in the future.""

47,47,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/11/we-will-not-let-them-get-away-with-it-trump-threatens-social-media-ahead-white-house-summit/?utm_term=.1d03f8b6b235,0,"President Trump assailed Facebook, Google and Twitter on Thursday — accusing them of exhibiting “terrible bias” and silencing his supporters — at a White House “Social Media Summit” that critics chastised for giving a prominent stage to some of the Internet’s most controversial, incendiary voices. For Trump, the conference represented his highest-profile broadside against Silicon Valley after months of accusations that tech giants censor conservative users and websites. With it, the president also rallied his widely followed online allies — whom he described as “journalists and influencers” and who together can reach roughly half a billion people — entering the 2020 presidential election.

“Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable,” Trump said.

Trump delivered his diatribe against Facebook, Google and Twitter — charges of political bias that all three companies long have denied — at an event at the White House featuring Republican lawmakers, GOP campaign strategists and social media meme-makers, a move that led some critics to express dismay that the president aimed to use the policy summit as a reelection push.

But Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups said they were most alarmed that Trump had invited supporters who have a history of targeting the president’s political opponents with inflammatory tweets, misleading videos and hard-to-debunk conspiracy theories. At one point, the president praised James O’Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, which has released widely criticized, highly edited videos of his subjects.

“Somebody said he’s controversial,” Trump said. “He’s truthful.”

In response, critics fretted that Trump had essentially endorsed such controversial tactics in the early days of the 2020 presidential race.

“This has the appearance not of a social media summit but a political rally and call for the right,” said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.). “The fact that some of the most extreme voices on social media are coming to the White House, and they get a forum to complain about how often they’re retweeted, and that the actual platform companies aren’t even invited, smacks of the absurd.”

The Southern Poverty Law Center charged that the president is “essentially conducting a hate summit at the White House,” said Heidi Beirich, the director of the group’s work to track online extremism.

Facebook, Google and Twitter each declined to comment.

For a portion of the summit, Twitter appeared to be down, an outage the company said it was investigating. Outside the gathering, Trump’s aides appeared to line the hallways with poster boards calling attention to the tech industry’s alleged tactics for suppressing conservatives’ speech — along with at least one tweet from Trump calling himself “the best” at using the service.

Trump also threatened additional scrutiny to come, promising to bring big tech companies to Washington for an upcoming meeting while directing federal agencies to explore “all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.” During a later, private portion of the summit, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said she and her fellow Republicans are launching a special task force to probe big tech, with an early focus on issues including privacy.

“I’m hearing from so many people who are saying we need to put some guardrails in place,” she said. “And this is not an industry in its infancy.”

Trump has skewered Facebook, Google and Twitter for months on allegations that they are biased against conservatives, even accusing them of trying to rig the election. In March, for example, he said the companies had engaged in “collusion” and worked in opposition to a “certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election.” Repeatedly, the president also has threatened to investigate or regulate Facebook, Google and Twitter, sparking hearings and similar calls for tough new laws among Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Trump has not provided evidence for his allegations that the tech companies seek to undermine Republicans or U.S. elections, and some of the examples he has cited to illustrate industry bias have been debunked. For instance, the president has accused Twitter of tampering with his follower count, a charge he repeated Thursday. The company long has said that users with large followings often experience fluctuations as it removes spam.

“A lot of bad things are happening,” he said.

Trump’s attacks often have come in response to efforts by Facebook, Google and Twitter to remove hate speech, threats of violence and other troubling content from their platforms. These tech giants have been under pressure to address a litany of online ills, including the rise of disinformation, three years after Russian agents spread falsehoods on social media during the 2016 election. But Trump and his close allies have decried some of social media’s content-moderation policies as censorship, putting those companies in a political bind.

“This is largely, I think, a political event,” said Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association, a Washington-based trade group that represents Facebook, Google and other tech giants. He said there is “no conservative bias on our platforms.”

Some of the conservatives that Trump consulted Thursday have adopted controversial tactics on social media and even have been disciplined by Facebook, Google or Twitter for running afoul of their rules. That includes O’Keefe and Project Veritas, whose secretly recorded video of Google drew Trump’s praise Thursday.

“Project Veritas can be synergistic with the Trump administration to pull back the curtain surrounding Big Tech,” O’Keefe said in a statement online after receiving the invitation.

Other attendees included Ali Alexander, who sent the initial inflammatory tweet questioning whether Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a Democratic presidential candidate, is actually an “American black,” and Jim Hoft, the Gateway Pundit founder who has long been faulted for spreading conspiracy theories online.

“After the 2016 election Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon (in advertising) decided the best way to prevent another Trump win was to silence conservative voices in America,” according to a statement from the Gateway Pundit site. “The tech giants in two years did more to destroy Freedom of Speech than at any other time in US history.”

Initially, the White House had invited Ben Garrison, whose cartoons long have provoked the ire of groups including the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center for including hateful imagery, including anti-Semitism. But the White House this week appeared to rescind its invitation, Garrison tweeted in a statement Wednesday, out of concern his presence would be a “media distraction from the president’s message.”

Trump also invited lawmakers such as Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) who have accused Twitter of limiting the reach of their tweets. They were joined by organizations such as the Media Research Center, a conservative group that has called for the breakup of big tech companies, and PragerU, which produces right-leaning videos that it says Google has censored — a matter the two sides are battling in court.

In an early-morning series of tweets, Trump said that the focus of the conversation would be “the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies,” though he did not mention any by name. “We will not let them get away with it much longer,” he added.

Trump also appeared to suggest social media sites “would be driven out of business” once he leaves office in six years — or more, acknowledging he had made a joke about exceeding presidential term limits.

Some lawmakers bristled at the summit, saying that the Trump administration had missed an opportunity to explore real challenges facing social media ahead of the 2020 election, amid heightened fears about the spread of hate speech and even harder-to-detect viral falsehoods."

As we have noted before, Romney's financial life as a very wealthy person is significantly more exotic than the average person he needs to vote for him; that he made almost $14 million in 2011 (and $21 million in 2010) without drawing any salary is all the confirmation you need of that fact.

So, as soon as the Romney team made the strategic decision during the Republican primary process to hold the line on releasing no more than two past years of returns prior to the general election, they knew this day would come -- a day when Democrats would get a chance to sift through a window into his full financial portfolio for evidence that the caricature they have painted of him (rich, entitled businessman) was right.

All the Romney campaign could control was when that day came. They chose today. But why?

Ask the campaign and, even when offered anonymity to speak candidly, top aides to Romney insist the returns were finished and signed by Romney yesterday and filed today, making today the obvious day to release them.

Of course, if you believe the calculation of when to drop the 2011 returns -- as well as a summary of the past 20 years of tax rates the Romneys paid -- was entirely without political motive then we have a bridge to sell you.

There's a number of reasons for why Romney chose today to swallow this uncomfortable political pill -- some logistical but mostly strategic.

First, the logistical. Romney had said previously he would release his 2011 return before the Oct. 15 deadline and before the first general election presidential debate, which is set for Oct. 3. This release meets both of those criteria.

Now, for the strategic.

1. It's Friday: The phrase ""Friday news dump"" has not become common parlance in Washington political news circles by accident. The reality of human nature -- and, yes, we are including reporters in that ""human"" category -- is that our attention span starts to wane as the weekend approaches. The story will get less attention late today than it would have on, say, a Tuesday morning. Fact.

2. It's already been a bad week: Romney's ""47 percent"" secret video comments ensured that the Republican presidential nominee had already lost this week on the big political scoreboard. (Heck, Romney had already won the Fix's ""Worst Week in Washington"" before the news of the tax return release broke this afternoon.) Political strategy 101 dictates that the best time to dump other bad new — at least in terms of political impact — is when things already are going badly so that it all gets wrapped into a single big story and you can then move on. Will Romney's tax returns be talked about on the Sunday chat show circuit? Absolutely. But is that any worse from a political perspective than those same Sunday shows being dominated by chatter about why Romney hasn't run a better campaign? Bad is bad. There are few gradations politically between bad and really bad.

3. The first debate is 12 days away: If Romney had waited to release his 2011 returns until, say, next Friday the first debate would be just 5 days away -- ensuring that there would be some (extended) discussion of them in it. And that's not what Romney wants. By releasing them today, it allows almost two weeks to pass before the debate, an amount of time that lets the GOP nominee dismiss the story as ""old news"" if and when Obama or one of the debate moderators brings it up.

The best case scenario for Romney on his tax returns (and his wealth more broadly) is that it takes up a single news cycle as people process the data in it and then move on. By dropping the 2011 return on a Friday afternoon, the Romney team is hoping that by Monday morning the political world has had its fill of the story and is back to talking about the economy and President Obama's handling of it.

Let's see if they're right."

Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) should send a letter to Fox News saying the following: Do more investigative journalism. Break more news.

That is the most logical recourse in light of her questioning of former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III on Wednesday in another one of those congressional super-hearings. True to both his own preference and Justice Department instructions, Mueller — at least in his testimony Wednesday morning before the House Judiciary Committee — stuck closely to the text of his two-volume report, which was released in April in redacted form. “I direct you to the report” was Mueller’s mantra for these proceedings.

[Got a question about the Mueller testimony? Submit a question for Harry Litman’s Twitter chat.]

But the report is the problem, Lesko suggested in her five allotted minutes of questioning. Here’s a look at the exchange:

LESKO: Mr. Mueller, rather than purely relying on the evidence provided by witnesses and documents, I think you relied a lot on media. I’d like to know how many times you cited the Washington Post in your report. MUELLER: How many times I what? LESKO: Cited the Washington Post in your report. MUELLER: I do not have knowledge of that figure . . . . I don’t have knowledge of that figure. LESKO: I counted about 60 times. How many times did you cite the New York Times? MUELLER: Again, I have no idea. LESKO: I counted about 75 times. How many times did you cite Fox News? MUELLER: As with the other two, I have no idea. LESKO: About 25 times. I’ve got to say, it looks like Vol. II is mostly regurgitated press stories. Honestly, there’s almost nothing in Vol. II that I couldn’t already hear or know simply by having a $50 cable news subscription. However, your investigation cost the American taxpayers $25 million. Mr. Mueller, you cited media reports nearly 200 times in your report, then in a footnote, a small footnote, No. 7, page 15 of Vol 11, you wrote, I quote: “This section summarizes and cites various news stories not for the truth of the information contained in the stories, but rather to place candidate Trump’s response to those stories in context.” Since nobody but lawyers reads footnotes, are you concerned that the American public took the embedded news stories at face value?

At that point, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) cut off the questioning, insisting that the hearing was running short on time.

Lesko was wrong: The non-lawyer Erik Wemple Blog read that footnote and addressed it in a two-part evaluation of the Mueller report’s implications for the media. It’s true: Fox News was cited far less than either the New York Times or The Post. From the first installment of this blog’s Mueller blowout:

The Mueller report credits not a single piece of investigative work among the 16 Fox News and Fox Business Network pieces cited in the report’s footnotes. Many of the hits are interviews conducted by the hosts of “Fox & Friends” and by Sean Hannity, perhaps the country’s foremost cheerleader for Trump. Several others stem from interviews with Trump and then-incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus by Chris Wallace, the no-nonsense host of “Fox News Sunday,” during the presidential transition.

Underlying Lesko’s line of questioning is the idea that, somehow, an investigative document should cite Fox News in equal proportion to The Post and/or the New York Times. But the problem with any such premise is that Fox News doesn’t do investigative journalism in the manner of major U.S. newspapers. It reads the news broken by other outlets, and then feasts on it. (Worth noting: The report made clear that other TV networks besides Fox didn’t measure up to newspapers’ investigative outputs either.)

And as for the footnote language cited by Lesko: Vol. II is indeed a tour through Trump’s various freak-outs as the Mueller team went about its work. For instance: In June 2017, The Post reported that Mueller and his team were looking into whether Trump had obstructed justice. A heading on the Mueller report itself makes clear why this report was germane to the investigation: “The Press Reports that the President is Being Investigated for Obstruction of Justice and the President Directs the White House Counsel to Have the Special Counsel Removed.”

See how that works, Rep. Lesko? News organizations didn’t sit around waiting for Mueller to finish his business. They conducted a parallel investigation into Trump’s actions, an investigation that had already surfaced many, though not all, of the revelations in the Mueller report. The role of Fox News was primarily to toss cold water on the significance of other outlets’ scoops. Such is not the sort of work that earns citations in a special counsel’s report.

Police said around 3,500 people gathered near City Hall for the unauthorized protest organized by prominent opposition figure Alexei Navalny. Earlier this week, a Russian court sentenced Navalny to 30 days in jail for calling for the demonstration. A handful of other prominent opposition politicians also were arrested before the rally took place.

OVD-Info, a monitoring group that tracks political arrests in Russia, said more than 1,000 people were detained during police sweeps Saturday. State-run news agencies, including Tass, also reported more than 1,000 detentions, citing police. In previous mass detentions, many people were released after being held for several hours. The Moscow police had earlier said they had made 295 arrests, the Associated Press reported, but did not offer a final number.

Police also stormed a TV studio belonging to Navalny that was live-streaming the protests on YouTube, and arrested Vladimir Milono, who was in charge of the program. Navalny previously ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Moscow in 2013.

A number of opposition politicians were banned from the ballot for the September city legislative vote after election officials claimed they had not gathered enough signatures to qualify. But their supporters say the government is intentionally boxing them out from participating in the elections to maintain the council’s status quo. Moscow’s city council has 45 seats and is controlled by a pro-Kremlin party.

The fight over the council is emblematic of political tests across Russia for President Vladimir Putin, such as municipal elections and challenges over building projects. While the outcomes do not directly threaten Putin’s grip on the country, they serve as rallying points for opposition groups that have faced relentless pressure from the Kremlin.

Last weekend, more than 22,000 people gathered for a protest in downtown Moscow in the largest such demonstration in years. This week, protesters chanted “Russia will be free,” the AP reported.

The rallies involved just a tiny fraction of the 13 million people who live in the city, and it was business as usual in much of the center on a balmy July afternoon. But the recent protests represented perhaps the biggest anti-government groundswell in the Russian capital in recent years.

The main target of the protesters’ ire was Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin, a close ally of Putin’s.

The protests are the latest sign that Russians are becoming increasingly vocal about their frustrations, even if their numbers are still far too few to pose an immediate challenge to Putin’s power. The demonstrations are driven, analysts say, by concerns as varied as economic stagnation, government cutbacks, corruption and Putin’s increasingly authoritarian rule.

Earlier this summer, protesters took to the streets in Moscow in support of Ivan Golunov, an investigative journalist who was framed for drug crimes by the police and then released amid public outrage. Across Russia, meanwhile, people have loudly protested over local issues in recent months, including the construction of a cathedral in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and a plan for a new landfill in the far north."

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-30/trump-cites-problem-with-china-on-trade-sending-futures-lower?srnd=premium",0,"President Trump said Tuesday that a new trade deal with China might not come until after the 2020 elections, a significant departure from more than a year of trying to exert pressure on the world’s second-largest economy. His comments were the latest in rapidly evolving and sometimes contradictory strategic shifts. Less than two months ago, he announced that a huge crackdown against China was imminent. On Tuesday, he suggested that further action could be more than a year away, and everything could change based on whether he is reelected.

In several Twitter posts, Trump accused China of delaying negotiations, which began in earnest last December. Even as Trump’s chief trade advisers resumed talks in Shanghai, the president’s tweets suggested a deal may be further away than it had seemed in recent months.

“My team is negotiating with them now, but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit,” Trump tweeted. “They should probably wait out our Election to see if we get one of the Democrat stiffs like Sleepy Joe,” he added, using a nickname he had tried to assign to presidential candidate Joe Biden.

“The problem with them waiting, however, is that if & when I win, the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now . . . or no deal at all,” he tweeted.

...to ripoff the USA, even bigger and better than ever before. The problem with them waiting, however, is that if & when I win, the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now...or no deal at all. We have all the cards, our past leaders never got it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 30, 2019

The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 70 points in early trading before recovering somewhat to end the day about 23 points lower. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and Nasdaq also fell.

Some influential business leaders are growing worried at the lack of progress in the talks, which the administration in May said were on the verge of a historic deal before collapsing. Despite Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreeing last month to restart negotiations, the bargaining has been slow to resume.

“The two sides are still trying to figure out how to get back to the table,” said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “We were close in May. Now the ground has gotten shakier.”

Several chamber executives were in Beijing this month for talks with Chinese officials, warning them against waiting for a better deal after the 2020 election. A prolonged delay risks the appearance of new issues that could complicate hopes for a comprehensive deal, Brilliant said.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer are expected to meet with Xi before leaving Shanghai on Wednesday. Such a meeting would be seen as an indication that China is ready to bargain seriously, Brilliant said.

Trump is trying to simultaneously negotiate multiple complicated trade deals, stretching his team thin and raising fears among business executives that he doesn’t have the bandwidth to deliver on his many promises.

An effort to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement has bogged down in Congress. Trump has also threatened the leaders of the European Union and Japan with tariffs if concessions aren’t made. And he has said he is trying to speed along a trade deal with Britain to help it complete a withdrawal from the E.U. None of these initiatives has been completed, and none appear close to completion.

But the China talks have long been Trump’s primary focus. On Friday, Trump first flagged the possibility of discussions dragging beyond the 2020 election, but his decision to repeat the claim Tuesday rattled investors because it seemed deliberate.

China is one of the United States’ largest trading partners, and U.S. companies import more than $500 billion in goods from China each year. Trump has alleged that China uses unfair trade practices, such as manipulating its currency, stealing U.S. intellectual property, and flooding global markets with cheap products, to gain an advantage over U.S. firms. He had tried to exert pressure on Chinese officials to agree to quick concessions, but that strategy has changed in recent days with his signal that talks might have to wait until 2021.

This is at least the second big part of Trump’s economic agenda that he has signaled is not likely to be accomplished in his first term. He has recently told advisers that he won’t be able to focus on spending cuts until after his reelection, and cutting the budget was one of his core campaign promises.

What began with tariffs on steel last summer has metastasized into a giant trade conflict that has affected two of the most powerful engines in the global economy. In tweets, Trump crowed about China’s economic slowdown, claiming the nation had lost millions of jobs because of his tariffs.

“China is doing very badly, worst year in 27,” Trump tweeted. “ . . . China has lost 5 million jobs and two million manufacturing jobs due to Trump tariffs. Trumps got China back on its heels, and the United States is doing great.”

China is doing very badly, worst year in 27 - was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now - no signs that they are doing so. That is the problem with China, they just don’t come through. Our Economy has become MUCH larger than the Chinese Economy is last 3 years.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 30, 2019

China has lost 5 million jobs and two million manufacturing jobs due to the Trump Tariffs. Trumps got China back on its heels, and the United States is doing great. @AndyPuzder @MariaBartiromo — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 30, 2019

Although Trump maintains that the drawn-out conflict is mostly hurting China, experts say the trade war is damaging the U.S. economy and possibly fueling a global slowdown. Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell has pointed to head winds from the trade war as a primary reason the central bank could cut interest rates by the time its two-day meeting ends Wednesday.

In January, the World Economic Forum predicted the trade war could reduce global gross domestic product growth by 0.7 percentage points to 2.8 percent in 2019. And in a recent research note, Morgan Stanley’s chief economist warned that the trade war could spur a global recession within a year.

Trump and Xi met in Argentina last year and agreed to negotiate a broad trade deal. Trump wants China to purchase more U.S. products, impose strict intellectual property rules, halt subsidies for China-backed companies and open its markets to American companies.

He first set a March 1 deadline for the talks but repeatedly granted extensions while negotiations progressed. Then, in May, Trump more than doubled tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods after accusing China of reneging on its commitments.

The president also threatened to impose tariffs on a further $300 billion or so in Chinese goods.

At the Group of 20 leaders summit in Japan last month, Trump again met with Xi. Trump agreed to postpone new tariffs and claimed that China had agreed to purchase “almost immediately” a large amount of U.S. farm products. Those purchases have yet to occur.

Trump wrote Tuesday that China “was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now — no signs they are doing so. That is the problem with China, they just don’t come through.”

Chinese officials appear to be under less pressure to cut a deal than they were a few months ago. They also have sent signals that Trump’s repeated threats are not working.

Hu Xijin, editor in chief of the nationalist Global Times, a state-owned news organization in China, fired back at Trump on Tuesday.

Whenever it's time to negotiate, the US side comes up with the trick of piling pressure. Really not a good habit. Americans need to change their negotiating style, show more sincerity, not just wield stick.

The Democratic presidential hopeful and former congressman, who lives in the Texas border city, told the audience that he had just called his wife to make sure she was okay. He said the shooting shatters “any illusion that we have that progress is inevitable” when it comes to tackling gun violence.

“We have to find some reason for optimism and hope or else we consign ourselves to a future where nearly 40,000 people a year will lose their lives to gun violence and I cannot accept that,” O’Rourke told reporters afterward.

Across the country, lawmakers took to cable television and Twitter to react to the mass shooting, with Republicans offering prayers and condemnations of the violence without mentioning guns and Democrats going a step further to decry yet another missed opportunity to address the nation’s gun laws. It was similar to what these lawmakers said less than a week ago, when a 19-year-old opened fire with an assault-style rifle at a food festival in Gilroy, Calif., killing three people and wounding 12 others.

On Saturday, President Trump and Vice President Pence offered expressions of condolence and federal support in the mass shooting that left dozens dead and injured in Texas.

“Terrible shootings in ElPaso, Texas,” the president tweeted as the reports of carnage unfolded. “Reports are very bad, many killed. Working with State and Local authorities, and Law Enforcement. Spoke to Governor to pledge total support of Federal Government. God be with you all!”

Texas lawmakers tweeted condolences. Attorney General William P. Barr issued a statement calling for the killer or killers to be “held accountable swiftly and to the fullest extent the law allows.”

“My heart is with everyone in El Paso struck by this unspeakable evil,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) tweeted Saturday afternoon. “Heidi and I are praying for the victims and their families and grateful for the first responders, local authorities, and law enforcement officers working tirelessly to bring the perpetrator of this depraved act to justice and keep the entire community safe. There are millions of people in Texas and across the country standing behind you.”

But Trump and Pence stopped short of calling for action on gun violence. That was left to Democrats, who called on their GOP colleagues to tighten gun laws.

“Enough is enough,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a news release, echoing a phrase that reverberated on social media all afternoon. “The Republican Senate’s continued inaction dishonors our solemn duty to protect innocent men, women and children and end this epidemic once and for all.”

For Democrats, the shooting has the potential to raise the profile of gun control.

Share this article Share

The Democratic contenders for president are largely in agreement on the need for greater gun restrictions. Sens. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Cory Booker (N.J.) have offered robust plans. Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.), who dropped out of the race in July, had made gun control the centerpiece of his campaign.

“I think all over the world people are looking at the United States and wondering: What is going on?” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said at Saturday’s forum by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). “It’s not just today. It has happened several times this week. It has happened here in Las Vegas.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) told the crowd that her mind was on El Paso — and pledged to take on the National Rifle Association. “I’m someone that believes that we need to take on the NRA.”

She noted that the House of Representatives passed legislation to expand background checks for people seeking to purchase guns. “Do you know where that bill is right now? It’s sitting on [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell’s doorstep in the graveyard in the Senate.”

McConnell (R-Ky.) tweeted Saturday: “The entire nation is horrified by today’s senseless violence in El Paso. Elaine’s and my prayers go out to the victims of this terrible violence, their families and friends, and the brave first responders who charged into harm’s way.”

The Democratic presidential candidates are embracing gun control more than in any other campaign in recent memory, with emotional appeals against firearms violence and pledges to stand up to the NRA. In the face of more and more mass shootings, particularly in schools, the ground on the issue has shifted from an embrace of a gun culture in many areas of the country, including some that Democrats hope to wrest from the president.

Almost every candidate in the field supports universal background checks and bringing back a ban on the sale of “assault” weapons like the one that expired in 2004.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he had an opening statement prepared for his AFSCME appearance, but began his remarks by saying, “I can’t even think about it right now.”"

Another Democratic presidential hopeful, Sen.

Biden in his speech highlighted Saturday’s shooting in El Paso by a suspect that authorities believe posted an essay with language that closely mirrors Trump’s rhetoric, as well as the language of the white nationalist movement, including a warning about the “Hispanic invasion of Texas.”

“How far is it from Trump’s saying this ‘is an invasion’ to the shooter in El Paso declaring this attack is a response to ‘the Hispanic invasion of Texas’?” said Biden. He also referred to the deadly clash between white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville in 2017 and the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last year.

“I don’t think it’s that far at all. In both clear language and in code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation,” said Biden, who has said it was Trump’s response to Charlottesville that convinced him to run for president.

Biden, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, delivered his speech in Burlington, Iowa, on a day when Trump appeared in both El Paso, where 22 people died in Saturday’s rampage, and in Dayton, Ohio, where nine people were killed early Sunday.

“We have a president who has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation,” Biden said. “Trump offers no moral leadership, no interest in unifying the nation, no evidence the presidency has awakened his conscience in the least.”

The president tweeted from Air Force One about Biden’s remarks while traveling between the sites of two mass shootings.

“Watching Sleepy Joe Biden making a speech. Sooo Boring! The LameStream Media will die in the ratings and clicks with this guy. It will be over for them, not to mention the fact that our Country will do poorly with him. It will be one big crash, but at least China will be happy!”

Earlier in the day, Booker, standing inside the church where a white supremacist killed black congregants at a Bible study class, argued that those who are not trying to fight racism and white supremacy are contributing to the problem.

“White supremacy has always been a problem in our American story, if not always at the surface, then lurking not so far beneath it,” said Booker, one of two black candidates running for president. “Racist violence has always been part of the American story, never more so than in times of transition and rapid social change.”

“There is no neutrality in this fight,” he continued. “You are either an agent of justice or you are contributing to the problem.”

Booker never used Trump’s name in his speech, but made clear he blamed the president for the massacre in El Paso carried out by a white supremacist gunman that used similar language as the president to describe immigrants, like “invasion.”"
176,176,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/09/why-is-iowa-state-fair-such-big-deal/,0,"It’s just a few days on the political calendar, but what happens at the Iowa State Fair can echo through an entire presidential race. It takes on its political significance in the year before a presidential election (that’s now). Because most presidential campaigns circle this event in red on their calendars, Washington Post reporters have covered the Iowa State Fair for years. Below is some of what they, and The Fix, have learned about it.

Why is the Iowa State Fair important?

Iowa is the first state to vote in presidential primaries, when both parties hold their caucuses in January or February of election years. So presidential candidates spend much of their time campaigning in the state, hoping to get a boost in the rest of the primaries by doing well in Iowa. A no-brainer way to campaign in Iowa is to attend the state’s fair, which is six months before the caucuses and is held in the state’s most populous city: Des Moines.

The fair started Thursday (it runs Aug. 8-18), which means we can expect candidates and their campaigns to be there throughout the weekend.

What do politicians do there?

They see the butter cow. It’s a 600-pound cow made of butter, and stands in a glass-enclosed 40-degree cooler. The Post’s Elise Viebeck explained in 2015 that it’s one of the main attractions at the fair. Many candidates take pictures in front of it and blast it out on social media. Here’s 2016 Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina.

They eat lots of fried food. That’s what most fairgoers come for. In 2015, Washington Post journalists ate their way through the fair and captured it on film — including a 1,650-calorie deep-fried nacho balls dish.

In 2015, the Post ate our way through the Iowa State Fair and took our camera along. (Video: Alice Li/The Washington Post)

While noshing on a corn dog is a way to show you eat as regular people do, eating is not a good look for anyone captured on camera, least of all heavily scrutinized politicians. Here’s a photo gallery of presidential candidates awkwardly trying to bite into food, much of it at the Iowa State Fair.

They get on a “soapbox.” Candidates ritually appear on the fair’s political soapbox, which is made of bales of hay and is sponsored by the Des Moines Register newspaper.

Does going there really help candidates?

Campaigning at the fair is harder than it looks. As The Post’s Holly Bailey pointed out this week, presidential candidates have been haunted by what happens here — from John F. Kerry (joking with a fair attendee about why someone would move to Iowa), to Fred Thompson (wearing designer shoes), to Mitt Romney (saying “corporations are people” in a speech he gave at the fair).

The fair “is just dotted with land mines,” David Kochel, Romney’s senior adviser in Iowa during his 2012 run, told Bailey.

As this year’s fair gets going, former vice president Joe Biden in particular is in the spotlight. He ended his 1987 campaign after a speech at the fair that took lines from another speech that was not his own. At a town hall in Des Moines on Thursday, Biden told a group of mostly minority voters that “poor kids” are just as bright as “white kids,” The Post’s John Wagner reported. His campaign said he misspoke by conflating wealth with whiteness, but that gaffe will trail him to the fair.

But the risk is worth the reward, if you can pull off.

Standing on the soapbox in 2015, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), then considered a long-shot primary challenger to Hillary Clinton, piqued the national media’s attention when an estimated 1,000 people came to hear him speak. He nearly beat Clinton in the Iowa caucuses a few months later.

And now-President Trump used the fair to show off an early sign of how his unusual approach to politicking won him devotees. As The Post's Philip Rucker and Jenna Johnson reported in 2015:

“A political Willy Wonka, Trump offered rides in his helicopter, which landed at a nearby baseball field, to randomly selected handfuls of Iowa children. ‘Come here,’ he said to the kids. ‘Does anyone want to take a ride? It’s nice, right? . . . Who wants to go first?’ ”

Trump, they reported, “was out of his element here but undoubtedly in command.""

The fair has been criticized for holding up a magnifying glass to the candidates that forces them to try to be authentic and doesn’t really represent who they are."

HONG KONG — Thousands of protesters shut down Hong Kong’s international airport Monday, defying an intensifying police crackdown, as China issued ominous warnings that described the protests as “terrorism” and began massing a paramilitary force in a southern border city. Fears have been mounting that Beijing — squeezed by a trade dispute with the United States and approaching a nationwide celebration of the founding of the People’s Republic of China — will soon resort to military action to quell the pro-democracy protests in the semiautonomous territory. Chinese officials and state news media actively stoked those fears Monday.

“The radical demonstrators in Hong Kong have repeatedly attacked police with extremely dangerous tools in recent days, which constitutes a serious violent crime, and now they are descending into terrorism,” said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office in Beijing. It was the first time the office had portrayed the protests in Hong Kong as “terrorism.”

“We should relentlessly crack down on such violent criminal acts without mercy, and we firmly support Hong Kong police and judicial authorities in bringing the criminals to justice as soon as possible,” Yang told reporters from state and Hong Kong media.

The nationalist Global Times tabloid tweeted a video showing Chinese armored personnel carriers heading toward the southern city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, ahead of what the paper called “large-scale exercises” by the People’s Armed Police, a paramilitary unit. “The tasks and missions of the Armed Police include participating in dealing with rebellions, riots, serious violent and illegal incidents, terrorist attacks and other social security incidents,” the newspaper elaborated in an accompanying story.

And China’s state broadcaster, CCTV, issued a commentary Monday night headlined “Alert! There are signs of terrorism on the streets of Hong Kong,”in which it warned: “No country can accept terrorist acts in its own country … Hong Kong has reached an important juncture. ‘End violence and restore order’ is the most important, urgent and overriding task of Hong Kong at present!”

Earlier, the Chinese government department responsible for Hong Kong held its third news conference in three weeks — it previously had not held a briefing in the 22 years since Britain returned the territory to the mainland.

Some of the protesters who had been occupying the airport’s arrivals hall swarmed into the departures area Monday, prompting authorities to cancel all flights and advise travelers to leave one of the world’s busiest hubs. Airport operations resumed Tuesday morning, though there were some delays and cancellations stemming from the previous night’s disruption.

Monday’s protest came in response to a sharp increase in the level of force employed by Hong Kong’s embattled police. Hours before the airport shutdown, two police officers elsewhere in the city pinned a black-clad demonstrator to the concrete, one officer’s knee pressing the young man’s face into a pool of his own blood.

“I’ve already been arrested,” the man yelled as he cried for help. “Don’t do this, I’m begging you.”

The scene, captured Sunday night by a cameraman from the Hong Kong Free Press, was jarring even in a city now accustomed to weekends awash with tear gas. It unleashed a fresh wave of anger toward Hong Kong’s police force and the government more broadly, spurring thousands of demonstrators to respond by occupying the airport.

At the airport Monday, officials had halted all departures by late afternoon, affecting tens of thousands of passengers.

Hong Kong’s airport authority said all flights were suspended Monday at about 3:30 p.m. local time (3:30 a.m. Eastern time).

After sitting in the arrivals hall for much of the day, many protesters began leaving the airport in the evening amid rumors on social media and messaging apps that police were preparing for a large clearance operation. The protesters, many dressed in black, streamed across the roads around the airport, bringing traffic to a near-standstill. Some travelers abandoned buses and taxis and wheeled bags through the traffic. Many said they were headed to a nearby bus station.

On Sunday night, Hong Kong police intensified their crackdown with new and more aggressive tactics after more than two months of sustained protests and more than 600 arrests.

Officers disguised themselves as protesters to arrest suspects, launched tear gas inside a subway station and fired on protesters at close range with less-than-lethal ammunition. One young woman was shot in the face with what appeared to be a bean bag round, severely injuring her eye. Police said Monday that the videos and photos had to be verified and that they could not confirm “the reasoning behind this lady’s injury.”

But the incident provided the latest rallying point for protesters.

“The police have had enough, to be honest. They feel like they have been bullied for two months now, and they knew themselves more than capable to use real force and tactics to control the situation,” said Clement Lai, a former police superintendent who now runs his own security firm.

“If the order was given that they need to escalate their action and their force, these guys are more than happy to do that.”

Mel, 40, who took part in the airport demonstrations and carried a sign with pictures of bloodied protesters, said she wanted “to show the world that what we are looking for is freedom.”

She said she was angry about the “dirty methods” police used Sunday night and early Monday morning.

Mel, who gave only her first name, added that a decision was made among many protesters to leave early Monday evening because of fears that police would forcibly clear the airport.

The police actions appear to be part of broader efforts by the Hong Kong government, with the support of officials in Beijing, to end the political crisis, through an approach that includes ramping up pressure on businesses, leveling heavy charges against arrested protesters and using state-controlled media to pump out increasingly shrill, conspiratorial claims about who is organizing the demonstrations.

“After a period of several weeks of uncertainty as to who was coordinating the government response, last week saw the rollout of Beijing’s multipronged, comprehensive strategy to deal with the protests,” said Sebastian Veg, a historian of China and a professor at the School of Advanced Studies in Social Sciences in Paris. “It consists in uniting all forces with whom common ground can be found to isolate and defeat the enemy.”

He added, “The aim is to turn public opinion against the protests by drastically raising the cost of participation.”

The new police tactics came after former deputy police commissioner Alan Lau was called out of retirement last week to help the embattled force.

Lai credited the new approach, in part, to Lau’s return. “He is coming back with a mission,” the former superintendent said.

Hospital officials said that 45 people were injured in weekend protests and that 25 remained hospitalized. Two were in serious condition.

One police officer who has worked on the front lines over the past month said officers’ new ploy of disguising themselves as protesters — wearing masks, yellow hard hats and black civilian clothes — was a deliberate tactic from the police Special Duties Unit, nicknamed the “Flying Tigers,” to sow mistrust among protesters.

This is a tactic they will continue to use, the officer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. Police on Monday also displayed trucks mounted with water cannons that they could deploy to disperse crowds.

One 22-year-old protester who has been on the front line for weeks admitted that the more aggressive moves by police had caught some demonstrators off guard and yielded results.

“It was quite effective for them; they are changing their strategy,” he said. “We know now the police have no limits. They will not follow the rules and the law.”

The government, in what has become a weekly ritual, condemned protesters Monday and said a police officer was injured after being hit with a firebomb tossed by a demonstrator.

Protests began earlier this year over the government’s attempts to push through a bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China. The legislation, which numerous critics said would be a severe blow to Hong Kong’s autonomy, was suspended by Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam in June.

Lam, however, has refused to fully withdraw the measure. She has issued apologies as well as condemnation, none of which have quelled the crisis. Most recently, she has pivoted to focus on how the unrest is damaging Hong Kong’s economy.

Protesters have offered a list of five demands that has shifted slightly in recent weeks. Much of the focus is now on the creation of an independent commission to investigate the handling of the bill and the subsequent fallout.

An inquiry has drawn wide support, with the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, law groups and civil-society organizations backing its creation, but the government continues to resist such calls. Lam has said she thinks an in-house investigation by police of their actions is sufficient and has not addressed the other demands.

The front-line protester said the new police strategy would only harden those who have already dedicated themselves to the fight.

“You can see our equipment — shields, helmets — is for defense, not for offense,” he said. “From now on, I think that will change. Some types of weapons will be used. We are standing there and getting beat by them.”"

Appearing outside the White House before a lengthy summer vacation in New Jersey, Trump claimed that conversations in recent days have yielded strong congressional support for “very meaningful background checks” and that his party, which has stymied gun-control efforts this year by Democrats, would take the lead in passing new legislation after returning from an August recess.

“I think Republicans are going to be great and lead the charge, along with the Democrats,” Trump told reporters.

The president is facing intense pressure to find a way to stem gun violence after two mass shootings last weekend in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, left 31 dead and injured dozens more.

His rosy assessment, however, faced immediate pushback from several skeptical Republicans who expressed concerns about any tougher gun controls infringing on constitutional rights, underscoring the daunting task even for a president who holds extraordinary sway over his party.

The president said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has refused to allow his chamber to consider House-passed bills strengthening background checks, was now “totally on board” after the two men spoke.

In response, a McConnell spokesman said the Kentucky Republican had not yet endorsed any legislation.

National Rifle Association officials geared up Friday to challenge any legislative push for stricter limits, according to an individual with direct knowledge of the effort.

Inside the White House, aides remained split about whether the administration should embrace more robust background checks, with acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney expressing skepticism about such legislation passing, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks. A spokesman for Mulvaney said he supported expanded background checks.

Seemingly all agreed that a drive for background checks, or tighter gun regulations, would take a concerted and sustained effort by a mercurial president who has often been ambivalent on the issue.

Trump’s previous declarations of support for tougher gun controls, including after the deadly Parkland, Fla., school shooting in February 2018, have foundered in the face of opposition from Republican lawmakers and the NRA, an organization that strongly backed Trump’s candidacy in 2016. Current and former officials said Trump essentially lost interest, and now a long vacation in Bedminster, N.J., along with a congressional recess, is likely to slow momentum.

Trump acknowledged to reporters Friday that previous efforts to strengthen background checks “went nowhere.”

“But there’s never been a president like President Trump,” he boasted, not mentioning that he had also championed such efforts as president.

“I have a great relationship with the Republican senators, and I really think they’re — they’re looking for me to make — give them a signal,” Trump said.

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who was spending the weekend with Trump, dismissed the prospects of expanded-background-check legislation along the lines of a bill that failed to advance in the Senate in 2013. But Graham said he is floating legislation that would potentially require background checks for assault weapons sold at gun shows.

Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.), the No. 3 Senate Republican, suggested that the failed 2013 bill has not gained fresh support and worried that other steps would undermine the right to due process.

Trump has talked to NRA leaders at least four times, White House officials said, but has not been able to convince them of his position — and chief executive Wayne LaPierre has continued to tell him he is likely to lose political support if he passes a background-check bill. Trump has told aides that the NRA is weaker as it reels from an internal leadership battle and allegations of improper spending, and that he could browbeat the group into backing whatever he wants, two aides said.

The aides spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely describe internal deliberations.

Proponents of background-check legislation said they were seeking to convince the president that he could overcome NRA objections. Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said he told Trump that NRA members distrusted President Barack Obama and thought he wanted to take their guns. “Mr. President, they don’t feel that way with you,” Manchin said he told the president.

Trump seemed to understand the sentiment. “I think my base relies very much on common sense. And they rely on me, in terms of telling them what’s happening,” he told reporters.

Trump also said he is hopeful that the NRA, whose members he called “great patriots,” can be persuaded.

“I think in the end . . . the NRA will either be there or will maybe be a little more neutral, and that would be okay, too,” Trump said.

Manchin said the goal was to make the NRA neutral.

But to counter the legislative push, NRA officials planned to highlight their power in states that Trump needs to win for reelection and in Senate races that the GOP could lose in 2020, an individual familiar with the effort said.

“I can confirm that the NRA opposes any legislation that unfairly infringes upon the rights of law-abiding citizens,” LaPierre said in a statement this week. “The inconvenient truth is this: The proposals being discussed by many would not have prevented the horrific tragedies in El Paso and Dayton. Worse, they would make millions of law-abiding Americans less safe and less able to defend themselves and their loved ones.”

The NRA executive said he would not discuss his conversations with Trump.

Early in his tenure, at the NRA’s urging, Trump signed legislation that repealed an Obama-era regulation designed to prevent certain mentally ill people from purchasing firearms.

In a tweet Friday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said that if Trump “needs the NRA’s sign off for background checks legislation, it will be nearly impossible to accomplish anything meaningful to address gun violence.”

McConnell, who is up for reelection in 2020, has declined to allow the Senate to consider two bills strengthening background checks that passed the House in February, both of which Trump has threatened to veto.

One bill would amend federal gun laws to require background checks for all firearm sales and most transfers. Federally licensed dealers are required to run background checks on people who buy guns, but private sellers who are not federally licensed are not. Under the bill, private parties would have to seek a federal license to facilitate a gun deal.

The second bill would extend the time for the government to complete a background check on someone trying to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer before the sale can go through.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sent a letter Thursday to Trump asking him to use his constitutional powers to force the Senate back into session to vote on the two bills — a plea Trump dismissed Friday while speaking to reporters.

In his first interview since the weekend massacres, McConnell said Thursday that he spoke to Trump about the Senate working on legislation to tighten gun laws after the August recess.

McConnell specifically mentioned expanding background checks and “red flag” laws, which would allow authorities to confiscate a firearm from someone deemed a risk to themselves or the public.

“Those are two items that will be front and center as we see what we can come together on and pass,” he said on a Kentucky radio station.

At the same time, McConnell underscored the difficulty in reaching consensus on a divisive issue. Congress has not passed significant gun-control legislation since the 1990s, and advisers said he would not bring anything forward that did not have majority Republican support.

One Democratic congressional aide who was not authorized to comment publicly noted that Trump floated red-flag laws after the Parkland shooting, but interest fizzled and the effort never went anywhere in the Republican-led Congress.

Just two of 53 Republican senators — Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) and Susan Collins (Maine) — are on record in support of expanding background-check laws, specifically through a bill Toomey drafted with Manchin after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., in 2012.

Toomey told reporters this week that he hopes the legislation will now gain momentum, but he acknowledged the difficulty of passing it in the Senate, where there is a 60-vote threshold on most legislation because of the filibuster rule.

Aides said Trump had polled a range of supporters about what they would accept.

“The problem is that you throw a liberal an inch on gun control and they take a mile,” said Doug Deason, a prominent donor to Trump.

But Deason said he expected that the president would still seek a universal-background-check bill. “I’m a big gun guy, and I’m all for background checks,” he said."

The announcement, which came from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, ensures that Apple products and other major consumer goods would be shielded from the import tax until at least December, potentially keeping costs on these products down during the holiday shopping season.

It was the latest in a series of unexpected announcements and reversals by Trump as the White House attempts to pressure China to change long-standing economic practices. The confusion and uncertainty has weighed on the economy, leading companies to tighten up investment as they wait for a resolution.

White House officials have been split over how to proceed with China. Some, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, have expressed optimism that a deal could be reached. But Trump and senior trade adviser Peter Navarro have defended the tough tactics, saying they are necessary to change China’s behavior.

Tuesday’s announcement reflected a more cautious approach, and it moved stocks sharply higher. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped after the news and finished the day 373 points, or more than 1.4 percent, higher. The stock prices of Apple, Best Buy, Mattel and Macy’s were among those that rallied on the announcement.

The announcement effectively shields more than $100 billion in Chinese imports from tariffs until Dec. 15.

Shortly after the announcement, Trump told reporters that he delayed the tariffs “just in case” they would have a negative impact on U.S. shoppers this holiday season. This marked the most explicit admission he has made so far that the tariffs could have raised costs for American consumers and businesses and had a negative impact on the economy.

Trump has for weeks insisted that higher tariffs are somehow paid for by the Chinese government, even though tariffs are imposed as a form of customs duty that is paid for by U.S. importers.

“What we’ve done is we’ve delayed it so they won’t be relevant in the Christmas shopping season,” Trump said before boarding a flight to western Pennsylvania. “Just in case they might have an impact on people.”

The economy has shown signs of slowing this year, and some business executives, lawmakers and White House officials had worried that the tariffs were damaging the economy even further. A number of businesses had cut back on investing, in part because they were unsure how Trump planned to proceed with the trade war. Democrats had begun attacking Trump for lacking a coherent plan in his approach to dealing with the Chinese, and the rapid reversals had caused dramatic swings in the stock market.

Sensing that Trump’s new defiance toward China could drive up costs, a number of companies petitioned the White House to exempt items they import from the new tariffs. They argued that these costs would be either passed along to the consumer or threaten the solvency of individual firms.

USTR said the 10 percent tariff would still go into effect in September on some items, including many food products, gloves, coats and suits. But it said tariffs on other items would be waived completely, “based on health, safety, national security and other factors.”

In a nod to pressure from religious groups and publishers, the White House completely exempted Bibles and certain other books from new tariffs.

Trump, in a Twitter post and comments to reporters, suggested that the announcement was meant as an overture to Chinese officials and an attempt to restart the stalled negotiations.

“I’m not sure if it was the tariffs or the call, but the call was very productive,” Trump said, referring to a conversation this week between top Chinese and U.S. negotiators.

But he added a warning on Twitter that China needs to buy more from the United States, “As usual, China said they were going to be buying ‘big’ from our great American Farmers. So far they have not done what they said. Maybe this will be different!”

USTR provided a list of products that were exempted and would face the delayed tariff implementation date, which included highchairs, strollers, cellphones and many toys.

Many businesses had worried that higher tariffs on consumer goods ahead of the Christmas shopping season could severely damage the economy at a time when some are warning that the risk of a recession next year has increased.

The tariff delay is likely to keep retail shopping strong this year, many economists say, but it does nothing to alleviate the confusion and uncertainty over what Trump will do next in the trade battle.

“Recession risks are elevated,” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “Uncertainty remains very high. Until there is a clear resolution, which we do not think will come before the end of next year, businesses will remain cautious in regards to investment.”

Advertisement

Meyer now predicts a 1-in-3 chance of a recession in the coming year as businesses have already pulled back on spending and are showing early signs of slowing down hiring as well.

The White House list of items that would face immediate tariffs and delayed tariffs included many items that appeared very similar, and White House officials did not explain how they decided which items to exclude and which ones to penalize.

For example, certain “men’s or boys’ shirts, of textile materials” are exempted from tariffs until Dec. 15, but “men’s or boys’ shirts, knitted or crocheted, of cotton,” face tariffs in September.

Similarly, recreation performance outerwear “bibs and overalls” are exempted from tariffs until Dec. 15. But nearly four dozen other types of overalls would face tariffs in September.

The announcement is the latest in a herky-jerky trade war between the White House and China. Trump has levied tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports, beginning last year, as he has tried to pressure Chinese leaders to change their trade practices. Chinese officials have negotiated but refused to agree to the terms Trump has demanded, leading to a prolonged standoff.

Trump has frequently threatened dramatic penalties, however, only to back away. His threat of imposing a 10 percent tariff on an additional $300 billion in Chinese imports starting next month spooked investors and many lawmakers, and it has led to a steady slide in the stock market in the past two weeks.

“These tariffs were Trump’s idea. Now his team is trying to clean this up,” said Steve Pavlick, a former Treasury Department official under Trump who is now head of policy at Renaissance Macro Research. “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that you see this right before Christmas. They are trying to minimize the impact.”

Trump has pressed China for months to change its trade practices, calling on it to change the way it subsidizes domestic companies, among other things. The White House has also accused China of stealing intellectual property from U.S. companies and forcing U.S. firms to transfer technology to Chinese firms.

But Trump’s demands in recent weeks have shifted, a sign of the political peril that the prolonged trade war has raised.

Trump had originally threatened to impose the new tariffs on $300 billion in consumer goods by early July, but at a June meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump agreed to hold off. At the meeting, during the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, Trump said the Chinese had agreed to dramatically increase purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, a nod to the farm industry, which had become increasingly incensed about being caught in the middle of the trade war.

But Chinese officials say they never agreed to purchase the farm products Trump had promised, and that soon became clear to the U.S. agriculture industry.

Several weeks ago, the U.S. trade representative, Robert E. Lighthizer, and Mnuchin flew to Shanghai to meet with Chinese leaders about restarting negotiations. The discussions went poorly, people briefed on the outcome said.

Trump had recently said that the Chinese seemed intent on waiting until after the 2020 election before they would cut a deal with him, and he seemed content with that. But when he heard back from Mnuchin and Lighthizer about how poorly the trip had gone, he announced that he would move ahead with the 10 percent tariff in September."
210,210,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/18/top-trump-officials-downplay-recession-risks/,0,"President Trump and two of his senior economic advisers on Sunday played down the risk of a recession after a tumultuous week in the markets suggested that the economy is heading onto shaky ground. In an exchange with reporters in Morristown, N.J., shortly before taking off for Washington on Sunday evening, Trump dismissed the notion that the nation is headed toward a downturn, saying, “I don’t see a recession.”

“I mean, the world is in a recession right now — although that’s too big a statement,” he added, in a remark that appeared to undercut his effort to calm fears.

Earlier Sunday, Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, and White House trade director Peter Navarro between them appeared on all five morning talk shows to defend the president’s economic record and argue that his trade offensive against China isn’t harming American producers or consumers.

Advertisement

Their push came days after bond market investors sent a powerful signal that they see a potential downturn looming, and economists from Wall Street and beyond further whittled growth forecasts for a record-length economic expansion that appears to be slowing.

“I don’t see a recession at all,” Kudlow said on “Fox News Sunday.” On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” he urged Americans, “Let’s not be afraid of optimism.”

“Consumers are working at higher wages,” Kudlow said. “They are spending at a rapid pace. They’re actually saving also while they’re spending. That’s an ideal situation. So I think actually the second half, the economy’s going to be very good in 2019.”

On ABC News’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos,” Navarro maintained that a recession could be staved off if the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates and banks in Europe and China make similar moves.

“The Federal Reserve’s precipitous interest rate hikes actually cost us a full point of growth,” Navarro told host Martha Raddatz. “All we need, Martha, is to reverse that, have Europe do what they need to do, China do their fiscal stimulus, and the global economy will — will have a bullish cycle going through 2020 and beyond.”

Share this article Share

Appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Navarro dismissed research indicating that American businesses and consumers are shouldering the bulk of the tariff burden Trump has imposed on Chinese imports.

“That dog won’t hunt,” Navarro said of findings by economists at Harvard University, the University of Chicago, the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston that the tariffs are effectively tax increases on Americans. “They’re not hurting anybody here. … They’re hurting China. They’re slashing their prices.”

The White House announced Tuesday that it is delaying until December new tariffs on popular consumer goods, including cellphones, laptops and strollers, that were set to take effect next month. Trump framed the decision as a gift to American shoppers heading into the Christmas season.

But Navarro rejected the suggestion that the move amounts to an acknowledgment by the administration that the import duties are raising prices for Americans. Instead, he said it was “a goodwill gesture that the president made to the Chinese. It was a wise decision to delay the tariffs to December 15, and in the meantime half of those tariffs are actually going on September 1. The tariffs are working.”

Democratic presidential hopefuls on Sunday painted a bleaker picture of the economic outlook and blamed Trump’s trade policies.

“There’s a big debate going on right now about whether we’re on the cusp of a recession. I think we probably are,” Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., said on CNN. “But the more important thing is, even during an expansion, most Americans haven’t been able to get ahead. … And the president has made it abundantly clear that he doesn’t care. When it comes to rural America, I think, to him, it’s just the scenery that he sees out the helicopter window on the way to his golf course. And when it comes to American consumers, he is completely out of touch on the impact it’s going to have on the prices we pay for our goods as the result of a trade war in which both sides will lose.”

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), appearing on ABC, said she worries that the pending trade agreement to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement will end up exacerbating economic woes."

While Mitt Romney relies heavily on massive amounts of cash held by the Republican Party and interest groups, Obama has more funds in his own campaign coffers. That allows him to make decisions about where and how to spend the money and to take better advantage of discounted ad rates, which candidates receive under federal law.

In one Ohio ad buy slated to run just before the election, for example, Obama is paying $125 for a spot that is costing a conservative super PAC $900.

The imbalance could prove crucial over the next six weeks, when the candidates and their allies are expected to burn through about $1 billion worth of advertising in battleground states and deploy thousands of staffers and volunteers to drum up votes. With $1.5 billion already spent on the White House race, the final barrage will help determine whether Romney can turn around his fortunes and defeat the incumbent.

Republicans, who have more cash overall, say they expect to dominate the airwaves through November despite Obama's advantage in ad rates and grass-roots organizing. They also say they hope to combat the president's vaunted ground game through the efforts of the Republican National Committee and independent groups.

“I think we’re in a strong place message-wise with the economy still struggling, with 26 million still struggling for work and with world events looking more and more uncertain,” Romney strategist Russ Schriefer said. “I’m confident that we will be able to get our message out.”

Romney’s White House bid is being handled largely outside his official campaign, from attack ads run by friendly super PACs to the RNC’s get-out-the-vote push. The campaign is legally forbidden from coordinating with independent groups, leaving it at a potential disadvantage at a time when the candidate is trailing in the polls.

The result is that Romney and his allies may have fewer resources than it appears, since much of what they do from here will be more expensive. The lack of direct control by Romney also raises the possibility, however remote, that his allies could abandon him if his chances continue to fade, as happened to Robert J. Dole in October 1996, when the party shifted its efforts to congressional races.

""The difference in ad rates alone could end up being very important,"" said Michael Franz, an associate professor at Bowdoin College and a co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks and analyzes political ad spending. ""It's a critical issue in determining how far each side's money goes. It looks to be a huge benefit for Obama in the long run.""

Clashing messages

A lack of coordination may have contributed to Romney’s problems in recent months: American Crossroads, Restore Our Future and other pro-Romney groups have bombarded swing states with tens of millions of dollars in ads, with little apparent effect on Obama’s trajectory. And the RNC has used up nearly all of the $21.6 million it is allowed to spend under law on coordinated advertising with the Romney campaign, records show.

Most of the ads aired by Republican groups since the spring have been scattershot in location and theme, often clashing with the messages pushed by the Romney campaign. During the last week of August, for example, there were at least eight pro-Romney television commercials running in battlegrounds on topics including Medicare, welfare policy, jobs, debt and Obama’s “hope and change” message from 2008.

The Obama camp, meanwhile, has drowned Ohio, Virginia and other swing states with commercials focused on defining Romney as an out-of-touch plutocrat and has spread its ad purchases widely among time slots to lower costs.

During the two weeks encompassing the Republican and Democratic conventions, for example, the Obama campaign alone aired 37,230 ads — twice as many as Romney and all his allies put together, according to data from the Wesleyan group. Obama paid an average of about $526 per spot, compared with more than $700 per spot for the GOP side, the data show.

The Obama campaign declined to comment on its media strategy.

Part of the disparity stems from differing strategies, as Republicans tend to favor pricier news and sports programs for their ads while Obama chooses a more varied mix. On KUSA in Denver, Obama paid as little as $100 per spot for some recent daytime slots, while the RNC spent as much as $17,000 for a pair of commercials during a Denver Broncos preseason game, according to Federal Communications Commission records.

‘Lowest unit rate’

Starting several weeks ago, both campaigns gained the ability to obtain radio and TV advertising at the “lowest unit rate,” which is guaranteed to federal candidates within 60 days of an election. The legal requirement means that campaigns — but not parties, nonprofits or super PACs — can commandeer airtime at the cheapest prices.

At the start of September, Romney had about $50 million in his campaign account compared with about $90 million for Obama, who has brought in much of his money in small-dollar contributions. Romney, by contrast, has relied heavily on donors giving up to $75,000, most of which must go to the Republican Party because of legal limits on how much a donor can give to a candidate’s campaign committee.

Outside groups and parties typically pay at least 50 percent more for advertising than candidates do in the final weeks of a national campaign, according to media buyers. Sometimes the gap is wider: One GOP ad buyer said a 30-second slot on “Good Morning America” in Washington will cost a candidate about $2,000, compared with twice that much for an interest group.

Federal candidates also legally receive priority over other clients, meaning they can force regular commercials aside, and they cannot be refused airtime by radio or television stations, regardless of the content.

“When everyone talks about what the media buy is, it’s often very misleading,” said Ken Goldstein, president of Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political advertising. “Not all dollars are created equal.”

There have been other signs of inflated costs in the Romney operation, which fell behind the Obama campaign in fundraising last month and has significantly higher staff and consulting expenses. Romney doled out more than $200,000 in bonuses to senior staff members in August even as the campaign took out a $20 million loan to get through the month.

Republicans say they will have plenty of resources to compete, both on the air through the Romney campaign and its allies, and in voter-engagement efforts by the RNC.

“We have implemented the gold standard of ground games for this cycle, drawing on the enthusiasm for the Romney-Ryan ticket,” said RNC communications director Sean Spicer. “The RNC’s number one priority this cycle is to put a top-notch army on the ground that will propel us to victory.”"

The talks are still in their early stages and have included a range of other tax breaks. The officials also have not decided whether to formally push Congress to approve any of these measures, these people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose internal discussions. But the White House increasingly is discussing ideas to boost a slowing economy, they said.

Even though deliberations about the payroll tax cut were held Monday, the White House released a statement disputing that the idea was actively under “consideration.”

“As [National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow] said yesterday, more tax cuts for the American people are certainly on the table, but cutting payroll taxes is not something under consideration at this time,” the statement said.

The statement and the internal discussions over the payroll tax cut are part of a rapidly evolving effort by the White House to exude confidence about the economy’s strength while simultaneously hunting for ways to bolster business and consumer confidence. Business spending already has pulled back, in part because of fears about the trade war, but consumer spending has remained robust. If Americans begin to tighten their belts later this year, the economy could suffer new strain.

Millions of Americans pay a payroll tax on their earnings, a 6.2 percent levy that is used to finance Social Security programs. The payroll tax was last cut in 2011 and 2012, to 4.2 percent, during the Obama administration as a way to encourage more consumer spending during the most recent economic downturn. But the cut was allowed to reset back up to 6.2 percent in 2013.

Workers pay payroll taxes on income up to $132,900, so cutting the tax has remained a popular idea for many lawmakers, especially Democrats seeking to deliver savings for middle-income earners and not the wealthiest Americans. But payroll tax cuts can also add dramatically to the deficit and — depending on how they are designed — pull billions of dollars away from Social Security.

The payroll tax cuts during the Obama administration reduced taxes by more than $100 billion each year, but the administration directed revenue to Social Security programs so those initiatives did not lose money. The cuts added to the deficit, however.

If Washington implemented a similarly sized reduction, the tax cut could equate to a bigger tax break for many families than the 2017 tax law.

The Trump administration’s discussions about whether to pursue a new payroll tax cut began in recent days, the three people said, and specific details about the design were not reached.

Trump and top aides have spent the past few days trying to convince the public that the economy is strong and that fears about a recession are misguided. But White House officials have begun scrambling for new ideas to reverse public concerns and boost business confidence.

Some administration officials have felt that planning for an economic downturn would send a negative perception to the public and make things worse, but Trump has spent much of the past week conferring with business executives and other confidants seeking input on what they are seeing in the economy.

There are signs the U.S. economy is slowing, and economists fear that Germany and Britain already are tipping toward a recession. So far, consumer spending has remained one of the U.S. economy’s bright spots, and White House officials are aware that Trump’s reelection chances could hinge on the economy staying strong into next year.

Payroll tax cuts have remained popular with Democrats largely because they are seen as targeting working Americans and the money is often immediately spent by consumers and not saved. That way, the money gives consumers more spending power but also helps businesses that rely on the income.

The White House talks are at such an early stage that aides have not begun consulting with key lawmakers yet.

A spokesman for Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said that the lawmaker had not discussed a payroll tax cut with the White House and that “at this point, recession seems to be more of a political wish by Democrats than an economic reality.”

Democrats, meanwhile, have become skeptical about the White House’s propensity to swing from one idea to the next, particularly when it comes to the trade war in recent weeks.

“Their panicking and flailing is palpable and adding more uncertainly to the economy and making a possible Trump recession more likely,” said Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.). “They’re flying by the seat of their pants and don’t seem to have any real plan. So let’s see the fine print first.”

White House officials have become acutely focused on protecting strong levels of consumer spending, which is one reason they are eyeing new tax cuts. That is because one of the biggest causes of economic downturns is a pullback in consumer spending. That hurts businesses, which then lay off workers, who then cut back on spending — a painful economic loop.

In the past, Democrats have strongly supported payroll tax cuts, while Republicans have been more resistant. Republicans have complained that such cuts do not help the economy and disproportionately worsen the deficit.

White House officials have shifted wildly in recent days, with varying assessments about the economy. Kudlow has sought to convey optimism, but Trump has been less consistent.

The president on Monday sought to play down the risk of a recession while also pinning the blame for a potential economic downturn on the Federal Reserve, chastising the central bank’s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, for a “horrendous lack of vision.”

In a tweet, Trump also called for the Fed to reduce interest rates by at least 100 basis points, marking an escalation of his demands on the central bank. Trump has frequently lashed out at Powell but had never used the phrase “basis points” in a tweet or made such a specific demand.

“Our Economy is very strong, despite the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed, but the Democrats are trying to ‘will’ the Economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 Election,” Trump tweeted. “Very Selfish! Our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world.”

He then declared that interest rates, “over a fairly short period of time, should be reduced by at least 100 basis points, with perhaps some quantitative easing as well.”

“If that happened, our Economy would be even better, and the World Economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced-good for everyone!” he said.

The federal funds rate, which Trump is trying to persuade central bankers to cut, is set at 2.25 percent. Slashing it 100 basis points would lower this rate to 1.25 percent, giving them little additional wiggle room to maneuver if a full-fledged recession began.

The president’s plea to launch a new phase of “quantitative easing” is shorthand for asking the Fed to pump more money into the economy, a step that could weaken the U.S. dollar. This also is seen as an extreme step that central bankers take when they are trying to urgently address a slumping economy, not a tactic that is employed when the economy is still growing.

Fed officials have said they do not make decisions based on political pressure, but Trump has taken his attacks on the central bank to new extremes, particularly this month amid numerous signs that the U.S. economy is weakening more than expected.

After a tumultuous week in the markets suggested that the economy is heading onto shaky ground, Trump and his top officials have touted what they say are the economy’s strengths, particularly consumer spending, and predicted that a recession will not occur.

As concerns mount, Kudlow has scheduled briefing calls this week with state and local business leaders, conservative groups and others to gauge the economy’s strength and seek more input.

White House spokesman Judd Deere said the calls, which “have been long-planned,” will focus on Trump’s economic agenda, including issues such as deregulation and energy production.

But even as the White House has dismissed the notion that the country may be headed toward a recession, Trump has sent mixed messages.

In an exchange with reporters in Morristown, N.J., shortly before taking off for Washington on Sunday evening, Trump brushed aside the possibility of a downturn, saying, “I don’t see a recession.”

“I mean, the world is in a recession right now — although that’s too big a statement,” he added, in a remark that appeared to undercut his effort to calm fears."

McConnell’s op-ed comes as many Democratic presidential candidates and others in the party have called for abandoning the Senate requirement to secure 60 votes to overcome a filibuster to advance most legislation.

According to a Washington Post tally, five Democratic White House hopefuls have said they believe the Senate should be able to pass bills with a simple majority, while another 11 contenders have said they are open to the change.

They argue that the lower bar would make it far easier to enact plans such as Medicare-for-all that draw little or no Republican support, assuming Democrats take control of the White House and both chambers of Congress in next year’s elections.

President Trump has also called for eliminating the filibuster, a fact left unmentioned in McConnell’s op-ed. Trump derided the “ridiculous filibuster rule” in tweets early in his tenure when Republicans struggled to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

“Strong minority rights have always been the Senate’s distinguishing feature,” McConnell wrote in his op-ed. “If that tradition frustrates the whims of those on the far left, it is their half-baked proposals and not the centuries-old wisdom that need retooling.”

McConnell noted that it might seem “odd” for the Senate majority leader to oppose a proposal that would increase the power of Republicans in his chamber.

But, he said, “there are no permanent victories in politics.”"
246,246,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/23/trumps-angry-tweets-about-china-betray-his-political-rhetoric-two-significant-ways/,0,"For all of his bluster about the strength of the economy and his purported role in guiding the country to new highs, President Trump is worried. As The Washington Post reported on Thursday, Trump is increasingly concerned about the various flashing lights indicating that the economy may be in trouble. His team is cobbling together options aimed at offsetting the worst possibilities, but one of Trump’s past decisions is widely cited as prompting the current instability: the trade war with China.

On Friday morning, Trump unveiled a tactic in the ongoing fight with the world’s most populous country.

“The vast amounts of money made and stolen by China from the United States, year after year, for decades, will and must STOP,” he wrote on Twitter. “Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your companies HOME and making your products in the USA. I will be responding to China’s Tariffs this afternoon. This is a GREAT opportunity for the United States.”

It’s been a staple of Trump’s rhetoric for some time that he will entice companies to bring manufacturing back to the United States. On the campaign trail in 2016, he would regularly tell audiences that he would make pariahs of companies that manufacture overseas.

Friday’s tweets, though, do something different. First, they aim (futilely) to be precisely the sort of government control of the private sector that has been a focus of Trump’s most fervent recent criticism (albeit in the abstract). Second, it is a demand, in short, that businesses shift more of the brunt of the trade war onto American consumers — a group which Trump has claimed would be shielded from the economic fight.

The first point is fairly self-explanatory. With the 2020 election looming, Trump has decided to focus on the alleged “socialism” of his political opponents.

Advertisement

“A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism,” Trump said at a campaign rally in New Hampshire last week, “and the destruction, the destruction of the American Dream.”

Trump’s colloquial use of “socialism” means, essentially, government social-welfare programs that cost money and don’t benefit his base. A July YouGov poll found that Republicans were more likely to see proposals such as free college education or universal health care as socialism — but less likely to apply that term to things such as Medicare or Social Security.

In reality, socialism is an economic system in which the public — generally meaning the government — controls production. (Which, Gallup found last year, Republicans are more likely to understand than Democrats.) In other words, a socialist system is one in which, say, an elected leader representing the public instructs how production should occur. By hereby ordering them to only produce in the United States, for example.

Trump’s not a socialist, of course. He’s mostly just angry that a trade war he once described as “easy to win” is not so easy to win after all. For decades, he was the CEO of the Trump Organization and could order his people to do things. As president, that instinct clearly remains even if that power doesn’t.

Share this article Share

Even if Trump did have the ability to force business to bring production back to the United States (or “onshore,” as they say), there would be negative repercussions beyond just political hypocrisy.

In May, The Post spoke with Columbia University’s David Weinstein, one of the authors of a research paper evaluating the costs to consumers of Trump’s tariffs.

He explained that the costs came in two forms. The first is that imported products subject to new tariffs necessarily get more expensive, since the government is now applying an additional tax to get them to consumers. Some of that cost will be absorbed by the companies exporting and importing the products, but some will be passed on to consumers.

The other form is that companies which use China as a source for components will look to other countries that aren’t affected by tariffs. Let’s say, for example, that a clothing manufacturer pays $10 per component to import from China instead of paying $11 to import from Vietnam. With a 25 percent tariff applied to the Chinese component, sourcing each item from China jumps to $12.50. It’s cheaper to get the product from Vietnam — though it’s still $1 more expensive than it used to be.

What’s more, there are additional costs to the company from switching: figuring out supply chains, shipping, legal issues and so on. In June, a National Retail Federation report explained how tricky shifting a supply chain could be. It reads, in part:

“The ability of U.S. retailers to shift sourcing from China to other suppliers is limited and could take years to complete. Retailers engage in a lengthy process to verify that potential new suppliers can produce the volume of products that are needed at the highest quality and at the most competitive price for consumers. These verifications include audits to ensure business partners meet various corporate social responsibility, labor, environmental, security and U.S. regulatory requirements.""

Weinstein’s research suggested that Trump’s original tariffs cost American consumers $3 billion a month in direct tariffs and another $1.4 billion from the costs of shifting supply chains. When Trump expanded the tariffs, it made re-sourcing products a relatively cheaper option. As a result, fewer products would be imported (reducing that monthly total), but supply chain costs would increase to $6.6 billion a month.

Those are costs of the trade war paid by consumers. Despite what Trump said at that same New Hampshire rally.

“We’re taking in billions of dollars in tariffs and again, China’s devaluing their currency. They’re pouring out money,” he claimed. “The prices haven’t gone up, so that means we’re taking in billions of dollars. We’re not paying for it.”

Demanding that manufacturers rejigger their supply chains means increased prices apart from the prices that have gone up because of tariffs. Trump has no power to make such a demand, of course. His tweet ordering companies to produce goods using non-Chinese suppliers not only lack legal weight, they essentially lack any weight whatsoever."

The decision to shutter the legislature for more than a month, starting no later than Sept. 12, stifled dissenters as the days ticked toward Britain’s most momentous deadline in generations. Outraged lawmakers said it concentrates power in Johnson’s hands and sharply curtails their ability to thwart a no-deal Brexit. Some spoke of a constitutional crisis.

It also suggested that Johnson’s bumbling exterior conceals a ruthless tactician, ready to exploit any opening to bring about the split from the E.U. and consolidate power.

Absent a delay, Britain will leave the European Union on Oct. 31.

If it leaves without a transition deal, analysts say, the country could face food and fuel shortages. The economic turmoil could spread to the E.U. nations, which collectively are the United States’ biggest trading partner. Many observers fear that with a hardened border, fresh violence could flare in Northern Ireland. And because President Trump has embraced Brexit and Johnson, the break with Europe would become a major test of the White House’s skepticism of multilateral institutions and trade blocs.

In Brussels, diplomats said they are increasingly convinced that Johnson will pilot Britain off the cliff without the safety net of a deal. European lawmakers expressed astonishment that he would so brazenly tie the hands of Parliament, in which a majority opposes a no-deal Brexit.

The Conservative prime minister denied claims that ­Brexit is the reason he sought the new timetable, telling reporters he wants a new session of Parliament so he can lay out the government’s “very exciting agenda.”

He added that there would be “ample time” for lawmakers to debate Brexit.

But few in Britain, even among Johnson’s allies, accepted his explanation of why he had decided to ask Queen Elizabeth II to ­“prorogue” — or suspend — Parliament. The queen, who is on holiday at her Scottish estate of Balmoral, approved the request, as is customary.

A “constitutional outrage,” John Bercow, speaker of the House of Commons, said in a statement. “However it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of prorogation now would be to stop Parliament debating Brexit and performing its duty.”

Proroguing Parliament is not unheard of — it happens most years in connection with the queen’s speech, often in May or June. But the five-week gap this time is the longest break since 1945. Recent suspensions have been measured in days, not weeks.

Johnson told reporters he asked the queen to give her usual annual speech outlining the country’s legislative agenda in mid-October, effectively suspending Parliament between Sept. 11 and Oct. 14.

The British pound swooned nearly 1 percent against the euro after the announcement before recovering slightly.

Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn promised to fight the move.

“Boris Johnson’s attempt to suspend parliament to avoid scrutiny of his plans for a reckless No Deal Brexit is an outrage and a threat to our democracy,” he wrote on Twitter. “Labour will work across Parliament to hold the government to account and prevent a disastrous No Deal.”

The controversy drew the attention of Trump, who has gravitated toward Johnson as a fellow nationalist and goaded Britain to be more aggressive about Brexit. Trump and Johnson met over the weekend at the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, France.

“Would be very hard for Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain’s Labour Party, to seek a no-confidence vote,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Boris is exactly what the U.K. has been looking for, & will prove to be ‘a great one!’ ”

Opposition leaders had talked earlier about forcing a vote of no confidence in Johnson’s government sometime before late October. Wednesday’s maneuver, if successful, would drastically narrow their window to next week or immediately before Britain drops out of the bloc.

They could also try to pass a law mandating that Johnson seek a Brexit delay.

But given how badly the opposition forces are fractured, it is unclear whether they have the votes for either option. And they have precious little time.

“Unless MPs come together to stop him next week, today will go down in history as a dark one indeed for UK democracy,” tweeted Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National Party.

In the rest of the European Union, leaders are bracing for Britain to leave without a deal. But there was anger — and some shock — that it could apparently happen with minimal input from Parliament.

“We could see a no-deal Brexit coming. Now it’s a no-debate Brexit that’s looming,” tweeted Nathalie Loiseau, a member of the European Parliament and an ally of French President Emmanuel Macron. “What disease is British democracy suffering from to fear a debate before making one of the most important decisions in its history?”

German lawmaker Norbert Röttgen, an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel tweeted: “How does respect for democracy go together with suspending parliament?!”

A petition launched on the British Parliament’s website calling for the government not to suspend the body quickly exceeded 100,000 signatures, the number needed for it to be considered for a parliamentary debate. The tally neared 1 million Wednesday night and was rocketing skyward, although any such debate would not lead to legislative action.

Johnson’s move infuriated some Conservative lawmakers who have sought to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

“This is pretty unprecedented,” said Dominic Grieve, a Conservative lawmaker. He described it as “tantamount to a coup.”

Grieve said he would consider voting against his own party if a no-confidence vote is called.

Johnson appears to be gambling that those who are against a no-deal exit won’t be able to organize quickly enough to mount an effective opposition.

“By using the political devices at hand, Boris has compressed everything into such a tight window that those who want to block a no-deal Brexit have a mountain of a task,” said Scott Lucas, a politics expert at the University of Birmingham, adding that he believed Wednesday’s move “sharply” increased the chance of a no-deal withdrawal.

Many observers say Johnson is ramping up for a possible early general election, which he says he doesn’t want. At present, he has a working majority of just one. Even if he loses a confidence vote, it is not clear that Corbyn or anyone else would be able to form an alternative government, and Johnson could campaign in a new election on a staunch anti-E.U. platform, analysts said. He faces pressure from both flanks because the Brexit Party has been growing its support.

During a week of negotiations with other E.U. leaders, including over the weekend at the G-7 summit, Johnson left his counterparts feeling that he would prefer to exit with a deal, according to officials briefed on the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private assessments.

But leaders including Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel felt Johnson was ready to depart on the October deadline if no politically feasible deal materializes in the meantime, senior officials said.

Short-circuiting debate on ­Brexit could push lawmakers, even skeptics, to vote for any new deal Johnson comes up with, just to avoid a no-deal departure.

But the officials said they think Johnson was setting an impossible task by demanding changes to the deal that would cross E.U. red lines, and they pegged the chances of a fresh compromise as low.

Comey violated FBI policies in how he handled memos that detailed his controversial interactions with President Trump, setting a “dangerous example” for bureau employees about substituting personal righteousness for established rules, the Justice Department’s internal watchdog found in a report released Thursday. The inspector general criticized Comey for keeping the government documents at his home, engineering the release of some of their contents to the news media and not telling the bureau to whom he had given them — even after he was aware that some contained classified information.

Comey told investigators that he felt the memos were personal and that he was acting in the best interests of the country. But the inspector general rejected that defense, writing that Comey’s senior FBI leaders all agreed the memos were government documents, and that the former director’s “own, personal conception of what was necessary was not an appropriate basis for ignoring the policies and agreements governing the use of FBI records.”

“The responsibility to protect sensitive law enforcement information falls in large part to the employees of the FBI who have access to it through their daily duties,” the inspector general wrote. “Former Director Comey failed to live up to this responsibility.”

By now, Comey’s memos are well-known. They described, among other things, how Trump had pressed Comey for loyalty and had asked him about letting go of an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Comey’s orchestration of the release of their contents helped spark special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s appointment to investigate possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia to affect the 2016 election. Mueller would go on to focus intently on the episodes Comey described as possible obstruction of justice by the president.

Trump on Thursday seized on the findings to lash out at Comey.

“Perhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General’s Report,” he tweeted. “He should be ashamed of himself!”

In total, the inspector general wrote, Comey wrote seven memos, documenting most of the nine one-on-one conversations he had with Trump in early 2017, just before he was fired.

Comey left three memos at the FBI, the inspector general wrote. He stored the other four documents in a safe in his home and provided copies to his personal attorneys, the inspector general found. Of those four, he gave one — which included information the inspector general called “sensitive” but unclassified — to a friend and authorized him to share its contents.

One of those memos shared with the attorneys was later determined to contain information that was classified as confidential, the lowest level of secrecy, after a review that included Comey’s FBI general counsel, the inspector general wrote.

The confidential material in that memo entailed just six words “from a statement by President Trump comparing the relative importance of returning telephone calls from three countries,” the inspector general wrote. Another memo Comey kept contained a classified “assessment of a foreign leader by President Trump,” though Comey redacted that before providing it to his attorneys, the inspector general wrote.

On Twitter, Comey noted that the inspector general found “no evidence” that he or his attorneys released any classified information to the media.

“I don’t need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a ‘sorry we lied about you’ would be nice,” he wrote. “And to all those who’ve spent two years talking about me ‘going to jail’ or being a ‘liar and a leaker’— ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long, including the president.”

Trump has previously attacked Comey over the memos and called him a “proven liar and leaker.”

The report is the second time Inspector General Michael Horowitz has criticized Comey for how he handled FBI business during his abbreviated tenure in charge of the bureau. Last summer, Horowitz lambasted Comey for his leadership of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, accusing him of insubordination and flouting Justice Department policies in deciding only he had the authority and credibility to make key decisions on the case and speak about it publicly.

The inspector general wrote that his office gave its findings to the Justice Department to determine whether Comey had committed a crime and that officials declined to prosecute the case. Conservatives, though, used the finding to attack Comey.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said in a statement that it was a “stunning and unprecedented rebuke of a former Director of the FBI.”

George J. Terwilliger III, a former deputy attorney general and acting attorney general under George H.W. Bush, said the inspector general had described “a gross abuse of institutional power and authority.”

“And for someone who claims on a regular basis the mantle of righteousness, Comey should be ashamed of what he did,” Terwilliger said.

Former deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller and has been conspicuously critical of Comey, seemed to draw attention to the report in a tweet on Thursday, quoting from a letter he penned in 2018 to the Senate Judiciary Committee that talked of following the rules.

“It is important .. to follow established policies and procedures, especially when the stakes are high,” Rosenstein wrote. “We should be most on guard when we believe that our own uncomfortable .. circumstances justify ignoring .. principles respected by our predecessors.”

That Comey had in his possession material that was later deemed classified and shared it with his lawyers has also rankled liberals. It was Comey, after all, who said Clinton and her aides were “extremely careless” in their handling of classified information in their use of a private email server.

Many Clinton supporters say the FBI’s investigation into that matter — and Comey’s revelation on the eve of the 2016 election that the case was resuming — cost her the presidency. As an FBI employee, Comey had to surrender all bureau materials upon leaving his job and abide by a “lifelong” duty to protect classified material, the inspector general wrote.

The New York Times first made some of the contents of Comey’s memos public on May 11, 2017, publishing a story about how, at a private dinner, Trump asked him for the loyalty pledge. Later, it published another story detailing Comey and Trump’s conversation about Flynn.

Comey would later admit that he had engineered the release of some of that information through a friend, Daniel Richman, a Columbia Law School professor who served as a special government employee at the FBI while Comey was director. Comey claimed he did not authorize Richman to serve as a source for the story on May 11, but did for the later piece.

None of it was authorized by the FBI. When Comey revealed what he had done at a June 2017 congressional hearing, senior bureau leaders were taken aback, the inspector general wrote.

Earlier that month, Comey had reviewed the memos and seen the classification markings the FBI had applied to the memos after he had left, the inspector general wrote.

FBI officials scrambled to get in touch with Richman, who told them Comey had also shared the material with his other lawyers, the inspector general wrote.

The memo provided to Richman was determined to be “For Official Use Only” but did not contain classified information, the inspector general wrote. But because other memos Comey shared with attorneys had material deemed classified, officials had to track down who had accessed the documents so they could be secured, the inspector general wrote.

“Members of Comey’s senior leadership team used the adjectives ‘surprised,’ ‘stunned,’ ‘shocked,’ and ‘disappointment’ to describe their reactions to learning that Comey acted on his own to provide the contents of Memo 4, through Richman, to a reporter,” the inspector general wrote."

On Monday, Mitt Romney will do the same with his advisers in Denver, two days before the rivals take the stage at the University of Denver for a 90-minute faceoff focused on the economy.

With Obama assuming a small but clear lead in the polls with five weeks remaining in the race, the candidates' willingness to nearly disappear from public view for 48 to 72 hours reflects the high stakes of the three October debates for both men.

If 2008 is a guide, the nationally televised debates could reach audiences of up to 60 million viewers, by far the largest platform either nominee will have to reach voters. Both sides view the debates collectively as the event with the most potential to alter the dynamics of the race in the final month.

Republican strategists, fretting over Obama’s recent rise, said the debates could be the last best chance for Romney to deliver a decisive blow, change the narrative and steady his campaign. They said Romney would try to force the president out of his comfort zone by attacking Obama’s economic record, then hope the president blunders trying to defend it.

“The president has compiled a miserable economic record over the last four years, with higher unemployment, lower incomes, rising energy costs, out-of-control Washington spending,” Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom said. “Those are some of the issues you can expect Mitt Romney to talk about.”

Asked about the stakes Friday, Romney told reporters that the public ""will listen carefully to the conversation . . . and they'll decide who can help their family, who will be able to get our economy going.""

If he is persuasive, Romney added, “I’ll get elected.”

Obama and his advisers say they recognize the risks. They have sought to play down expectations, noting that this will be Obama’s first debate in four years, while Romney has had more recent practice with a string of primary debates. Obama campaign manager Jim Messina called Romney a “very skilled debater” and said that Romney won 19 of the 23 Republican primary debates.

“The Romney team has made no secret of the intense preparation of their candidate, and historically challengers benefit from simply being on the stage with the incumbent,” Messina said this week. “So we are clear-eyed about how prepared he will be and about how difficult this debate will be.”

Preparation

Although his advisers have been mum on the details, the president’s cram sessions are likely to include rigorous policy briefings, mock debates — with Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) playing the role of Romney — and a critical review of Obama’s own bad habits.

Obama has been concentrating on shortening his responses, aides said, because his tendency to slip into professor mode when explaining things limits the media-friendly sound bites that can form lasting impressions on viewers.

“The president is familiar with his own loquaciousness,” campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, fretting that run-on responses can be a drawback in debates with a time clock.

Romney has been blocking out an hour or two nearly each day to study Obama’s policies and reviewing briefing books. He also spent the week of the Democratic National Convention rehearsing for the debate.

Romney will conduct a two-day boot camp, with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) playing the role of the president, as Portman did in 2008 to prepare Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) for debates with Obama. Portman has been a semi-regular on the Romney campaign plane in the past several weeks.

As Romney aides are quick to point out, Obama has participated in one-on-one debates more recently than Romney, who hasn’t faced a head-to-head matchup since his successful Massachusetts governor’s race in 2002.

This summer, the president had several practice sessions at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington. Senior White House adviser David Plouffe, communications director Dan Pfeiffer, strategist Anita Dunn and others provided guidance. Kerry was tapped to stand in for Romney because of his familiarity with both the debate format and Romney’s record in Massachusetts.

Aides said the president will again frame the election as a choice between his and Romney’s policies. Obama has warned voters that his rival would harm the middle class by giving tax breaks to the wealthy and rolling back Wall Street regulations.

Strategies

Republican strategists cautioned that the president is a skilled orator, one whose windy approach could help him deflect criticism, filibuster through answers and run out the clock. The key for Romney, they said, is to force Obama to stray from his prepared script.

These strategists point to recent moments such as when Obama, pressed during a televised Univision forum in Miami, stated that he has been unable to ""change Washington from the inside,"" a remark Romney pounced on to suggest the president has been a failure in his first term.

“This is the first time in four years where the president is standing toe-to-toe with a person on a stage who will have no reticence telling him directly to his face what a bad job he’s doing, and that’s always a dangerous moment for the president,” said GOP strategist Steve Schmidt, who managed McCain’s campaign. Romney is “going to want to go out and draw blood.”

GOP strategists say that Obama also can come across as arrogant. During the Democratic primary in 2008, Obama was mocked when he told then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton during a debate that she was ""likable enough,"" an aside that struck many viewers as condescending.

""President Obama is obviously charismatic, a good speaker,"" said Charlie Black, another GOP consultant who helped McCain in 2008. ""His only mistakes or rough patches are when there are unanticipated questions or he has not rehearsed something. . . . He's combative, and he can even be dismissive.""

Romney will have his own challenges. Although he generally stood out as the best performer in the GOP primary field, Romney became the object of some ridicule after a December debate in which he offered to make a $10,000 bet with Texas Gov. Rick Perry over a disagreement on health-care policy. For some, the moment reinforced the perception that Romney's wealth renders him out of touch with ordinary Americans.

Against Obama, Romney “must forcefully insert himself into the conversation,” said GOP communications consultant Brett O’Donnell, who was widely credited with helping Romney shore up his primary debate performances.

""He can't let the president filibuster,"" added O'Donnell, who has since left the Romney campaign after reportedly clashing with other aides. ""He has to stay on offense, not by attacking but by staying on message and focusing on the economy and tying the president to his economic policies."""

Trump’s interaction with the foreign leader included a “promise” that was regarded as so troubling that it prompted an official in the U.S. intelligence community to file a formal whistleblower complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence community, said the former officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

It was not immediately clear which foreign leader Trump was speaking with or what he pledged to deliver, but his direct involvement in the matter has not been previously disclosed. It raises new questions about the president’s handling of sensitive information and may further strain his relationship with U.S. spy agencies. One former official said the communication was a phone call.

The White House declined to comment late Wednesday night. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and a lawyer representing the whistleblower declined to comment.

Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson determined that the complaint was credible and troubling enough to be considered a matter of “urgent concern,” a legal threshold that requires notification of congressional oversight committees.

But acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire has refused to share details about Trump’s alleged transgression with lawmakers, touching off a legal and political dispute that has spilled into public view and prompted speculation that the spy chief is improperly protecting the president.

The dispute is expected to escalate Thursday when Atkinson is scheduled to appear before the House Intelligence Committee in a classified session closed to the public. The hearing is the latest move by committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to compel U.S. intelligence officials to disclose the full details of the whistleblower complaint to Congress. Maguire has agreed to testify before the panel next week, according to a statement by Schiff. He declined to comment for this article.

The inspector general “determined that this complaint is both credible and urgent,” Schiff said in the statement released Wednesday evening. “The committee places the highest importance on the protection of whistleblowers and their complaints to Congress.”

The complaint was filed with Atkinson’s office on Aug. 12, a date on which Trump was at his golf resort in New Jersey. White House records indicate that Trump had had conversations or interactions with at least five foreign leaders in the preceding five weeks.

Among them was a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin that the White House initiated on July 31. Trump also received at least two letters from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during the summer, describing them as “beautiful” messages. In June, Trump said publicly that he was opposed to certain CIA spying operations against North Korea. Referring to a Wall Street Journal report that the agency had recruited Kim’s half brother, Trump said, “I would tell him that would not happen under my auspices.”

Trump’s handling of classified information has been a source of concern to U.S. intelligence officials since the outset of his presidency. In May 2017, Trump revealed classified information about espionage operations in Syria to senior Russian officials in the Oval Office, disclosures that prompted a scramble among White House officials to contain the potential damage.

Statements and letters exchanged between the offices of the DNI and the House Intelligence Committee in recent days have pointed at the White House without directly implicating the president.

Schiff has said he was told that the complaint concerned “conduct by someone outside of the Intelligence Community.” Jason Klitenic, the DNI general counsel, noted in a letter sent to congressional leaders on Tuesday that the activity at the root of the complaint “involves confidential and potentially privileged communications.”

The dispute has put Maguire, thrust into the DNI job in an acting capacity with the resignation of Daniel Coats last month, at the center of a politically perilous conflict with constitutional implications.

Schiff has demanded full disclosure of the whistleblower complaint. Maguire has defended his refusal by asserting that the subject of the complaint is beyond his jurisdiction.

Defenders of Maguire disputed that he is subverting legal requirements to protect Trump, saying that he is trapped in a legitimate legal predicament and that he has made his displeasure clear to officials at the Justice Department and White House.

After fielding the complaint on Aug. 12, Atkinson submitted it to Maguire two weeks later. By law, Maguire is required to transmit such complaints to Congress within seven days. But in this case, he refrained from doing so after turning for legal guidance to officials at the Justice Department.

In a sign of Atkinson’s discomfort with this situation, the inspector general informed the House and Senate intelligence committees of the existence of the whistleblower complaint — without revealing its substance — in early September.

Schiff responded with almost immediate indignation, firing off a letter demanding a copy of the complaint and warning that he was prepared to subpoena senior U.S. intelligence officials. The DNI has asserted that lawyers determined there was no notification requirement because the whistleblower complaint did not constitute an urgent concern that was “within the responsibility and authority” of Maguire’s office.

Legal experts said there are scenarios in which a president’s communications with a foreign leader could rise to the level of an “urgent concern” for the intelligence community, but they also noted that the president has broad authority to decide unilaterally when to classify or declassify information.

Revealing how the United States obtained sensitive information could “compromise intelligence means and methods and potentially the lives of sources,” said Joel Brenner, former inspector general for the National Security Agency.

It was unclear whether the whistleblower witnessed Trump’s communication with the foreign leader or learned of it through other means. Summaries of such conversations are often distributed among White House staff, although the administration imposed new limits on this practice after Trump’s disclosures to Russian officials were revealed."

The leaders of the world’s two largest democracies took the stage together in Houston before a roaring crowd of tens of thousands of Indian Americans, where Modi delivered an unmistakable endorsement of Trump’s presidency and cast their joint appearance in historic terms.

“His name is familiar to every person on the planet,” Modi said as he introduced Trump. “He was a household name and very popular even before he went on to occupy the highest office in this great country. From CEO to commander in chief. From boardrooms to the Oval Office. From studios to global stage.”

The prime minister then repurposed his own campaign slogan in India to rally support for “my friend” Trump in the United States: “Abki baar, Trump sarkar,” meaning, “This time, a Trump government.”

Modi’s overtures come at a delicate moment in U.S.-India relations. After the United States imposed tariffs on Indian steel and aluminum imports, India has been looking for ways to decrease trade tensions with the Trump administration and stimulate fresh investment.

The two leaders — both center-right politicians who govern with big personalities and stir controversy — are set to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week.

Trump swooped into Houston on Sunday with an unusual role: as a warm-up act.

Called “Howdy, Modi!,” the event was staged to honor the prime minister and was billed as the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader other than the pope. Attendees, many of them from Texas’s large Indian community, packed into NRG Stadium, the 72,000-seat home to the the National Football League’s Houston Texans. Houston is the nation’s most diverse city and home to an estimated 150,000 Indian Americans.

Modi recently invited Trump to join him here, and the president agreed to be a special guest, but the signage and stagecraft made clear that Modi was the main attraction, with his image projected on large screens throughout the arena.

“In Houston, we say ‘Howdy’ in more than 140 languages — and this morning we are saying ‘Howdy’ to Prime Minister Modi,” Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, told the crowd.

The event pulsed with energy all morning, as artists performed Indian dances and played music onstage. Once Trump arrived, live video of him and Modi walking down a red carpet winding through the bowels of the stadium played on the screens as a drum band played in anticipation of their grand entrance. The two strode onto the stage holding hands.

As Trump stood at his side grinning widely, Modi said he admired Trump’s “concern for every American, a belief in America’s future and a strong resolve to make America great again.”

The prime minister added, “We are witnessing history in the making.”

Trump delivered remarks — and, unlike at his own campaign rallies, did not appear to stray from his script on Teleprompters.

The president highlighted his stewardship of the economy, but drew far most impassioned responses from the crowd when he talked about other issues. The president received a standing ovation when he denounced “radical Islamic terrorism,” and sustained applause when he vowed to stop illegal immigration.

He said Modi was doing “a truly exceptional job” as prime minister, and congratulated him on his overwhelming reelection victory in May.

Trump then took a seat in the audience to watch Modi give the keynote address in his native Hindi.

In the 2016 election, Trump won the support of roughly 14 percent of Indian American voters, compared to 84 percent for Hillary Clinton, according to an analysis by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund.

But Trump made a direct pitch to expand his share of support among Indian Americans in his 2020 reelection. In his speech, he cited the estimated 4 million Indian Americans living here.

“You enrich our culture, you uphold our values, you uplift our communities and you are truly proud to be American — and we are proud to have you as Americans,” Trump said. “We thank you, we love you, and I want you to know my administration is fighting for you each and every day.”

“We are going to take care of our citizens first, our Indian American citizens, before we take care of illegal immigrants who want to pour into our country,” Trump said.

M.R. Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora and an organizer of Sunday’s event, said there was an opportunity for Trump to improve upon his 2016 vote margin.

“He could hope he could change some minds,” Rangaswami said. “It could happen.”

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said Trump was smart to come to Houston and take advantage of the large audience assembled to see Modi.

“Politics being what politics is, it’s really important to show up and to listen respectfully and try to find common ground with these constituents,” Cornyn told reporters. “I don’t think it’s any accident the president decided to come.”

“Of course, he loves a good rally,” Cornyn added. “You might have heard that.”

Later in the day, Trump traveled to Wapakoneta, Ohio, where Australian businessman Anthony Pratt celebrated the opening of his newest cardboard manufacturing plant in the United States and introduced his country’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, and Trump.

“As a result of this paper mill, we are now the largest Australian employer of Americans,” said Pratt, who said his company now employs 9,000 workers in the United States.

After Pratt’s remarks, Trump spoke and lavished praise on Morrison for helping to create a $65 billion annual trade relationship with the United States. “He has become a very good friend of mine, he believes a lot of the same things I do,” Trump said.

Morrison returned the praise in brief remarks, saying: “We are here to celebrate jobs.”"

Officials at the Office of Management and Budget relayed Trump’s order to the State Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting in mid-July, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. They explained that the president had “concerns” and wanted to analyze whether the money needed to be spent.

Administration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an “interagency process” but to give them no additional information — a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11.

Trump’s order to withhold aid to Ukraine a week before his July 25 call with Volodymyr Zelensky is likely to raise questions about the motivation for his decision and fuel suspicions on Capitol Hill that Trump sought to leverage congressionally approved aid to damage a political rival. The revelation comes as lawmakers clash with the White House over a related whistleblower complaint made by an intelligence official alarmed by Trump’s actions — and as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is said to be exploring whether it’s time to allow impeachment proceedings.

Republican senators on the Senate Appropriations Committee said Sept. 12 that the aid to Ukraine had been held up while the Trump administration explored whether Zelensky, the country’s new president, was pro-Russian or pro-Western. They said the White House decided to release the aid after Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) threatened to freeze $5 billion in Pentagon funding for next year unless the money for 2019 was distributed.

One senior administration official said Monday that Trump’s decision to hold back the funds was based on his concerns about there being “a lot of corruption in Ukraine” and that the determination to release the money was motivated by the fiscal year’s looming close on Sept. 30.

There was concern within the administration that if they did not spend the money, they would run afoul of the law, this official said, noting that, eventually, Trump gave the OMB’s acting director, Russell Vought, permission to release the money. The official emphatically denied that there was any link between blocking the aid and pressing Zelensky into investigating the Bidens, stating: “It had nothing to do with a quid pro quo.”

But on Capitol Hill, Democrats were calling for an investigation of what they viewed as potential “extortion,” as Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the Foreign Relations Committee’s ranking Democrat, put it Monday. Trump, he said, is trying to “reshape American foreign policy” to advance his personal and political goals.

“I don’t think it really matters . . . whether the president explicitly told the Ukrainians that they wouldn’t get their security aid if they didn’t interfere in the 2020 elections,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “There is an implicit threat in every demand that a United States president makes of a foreign power. . . . That foreign country knows that if they don’t do it, there are likely to be consequences.”

Trump on Monday repeated his denial of doing anything improper and insisted that his July 25 conversation with Zelensky was “a perfect phone call.” He also hinted that he may release a transcript of it.

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley rejected claims that Trump was engaged in a quid pro quo. “But because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they’ll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this president,” Gidley said.

Zelensky’s “entire” administration was concerned “that the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence for their unwillingness, at the time, to investigate the Bidens,” Murphy said, citing his interactions with numerous Ukrainian officials during an early September trip there. Murphy said he heard “directly” from Zelensky about “his concern about why the aid was being cut off to Ukraine,” though the Ukraine’s new president did not specifically broach the subject of a quid pro quo.

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases — at one point, threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

Trump’s allies have frequently said he has been better about distributing military aid, and specifically lethal aid, to Ukraine than his predecessor. Yet according to Democratic and Republican aides, no administration has withheld funds as long and as mysteriously as the Trump administration did this year since the United States began helping Ukraine fend off Russian-backed separatists in the country’s eastern provinces.

Congressional officials were notified twice this year, on Feb. 28 and again on May 23, that the administration intended to release large tranches of military aid to Ukraine. Congress approved two large pots of military aid for Ukraine during fiscal 2019: $250 million, to be managed by the Pentagon, for equipment such as sniper rifles, counter-artillery radar systems, ammunition and grenade launchers; and $141 million, to be funneled through the State Department, for maritime security, NATO interoperability and various initiatives to help Ukraine’s military fend off Russian aggression.

Despite those notifications, the money was not transmitted until this month.

According to administration officials, discussions about Ukrainian aid began in June. Withholding aid from foreign governments is something the president has frequently requested, such as with Central American countries when he said they were not doing their part to help the United States with immigrants amassing at the southern border.

Former national security adviser John Bolton wanted to release the money to Ukraine because he thought it would help the country while curtailing Russian aggression. But Trump has said he was primarily concerned with corruption.

“It’s very important to talk about corruption,” Trump told reporters. “If you don’t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

Besides Bolton, several other administration officials said they did not know why the aid was being canceled or why a meeting was not being scheduled.

The decision was communicated to State and Defense officials on July 18, officials familiar with the meeting said.

By mid-August, lawmakers were acutely aware that the OMB had assumed all decision-making authority from the Defense and State departments and was delaying the distribution of the aid through a series of short-term notices. Several congressional officials questioned whether the OMB had the legal authority to direct federal agencies not to spend money that Congress had already authorized, aides said.

Spokespeople for the Pentagon and the State Department declined to comment.

Mid-August is also when a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint regarding Trump and Ukraine to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Atkinson informed the House and Senate intelligence committees of the complaint’s existence Sept. 9 — the same day three House committees launched an investigation to determine whether Trump and his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, had improperly pushed Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.

Capitol Hill has not been briefed on the details of the whistleblower complaint, on orders of the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, who after consulting with the Justice Department and the White House declined to transmit the complaint to lawmakers. On Thursday, Maguire is set to testify publicly before the House Intelligence Committee and in a closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

403,403,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/09/25/carson-king-viral-busch-light-star-old-iowa-reporter-tweets/,0,"Update: On Thursday, the Des Moines Register announced that Aaron Calvin, the reporter behind the story, no longer works for the paper. On Sept. 14, an Iowa man named Carson King went viral after holding a sign on ESPN’s “College GameDay” asking for donations on Venmo to pay for his “Busch Light Supply.” When cash unexpectedly poured in, King decided to give it to a local children’s hospital instead of buying beer, leading Venmo and Anheuser-Busch to pledge matching donations.

That’s when Des Moines Register reporter Aaron Calvin set out to profile King — and found two offensive tweets the 24-year-old had sent when he was 16.

That discovery has now sparked an acrimonious conflict, as King quickly lost his partnership with Anheuser-Busch, and the Des Moines Register scrambled to explain its decision to report on the old tweets in the first place — particularly after critics Tuesday turned up multiple offensive tweets once sent by Calvin, forcing the paper to open a new investigation into its own reporter.

“Some of the toughest decisions in journalism are about what to publish ⁠ — or not,” Des Moines Register executive editor Carol Hunter wrote in a Tuesday statement defending the paper’s choice to report on King’s old posts, adding that “such decisions are not made lightly and are rooted in what we perceive as the public good.”

The story marks the latest battle over “cancel culture,” the same debate over how to handle offensive statements that roiled the comedy world earlier this month when “Saturday Night Live” fired a new featured player over racist language he’d used about Asian people on a podcast.

King’s social media missteps came to light after Calvin, a trending news reporter at the Register, delved far back into the casino security guard’s old tweets. Calvin discovered two 2012 tweets, written when King was in high school, that the Register described as “racist jokes, one comparing black mothers to gorillas and another making light of black people killed in the holocaust.” When Calvin asked King about the tweets, he told the reporter seeing them made him feel “sick.”

Before the Register published its profile online, though, King held a news conference on Tuesday evening to apologize for the posts and to announce that Anheuser-Busch had ended its partnership with him. The beer maker still promised to donate the more than $350,000 it had already pledged to the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics.

King explained that the tweets had been jokes among friends watching Comedy Central’s “Tosh.0” and that he didn’t remember them until Calvin dug them up.

“Once he pointed it out and I went back and looked at it I was really upset with myself,” King said on Twitter, adding that he did not blame the newspaper, which he said had been “nothing but kind in all of their coverage.”

But online, backlash to the Register’s reporting began brewing immediately.

Critics questioned why Calvin had dug so far into the past of a previously ordinary person who wasn’t directly profiting from his newfound, accidental fame. Conservative bloggers latched on to the incident as an example of alleged hypocrisy of reporters tarring people’s reputations based on long-ago poor decisions.

Many balked when Anheuser-Busch announced Tuesday afternoon that the company had cut ties with King, saying his posts “do not align with our values as a brand or as a company.” The Des Moines Register published a story Wednesday clarifying that Busch cut ties with King seven hours before the newspaper’s profile appeared online and the company did not learn about the tweets from either King or the reporter.

Around 9:30 p.m., the Register published the profile, which mentions King’s offensive tweets deep in the story.

As a clamor grew against that decision, the newspaper’s executive editor published a letter on Twitter shortly before midnight, explaining in detail the editors’ deliberations and why they decided to include the tweets. She said that staff heavily debated whether to write about King’s two offensive tweets.

“The jokes were highly inappropriate and were public posts. Shouldn’t that be acknowledged to all the people who had donated money to King’s cause or were planning to do so?” Hunter wrote. “The counter arguments: The tweets were posted seven years ago, when King was 16. And he was remorseful. Should we chalk up the posts to a youthful mistake and omit the information?”

The paper’s editors landed on a compromise, Hunter said: Publishing the information, but not making it a major focus of the story.

“Eventually, Register editors decided we would include the information, but at the bottom of the story,” she said. “We thought we should be transparent about what we had found, but not highlight it at the top of the story or as a separate story.”

The statement did little to quell the anger bubbling on Twitter. And that fury intensified as critics began digging through Calvin’s old tweets — and soon found several that appeared to be at least as problematic as King’s two racist jokes riffing off a 2012 comedy show.

Between 2010 and 2013, Calvin published tweets that used a racist slur for black people, made light of abusing women, used the word “gay” as a pejorative and mocked the legalization of same-sex marriage by saying he was “totally going to marry a horse.” The Register’s statement on Twitter was soon flooded with images of the reporter’s offensive comments.

By late Tuesday night, Calvin began deleting old tweets, and then locked his account early Wednesday morning after posting an apology.

“Hey just wanted to say that I have deleted previous tweets that have been inappropriate or insensitive,” he wrote on Twitter. “I apologize for not holding myself to the same high standards as the Register holds others.”

When reached for comment early Wednesday morning, Hunter said the Register was aware of the posts, but declined to comment further on Calvin’s old tweets beyond noting the investigation.

In response to Busch rescinding it’s offer to provide a one-year supply of beer to King in cans embossed with his face, several local brands pledged new donations to the fundraiser, the Des Moines Register reported Wednesday.

Iowa-based Goldie’s Ice Cream Shoppe created a beer-flavored soft-serve. The ice cream shop originally planned to make a Busch Light-flavor, but changed course Wednesday and will instead use beer donated by Iowa’s Gezellig Brewing Company. Smokey Row Coffee, a local cafe, promised half-priced pumpkin spice lattes until Monday. DeWit Construction, which employs King’s brother, will still give $300 for every new roof installed during the fundraiser. Nearby in Illinois, Geneseo Brewing Co. announced plans for an “Iowa Legend” pilsner, taking back the label from Busch, which had planned to print the title below King’s face on its cans.

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) also carried through with plans to declare Saturday “Carson King Day.” King plans to lead the “Hawkeye Wave” to children treated at the hospital at the University of Iowa football game scheduled for that day.

But the next five days matter more than most when it comes to the race's final outcome. Here's why: There are two seminal events in the campaign this week -- the first presidential debate on Wednesday night and the release of the September jobs report on Friday morning.

Yes, we know -- and have written about -- the fact that the general election debates in a presidential race may be less than meets the eye. And, yes, we know that the economy may well be a settled issue for most voters already -- a phenomenon expertly documented by BuzzFeed's Ben Smith and Zeke Miller.

But the simple fact is that, for the 6 to 8 percent of the electorate who remains genuinely undecided (sidebar: Who are these people?!), the next five days could set a narrative that will push them to a choice sometime between now and Nov. 6.

Let's run through three possible scenarios for how the week could play out -- and what it might mean for the race.

Scenario #1: Solid Romney debate, bad (under 80,000 jobs created) jobs report

Romney has beaten the campaign collapse story back over the last few days as poll numbers in places like Iowa suggest what most smart political types knew all along: the country is too divided for Obama to run away with the election. If Romney looks up to the job Wednesday night and then the jobs report produces less-than-expected in terms of job creation, by this time next week the ""Romney momentum"" storyline will be in full swing.

Scenario #2: Obama unscathed in debate, good (150,000 jobs created) jobs report

The last three weeks or so have been the best of Obama's presidential campaign to date (nice timing if you are a Democrat). If Obama is seen to have survived Wednesday's debate without taking any direct hits from Romney AND the jobs report produces some good-ish news, it would affirm the idea that the incumbent's case for a second term is growing stronger as the election approaches. Remember that much of the progress Obama has made nationally and in swing states in recent weeks is due to a renewed optimism about the economy and the direction of the country; if Obama has a strong jobs report to point to for the final month of the campaign, it will only make that argument more powerful to undecided voters.

Scenario #3: Debate draw, mediocre (100,000 jobs created) jobs report

Combine a debate that decides nothing with a jobs report that tells us nothing (really) about the direction of the economy, and this week will amount to a push -- setting the stage for the second and third debates later this month to potentially make more of a difference. One thought on a mediocre jobs report: The growing optimism we mentioned above doesn't seem to be based on any particular economic indicator, since all of the indicators seem to be pointing in different directions. That suggests that no new news is good news for Obama on the economic front. If the jobs report produces headlines that point to a lack of clarity in the jobs picture, that sort of status quo-ness could well allow the incumbent to keep the perception of momentum -- or at least lurching progress -- he has been able to build over the past few weeks.

Mixed signals from Romney camp on debate expectations: While the Romney campaign was lowering expectations for its first debate, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), in two separate Sunday show appearances, raised them -- a lot.

Christie, one of Romney's top surrogates and the keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention, said Wednesday's debate is a chance to ""restart"" the campaign.

“I have absolute confidence that when we get to Thursday morning, George, all of you are going to be shaking your head saying it’s a brand new race with 33 days to go,” Christie said on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos.”

At the same time, Romney's vice presidential nominee was playing down the debate's importance.

“I don’t think one event is going to make or break this campaign,” Ryan said on “Fox News Sunday.""

Christie's comments aside, Romney's campaign has worked hard to lower expectations, as has Obama's campaign. If Romney doesn't perform well now, Democrats can point to Christie's comments as proof that the campaign was planning on a game-changing performance.

Romney op-ed hits Obama's foreign policy: Romney's campaign isn't letting off the gas when it comes to attacking Obama's foreign policy, with the candidate authoring an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal late Sunday night.

""We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none,"" Romney said of the situation in the Middle East. ""And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few weeks.""

The White House late on Friday revealed that it believed the killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya on Sept. 11 was part of a planned terror plot rather than a spontaneous mob action, as it had previously posited.

The issue is threatening to distract from what has been a very good couple weeks for the Obama campaign, and Romney's campaign -- after initially whiffing on Libya -- is clearly taking another stab at it. (Worth noting: Wednesday's debate will focus on domestic -- not foreign -- policy).

Obama sought to parry Romney’s criticisms, charging that his presidential rival favors a top-down approach to the economy that would reward the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the middle class and that the details of the Republican’s proposals don’t add up. But he found himself on the defensive repeatedly during their first debate, held at the University of Denver.

Romney came into the 90-minute exchange after several difficult weeks but appeared rejuvenated by the opportunity to take his case directly to Obama and the American people. He was well prepared and aggressive as he hammered the president. The contrast with Obama was striking, as the president appeared less energetic even as he rebutted some of Romney's toughest attacks.

The debate is likely to give Romney what he needed most, which is a fresh look from voters — at least those who are undecided or open to changing their minds — and will change the conversation about the campaign, which for the past two weeks has been tilted in the president's favor. Romney now faces the challenge of trying to build on his performance and keep the president on the defensive in the days ahead.

Romney offered conservative policies throughout the evening but he often sounded more moderate than he does in campaign appearances. He is likely to face a challenge from Obama and the Democrats in the coming days about the contrast in tone and posture on display during the night.

But Republicans were immediately cheered by the aggressiveness they saw in Romney and took it as a sign that he will wage a fierce battle between now and Nov. 6.

PBS’s Jim Lehrer moderated the forum, which included a more open format that encouraged a free-flowing discussion, and most of the exchanges focused on the economy, the federal budget deficit and health care. The debate was generally civil and proved to be one of the most substantive and detailed in recent memory.

The weak economy has long been Obama’s biggest obstacle to reelection. On Wednesday, he argued that, although the country faces problems, it has begun to “fight our way back” because of his policies and the resilience of the American people.

“Over the last 30 months, we’ve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise. But we all know that we’ve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we’ve been but where we’re going.”

But Romney said the status quo “is not going to cut it” for struggling families. “Under the president’s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They’re just being crushed. Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a tax in and of itself. I’ll call it the economy tax. It’s been crushing.”

Romney clearly came to the debate determined to change his image as someone who cares little for ordinary Americans, a view that was heightened by his dismissive comments about the roughly 47 percent of Americans who pay no income taxes.

Throughout much of the early part of the debate, he sought to portray himself as a protector of the middle class, not the wealthy. He said that he would not raise taxes on middle-class families and that he would not reduce the share of taxes paid by the wealthiest Americans.

Advertisement

Obama, however, said that Romney’s tax plan would do just that. He said his rival favors a $5 trillion tax cut and argued that eliminating loopholes and deductions for the wealthiest Americans would not provide enough revenue to avoid deepening the deficit. He said Romney would either have to cut into middle-class benefits or reduce spending on vital programs.

“The magnitude of the tax cuts that you’re talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people but, more importantly, would not help us grow,” the president said.

Romney repeatedly has declined to specify what loopholes and deductions he would eliminate and passed up opportunities to do so again Wednesday. But he said Obama had mischaracterized his tax plan, saying that it does not include a $5 trillion cut.

“Let me repeat what I said,” Romney said. “I’m not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That’s not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit.”

Obama and Romney clashed over Medicare, with both promising to protect the health-care program for seniors. Obama accused Romney of wanting to turn it into a voucher program, while Romney claimed that the president cut $716 million from Medicare to help pay for the Affordable Care Act.

Romney was eager to launch into a critique of the landmark legislation that he cited as his top example of programs that must be eliminated to close the federal deficit. “I apologize, Mr. President,” Romney added after referring to the program as Obamacare. “I use that term with respect.”

“I like it,” Obama quickly responded, but that was about their only real point of agreement.

Romney argued that the program would raise health-care costs and make it less likely that businesses would hire new workers. He accused Obama of establishing an unelected board to make health-care decisions for patients, and of cutting more than $700 billion from Medicare to help pay for the law. And he chastised the incumbent for “pushing through” legislation of such magnitude without a single Republican vote.

“I just don’t know how the president could have come into office — facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the kitchen table — and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people,” Romney said. “It has killed jobs.”

Obama pushed back, particularly on the point about the cut to Medicare, which he explained, and independent analysis has shown, does not include direct reductions to benefits for seniors but rather ratchets down payments to providers, including insurance companies.

The president noted that Romney has promised to repeal Obamacare on his first day in office, yet more recently has said he wants to keep some of its provisions, notably its protections for patients with preexisting conditions and the rights of young adults to remain on their parents’ insurance plans.

Obama also reminded viewers that his law was modeled heavily on the health-care law that Romney championed when he was governor of Massachusetts. “We’ve seen this model work really well in Massachusetts,” the president said.

“He now says he’s going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don’t have to worry,” Obama added. “And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves: Is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they’re too good?”

Romney defended his plan in Massachusetts, saying he had not raised taxes and had pushed through the bill with significant numbers of Democratic votes.

On energy, Obama said Romney would continue to favor tax breaks for the oil industry. Romney retorted by noting that the Obama administration has invested more than $90 billion in green-energy projects, “about about 50 years’ worth of what oil and gas receives.”

On regulatory issues, Romney attacked the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which overhauled regulation of the financial industry, but he said that some regulations are needed and that he would keep them. Obama scoffed at Romney’s promise to repeal Wall Street regulation that he signed into law, saying: “Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate.”

Near the end of the debate, Lehrer asked the candidates how they might make Washington work more effectively. Romney said he would do what he had done with a Democratic legislature in Massachusetts: work out compromises.

Obama said that might be difficult if one of Romney’s first efforts were to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which he said would anger Democrats in Congress. And he accused Romney of being hostage to the most conservative elements of the Republican Party.

“I’ve got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party,” he said."

There they go again. Both President Obama and former governor Mitt Romney tossed out a blizzard of statistics and facts, often of dubious origin. Here are some highlights from the first presidential debate of 2012, with thanks to the readers who tweeted suggestions to #FactCheckThis

How can both facts be true? The $5 trillion figure comes from the fact that Romney has proposed to cut tax rates by 20 percent and eliminate the estate tax and alternative minimum tax. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says that would reduce tax revenue by nearly $500 billion in 2015, or about $5 trillion over 10 years

But Romney also has said he will make his plan “revenue neutral” by eliminating tax loopholes and deductions, although he has not provided the details.

Advertisement

The Tax Policy Center has analyzed the specifics of Romney’s plan thus far released and concluded that the numbers aren’t there to make it revenue neutral.

In the debate, Romney countered that ""six other studies"" have found that not to be the case, but he's wrong about that. Those studies actually do not provide much evidence that Romney's proposal — as sketchy as it is — would be revenue neutral without making unrealistic assumptions.

Given the uncertainty, the Obama campaign has assumed the worst about Romney’s plan — that it would mean higher taxes for middle-class Americans — even though, as Romney stated, there is no chance he would try to implement such a plan as president.

Though Obama often claims that his deficit-reduction plan has the “balanced approach” of the Simpson-Bowles deficit commission proposal offered by the co-chairmen, the Simpson-Bowles plan is actually quite different. (The commission failed to reach a consensus.)

Advertisement

For instance, Simpson-Bowles envisioned $4 trillion in debt reduction over nine years; the president's plan would spread the cuts over 10 years. A good chunk of the savings from deficit reduction piles up in that last year. When the two plans are compared apples to apples, Simpson-Bowles yields about $6.6 trillion in deficit reduction — 50 percent more than Obama's plan. (For a detailed look at the Simpson-Bowles, here is a link to a new report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.)

By Obama’s math, you have nearly $3.8 trillion in spending cuts, compared to $1.5 trillion in tax increases (letting the Bush tax cuts expire for high-income Americans). That’s how he claims $1 of tax increases for every $2.50 of spending cuts.

But virtually no serious budget analyst agreed with this 1:2.5 accounting. Obama’s $4 trillion figure, for instance, includes counting some $1 trillion in cuts reached a year ago in budget negotiations with Congress. So no matter who is the president, the savings are already in the bank.

Advertisement

The Obama campaign notes that the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the president's budget would reduce the deficit by $3.5 trillion over 10 years against ""an alternative fiscal scenario;"" otherwise, CBO says the president's budget increases deficits. The national debt, as a percentage of the gross domestic product, would rise from 73 percent to 76 percent in that period, for instance. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities also pegs the administration's deficit reduction as $3.8 trillion, but says the ratio of spending cuts to tax increases is 1 to 1.

This is fantasy money. The administration is counting $848 billion in phantom savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, even though the administration had long made clear those wars would end.

In other words, by projecting war spending far in the future, the administration is able to claim credit for saving money it never intended to spend. And Obama would still be borrowing the money to “rebuild America” (Imagine someone borrowing $50,000 a year for college — and then declaring that they have an extra $500,000 to spend over the next decade once they graduate.)

Advertisement

This budget trick actually works both ways. The Bush administration never properly accounted for war spending, refusing to project costs in the future, which kept its deficit projections artificially low. Now that the wars are winding down, the Obama administration is happy to project costs far into the future, because it artificially inflates the potential deficit reduction. Funny how that works.

Romney accused Obama of taking $716 billion from Medicare. This $700 billion figure comes from the difference over 10 years (2013-2022) between anticipated Medicare spending (what is known as “the baseline”) and the changes that the law makes to reduce spending.

Under the health-care law, spending does not decrease in Medicare year after year; the reduction is from anticipated levels of spending in future years. In fact, the savings mostly are wrung from health-care providers, not Medicare beneficiaries — who, as a result of the health-care law, ended up with new benefits for preventive care and prescription drugs. But Romney argued that was a “bad trade,” arguing that in effect the reductions would affect beneficiaries, and the Medicare actuary also has raised concerns about whether the cuts to providers were sustainable.

Advertisement

While it is correct that anticipated savings from Medicare were used to help offset some of the anticipated costs of expanding health care for all Americans, it does not affect the Medicare trust fund. The Obama health-care law also raised Medicare payroll taxes by $318 billion over the new 10-year time frame, but only a third of that money is credited to the trust fund; the rest goes to general revenues.

Moreover, under the concept of the unified budget, money that is collected by the federal government for whatever purpose (such as Medicare and Social Security payroll taxes) is spent on whatever bills are coming due at that time. Social Security and Medicare will get a credit for taxes collected that are not immediately spent on Social Security, but those taxes are quickly devoted to other federal spending.

Indeed, the House Republican budget plan crafted by Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan, retains virtually all of the Medicare “cuts” contained in the health-care law, but diverts them instead to his Medicare overhaul. Republicans argue that that is a more effective use of the savings.

Romney said he was unaware of any provision that gives companies a tax deduction for moving operations overseas. But Obama is right; there is such a provision that allows companies to deduct such expenses — but it is not a specific loophole or incentive, as Obama indicated.

Here’s how the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation described it:

Moreover, it is pretty small potatoes given the attention Democrats pay to it. The JCT estimated that ending the deduction for moving operations overseas would raise just $168 million over a decade.

In the federal government with an annual budget deficit of more than $1 trillion, that’s what you call a rounding error.

(This item was updated with the specific JCT language.)

Obama tried to attribute a 50-year decline in health costs to the health-care law, but much of it has not yet been implemented. Most economists say the slowdown is more likely because of the lousy economy.

Advertisement

“It’s tempting to think that provider initiatives are truly denting costs, but it’s hard for changes in provider behavior to influence costs before they occur,” said a recent article in Modern Healthcare magazine. “Instead, the drop in healthcare cost growth is primarily attributable to the Great Recession’s impact on employment, private health insurance, government revenues and budgets.”

Meanwhile, Romney blamed a rise in insurance premiums on the health-care law. This is also overstated, since much of the health-care law has not been implemented yet.

This is a reprise from his convention speech. And this sounds like a pretty bold statement, especially considering that only two presidents — Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton — created more than 12 million jobs. Romney, in fact, says he can reach this same goal in just four years, though the policy paper issued by his campaign contains few details. It is mostly a collection of policy assertions, such as reducing debt, overhauling the tax code, fostering free trade and so forth.

Advertisement

But, in fact, the number is even less impressive than it sounds. This pledge amounts to an average of 250,000 jobs a month, a far cry from the 500,000 jobs a month that Romney once claimed would be created in a “normal recovery.” In recent months, the economy has averaged about 150,000 jobs a month.

The Congressional Budget Office is required to consider the effects of the so-called ""fiscal cliff"" if a year-end budget deal is not reached, which many experts believe would push the country into a recession. But even with that caveat, the nonpartisan agency assumes 9.06 million jobs will be created between 2013 and 2017. (This is a revision downward; CBO had estimated 11 million in January.)

But Moody's Analytics, in an August forecast, predicts 12 million jobs will be created by 2016, no matter who is president. And Macroeconomic Advisors in April also predicted a gain of 12.3 million jobs.

In other words, this is a fairly safe bet by Romney, even if he has a somewhat fuzzy plan for action. We have often noted that presidents are often at the mercy — or are the beneficiary — of broad economic trends, and Romney’s pledge appears to be an effort to take advantage of that.

In the debate, Obama acknowledged that the GOP Medicare plan, authored by Romney running mate Paul Ryan, has been changed. But he still clung to an outdated estimate of an earlier version of the plan, claiming it will cost seniors an extra $6,000 a year. (He had previously earned Two Pinocchios for this claim.)

The problem is this dollar figure — usually expressed as $6,400 — is an estimate for an earlier version of Ryan’s plan. He’s since changed it significantly to address some of the loudest complaints. The new version of the plan includes the option for traditional Medicare, as well as a commitment that at least one health-care option would be fully covered by the government.

Indeed, the new plan is much more generous than the original version. The old plan had capped growth at the rate of inflation. Many experts believed that was too low and pushed more costs on beneficiaries.

In the updated Ryan plan, Medicare spending would be permitted to grow slightly faster than the nation’s economy — in fact, at the same growth rate as Obama’s budget for Medicare.

This claim of no new taxes deserves some context, because the federal government has provided substantial help in paying for Romney’s health-care law.

A June 2011 Boston Globe article said this about the cost of RomneyCare and how the state has paid for it:

So the federal government pays more for the Bay State’s health-care program than the state itself does.

The Globe piece also noted that “there is no certainty the state can afford the program’s cost indefinitely if the underlying costs of health care continue to soar.”

The state has increased taxes to pay for its health-care plan since Romney left office. For instance, it raised taxes on cigarettes and implemented a one-time assessment totalling $50 million on hospitals and insurers. — Josh Hicks

The math does not add up for this statement that Romney directed at Obama.

The president's 2013 budget called for elimination of tax breaks for oil subsidies, which the White House estimated at $4 billion per year. Dividing $90 billion — the federal money that Romney claims went toward clean energy — by $4 billion in breaks for the oil industry amounts to 22.5 years, not 50 years.

It’s also worth noting that the $90 billion was not “breaks,” but a combination of loans, loan guarantees and grants through the stimulus program, and they were spread out over several years rather than one, as Romney claimed.

Furthermore, not all of the money went to the ""green energy world."" About $23 billion went toward ""clean coal,"" energy-efficiency upgrades, updating the electricity grid and environmental clean-up, largely for old nuclear weapons sites. — Josh Hicks and Steven Mufson

Romney greatly oversimplifies a complex story here. In an effort to end the bitter impasse between Democrats and Republicans over raising the debt ceiling, the Budget Control Act of 2011 cut spending by nearly $1 trillion over 10 years by setting new budget caps for “security” and “nonsecurity” discretionary spending.

“Security” spending included not just the Defense Department but also the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Veterans Affairs, foreign aid spending, intelligence and other areas. The goal was to allow some flexibility to avoid being locked into a specific number for defense spending.

The law also tasked a “supercommittee” with finding ways to reduce the deficit by an additional $1.2 trillion over 10 years. If the committee failed — which it did — then automatic cuts totaling $1.2 trillion also would be ordered in “security” and “nonsecurity” spending.

Now there is an impasse. An alternative plan passed the House in May on a party-line vote, with not a single Democrat voting for it. The bill would have halted the automatic cuts in defense spending for one year, while cutting in other areas. The Democratic-controlled Senate did not accept the bill. Democrats, by contrast, have proposed ending Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy as a way to meet the deficit targets in the Budget Control Act, though no vote has been taken on a sequestration replacement plan.

Romney has not explained how he would end this stalemate.

What is Romney referring to as he almost begins to channel the “death panels” claim of Sarah Palin?

Beginning in 2014, the 15-member Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, (made up of experts subject to Senate confirmation) is designed to help reduce the rate of growth in Medicare spending if it exceeds a certain target rate. The board would make recommendations to reduce costs.

Eventually, if the targets are not met, the board will submit a plan to the White House and Congress to achieve the necessary cuts. Congress could pass a different set of cuts or reject the IPAB recommendations with a three-fifths vote in the Senate.

In effect, the IPAB appears designed to mimic the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission, which was designed in the late 1980s by then Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.) with the backing of the Reagan administration. That commission was empowered to make politically difficult decisions of closing military bases, thus limiting the influence of lobbyists and in effect letting Congress off the hook of making the tough decisions themselves.

The health-care law explicitly says that the recommendations cannot lead to rationing of health care. Of course, “rationing” is in the eye of beholder, and one common complaint is that rationing is not defined. The law also limits recommendations that would change benefits, modify eligibility or increase Medicare beneficiary cost-sharing, such as deductibles, coinsurance and co-payments.

On the surface, the IPAB appears aimed at doing the same thing as the House Republican Medicare plan — reducing the runaway costs of Medicare, except on a faster track. (The GOP plan would not kick in until 2021, just a few years before the Medicare hospital fund begins to run dry.)

The dispute really centers on a philosophical divide between the parties. Democrats would rely on independent experts (such as doctors and consumer advocates) to recommend the cuts; Republicans would rely on the insurance marketplace to control costs.

Here, the president comes close to repeating a line that just this week earned him Three Pinocchios. In a new television ad, Obama said that tax cuts and deregulation led to the crisis. But in the debate he broadened his language, bringing in the impact of the Bush tax cuts on the deficit and not directly linking the policies (""it all culminated"" versus ""led to"") to the financial crash.

With such careful pruning and adjusting of language, a politician can easily shed one or two Pinocchios.

But another part of Obama's statement is misleading. There's no doubt that George W. Bush owns an unimpressive record on job creation. But as we have previously demonstrated, Obama comes in either last, second-to-last or in the bottom half among presidents since the Great Depression, depending on which way you look at the numbers.

(As is our practice, we generally do not award Pinocchio ratings in these instant round-ups.)

The operation — with some ground forces crossing the border later — came just days after President Trump’s startling announcement that the United States would not stand in Turkey’s way, bringing sharp rebukes from even the president’s Republican allies.

The Turkish foray threatened

to further fracture a war-

shattered Syria as Ankara moved to create a “safe zone” after failing to agree on its size and nature during negotiations with the United States.

Turkey’s goal is to push back the Syrian Kurds — considered enemies by Turkey — from the border region. Turkey also claims the buffer region would be fit for the resettlement of millions of Syrian refugees residing in Turkey.

But aid agencies warned that the offensive could create a new humanitarian crisis, as well as a fresh wave of displaced people and refugees.

An even greater worry was the thousands of Islamic State prisoners and their families held by the Syrian Kurdish forces after the fall of the militant group’s self-

declared caliphate. A security breakdown at the detention camps could open the way for the fighters and others to slip away.

Already, frightened people were on the move in Syria. Cars, trucks and motorcycles — with no empty seats — streamed away from the border. Smoke rose from some buildings. Fires broke out.

Some Turkish ground forces moved into Syria after nightfall. A statement from the Turkish military said a “land operation” began in an area east of the Euphrates River but gave no further details on the scope of the incursion.

President Trump called the Turkish offensive “a bad idea,” but also stood by his decision to pull back U.S. forces to effectively clear the way for Turkey.

“Turkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place,” he added. “We will hold them to this commitment.”



The past weeks have seen a buildup of Turkish forces on the border, belligerent speeches by Turkish officials and dire warnings from Turkey’s NATO allies and others.

In the first hours of the operation, Turkish warplanes and artillery shelled towns along a 250-mile swath, stretching from Ain Issa, about 30 miles from the Euphrates River, to Malikiyah, near Syria’s border with Iraq.

Turkish shelling killed at least five civilians, according to the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as the Syrian ­Kurdish-led militias are known. Mortar fire from Syria landed in

at least two Turkish towns, but caused no injuries, Turkish media reported.

The offensive has presented the Trump administration with a dilemma as it has sought to balance Washington’s partnership with Turkey and its links to the Syrian Kurdish forces that helped beat back the Islamic State.

Ankara views the Syrian Kurdish fighters as terrorists because of their links to Turkey’s Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has waged a decade-long battle in southeastern Turkey for greater autonomy. Turkey has launched cross-border attacks on PKK bases in northern Iraq since the 1990s.

A spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Fahrettin Altun, writing in The Washington Post on Wednesday, called for international support for Turkey’s offensive.

“Turkey has no ambition in northeastern Syria except to neutralize a long-standing threat against Turkish citizens and to liberate the local population from the yoke of armed thugs,” Altun wrote.

The coming days will make clear whether Turkey intended a symbolic push across the frontier or would follow through with plans to move deeper into Syrian territory, analysts said.

As the battle approached, residents of Syria’s border towns braced for the worst.

Mikael Mohammed, a Kurdish father of three who owns a clothing store in Tal Abyad, a quarter-mile from the Turkish frontier, said he had not had any customers for an entire day. U.S. troops based in the town withdrew early Monday after the White House announcement.

“People who are out there in the streets look as if they are going to someone’s funeral. . . . People are scared,” he said.

The town felt safe “when we used to see U.S. troops in the streets of Tal Abyad.”

“Yesterday, we saw U.S. troops, but this time they were on their way out of the area, and that terrified people,” he said.

By Wednesday afternoon, worry had turned to dread.

“Turkish warplanes have started to carry out airstrikes on civilian areas. There is a huge panic among people of the region,” Mustafa Bali, a spokesman for the SDF, wrote on Twitter. Turkey had conducted airstrikes about 25 miles into Syrian territory, according to another SDF statement.

The scene during the Turkish military offensive against Kurdish fighters in Syria + 29 Turkey launched airstrikes, fired artillery rounds and began a ground offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria after U.S. troops pulled back from the area, paving the way for an assault on forces that have long been allied with the United States.

In the town of Qamishli, the SDF traded fire with Turkish forces across the border, according to a farm owner who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid possible reprisals. Residents hoarded food and lined up at gas stations. People had started leaving the town, headed farther away from the Turkish border, he said.

Apart from scattered skirmishes, the SDF did not appear to be mounting a full-fledged counterattack, according to Dareen Khalifa, senior Syria analyst for the International Crisis Group.

“My understanding is that they are still hoping that this would be a strictly limited operation that would not spread to any Kurdish towns, and that they would be able to continue to keep U.S. protection,” she said.

“This is a battle they would surely lose,” she added, referring to the SDF. “The flat topography favors conventional warfare.”

Erdogan’s government has watched nervously for years as Syria’s Kurds have built an autonomous enclave along Turkey’s border. It railed against the United States for relying on the Kurds as a military partner and bristled as their enemies accumulated weapons and territory.

For years, the United States and Turkey have been engaged in negotiations aimed at soothing Ankara’s security concerns.

There was also the risk that American troops still positioned in Syria could get caught in the crossfire.

A U.S. official said the Trump administration had provided Turkey with a list of no-strike locations where U.S. personnel were stationed.

The International Rescue Committee warned that 2 million civilians who lived in the military zone were at risk — “many of whom have already survived ISIS brutality and multiple displacements,” the group said in a statement, using an acronym for the Islamic State.

The offensive threatened to displace as many as 300,000 people, the group said. Already, it added, there were reports of people fleeing the fighting “with only the clothes on their backs.”"

In a scathing eight-page letter, the White House said the inquiry into the Ukraine scandal was without merit, complained that the president has been denied his due process rights and argued that Democrats were intent on overturning the results of the 2016 election and influencing the 2020 contest.

“To fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the executive branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances,” White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone wrote to top congressional Democrats.

In response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) signaled that Democrats were undeterred and would move ahead with their investigation focused on Trump’s pressure on a foreign leader to dig up dirt on a domestic political rival.

“The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President’s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction,” Pelosi said in a statement. “Mr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.”

The White House letter, which lacked substantive legal arguments and echoed Trump’s political broadsides, capped a day of defiance and challenges as House Democrats have tried to force recalcitrant administration officials to divulge potentially incriminating information over Republican objections. But it also highlights the limitations of Democrats’ ability to exercise their oversight authority in the face of an administration that appears unfazed by flouting subpoenas.

The White House’s resistance throws a new and formidable roadblock in the way of House investigators attempting to depose various State Department officials this month as they build a case that Trump abused his office by trying to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter.

Cipollone dismissed the notion that Trump did anything wrong when he spoke to Zelensky on that July 25 call, the details of which were revealed in a rough transcript released by the White House last month.

“The record clearly established that the call was completely appropriate and that there is no basis for your inquiry,” the counsel wrote.

The three House Democratic chairmen — Adam B. Schiff (Calif.) of the Intelligence Committee, Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.) of Foreign Affairs and Elijah E. Cummings (Md.) of Oversight — said Tuesday that they are trying to determine whether Trump violated his oath of office and endangered national security “by pressing Ukraine to launch sham investigations to assist his personal and political interests rather than the interests of the American people.”

While the administration is refusing to provide witnesses or documents, Democrats have been negotiating for testimony from the whistleblower whose complaint about Trump’s call prompted the impeachment inquiry. The Intelligence Committee is considering extraordinary steps, including masking the individual’s identity, to secure the interview.

The whistleblower wrote in a two-page memo that the intelligence community’s inspector general provided last week to the congressional intelligence committees that a White House official called the substance of the July 25 call “crazy” and “frightening” and suggested that Trump may have violated federal election laws by asking Zelensky for a “favor” of investigating the Bidens.

A person familiar with the memo added that the White House official also thought it was improper that the record of the call was moved to a highly classified server.

The fast-moving developments came as a Washington Post-Schar School poll found that a majority of Americans say they endorse the decision by House Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry, and nearly half of all adults also say the House should take the additional step of recommending that the president be removed from office.

The recent revelations have caused many Americans to rethink their opinions of impeachment.

Looking to bolster his defense, Trump is likely to add former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) to serve as an outside lawyer for the impeachment process, according to senior White House officials with direct knowledge who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.

Gowdy headed the House’s select committee that investigated the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and repeatedly demanded witnesses and documents from the Obama administration.

Over the course of more than two years, that panel spoke to 81 witnesses and reviewed 75,000 pages of documents, according to its final report. Most notably, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton testified for more than 11 hours before the committee on Oct. 22, 2015.

Trump has regularly told White House officials that he does not want to cooperate with the House committees conducting oversight.

“He was livid last week after the release of text messages from Kurt Volker [special envoy to Ukraine], and news accounts from testimony that seemed to undercut his administration’s case,” said a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks.

In its stonewalling, the State Department blocked House investigators from deposing Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and a central figure in the impeachment inquiry. Sondland had worked to ensure that the Ukrainians would investigate an energy company that previously paid Hunter Biden to sit on its board as a precondition for a meeting between the two heads of state.

Text messages supplied to the House last week by Volker show that Sondland coordinated with other diplomats, Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, and a top aide to Zelensky to secure what he called the “deliverable,” while defending Trump against concerns raised by other officials that they were attempting to orchestrate a quid pro quo.

“I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court,” Trump tweeted Tuesday.

Sondland was willing to testify, according to his lawyer Robert Luskin, but didn’t appear on Tuesday at the direction of the State Department. The order to Sondland’s attorneys not to testify came via voice mail at 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, according to Democrats.

“As the sitting U.S. Ambassador to the E.U. and employee of the State Department, Ambassador Sondland is required to follow the Department’s direction,” Luskin said.

The White House letter suggests that the administration will take similar steps to block the testimony of former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who is expected for a deposition with the panels on Friday. Attempts to reach a lawyer for Yovanovitch were unsuccessful.

Giuliani also pledged on Tuesday to disregard a House subpoena for documents related to his efforts in Ukraine.

“Let them hold me in contempt. We’ll go to court. We’ll challenge the contempt,” Giuliani said in an interview. He added that he would be “very interested” in speaking instead to the GOP-led Senate Judiciary Committee, where chairman and Trump ally Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) promised to launch a Ukraine probe, centered on Giuliani’s testimony, to rival House Democrats’ impeachment-focused investigation.

The House panels are also expected in the days ahead to issue subpoenas for three Soviet-born operatives — Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman and Sem­yon Kislin — who assisted Giuliani in Ukraine and have thus far resisted congressional summonses.

House Democratic leaders have already stated that they consider the administration’s efforts to keep witnesses from testifying to constitute impeachable acts of obstruction. The White House countered in Cipollone’s letter that such a presumption constitutes “threats and intimidation” that “destroy the integrity of the process and brazenly violate fundamental due process,” as well as “every past precedent,” the White House argued.

Republicans have rallied to defend the president and support the White House’s assertion that the impeachment inquiry “suffers from a separate, fatal defect” because the House has not yet taken a floor vote to establish formal procedures for the impeachment inquiry and guarantee the “elementary rights and protections” Trump needs to defend himself against charges.

Rep. Michael McCaul (Tex.), the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in a statement pointed to past votes the House took to formally launch impeachment inquiries into presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton as the standard that should govern current proceedings.

Pelosi has said a vote on the House floor is an option but is not required for the inquiry to proceed.

“There’s nothing anyplace that says that we should. However, the people who are most afraid of a vote on the floor are the Republicans,” she said in an interview last week. “That’s why they’re beating their tom-toms like they want it, but they don’t. They have the most to be concerned about because for some of their members, to say that we shouldn’t go forward with this is a bad vote.”

At the same time, the Trump administration was in court attempting to convince a federal judge that the courts never should have given Congress the “road map” that formed the backbone of the Watergate hearings — a position that Chief JudgeBeryl A. Howell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia called “extraordinary.”

The House Judiciary Committee has appealed to that precedent in an effort to secure the grand jury materials that former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III relied on for his report."

The report appears to represent a final and anticlimactic chapter in a controversy that overshadowed the 2016 presidential campaign and exposed Clinton to fierce criticism that she later cited as a major factor in her loss to President Trump.

In the end, State Department investigators found 38 current or former employees “culpable” of violating security procedures — none involving material that had been marked classified — in a review of roughly 33,000 emails that had been sent to or from the personal computer system Clinton used.

Overall, investigators said, “there was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.” The report cited “instances of classified information being inappropriately” transmitted, but noted that the vast majority of those scrutinized “were aware of security policies and did their best to implement them.”

The release comes as Trump continues to raise the Clinton email issue to attack Democrats, even as new evidence has emerged of apparent security lapses by senior officials in his own administration.

Diplomats involved in pressuring Ukraine to pursue investigations that would politically benefit Trump used private phones and texting apps to trade messages about their efforts, according to records released by leaders of the House impeachment inquiry.

The State Department probe focused on internal communications that were up to nine years old.

Dozens of former State employees were brought back in for questioning in recent months after being notified that emails they had sent years ago had been retroactively classified.

The renewed activity after a long stretch in which the investigation had seemed to go dormant sparked suspicion that the Trump administration was seeking to revive an issue that had been politically advantageous to Republicans.

One former official who was questioned described it as “a way to tarnish a whole bunch of Democratic foreign policy people.”

State Department officials denied any political agenda, saying the interviews were part of the final stages of an internal inquiry that the department was under pressure to complete this month. Among those applying pressure was Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who had sent letters to the State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security seeking updates.

There is no indication that any of those scrutinized will be sanctioned, but many received letters saying they were judged to have been involved in “valid” security incidents even if “not culpable” of a formal breach — an ambiguous status that some fear could complicate their abilities to return to government service.

The report does not identify those who were scrutinized, but the list included ambassadors and assistant secretaries of state responsible for U.S. policy in the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia.

Few had sent emails directly to Clinton, and instead had routed them to William Burns, who served as deputy secretary of state, or Jake Sullivan, the former director of policy planning. They then relayed many of the messages to Clinton’s private email, a system she said she used mainly out of convenience.

Clinton’s use of a private server, discovered by House Republicans as part of the probe of the deaths of U.S. diplomats and intelligence personnel in Benghazi, Libya, triggered overlapping investigations by Congress, the State Department and the FBI.

Then-FBI Director James B. Comey’s handling of the matter enraged Democrats. In July 2016, Comey took the extraordinary step of announcing there would be no charges filed against Clinton in the email probe, but accused her of being “extremely careless” in a news conference.

The bureau reopened the investigation in the final days of the 2016 race after discovering a laptop with Clinton emails as part of a separate case. Most were duplicates, and, again, there were no charges, but Comey’s decision to notify Congress revived the issue at a moment that Clinton has said was devastating to her campaign.

The State Department suspended its internal review while the FBI probe was active, before resuming work in 2017. In total, the report found 91 violations by 38 individuals, and another 497 violations “where no individual was found to bear culpability.”"
571,571,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/28/everything-you-need-know-about-controversial-rise-fall-katie-hill/,0,"After she won election last year as part of a historic, female-driven wave for House Democrats, the party picked Rep. Katie Hill (Calif.) to be one of its faces of success. She is young (32), diverse (one of the first openly bisexual members of Congress), politically astute (her first time running for office was for this seat) and from the kind of district that helped the Democrats win back the House last year and that they hope to keep.

But as swift as her rise came her fall. Hill is resigning after less than a year in Congress over allegations she had relationships with staffers. Such relationships violate new House rules passed in the #MeToo era, making her seat potentially more competitive for Republicans. Here’s what happened, from the beginning.

What happened: Hill has acknowledged having a consensual relationship with a campaign staffer but has denied having a relationship with a staffer in her D.C. office. She is resigning after her colleagues launched an ethics investigation into the claims, which were first seen on the conservative website RedState. It’s not immediately clear when she will resign.

Why is she resigning if she is denying some of the accusations? Good question. She denies the more serious claim, that she had a relationship with a congressional staffer. (“Absolutely false,” she said in a statement last week.) It’s more serious because it would break new rules passed last year by the House after the #MeToo movement brought down nine members of Congress. As The Post’s Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports, “It is against the official code of conduct for members to ‘engage in a sexual relationship with any employee’ who works for the member.”

Hill has been somewhat vague about why she is leaving. “I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country” to resign, she said in a statement Sunday. But she has also framed herself as a victim of revenge porn. Sexual photos of her with her campaign staffer were released online, and she has accused her husband, whom she is in the process of divorcing, of being behind that release. She said in her resignation statement that she is pursuing legal options.

“I am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view and the vindictive claims of my ex have now involved the lives and reputations of unrelated parties,” she said.

Advertisement

There’s some irony — and controversy — to Hill being the first one to lose her seat to these rules: The rules changes were driven by Democrats (though they passed a Republican-led Congress with lots of Republican support and leadership). And they were primarily in response to men leveraging their power for sex. The decades-old rules changes came after these events, as I reported last year:

Lawmakers have been accused of everything from groping a soldier while on a USO tour (resigned Democratic Minnesota senator Al Franken) to writing love notes to a staffer (retiring GOP congressman Patrick Meehan) to offering to pay a staffer $5 million to bear his child (resigned GOP Arizona congressman Trent Franks) to decades of unwanted touching and sexual advances (resigned Michigan Democratic congressman John Conyers Jr.).

To supporters of Hill, or supporters of just having more female members in Congress, it seems unfair. Hill has not been accused of any wrongdoing — an ethics investigation was just getting started. And she was not accused of sexual harassment.

“For decades, male lawmakers got away with those sort of shenanigans,” Los Angeles Times columnist Robin Abcarian wrote under the headline: “Katie Hill messed up but she should not have resigned.” “Wouldn’t you know it, the first one to fall afoul of the rule is a woman, and a bisexual woman, at that.”

Advertisement

There’s also a political irony: During the 2018 campaign, political analysts called Hill “one of the most impressive Democratic contenders of 2018,” and Democratic strategists routinely talked up Hill to reporters as one of their best recruits.

Share this article Share

Her first time running for office, she beat a Republican, Steve Knight, in her home district outside Los Angeles, and she quickly became an ally to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). She was installed in a powerful position on one of the committees now involved in impeachment proceedings against President Trump, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Now, Pelosi has indicated it was right for her to resign — even before an ethics investigation in Congress concluded. Hill “came to Congress with a powerful commitment to her community and a bright vision for the future, and has made a great contribution as a leader of the Freshman Class,” Pelosi said in a statement. “She has acknowledged errors in judgment that made her continued service as a Member untenable. We must ensure a climate of integrity and dignity in the Congress, and in all workplaces.”

It’s not immediately clear how competitive this seat becomes with Hill out: Before the allegations, the nonpartisan handicappers at Cook Political Report ranked her district as evenly split between Republican and Democratic voters, with a slight edge to Hill. The area has been trending Democratic and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. The Los Angeles Times reports it’s unclear when a special election for her replacement will take place, largely because it is not clear when Hill will leave."

Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, was part of a small group of White House officials assigned to listen in on Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. His testimony returns repeatedly to his fears that Trump’s manipulation of Ukraine policy to discredit his political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, is unethical and damaging to U.S. national security.

“I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government’s support of Ukraine,” Vindman intends to tell lawmakers, according to a draft of his opening statement.

Vindman is the first White House official to testify who listened to Trump’s controversial call, which was exposed by a government whistleblower and triggered a historic impeachment inquiry. His prepared statement, first reported by the New York Times, bolsters previous testimony by Fiona Hill, his former boss at the National Security Council, and William B. Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine.

Vindman’s testimony follows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) call for a vote later this week authorizing the impeachment inquiry. Pelosi’s move came in response to Republican criticism that the Democrats’ activities to date amount to a partisan hit job and have denied the president due process.

In his statement Vindman repeatedly insists he has no partisan bias and asserts that he is motivated by loyalty to the Constitution and the country. Vindman and his family fled the Soviet Union when he was 3, and he describes himself as both an immigrant and a patriot.

“It is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics,” his prepared statement reads.

Vindman was assigned to the White House in July 2018 after a tour in the Pentagon, where he writes that he authored the U.S. military’s principal strategy for managing competition with Russia.

In his statement Vindman states that he has never had direct contact or communication with the president. He also notes that he is not the whistleblower whose complaint helped spark the impeachment inquiry .

“I do not know who the whistleblower is and I would not feel comfortable to speculate,” his statement reads.

Despite his remove from the White House, Vindman became deeply concerned about the way the president and some of his top advisers were manipulating Ukraine policy to discredit Biden, a possible challenger in the 2020 election.

Vindman states that Trump’s initial call with the new Ukrainian president, made after Zelensky’s April election, was positive.

“President Trump expressed his desire to work with President Zelensky and extended an invitation to the White House,” the statement reads. Vindman notes that the Ukrainians saw the meeting with Trump as “critical” to solidifying American support in the face of Russian aggression.

But within weeks of that initial promise, he grew worried that the policy was being hijacked by partisan politics.

“In the Spring of 2019, I became aware of outside influencers promoting a false narrative of Ukraine,” his statement reads. “This alternative narrative undermined U.S. efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine.”

Vindman cites a July 10 meeting in which Gordon Sondland, a major Trump donor and ambassador to the European Union, emphasized that to secure a meeting with Trump, the Ukrainians would have to “deliver investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma,” a Ukrainian natural gas company that had controversially tapped Biden’s son to serve on its board.

“I stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the National Security Council was going to get involved with or push,” his statements reads.

Following the briefing, Vindman reported his concerns to the National Security Council’s top lawyer. Vindman’s statement notes that an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma would likely inject Ukraine’s new president into U.S. politics and cause the struggling democracy to lose bipartisan support in Congress.

“This would undermine U.S. national security,” Vindman writes.

Vindman’s most direct contact with Trump came in the form of preparing documents for the president to sign regarding Ukraine.

At the direction of his superiors at the NSC, including John Bolton, then the national security adviser, Vindman drafted a memorandum in mid-August that sought to restart $391 million in security aid that was being withheld from Ukraine, according to the Times report. But Trump refused to sign it. He also drafted a letter in May congratulating Zelensky on his inauguration that Trump declined to sign, according to the Times."

http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/08/romney-to-deliver-foreign-policy-speech/?hpt=po_c2",0,"In what was billed as a major foreign policy address, Mitt Romney blasted President Obama's leadership in the Middle East on Monday, saying that a withering of American resolve had made the region a more dangerous place where the United States has less leverage. “Hope is not a strategy,’’ Romney said.

Romney sought to capitalize on the violence in Libya and Egypt that has made Obama vulnerable in the national security realm long seen as his strength. The Republican nominee vowed to ""change course in the Middle East,"" including by taking a hard line on Iran and arming Syrian rebels.

Romney said he knows “the president hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I share this hope.”

But he added: “We cannot support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds.”

The address mostly repackaged things Romney has said before, sometimes with greater precision. The Republican offered few specific ways he would change the Obama administration’s current approach.

Although he made broad critiques of Obama’s “passivity,” Romney did not call for any new armed intervention in any Mideast conflict.

“I believe that if America does not lead, others will,” Romney said, “others who do not share our interests and our values.”

Romney did say Obama failed reformist protesters in Iran in 2009, and is failing the anti-Assad forces in Syria now. The United States is “sitting on the sidelines,” instead of working with other nations to arm Syrian rebels, Romney said.

Much of Romney’s address focused on the complex threat posed by Iran, but he did not propose specific solutions that differ from the Obama administration’s current policy of tightening sanctions and insisting that an Iranian nuclear bomb is intolerable.

Romney did not say whether he would continue the current international diplomatic effort to persuade Iran to back off the most worrisome elements of its nuclear program. Iran claims the program is aimed only at peaceful nuclear energy and medical uses.

Romney, speaking in confident and crisp tones before an audience of more than 400 cadets and invited guests at Virginia Military Institute, said it is Obama’s “responsibility to use America’s great power to shape history—not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events.”

Romney did not call for a new ""red line"" on Iran as Israel has said it wants, and he did not specifically say he would be open, in the future, to a U.S. attack on Iran to stop them from acquiring ""nuclear capability"" so Israel doesn't have to do it now. He did not mention the crippling effect sanctions are having now, and he didn't call for regime change in Iran.

The speech at VMI thrust foreign policy further into the center of a campaign that until recently had been almost entirely about the economy. The focus is expected to intensify as the two candidates debate foreign policy during their last one-on-one encounter, on Oct. 22.

Romney said he would support Israel, the nation presumably most at risk if Iran acquired nuclear weapons, and charged that Obama’s poor relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has help embolden Iran and other adversaries.

“I will reaffirm our historic ties to Israel and our abiding commitment to its security,” Romney said. “The world must never see any daylight between our two nations.”

That was a reference to a remark Obama reportedly made to “put some daylight” between the United States and Israel early in his administration. Obama has since pledged many times to support Israel and his administration claims ties between the two nations have never been stronger.

Romney said he would bulk up the U.S. naval presence around Iran, something the Obama administration has done occasionally on an ad hoc basis. He said he would add to the Navy’s fleet, but did not say how he would pay for it.

Romney also promised new conditions on foreign aid, including to Egypt.

“I will make it clear to the recipients of our aid that in return for our material support, they must meet the responsibilities of every decent modern government,” Romney said.

He said Obama has “no trade agenda to speak of,” and has signed no new bilateral trade deals. That is technically true, since the deals he signed with South Korea, Panama and Colombia were begun under Republican President George W. Bush.

Free trade deals are often politically unpopular among key Democratic constituencies such as labor groups. Although Obama had used mild anti-free-trade rhetoric during the 2008 campaign, he has pointed to those three deals and another in the works with Asia as accomplishments.

Romney said Obama had failed to secure a deal to keep some troops in Iraq, and promised that he would manage the coming U.S. exit from Afghanistan with national security, not politics, as his guide.

The Obama campaign quickly criticized the speech as a patchwork of overheated rhetoric and outdated ideas.

“I just find him very shallow,” former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in a conference call arranged by the Obama campaign. Romney’s views on Russia, for example, seem rooted in the last century and infirmed by the most conservative of his circle of foreign policy advisers, Albright said.

“I’m beginning to think that Governor Romney just doesn’t have the facts,” Albright said.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki called the address Romney’s seventh attempt to reboot his foreign policy vision.

“This is somebody who leads with chest-pounding rhetoric. He’s inexperienced. He’s been clumsy of his handling of foreign policy,” Psaki said.

Romney spoke in a small auditorium at the military school, behind a U.S. flag and several military flags. A group of several hundred white-uniformed cadets filled the seats, mixing with a few dozen invited guests. Patriotic and military music played in the background.

Romney stuck to his prepared text and did not ad lib.

The former CEO and Massachusetts governor, in his comfort zone when focused on the economy, has stumbled during his occasional forays into foreign policy.

It has been the unscripted or hurried moments that have caused Romney, who has little foreign policy experience, the most trouble.

Even many Republicans were critical after Romney slammed Obama’s handling of the attacks on U.S. diplomatic missions in Egypt and Libya, even as the events were unfolding. The Sept. 11 assault in Libya killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

Romney has mounted a sustained attack on Obama’s leadership ever since, as questions have mounted over the administration’s shifting explanations of the attack and whether the U.S. post was properly secured.

He offended his British hosts and Palestinian leaders during an overseas trip in July, failed to mention Afghanistan in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, and was roundly criticized for the timing of his assault on Obama’s handling of violence in Libya.

With increasing questions about the Obama administration’s handling of the violence in Libya that killed four Americans — and with Romney gaining momentum from his widely praised performance in last week’s first debate — some experts think the speech is well-timed.

Though Obama has consistently outpolled Romney on foreign affairs, that advantage has diminished. A Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted just before the first debate showed Obama with a five-point edge in who is more trusted to handle international concerns, down from the president’s double-digit advantage earlier in the year.

“It’s understandable why he’s doing it now,” said David Rothkopf, a former senior Clinton administration official who is chief executive of Foreign Policy magazine. “The administration, which two to three months ago seemed unassailable on foreign policy and national security issues, now looks much more vulnerable because of what happened in Libya, because the entire Middle East is a mess, because of tensions between Obama and Netanyahu.”

In a series of speeches that began during the Republican primary campaign, Romney has proposed a more confrontational approach to China, Russia and other countries, and he accused Obama of failing to contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions, offending Israel, and jeopardizing the U.S. military with budget cuts that Republican congressional leaders have supported.

Advised by veterans of the Reagan and both Bush administrations, Romney has also used blunt, sometimes swaggering language on the stump that has at times evoked the Cold War, including his pledge to “devote myself to an American century.”

But Romney’s description of Russia as America’s “number one geopolitical foe” has drawn criticism, and his overseas trip in July, intended to showcase Romney as a world leader and potential commander in chief, was widely seen as plagued by missteps. Romney, in an interview, questioned Britain’s readiness for the Olympic Games it was about to host, drawing rebukes from British leaders and a tabloid headline labeling him “Mitt the Twit.’’

He then angered Palestinian leaders by suggesting that the Israeli economy has outpaced that of the Palestinian territories in part because of advantages of ""culture,'' while also vastly misstating the difference in gross domestic product between Israel and Palestinian areas. Romney advisers argued at the time that the trip had been successful, pointing out the candidate's generally positive reception in Israel and an endorsement from former Polish president and pro-democracy icon Lech Walesa.

The Obama campaign, citing foreign policy achievements including the killing of Osama bin Laden and the U.S. military withdrawal from Iraq, is undeterred. Campaign officials have accused Romney of flip-flopping on the U.S. mission in Libya and troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, and have pointed out that the lack of new policy prescriptions. They also say most people don't vote based on foreign policy, though it may be seen more broadly as part of a leadership test.

The Obama campaign released a television ad Monday that blasted Romney’s foreign policy credentials and said his “gaffe-filled” European tour in July showed his “reckless” and “amateurish” approach to international issues."
583,583,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/25/us-deficit-hit-billion-marking-nearly-percent-increase-during-trump-era/,0,"The U.S. government’s budget deficit ballooned to nearly $1 trillion in 2019, the Treasury Department announced Friday, as the United States’ fiscal imbalance widened for a fourth consecutive year despite a sustained run of economic growth. The deficit grew $205 billion, or 26 percent, in the past year. The country’s worsening fiscal picture runs in sharp contrast to President Trump’s campaign promise to eliminate the federal debt within eight years. The deficit is up nearly 50 percent in the Trump era. Since taking office, Trump has endorsed big spending increases and steered most Republicans to abandon the deficit obsession they held during the Obama administration.

In 2011, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives pushed to pass a constitutional amendment that would require balanced budgets. And the Obama administration created a deficit commission looking for ways to slow the growth of government debt. But those efforts have fallen away, and budget experts believe the country will see trillion-dollar annual deficits far into the future.

The gap between spending and revenue, referred to as the deficit, grew to $984 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the highest dollar amount since 2012. The government spent $4.4 trillion on numerous programs and services and brought in $3.5 trillion through taxes and other revenue.

Trump administration officials did not defend the marked deficit increase, but they cast blame on Congress for not doing more to reduce expenditures. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called on lawmakers “to cut wasteful and irresponsible spending.” But neither Trump nor Congress has done much to cut spending in recent years, with Trump repeatedly backing away from his own budget proposals. Trump has also demanded new spending on the military and for a border wall. He has recently told aides that he will focus on cutting spending if he is elected to a second term next year.

It is unusual for the government to run such a large budget deficit during a period of economic growth, because spending on unemployment and other benefits tends to contract and tax revenue often grows. But the White House and Congress have contributed to the deficit’s surge by enacting large spending increases and passing the 2017 tax cut law. The budget deficit was $665 billion in 2017.

U.S. debt is considered one of the safest investments in the world and interest rates remain low, which is why the government has been able to borrow money at cheap rates to finance the large annual deficits. But the costs are adding up. The government spent about $380 billion in interest payments on its debt last year, almost as much as the entire federal government contribution to Medicaid.

Budget experts have also warned that a lack of focus on the deficit could make it much harder for the U.S. government to respond to the next economic crisis, because policymakers will have less flexibility to enact new spending programs if they are devoting hundreds of billions of dollars to interest payments on the debt.

“This is the first time in our history that we are seeing a boom in the economy at the same time deficits are rapidly rising. It’s alarming,” said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which supports reducing the deficit.

The Obama administration and Republicans in Congress enacted measures to reduce the deficit starting in 2011, and those measures — and a growing economy — led the deficit to fall by almost 50 percent. But those gains have been lost by a recent apathy among policymakers about addressing the fiscal imbalance.

“There is very little discussion among Republicans about the deficit and virtually no serious outreach to Democrats for any sort of bipartisan deal,” said Brian Riedl, a budget expert at the Manhattan Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, and former chief economist for Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio). “The parties are not talking on this issue.”

The government recorded four straight years of budget deficits that exceeded $1 trillion around the time of the Great Recession, with the worst overrun occurring in 2009 when the deficit reached nearly 10 percent of the U.S. economy, the highest level since World War II. A growing economy and steps taken by the Obama administration and Congress shrank the deficit to 2.4 percent of the economy in 2015, but it slowly began expanding again, largely because of spending increases. In 2019, the deficit was 4.6 percent of the economy.

Budget experts also say the tax cut has led revenue to come in lower than they normally would during an economic expansion. The legislation is projected to increase the annual deficit by about $200 billion, or close to $2 trillion over 10 years when factoring in interest payments, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Tax revenue remained roughly flat the first year the law was in effect, despite economic growth of nearly 3 percent. Tax revenue was modestly higher in fiscal 2019, aided in part by a 70 percent increase in tariff revenue. White House officials said the GOP tax cuts would create so much new income tax revenue that it would offset any money lost from lower rates, but there are signs the economy is beginning to slow markedly now.

Overall spending is projected to rise by about 16 percent between 2017 and 2020, largely because of bipartisan deals struck by Congress, including a 2018 law that lifted spending limits and disaster relief funding, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Military spending has risen dramatically under Trump, from about $550 billion annually to more than $700 billion in 2019, and Democrats successfully pushed for increases to other parts of the budget in exchange for their support to boost money for defense.

The leading Democratic presidential candidates are running on plans for enormous new spending programs that would likely add to the deficit, though some have said they will offset the costs with tax increases. Meanwhile, Republicans have demonstrated little appetite for raising tax revenue after dramatically slashing them in 2017.

America’s fiscal outlook could deteriorate even further should interest rates rise. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates relatively low during this recovery, reducing the cost of borrowing and easing concerns that the deficit could trigger runaway inflation.

America’s expanding federal deficit is an anomaly among developed nations around the world. Nearly all other advanced-economy countries are on track to see their debt shrink as a share of their economy over the next five years, according to the International Monetary Fund.

Some economists, particularly on the left, warn against expressing alarm over the widening deficit, arguing that because inflation remains low there is little reason to fear higher deficits.

In January, former Obama administration economists Jason Furman and Lawrence Summers penned an op-ed calling for Washington to “end its debt obsession,” casting doubt on the nightmarish predictions of some deficit hawks.

“If the deficit is helping to support demand, and that support is keeping us moving forward, then I see no reason to complain about the fact that the deficit has increased,” said Stephanie Kelton, an economist at Stony Brook University who has served as an adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

Republican policymakers have made little noise about the deficit under Trump, a contrast with their dire predictions about rising red ink under President Obama.

In 2013, when federal debt totaled $16.7 trillion, Trump tweeted: “Obama is the most profligate deficit & debt spender in our nation’s history.” The federal government is now more than $22 trillion in debt, according to the White House.

Vice President Pence called the debt increases under the Obama administration “atrocious.” Mick Mulvaney, the president’s acting chief of staff, held “Spending, Debt and Deficit” town halls during the Obama administration and repeatedly criticized lawmakers of both parties for increasing the deficit, including through funding relief for Hurricane Sandy."
586,586,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/10/24/james-younger-luna-transgender-greg-abbott/,0,"There is little that Jeffrey Younger and Anne Georgulas agree on about one of their twins. To start: Is the 7-year-old transgender? It’s a question that has divided the Coppell, Tex., parents — on how Luna, who was named James at birth, should be dressed to school and wear their hair. On whether the child should receive gender-affirming care, which could eventually lead to medical treatment to delay puberty. On which parent should get to live with the twins, and who should have a say in decisions over their health.

At least one of those conflicts was resolved on Tuesday, as a jury in Dallas effectively granted Georgulas sole custody of Luna in a deeply personal case of gender identity, family conflict and viral misinformation that has lit conservative circles aflame.

Since the start of the trial last week, a number of conservative media outlets have cried foul about the situation, claiming that Georgulas, a pediatrician with a private practice in a Dallas suburb, was going to have Luna “mutilated” or “chemically castrated.” The case even made its way to at least three Texas Republicans, including Sen. Ted Cruz, who called the child “a pawn in a left-wing political agenda.”

Gov. Greg Abbott (R), meanwhile, said late on Wednesday that state agencies were looking into the situation. Neither office immediately responded to a request for comment. Attorneys for both parents also did not immediately respond.

FYI the matter of 7 year old James Younger is being looked into by the Texas Attorney General’s Office and the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. #JamesYounger — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) October 23, 2019

But as Younger turned the parents’ fight into one over irreversible medical procedures, experts on health care for transgender children told The Washington Post that Georgulas’s approach to the child would not involve any kind of surgery or hormones for years.

“Many people wrongly assume that prepubescent transgender or gender-diverse children will receive medical interventions,” Katherine Kuvalanka, a social work professor at Miami University in Ohio, said in an email to The Washington Post. “The only interventions for young children is affirmation and acceptance for who they are.”

In its 11-to-1 decision, a jury all but gave Georgulas the right to sign off on any medical and psychological decisions. If a judge upholds that decision on Thursday, the verdict would end a bitter, two-year saga between the parents, who had their brief marriage annulled over their child’s gender identity, a case that wades deep into thorny, polarized and little-known questions about the impact of medical transitions on young children.

It all began, Younger says on his blog, on the twins’ third birthday, when Luna expressed a desire to be a girl.

At that point, the father was paying maximum child support and had standard custody in Texas: He saw the twins once a week for two hours and had them sleep over at his apartment two weekends a month. They spent the rest of their time with Georgulas, who had noticed that the child, known by the name James at the time, wanted to wear dresses and look like the female characters from the Disney movie “Frozen.""

Georgulas took Luna to see a therapist, who diagnosed the child with gender dysphoria — a mismatch between the gender assigned at birth and the one they identified with. From there, the therapist laid out steps on how to make the child feel affirmed, like letting Luna paint their nails and putting them in a dress, as the mother did when the twins turned 5.

But Younger has repeatedly told a different story in interviews with conservative media outlets, including LifeSiteNews, a website run by a Canadian antiabortion organization that advocates for “traditional family values” and against same-sex marriage.

“James presents as a boy with me and he presents as a girl with his mom,” Younger said to the website last month. “He gets dressed as a boy at his mother’s home and he comes out to me as a boy. That means that he’s comfortable as a boy at his mother’s home.”

Younger charged that Georgulas had been pressuring Luna to want to use female pronouns. He cut the child’s hair, put the child in boys’ clothes and continued calling them James.

Share this article Share

In August 2018, Georgulas filed for a restraining order to block Younger from entering the twins’ school or telling other parents or students “that the gender of Luna is different than a girl named Luna.”

She also tried to enroll their child in gender transition therapy at GENECIS, a pediatric clinic for transgender children in Dallas and the first one like it in the Southwest. (Representatives for the clinic did not immediately answer a request for comment on Wednesday night.)

But Laura Edwards-Leeper, a clinical psychologist at Pacific University, said that for someone of Luna’s age, gender-affirming care would not include any kind of medical intervention until they hit puberty. Even then, she said, it’s not an automatic procedure.

After a mental-health evaluation and discussion with parents, it might encompass a range of activities to help “the child to live as their authentic gender, and with their preferred gender expression, at any given point in time, without a presumption about their future gender identity,” she said.

For a 7-year-old, that might mean speaking to experts and potentially helping them through a social transition, which might include changing their clothes, hairstyle or pronouns. At around ages 10 to 13, parents, health professionals and the child might decide to take puberty blockers, which delay the development of secondary sex characteristics, like facial hair or breasts.

Those can be stopped at any time, and puberty continues as it would normally. “It is only irreversible if the adults in the child’s life make it irreversible,” Edwards-Leeper told The Post. “If the adults can stay open to whatever trajectory the child has, then it’s completely reversible.”

Younger, however, said that a tactic of “watchful waiting” would be more prudent for Luna instead. Because he still had custody, his objections meant that the clinic said it could not take Luna on as a client, LifeSiteNews and other outlets reported.

Kuvalanka, however, said the “watchful waiting” approach can be harmful when a parent is withholding acceptance, and that tactic has been deemed “outdated” by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Around the time she filed the restraining order, Georgulas also tried to alter the terms of what is essentially Texas’s version of joint custody. She wanted Younger to affirm the child’s gender identity, requiring him to call her Luna and use female pronouns, and prevent him from making them spend time with those who did otherwise.

In response, Younger made a request of his own: a petition for full custody over the twins. Launching an Internet campaign to #ProtectJamesYounger, which was shared by Cruz and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.), he argued that Georgulas was going to force the child to undergo “chemical castration” once the 7-year-old became old enough to transition.

And he stepped up his calls. In January, on a podcast with a Texas political operative, he described talking with the child on FaceTime, accusing Georgulas of having “dressed him as a drag queen,” with fake eyelashes, makeup and hair covered in glitter.

“This is not just emotional abuse but is the very, most fundamental form of sexual abuse, tampering with the sexual identity of a vulnerable boy,” the father said.

A 7-year-old child doesn't have the maturity to make profound decisions like this. The state of Texas should protect this child's right to choose—as an informed, mature person—and not be used as a pawn in a left-wing political agenda. #ProtectJamesYounger — Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) October 24, 2019

This is heartbreaking and sets a horrible precedent.



A 7-year-old can’t possibly make this decision or understand it. Parents should know better. I hope this father receives the public support he needs. #ProtectJamesYoungerhttps://t.co/4hszPgqGWe — Dan Crenshaw (@DanCrenshawTX) October 22, 2019

The judgment effectively giving the mother sole custody of the twins was unusual, Kuvalanka said, given that juries and judges tend to side with parents who repress a child’s gender identity. But the victory has come with a cost."
590,590,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/testimony-from-career-diplomats-to-outline-trumps-dark-view-of-ukraine/2019/10/29/1681d293-f23c-476a-bdd8-35244e23d66a_story.html,0,"Two career diplomats testified to House impeachment investigators Wednesday that President Trump displayed a deeply pessimistic view of Ukraine that was out of step with officials at the White House and State Department who saw support for the European country as critical in its battle with Russian-backed separatists. The State Department officials, Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, said their optimistic view of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky clashed with a darker outlook of the new government held by Trump and an informal channel of actors linked to the president’s attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, according to opening statements obtained by The Washington Post.

The testimony followed a blockbuster day in which Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert assigned to the National Security Council, gave lawmakers a firsthand account of Trump’s alleged attempt at a quid pro quo during a July 25 call with Zelensky. Partisan tensions were also building around procedural rules for impeachment drafted by Democrats, which were scheduled for a markup Wednesday afternoon ahead of an expected House vote on Thursday.

Anderson, a career Foreign Service officer, detailed efforts when U.S. officials tried to demonstrate support for Ukraine only to be batted down by the White House, including after Russian forces attacked and seized Ukrainian military vessels in the Sea of Azov in 2018. He spoke with lawmakers Wednesday afternoon.

“While my colleagues at the State Department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued,” Anderson testified.

Croft, who worked on Ukraine issues at the White House and the State Department, said that “throughout” her time in the Trump administration she heard the president “describe Ukraine as a corrupt country,” both “directly and indirectly.” An official working on the impeachment inquiry who requested anonymity to discuss closed-door proceedings said Croft was appearing under subpoena.

“In light of an attempt by the White House and State Department to direct Catherine Croft not to appear for her scheduled deposition, and efforts to also limit any testimony that does occur, the House Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena to compel her testimony this morning,” the official said, noting that Croft was answering questions from lawmakers and aides from both parties.

The prepared testimony does not add significantly to the specific claims by other U.S. officials alleging that Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into investigating his political rivals by withholding about $400 million in military aid and diplomatic support to Ukraine.

Croft and Anderson did not enjoy as much visibility into senior-level decision-making as some of their peers, such as former deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman, whom House Democrats have struggled to bring in to testify. But they do offer new insight into how a shadow foreign policy executed by people outside of government undermined the work of U.S. officials.

Specifically, Croft mentioned receiving inexplicable phone calls from Washington lobbyist Robert Livingston, “who told me that Ambassador Yovanovitch should be fired,” referring to Marie Yovanovitch, then the top U.S. envoy in Kyiv.

“He characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an ‘Obama holdover’ and associated with George Soros,” she stated in her opening remarks.

Yovanovitch was recalled from her position earlier this year after Giuliani and his associates waged a campaign of unsubstantiated allegations about her being opposed to Trump and supportive of Joe Biden, the former vice president now seeking the Democratic nomination for president in 2020. Yovanovitch denied those allegations in her sworn testimony earlier this month.

“It was not clear to me at the time — or now — at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,” Croft said.

She added that she notified her boss, Fiona Hill, and another State Department official, George Kent, of Livingston’s activities, but that she is “not aware of any action that was taken in response.”

Livingston, a former Republican congressman from Louisiana, was chosen as the successor to Newt Gingrich as speaker of the House in 1999, but he declined the position after revelations of an extramarital affair. After leaving Congress, he formed the Livingston Group, one of Washington’s most influential lobbying firms. His firm has represented clients in the Middle East and around the world, including political figures in Ukraine such as former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, according to Justice Department documents.

The firm was in touch with both Croft and Anderson in 2018, according to lobbying records, and is currently working on behalf of two Ukrainian entities: Association of Enterprises UKRMETALURGPROM, a steel-related trade group, and Innovative Technology & Business Consulting, a group related to Tymoshenko.

On Dec. 4 of last year, representatives of the Livingston Group accompanied Tymoshenko to a meeting with Anderson, the records showed.

The testimony came during a pivotal moment in the impeachment inquiry, as Democrats prepared to move the effort into the open with public hearings.

The House is expected to vote this week on a Democratic resolution laying out rules for those hearings in the Intelligence Committee and formally authorizing House Republicans to request testimony and documents, subject to votes by the Democratic-majority panel.

The move responds in part to Republican attempts to undermine the impeachment inquiry by painting it as a secretive effort to oust Trump from office.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Wednesday that the procedures drafted by Democrats “fall way short” of the “highest standards of fairness and due process” for Trump.

“This time around, instead of setting a high bar, House Democrats seem determined to set a new low,” he said.

In the past month, investigators have heard testimony or received briefings from about a dozen officials, and they have subpoenaed or requested documents from about 18 others. The inquiry formally began Sept. 24.

Two additional witnesses are scheduled to testify before the end of the week: Timothy Morrison, special assistant to the president and senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council, on Thursday, and Robert Blair, senior adviser to acting Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, on Friday.

Croft testified that she has spent nine years as a Foreign Service Officer and started working on issues related to Ukraine when she was posted to the U.S. Mission at NATO in 2013. The following year, she was assigned to NATO headquarters in Brussels, then returned to Washington as a Ukraine Desk Officer at the State Department.

Supporting anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine was a theme of her work, starting in late 2013 when “citizens of Ukraine took to the streets to demand a European future and an end to corruption,” she said in her opening statement.

Croft described a few episodes where she worked in closer proximity to Trump, including his decision to provide Javelin anti-tank missile systems to Ukraine in 2017 and his meeting about corruption and Ukraine’s business climate with then-President Petro Poroshenko during the U.N. General Assembly meeting in Sept. 2017.

In his opening statement, Anderson stated that he has worked as a Foreign Service Officer since 2005 and spent the last five years on issues related to Ukraine. As an external unit chief at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, he said, he worked closely with Yovanovitch from 2015 and 2017. Anderson said Volker asked him to become special adviser for Ukraine negotiations in Aug. 2017.

Anderson said that his work has sometimes posed risks for him and his family, including “harassment and intimidation by hostile intelligence services, death threats, and other significant challenges.”

“I have accepted these burdens because I believe we are advancing a cause greater than ourselves and are working to promote the general welfare,” his statement read."

Many allies of President Trump rushed to explain away the poor performance of incumbent Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) as an anomaly, while other GOP veterans expressed alarm about the party’s failure in a state where Trump won by nearly 30 percentage points in 2016 — and where he just campaigned this week.

Although Bevin was controversial and widely disliked, he was also a devotee of the president, embracing Trump’s agenda and his anti-establishment persona. And in the contest’s final days, Bevin sought to cast his candidacy as a bulwark against House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry of Trump.

But Bevin’s attempt to nationalize his cause by stoking conservative grievances about the impeachment process was not enough to overcome his problems, nor was Trump’s raucous rally for the governor on Monday — raising questions about Trump’s political strength as he faces a barrage of challenges and a difficult path to reelection.

The outcome — with Democrat Andy Beshear claiming victory with a lead of several thousand votes and Bevin refusing to concede — underscored how Republicans are struggling to navigate choppy political waters as the 2020 campaign now begins in earnest. Trump continues to dominate the party, but many lawmakers are uneasy about their ability to defend his conduct and hold on to suburban support.

Yet few Republicans are willing to even lightly criticize Trump because they widely believe they will need his voters’ backing and enthusiasm to survive next year.

Still, the Kentucky defeat has sparked concern among the party’s donors and many longtime GOP leaders who are worried that the nonstop twists of the House impeachment inquiry and Trump’s growing fury are making it increasingly difficult for Republicans to make a clear and compelling case to voters.

Democratic successes Tuesday in the vote-rich suburbs of Philadelphia were also cited as another example of Republican trouble in Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2016. In the critical Delaware County suburbs, Democrats held on to all five seats on the county council and the party also did well in local races in nearby Bucks County.

“Taking a step back from KY and looking at all the elections last night, GOP should be most concerned about what happened in local elections in Chester, Delaware and Bucks County, PA,” Josh Holmes, a McConnell confidant and political strategist, tweeted. “That is genuinely alarming if you know the voting history.”

Former Pennsylvania congressman Ryan Costello, a moderate Republican from the Philadelphia suburbs, said “there appears to be an electoral realignment in the suburbs” and warned Republicans to take notice.

“Republicans aren’t leaning in on the issues that affect suburban, affluent voters like gun safety and the environment,” Costello said. “Plus, Trump is not a benefit but a burden. That forces Republicans to have to ask voters to really hear them out on issues like taxes and school safety even if those voters don’t like Trump and that’s not easy.”

“It was a rough night,” said Scott Reed, the chief political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “The Republican Party is lacking message discipline, and that needs to be addressed. There is a lot of positive news around President Trump’s governing on the economy, on regulations and judges, and it seems to be overwhelmed by the drama.”

“It’s a definite shot across the bow, even though Republicans picked up the state attorney general position in Kentucky,” said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, referring to Republican Daniel Cameron, who became the first African American to win that office. “But losing the governorship is a smack at both Mitch McConnell and the president, sending up a cautionary note.”

Steele added, “Just because Trump shows up doesn’t mean an automatic win anymore.”

Allies of McConnell, the Senate majority leader, argued that Bevin’s loss did not indicate any looming trouble for him, who is up for reelection in 2020 and is working to hold the Senate GOP together amid the impeachment debate.

“Republicans won every office on the ballot except [Bevin’s],” Scott Jennings, a longtime McConnell adviser, tweeted. “Some unique candidate problems. GOP brand was fine elsewhere.”

Early Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted, “Based on the Kentucky results, [McConnell] will win BIG in Kentucky next year!”

Some Republicans, however, also viewed Beshear’s appeals to moderation as a sign that Republicans cannot take red-state races for granted.

Instead of drifting to the left, the son of former governor Steve Beshear railed against Bevin’s divisive style and his attempts to slow the expansion of Medicaid under former president Barack Obama’s health-care law.

“Republicans look at that and say, ‘Anything could be competitive if the Democrats are going to be on their games like they were with Beshear here,’ ” said former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum (R). “You’re seeing Democrats building on what they did in 2018, running more moderate candidates and making sure those candidates are financed.”

In a statement, Democratic Governors Association Chair Gina Raimondo congratulated Andy Beshear.

“Governor-Elect Andy Beshear will restore decency to Frankfort and has spent his career lifting up every single Kentuckian,” she said. “Tonight’s victory is a major pickup for Democrats and a massive rejection of Bevin’s record of stoking chaos, undermining public education, and trying to gut health care coverage.”

On Monday night — less than 12 hours before the polls opened — Trump appeared at a rally in Lexington, Ky., to support Bevin but also made sure the crowd knew his own reputation was on the line.

“If you lose, they will say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world,” said Trump, pointing at a bank of news cameras. “You can’t let that happen to me, and you can’t let that happen to your incredible state.”

Trump’s campaigning fared better in deep-red Mississippi, where Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves (R) defeated Democratic attorney general Jim Hood on Tuesday in that state’s governor’s race.

Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) said in an interview prior to the race being called that campaigns in the Deep South, including the Mississippi gubernatorial contest, have drawn attention because both parties are giving them serious attention and fielding candidates with the ability to win statewide.

In late 2017, Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) won a special election for U.S. Senate, giving Democrats hope of a comeback in similar states.

“We had two statewide officials running against each other and we haven’t had that in years,” Wicker said. He dismissed the suggestion that Trump’s standing could diminish. “If this race was about Trump, it’d be a 60-40 race” in Republicans’ favor.

When asked if Democrats are figuring out ways to do better in the South, Jones said earlier Tuesday: “We’re doing that, that’s pretty obvious with the way things are going. Democrats speak to voters in the South more than they have in the last two generations.”

The gubernatorial races in Kentucky and Mississippi came one year after Democrats made major inroads in statehouses, including flipping seven governorships and more than 400 state legislative seats. Many of those gains were in Midwestern or coastal states that formed the backbone of the backlash to Trump in the 2018 midterm elections. Louisiana also holds a runoff election Nov. 16 to decide the governor’s race there.

In 2016, Trump carried Kentucky by about 30 points, Louisiana by about 20 points and Mississippi by about 17 points.

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), reflecting the views of several Senate Republicans on Tuesday, said he did not see Kentucky as a bellwether for 2020 even if the president was making it sound that way during his remarks at Monday’s rally.

“It’s not a national race except in the sense the president wants to make it about him,” Cornyn said. “Nobody likes to lose, but I wouldn’t call it a bellwether for 2020. Look, if the Democrats elect Elizabeth Warren as their nominee, I think it’s going to come at a price for them.”

“Bevin’s got his own problems,” Cornyn said. “That’s unrelated to national politics.”"

No, if Biden wants to help the ticket make up for ground lost since the Denver debacle, he needs a different approach. An approach that doesn’t assume his listeners already agree with him. He needs to walk people through some political realities the way he’d explain them to a small roomful of independent or undecided voters.

“My friends,” Biden should say, “we can’t be sure at this point what Mitt Romney’s ‘real’ philosophy and values are. He governed Massachusetts as a centrist Republican and did things that I applaud — like enacting a universal health plan with the support of Ted Kennedy. That plan became a model for the president’s national reform.

“But then Governor Romney sold his soul to the right wing of his party to get the nomination – and adopted extreme conservative positions on taxes, immigration, health care, women’s rights and more.

""Did Romney call for well-off Americans to contribute nothing to deficit reduction — or for hard-working high school graduates to be deported, though they were brought here as children – or for millions of poor workers to be stripped of basic health coverage – because he really believes in this pinched vision of America? Or did he do it because he thought that's what it took to win the nomination?

“I have no idea, my friends. And neither does anyone else.

“That’s the point. It’s impossible to know Mitt Romney’s real values. But it’s entirely possible to understand the conservative forces Romney has pandered to and empowered in his thirst for office. They’re the same extremists who will be calling the shots if you send him to the White House.

“The selection of Paul Ryan was part of Governor Romney’s strategy to court the right wing. The key thing I want to persuade you of tonight, then, is why Congressman Ryan’s values, and those of today’s congressional Republicans who stand with him, are out of step with America’s best traditions and current needs.

“Let me be clear: I’ve worked with Republicans over my entire 40-year career. You can’t accomplish anything in Washington if you don’t. But something a little crazy has gotten into the water the GOP has been drinking these last few years. Too many Republicans today won’t support the policies we need to renew America’s middle class and assure opportunity and security in a global age.

“Let me also stipulate that Paul is a hard-working young man and has a lovely family. My critique isn’t personal. But Paul is skilled at wrapping his ideas in a pleasant-sounding package that I’ll ask you to look beyond tonight.

“Here are three things you need to understand about my opponent and the congressional Republicans who share his views.

Share this article Share

“First, on taxes: The single highest priority of Mr. Ryan and Republicans in Congress has been to cut taxes on America’s top earners — even though we’ve been at war for a decade and have huge deficits to shrink. This is the first time in our history that America has cut taxes for top earners at a time of war. Mitt Romney and congressional Republicans think we should let other people’s children fight our wars, and let other people’s children pick up the tab for them later. The president and I believe this is wrong.

""Second: Paul Ryan and the Republicans are NOT 'fiscal conservatives.' Fiscal conservatives pay for the government they want. Ryan's budget, which his party endorsed, doesn't balance the budget until the 2030s and adds $14 trillion to the national debt along the way. The fastest-growing program in Ryan's budget is interest on the debt. What kind of 'conservative' has a 25-year plan to balance the budget? The president has a balanced approach to tame the deficit in the next decade while still making critical investments in education, research and infrastructure.

""Finally, Ryan has said that programs like Social Security and Medicare have become 'a hammock, which lulls able-bodied people into lives of complacency and dependency.' I'm not saying this view makes him evil. But it's deeply misguided. It's an ideological stance that could only be taken by someone who hasn't thought about, or is perhaps personally insulated from, the challenges faced by millions of Americans every day. It suggests a readiness to return life in America to its rougher state a hundred years ago, before both parties came together to assure basic health care and retirement security for seniors.

“My opponent sees these programs as breeding ‘dependency.’ We’ve heard Governor Romney say much the same thing behind closed doors. This may have been a legitimate debate...in the 19th century. But shredding our safety net is not what America needs at a time when global competition and rapid technological change are leaving Americans increasingly vulnerable.

“There’s more we’ll get into – especially on jobs, where Republicans killed the president’s plan that would have created 2 million new jobs and left unemployment tonight below 7 percent. And of course Medicare, where our differences are profound.

“But these three areas show that the army of extreme conservatives Mitt Romney would bring with him to power are not what they pretend to be. I look forward to explaining this tonight, so at this critical juncture America can choose to move forward...”

In an interview with the Des Moines Register, Romney seemed to back away from his antiabortion position, suggesting that he would not actively pursue legislation that would outlaw abortions, a key objective among social conservatives.

“There’s no legislation with regards to abortion that I’m familiar with that would become part of my agenda,” Romney told the paper’s editorial board. “One thing I would change however which would be done by executive order and not by legislation is that I would reinstate the Mexico City policy which is that foreign aid dollars from the United States would not be used to carry out abortion in other countries.”

Later, Romney, who spent the day in Ohio, appeared to back away from his remarks, saying: “I think I’ve said time and again that I’m a pro-life candidate and I’ll be a pro-life president.”

Romney’s comments come as the race for the White House tightens and as both candidates look to ensure base turnout in key swing states, such as Iowa, yet also look for ways to appeal to undecided, more centrist voters in states such as Ohio and Virginia.

During and after the debate last week, Romney has shifted and softened his earlier statements on several issues in moves apparently aimed at the center. In addition to Tuesday night’s comments on abortion, Romney has recently changed his tone and message on immigration, saying that he would not revoke the status of young illegal immigrants granted a two year deportation reprieve under an Obama order, yet still would end the program.

He also backed completely away from earlier comments captured in an undercover video that 47 percent of Americans were government freeloaders.

A Pew poll shows that Romney has gained significant ground among women voters since the debate, making up an 18-point deficit and now drawing even with Obama.

And as much as Romney needs to perform well among women, he also needs to perform well among social conservatives in states like Iowa, if he is to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the White House.

A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist Poll showed Obama with an eight point edge, 50 percent to 42 percent, among likely Iowa voters. But the Sept. 20 poll was taken before Romney’s dominant performance in the first debate.

In 2008, Obama won Iowa by eight points. Bush won the state in 2004, by about 13,000 votes. Social conservatives are hugely important to Romney’s chances in Iowa and with his recent statements on abortion he is highlighting a long-standing rift that has yet to be fully repaired according to some conservatives.

“I’m running out of fingers and toes to count the number of positions he has taken on abortion,” said Steve Deace, a conservative radio host in Iowa. “This is someone who does not have a deep or abiding position on this issue either way, and I think what it does is it puts pro-life leadership in America in a difficult position. I don’t know anybody in the pro-family movement who is not for sale who trusts him. People want to know who the person is that they are voting for at their core. I just don’t think he cares.”

Democrats, who have consistently run ads in states like Virginia that highlight Romney’s more conservative statements on abortion, seized on Romney’s seeming shift, yet said that he wasn’t flip-flopping, only hiding his real views on the issue.

“We are not saying he’s changed his mind. We are saying he’s trying to cover up his beliefs. He’s been running for president for six years, and every step of the way he’s been anti-choice, against Roe v. Wade, promised to appoint justices,” said Stephanie Cutter on an Obama campaign conference call with reporters. “Now he’s trying to soften his positions. He has not changed his mind, he’s just trying to hide them. That’s the difference here. He’s suddenly trying to hide because the positions are not working for him.”

Romney’s positions on abortion have run the gamut since a 1994 Senate race against then Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) .

“I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country. I have since the time my mom took that position when she ran in 1970 as a U.S. Senate candidate,” he said in a 1994 debate. “I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for twenty years that we should sustain and support it. And I sustain and support that law and the right of a woman to make that choice.”

That same year, in an interview with The Boston Herald, Romney said:

“[Roe v. Wade] has been the law of the land for over 20 years, and I do not want to change it, overturn it, reverse it,” he said. “I want it to remain the law of the land.”

Romney later changed his position, saying he would support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, “because it is bad law and bad medicine,” in a 2011 interview with the National Review.

Deace said Romney’s changing positions could hurt him among social conservatives, particularly in Iowa.

“You don’t see Obama looking for ways to spit in the eye of his own base,” Deace said. “You don’t have to offend that many people to affect the outcome. I hope Democrats push him on this. I hope Obama presses this issue because people deserve to know. This is a fundamental issue.”

But other conservatives continued to express support for Romney."

Douglas MacArthur delivered a final speech to the corps of cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He was nearing the end of his of life, and he knew it. “The soldier, above all other people, prays for peace,” he said, “for he must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war.”

For Veterans Day, here are some historical photos of Americans who served celebrating the end of war and coming home.

Alta May Andrews, who served in the Army Nurse Corps in France during World War I, is on the far right in the above photo. Her collection of more than 400 photos from her service are at the National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Mo.

Though the above photo, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1974, has been named “Burst of Joy,” the Air Force pilot’s return was anything but. Soon after his release from a North Vietnamese prison camp — days before this photo was taken — Lt. Col. Robert L. Stirm received a letter from his wife telling him she wanted a divorce.

Pompeo said the Trump administration, as it did with recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and Israel’s sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights, had simply “recognized the reality on the ground.”

The move upends more than 40 years of U.S. policy that has declared Israeli expansion into territories occupied since the 1967 war a major obstacle to settling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

In response to a question, Pompeo denied that the announcement was connected to turmoil in Israel in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has supported the Israeli annexation of West Bank territory, is fighting for his political life.

“The timing of this was not tied to anything that had to do with domestic politics anywhere,” he said. “We conducted our review, and this was the appropriate time to bring it forward.”

More than 700,000 settlers have taken up residence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since the 1967 war. Both areas are claimed by Palestinians for a future state.

Since Israel first occupied the territories, only the Carter administration, based on a 1978 State Department legal opinion, has outright declared settlements illegal, although all administrations since then have described them as an impediment to peace and have called for freezing settlement expansion and new construction.

A month before President Trump took office, Barack Obama — whose administration referred to settlements as “illegitimate” — became the first U.S. president to withhold a veto from one of countless U.N. resolutions that described them as illegal. In one of its final acts in office, that administration abstained from a U.N. vote that called settlements “a flagrant violation under international law,” allowing it to pass.

Then-Secretary of State John F. Kerry, in a speech explaining the abstention, referred to “the proliferation of settlement outposts that are illegal under Israel’s own laws.”

Pompeo said the administration was returning to policy under Ronald Reagan, pointing out that Reagan said in a 1981 interview that settlements were “not illegal.” Reagan went on in that interview, however, to say that settlements were “ill-advised.” His subsequent 1983 peace plan said that “the immediate adoption of a settlements freeze by Israel, more than any other action,” would enhance the prospects for peace.

“The United States government is expressing no view on the legal status of any individual settlement,” Pompeo said. Such assessments, he said, were up to Israeli courts, and “we are not addressing or prejudging the ultimate status of the West Bank. This is for the Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate.”

Advertisement

The announcement drew immediate criticism as ill-timed, and skepticism that it was unrelated to both Israeli and U.S. politics.

“I’m mystified by the timing,” said Dennis Ross, who played a lead role in shaping Middle East policy under several administrations from Reagan to Obama. “If you were still interested in presenting the Trump peace plan, you wouldn’t want to do something that puts key Arab leaders . . . in a position where they would be much more moved to oppose it.”

Introduction of the Middle East peace plan that Trump promised at the beginning of his administration has been delayed repeatedly.

Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East peace negotiator under Republican and Democratic administrations, said that “in essence, this has validated and greenlighted the entire settlement enterprise . . . at a time when the peace process is all but comatose, and they know it probably won’t reemerge.”

In Israel, both Netanyahu and former army chief Benny Gantz, who are each vying to form a government following deadlocked elections in September, hailed the shift.

Share this article Share

“The fate of the settlements and the residents of Judea and Samaria should be determined by agreements that meet security requirements and that can promote peace,” Gantz said in a statement, using the biblical names for the West Bank that have become the popular parlance among Israelis in recent years.

Netanyahu, who has been a staunch supporter of settlements and proposed annexing the Jordan Valley into Israel proper, praised the move as reflecting “a historical truth — that the Jewish people are not foreign colonialists in Judea and Samaria. In fact, we are called Jews because we are the people of Judea.”

But Pompeo’s announcement was met with dismay by Palestinian leaders as well as peace advocates who view the expansion of settlements as lessening the likelihood — and the size — of a possible future Palestinian state.

“Israeli settlements steal Palestinian land, seize and exploit Palestinian natural resources, and divide, displace and restrict the movement of the people of Palestine,” Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in a statement. “Once again, with this announcement, the Trump administration is demonstrating the extent to which it’s threatening the international system with its unceasing attempts to replace international law with the ‘law of the jungle.’ ”

Ayman Odeh, the leader of a faction of Israeli Arab members of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, tweeted: “No foreign minister will change the fact that the settlements were built on occupied land where an independent Palestinian state should one day stand beside the State of Israel.”

Softening the U.S. stance on settlements comes as a late-breaking boost to Netanyahu as he clings to power at a dicey political moment; his rival Gantz has less than two days left to form a government before the process opens to free-for-all negotiations by the entire parliament. Netanyahu is also widely expected to be indicted on corruption charges in coming weeks, if not days.

“Israel is deeply grateful to President Trump, Secretary Pompeo and the entire US administration for their steadfast position supporting truth and justice,” Netanyahu said in his statement.

Pompeo also announced the cancellation of a sanctions waiver that permitted companies from the European Union and Russia to work with Iran as it converted an underground uranium-

enrichment facility into a “nuclear, physics, and technology center,” per the terms of the Obama administration’s 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

Pompeo said that waiver will be eliminated on Dec. 15, after Iran’s announcement that it will ramp up uranium enrichment at the facility. The decision exposes foreign companies that work with Iran on the facility to U.S. penalties.

“The right amount of uranium enrichment for the world’s largest state sponsor of terror is zero,” Pompeo said.

Critics have said that terminating the waivers is needlessly vindictive and risks an even more dangerous confrontation with Iran.

In Iraq, where the government has unleashed a deadly clampdown on anti-corruption protesters, Pompeo said the United States was prepared to slap new sanctions on officials proven to be corrupt or who are involved in the violent clashes with peaceful demonstrators that have left 315 dead since last month.

“We will not stand idle while the corrupt officials make the Iraqi people suffer,” Pompeo said. “We support the Iraqi people as they strive for a prosperous Iraq that’s free of corruption. . . . Iraq’s leaders must protect human rights.”"

Pugh, a once-rising political star, ran a years-long scheme involving her self-published children’s books to boost her career and benefit her campaign, according to federal charges made public Wednesday. Pugh, who resigned in May after revelations about the lucrative deals for her Healthy Holly series, is set to appear in federal court in Baltimore Thursday to face charges of wire fraud and tax evasion that touched off another political crisis and laments about public corruption that sets back the city.

Pugh, 69, was the second Baltimore mayor to leave office in the past decade while facing corruption allegations.

Prosecutors accuse Pugh of running a sham business dating to 2011, when she was a state senator and before her days overseeing Maryland’s largest city. She is accused of ripping off nonprofit organizations and taxpayers by accepting payments for tens of thousands of books she never intended to deliver. Pugh used the money, according to court papers, to fund her mayoral bid and to buy and renovate a house in Baltimore.

Pugh churned book sales and replenished her inventory by selling the same volumes multiple times, prosecutors said, including taking back books intended as donations to Baltimore school students. Most of the books, stashed at locations throughout the city, were marketed and sold directly to companies and foundations that did business or tried to get business with the state and city of Baltimore, prosecutors allege.

Maryland U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur, in a news conference along with top officials from the FBI and Internal Revenue Service, called Pugh’s alleged actions a “betrayal of the public trust,” adding that “the victims are all of us.”

“This is a tragedy and the last thing that our city needs,” Hur said.

The charges come after searches in April of Baltimore City Hall, Pugh’s homes and a nonprofit tied to her. Federal agents sought financial documents and other information related to almost $800,000 she allegedly was paid for the books, an enormous amount in the world of children’s literature.

Pugh’s attorney, Steven D. Silverman, said the former mayor plans to present herself to authorities at the start of her court hearing. Silverman declined to comment on the charges.

Two former Baltimore employees, Gary Brown Jr., 38, a longtime Pugh aide who worked at City Hall, and Roslyn Wedington, 50, who ran a nonprofit linked to the case, have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and to filing false tax returns, court papers unsealed Wednesday show.

Pugh, a state lawmaker for more than a decade, was elected mayor in 2016. Her downfall stunned friends and supporters and was another blow to the city struggling with ongoing violence and scarred by 2015 riots after the death of Freddie Gray from an injury in police custody.

Last week, the city recorded its 300th homicide for the fifth consecutive year. The grim numbers threaten to once again leave Baltimore with the highest or near the highest homicide rate in the country.

The breadth and scope of the alleged corruption dismayed Democratic political leaders, who said it erodes their ability to advocate for Baltimore and further undermines residents’ trust in leaders trying to guide the beleaguered city to a better place. Pugh came in as mayor in part after portraying herself as a candidate with more integrity than former Baltimore mayor Sheila Dixon, who resigned as part of a plea deal for stealing gift cards meant for the poor.

“This news is going to make it just that much harder for us,” said Sen. Antonio L. Hayes, the Baltimore Democrat elected to the seat Pugh previously held. The scandal, he said, “has thrown our political system into a tailspin. It’s provided instability in the mayor’s office, and it’s trickled down.”

Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said in a statement that “the people of Baltimore, and all Marylanders, should be able to have confidence in the honesty and character of the people they elect to office. It is completely unacceptable anytime a public official violates the public trust.”

Three years ago, state investigators began scrutinizing donations to Pugh’s mayoral campaign. That led federal investigators in early 2017 to payments made to Pugh for her book series, which follows an African American girl, Holly, and is aimed at promoting a healthy lifestyle.

In March, the Baltimore Sun first reported that Pugh received $500,000 from the University of Maryland Medical System for a total of 100,000 books beginning in in 2011, when Pugh served on a state Senate committee that partially funded the private hospital network — and was on its board.

Pugh resigned from the board, on which she had served for 18 years. She returned $100,000 for a shipment of books she said was not completed.

In all, court records show, Pugh took purchase orders for roughly 124,000 books but had printers produce only 63,210.

Hur suggested Wednesday that investigators were continuing to look at book buyers who would have been aware the purchases amounted to a bribery scheme. The indictment states that one buyer, the owner of a company that did business with the city, knew money he paid Pugh for books would not go in full to the school system but would instead be diverted to her campaign — and to help Pugh buy a new house.

When asked whether additional indictments would be forthcoming or if some bought books expecting a direct benefit or to leverage Pugh’s influence in return, Hur said he could not comment beyond saying, “All very interesting questions but not ones that I can answer at this point. We look forward to telling more in court.”

Pugh was hospitalized with pneumonia for five days in late March and took an indefinite leave April 1. She never returned to her job at City Hall.

Longtime City Council President Bernard C. “Jack” Young was elevated to acting mayor and has served as mayor since her resignation. Young plans to run for mayor in the 2020 election.

The 11-count indictment handed up by a grand jury last week and unsealed Wednesday charges Pugh with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, seven counts of wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and two counts of tax evasion.

Brown’s lawyer, Barry Pollack, said in a statement that Brown “regrets his role in this matter, has resolved the charges against him, and trusts that the court process will treat everyone involved fairly.” Brown signed a plea deal Nov. 5.

Wedington’s attorney, Brandon R. Mead, said his client has “taken ownership of the allegations against her.” She agreed to help Brown because he offered her a way to repay outstanding student loan and health-care debts, for which her wages were being garnished.

“She was presented a way out by Mr. Brown, and unfortunately she took advantage of that,” Mead said Wednesday. Wedington, who signed a plea deal Sept. 20, “looks forward to making amends,” which includes paying back taxes.

All three face the possibility of lengthy prison sentences.

Prosecutors allege the scheme spanned the period in which Pugh held leadership positions in the Maryland Senate. She was elevated to majority leader in 2015.

When Pugh was elected mayor the next year, Brown was designated to fill a vacancy in the House of Delegates. The morning Brown was scheduled to be sworn in, state prosecutors charged him with campaign finance violations tied to Pugh which — Brown admitted in his plea unsealed Wednesday — were funneled through Healthy Holly sales.

Brown’s swearing-in was canceled, and he pleaded guilty.

Pugh is accused of writing “Healthy Holly checks” to Brown, which he cashed before returning the money to Pugh to fund straw donations to her election committee.

Though Brown didn’t move to a state seat, Pugh kept him on the staff at City Hall, where he had an office on the same floor as the mayor’s and sometimes worked on promoting and selling her books, according to Brown’s plea agreement.

According to his agreement, the pair diverted money in three ways.

Brown admitted that they promised to fill book orders but kept the purchase money and didn’t provide the books.

In other cases, his plea states, they provided books to purchasers, but skimmed some for Pugh’s use at public appearance and campaign events.

They also plucked books from storage from an inventory bought and donated for use by schoolchildren.

Starting in 2011, for instance, Brown’s plea states that Pugh began negotiating initial deals with the University of Maryland Medical System for a total of $300,000 for 60,000 copies of three Healthy Holly books — “Exercising is Fun”; “A Healthy Start for Herbie”; and “Fruits Come in Colors Like the Rainbow.” The sales were contingent on the books being donated and distributed to Baltimore schoolchildren.

The schools chose not to use the books as part of the curriculum — the books had grammar and spelling errors that needed to be corrected.

The school system moved the books to a warehouse for possible distribution to students but Pugh and Brown later arranged to remove thousands from that stash, sometimes using city employees, according to Brown’s admission.

The pair took those books, and others already diverted, and used Associated Black Charities, a Baltimore-based public charity, “to facilitate the resale and distribution of the books to new purchasers.”

Neither the medical system nor the charity “knew that Pugh and Brown were double selling the books,” according to Brown’s guilty plea.

Pugh stored the books at various locations — at her house, government offices in the state legislature and in Baltimore, in the mailroom and a warehouse of the Baltimore school’s system, and vehicles owned by the city, the plea papers show.

Prosecutors also allege Pugh evaded taxes on her books sales and underreported her income, paying $4,168 in taxes, not the $102,444 the government said she owed for 2016 — the year she was elected Baltimore mayor."

As his unfiltered thoughts streamed from his mind, through a telephone receiver and onto the airwaves of Fox News for 53 minutes, it became clear that the prospect of impeachment has changed nothing about Trump’s un­or­tho­dox approach to the presidency.

He continued to make lofty promises of soon-to-come bombshells, peddle falsehoods, spread long-debunked conspiracy theories, attack his perceived enemies and dabble in misogynistic tropes — all while playing the role of persecuted victim.

Trump’s phone conversation with the hosts of “Fox & Friends” also undercut Republicans’ strained efforts to defend him during the House impeachment inquiry.

He attacked witnesses — including those who had been requested by Republicans — saying he hardly knew them. He continued to smear his former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, and said House Republicans hadn’t followed his example only because, they told him, “she’s a woman, we have to be nice.” And he briefly appeared to welcome the prospect of being impeached by the House, saying “I want a trial” in the Senate.

Trump also parroted the unfounded theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for hacking Democrats’ emails during the 2016 presidential campaign, a baseless claim most Republican lawmakers tried to sidestep during the hearings.

“They gave the server to CrowdStrike, or whatever it’s called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian,” the president said, indicating that his concerns about “corruption” in Ukraine were linked to a politically convenient conspiracy theory. “That’s a big part of this whole thing. Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company?”

Trump’s former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, has said he repeatedly informed the president that the allegation was false. On Thursday, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee took umbrage when Trump’s former Russia adviser, Fiona Hill, accused them of promoting a “fictional narrative” of Ukrainian election meddling promoted by the Kremlin.

Trump appeared unfazed by the fact that not even his staunchest defenders have embraced his claims about CrowdStrike, a company he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate during the July 25 phone call at the heart of the impeachment proceedings.

“Are you sure they did that? Are you sure they gave it to Ukraine?” Fox’s Steve Doocy asked Trump.

“Well, that’s what the word is,” the president said, offering no evidence. “That’s what I asked, actually, in my phone call, if you know. I asked it very point blank because we’re looking for corruption.”

Republican lawmakers have tried to make the case that Trump withheld military aid and a White House visit from Ukraine while seeking investigations of Democrats in part because he had legitimate concerns about corruption in the country. House Democrats have dismissed that defense, saying Trump and his lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani used the pretext of corruption to try to secure probes targeting former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as the unfounded claims about Ukraine’s role in the 2016 election.

Several witnesses from Trump’s own administration have testified that the president’s push for “investigations” was a thinly veiled political effort to boost his reelection chances.

While Trump’s convoluted impeachment defense has lacked consistency, his Fox interview underscored how he has never wavered in his willingness to attack Democrats.

He blasted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) as a “sick puppy,” called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) “crazy as a bedbug” and, without evidence, accused top officials from the Obama administration of “spying on my campaign.”

His attacks got an assist from Fox’s Ainsley Earhardt, who helped the president peddle the falsehood that Trump’s release of a rough transcript of his July 25 call with Zelensky had undermined Democrats’ impeachment claims.

“Why did [Schiff] make up my statement?” Trump asked, referring to an exaggerated account of the phone call Schiff gave that added mob-boss flair to the president’s actual words.

“Because he didn’t think you were going to release the transcript,” Earhardt responded.

“That’s right,” Trump replied. “Exactly.”

Except it was wrong. Schiff’s rendition came after the White House released the rough transcript of the call.

The Fox News hosts also repeatedly challenged Trump to offer evidence when he made his most head-scratching claims. The president repeatedly demurred.

“What are you talking about?” Doocy asked when Trump predicted that his Justice Department was on the verge of exposing “perhaps the biggest scandal in the history of our country.”

Trump’s answer was vague.

“I think you’re going to see things that are going to be incredible,” he said, adding that he has not been personally involved in any of the Justice Department’s investigations into the origins of the FBI’s Russia probe.

“Who is your source that’s telling you this?” Fox’s Brian Kilmeade asked when Trump claimed that Obama administration officials had worked to undermine his presidency from its earliest days.

“I can’t tell you that,” Trump answered. “I can only say that we have a lot of information that a lot of bad things happened.”

“You electrified the wall?” Kilmeade asked when the president casually claimed that the barrier on the southern border had been equipped with electricity.

“We’re building a fantastic wall,” Trump responded. It wasn’t clear if he had heard the question.

Trump’s classic braggadocio was on display for much of the interview, in tandem with his penchant for playing the victim. He complained of negative media coverage while claiming that his administration had accomplished more than any other in history. He also credited himself with saving thousands of lives in Hong Kong.

“If it weren’t for me, Hong Kong would’ve been obliterated in 14 minutes,” he said, claiming that China had refrained from cracking down on pro-democracy protesters at his request.

He also suggested that, to pave the way for a trade deal with China, he might veto bipartisan legislation designed to support the Hong Kong protesters.

“We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with President Xi [Jinping],” Trump said.

He complained that he had not been given adequate credit for the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a raid he approved last month.

“If Obama did al-Baghdadi, the biggest terrorist in the last 100 years, if Obama did it, it would be a two-year story,” Trump said. “With me, I got a day. Not that it matters.”



He lamented that when he arrived in Washington, the government was filled with “thousands of people that are Never Trumpers,” people he said are now testifying against him.

But many of the witnesses in the impeachment inquiry, including Hill, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker and acting ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor, are people his administration specifically hired.

Trump also launched into gender-specific criticism of several women, including one in his own White House.

He described Yovanovitch as “the ambassador, the woman,” and described a conversation with Republicans in which her gender was brought up.

“I said, ‘Why are you being so kind?,’ ” Trump said, before recounting what he said was the GOP response: “Well sir, she’s a woman, we have to be nice.”

“This was not an angel, this woman, okay?” he said.

Yovanovitch testified last week that she was forced to leave her post in Ukraine because of a smear campaign led by Trump’s allies.

Trump described Pelosi, the first female speaker of the House, as “not talented,” “highly overrated” and “totally incompetent.”

And he criticized the husband of one of his top White House aides, Kellyanne Conway, by hinting that he had been traumatized by the marriage."
760,760,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/23/climate-change-protesters-swarm-harvard-yale-football-game-with-chants-ok-boomer/,0,"Hundreds of climate change protesters swarmed the field during halftime of the annual Harvard-Yale football game Saturday, delaying the action for nearly an hour as students chanted “OK boomer” and as police made arrests and issued summonses for disorderly conduct. Players from both teams joined demonstrators on the field in a showstopping escalation of long-running campaigns for the two schools to stop investing their endowments in fossil fuels and forgive Puerto Rican debt. Protesters sat at the 50-yard line at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Conn., arms linked and chanting, as banners echoed calls for urgent change championed by lawmakers and activists around the country: “This is an emergency,” one sign read.

The protest quickly became a cause celebre among political figures, but its disruptive tactics were divisive. A Yale spokesperson expressed disapproval of the interruption, while a Harvard representative said the school “respectfully disagree[s] with divestment activists” over how to confront climate change.

At the demonstration’s peak, 500 people were on the field, protesters said. Forty-two people were issued misdemeanor summonses, according to Yale officials.

“This is an absolutely thrilling experience, and we’re very excited about the support that it garnered from all over,” Sidney Carlson-White, a Yale student and Fossil Free Yale spokesman, said in a phone interview.

INCREDIBLE to see this video of fans STORMING the field from the stands to join @FossilFreeYale and @DivestHarvard. Our movement is big. We stand united. #NobodyWins so long as our universities stay invested in injustice. https://t.co/kgZ7e7uifp — Divest Harvard 🔶 (@DivestHarvard) November 23, 2019

As officials asked protesters to leave, another 100 students unaffiliated with the divest movement walked onto the field to join them. Some fans booed and said the protest humiliated the schools.

“They’re all supposed to be intelligent people. It looks like there’s a lot of common sense that has missed their generation,” said Chuck Crummie, 68, who attended the game with his son, a former Yale football player. “It goes to show that this generation is all about themselves and not a football game.”

“They’re playing for the Ivy League title here, maybe costing the Ivy League championship,” Roy Emanuelson, 60, said of Yale, which entered the game 8-1. “I think the end result’s unrealistic. Now if you’ve made your point, leave the field. Show your class.”

Police arrested the protesters, who had planned not to leave the field any other way, Carlson-White said. Organizers, who had been planning the on-field incursion since August, had lawyers standing by for students to call after being detained.

“Being connected to a very powerful law school has its benefits,” Carlson-White said.

New Haven Police did not immediately provide comment, and school spokespeople did not discuss the arrests.

The protest caused a delay of a little over an hour and caused the game, which went into double overtime, to end in near darkness because the Yale Bowl does not have lights. Yale ultimately won 50-43 just moments before it became too dark to continue the game. Including the delay, Saturday’s edition of the rivalry known as “The Game” ran 4 hours, 40 minutes and afterward students stormed the field to celebrate securing a share of the Ivy League title.

The result was overshadowed by the protest, though, and Democratic presidential candidates commended demonstrators as leaders in the nation’s climate crisis conversation.

“When people come together to stand up for justice, we win,” tweeted Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) “Congratulations to the young people demanding a sustainable future for our planet. We are with you in this fight.”

“From the March for Our Lives, to worldwide Climate Strikes, students and young people are leading the charge to protect their futures,” wrote former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julián Castro. “I’m inspired by their efforts to hold their universities to a higher standard.”

Added businessman and activist Tom Steyer, another Democratic primary candidate: “These students have it right. Nobody wins when we’re complicit in climate injustice. Institutions like Harvard and Yale must be leaders in the fight to address the climate crisis.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a major backer of the House’s “Green New Deal,” hailed the movement, tweeting, “Activism disrupts the present to change the future.”

Students at universities around the country have pushed their administrations to divest endowments from the fossil fuel industry over its role in climate change, with mixed success. Combined, Yale and Harvard have endowments of close to $71 billion, and many of the assets that make up those funds, demonstrators said, come from sources they find immoral.

“Our education is funded at times by Puerto Rican debt, the fossil fuel industry and private prisons,” Carlson-White said.

Advocates of divestment have expressed impatience as school officials say true independence from fossil fuels is impossible to achieve and argue that they can use their positions as shareholders to sway companies’ practices. Harvard football captain Wesley Ogsbury, a senior defensive back, said Yale and Harvard are investing in industries that are “destroying our futures.”

“When it comes to the climate crisis, no one wins,” he said in a video released by the Divest Harvard group. “Harvard and Yale can’t claim to truly promote knowledge while at the same time supporting the companies engaged in misleading the public, smearing academics and denying the truth.”

Harvard leaders have argued that the university should combat climate change through its research, despite dozens of U.S. schools’ decisions to divest and growing momentum at Harvard that extends beyond student activists. Hundreds of faculty members signed a petition this year calling for divestment, and prominent alumni such as former vice president Al Gore have written to university president Lawrence Bacow with the same message.

Yale has divested partially, but its chief investment officer David Swenson said last year that overhauling the university’s investment portfolio would be foolish because “we would all die” if fossil fuel production stopped.

“Every one of us in the room is a consumer,” Swenson said.

Yale spokeswoman Karen Peart did not address demonstrators’ message Saturday but said the university agrees with an Ivy League statement that the protest’s timing was “regrettable.”

“It is regrettable that the orchestrated protest came during a time when fellow students were participating in a collegiate career-defining contest and an annual tradition when thousands gather from around the world to enjoy and celebrate the storied traditions of both football programs and universities,” the statement read.

NCAA spokesman Greg Johnson said the situation did not violate NCAA playing rules.

Peart said the exercise of free expression is subject to conditions on campus and that “we do not allow disruption of university events.""

Harvard spokeswoman Rachael Dane said in an emailed statement that the university would not comment directly on the protest or police activity.

“Universities like Harvard have a crucial role to play in tackling climate change and Harvard is fully committed to leadership in this area through research, education, community engagement, dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint, and using our campus as a test bed for piloting and proving solutions,” she said.

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/obama-turns-jokes-jab-romnesia/story?id=17520123",0,"In advance of Monday's final presidential debate set for Florida, the candidates and their top surrogates have converged on this key swing state, where a prize of 29 electoral votes could determine who wins in November. The focus on Florida comes as the race for the White House enters its final stretch, with polls showing President Obama and Romney neck-and-neck in the Sunshine State.

Vice President Joe Biden, dispatched to Florida on the strength of his appeal to two key constituencies — seniors and blue-collar workers -- represented the Obama campaign Friday in the Tampa Bay area.

Ann Romney and Michelle Obama, both seeking to give their husbands an edge among female voters, have scheduled events in South Florida in the coming days.

On Thursday, Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan was on the trail in Fort Myers and Ocala, and he was set to join GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney in Daytona Beach on Friday evening for a large rally. It was the 10th straight week that the campaigns have had a presence in Florida.

The contest for the state has been tightly competitive for most of the year, with Obama’s mid-September edge now apparently gone. There has also been significant variability in polls taken after the first presidential debate, with a Mason-Dixon poll showing Romney up seven percentage points and an NBC-WSJ-Marist poll showing Obama up only one percentage point.

According to a CNN/ORC International poll conducted in Florida after the second presidential debate, the race is virtually tied. Romney has the support of 49% of likely voters, with 48% backing President Obama. Romney’s one point margin is well within the survey’s sampling error.

For Romney, the stakes in Florida couldn't be higher since his quest for 270 electoral votes will be much more challenging without a Florida win. He nabbed the endorsement of the Orlando Sentinel on Thursday. The paper endorsed Obama in 2008.

“Romney has a strong record of leadership to run on,” the editorial said. “He built a successful business. He rescued the 2002 Winter Olympics from scandal and mismanagement. As governor of Massachusetts, he worked with a Democrat-dominated legislature to close a $3 billion budget deficit without borrowing or raising taxes, and pass the health plan that became a national model. This is Romney’s time to lead, again.”

Obama, meanwhile, picked up the endorsement of the Tampa Bay Times.

“This is not the time to reverse course and return to the failed policies of the past,” the editorial says.

The recent drop in the national unemployment rate below 8 percent hasn’t helped Obama much in Florida, where the jobless rate for September was 8.7 percent, with just 800 jobs created according to state data released Friday. And the state is ranked No. 1 in the country for home foreclosures.

But during an event Friday in Sun City Center, Fla., Biden made the argument that Romney would make things worse, not better, for Floridians.

Biden said that until only recently, Romney and Ryan were touting ""massive tax cuts for the very wealthy, because they are the 'job creators' . . . and significant cuts, particularly in entitlements, to vital programs because that's the only way to get the country in shape, they argue.""

He criticized the Romney campaign for downplaying the Ryan budget already passed by the House that includes large tax cuts and a voucher option for Medicare.

“Now, after the convention, we find out, no, he didn’t mean that,” said Biden. “No, there’s no $5 trillion tax cut. We don’t have one of those. You heard Romney say that. You heard Ryan say that.

“Now he [Ryan] says, ‘I do not cut those programs. I just slow the growth of those programs.’”

“That’s like Romney standing in an unemployment line in Florida and turning to the guy and saying, ‘You know, I didn’t outsource your job. I offshored it.’ ”

That same sharp tone can be heard every day on Florida’s airwaves, which have been flooded with overwhelmingly negative ads. Some $136 million has been spent on campaign spots, with the edge going to Republicans, who have hammered the president with an ad saying that Obama used $716 billion from Medicare funds to pay for his health-care plan.

“The GOP ground game across Florida continues to build strength, with volunteers reaching nearly 10 million voter contacts, including almost 300,000 doors knocked in one week,” Republican National Committee spokesman Tom Brandt said Friday.

While Florida’s struggling economy appears to be helping Romney’s campaign, the state’s demographics, with Latino and African Americans making up nearly 30 percent of Florida voters, appear to be helping Obama. In 2008, he won the state by about 200,000 votes on the strength of those voting blocs in Miami, Orlando and Tampa, the site of the Republican National Convention this past summer.

Obama beat 2008 Republican nominee John McCain by 15 points among Latino voters.

But a recent Florida International University/Miami Herald/El Nuevo Herald poll shows Romney faring much better among Latinos than McCain. While Obama still leads in that group, 51 percent to 44 percent over Romney, the gap is much narrower because of Romney's strong showing among Cuban Americans, who view Obama's record on immigration, the economy and foreign policy more negatively than other Latinos do.

“The two biggest Latino voting blocs in Florida are Puerto Ricans and Cubans, and they don’t care as much about Romney’s immigration stances,” said Ana Navarro, who was national Hispanic campaign chairwoman for McCain in 2008. “They care more about the economy and more about foreign policy towards Latin America and are not particularly pleased with the way Obama has handled [Venezuelan President Hugo] Chavez and [Cuban leader Fidel] Castro and the undemocratic governments in the region.”

Navarro said the Romney ground game for Hispanic outreach in Florida is much better than McCain’s was in 2008. “They have many more resources than McCain had four years ago, and they are putting them to use in a real way.”

One group of Hispanic voters appears to be helping Romney gain more support — evangelical Christians.

According to a Pew Research Center study (based on polling done shortly after the first presidential debate), 39 percent of evangelical Hispanics that are registered voters back the Republican candidate; 50 percent back Obama.

By contrast, 73 percent of Catholic Latinos and 82 percent of religiously-unaffiliated Latinos support Obama over Romney.

National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference President Samuel Rodriguez recently told Religion & Politics magazine that Romney has “reached out extensively” to him and other Latino evangelicals. Rodriguez said Romney could strengthen his support in the community “if he emphasizes his commitment to faith, family, entrepreneurship and a just immigration reform solution.”"
783,783,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/11/29/black-or-green-friday-europe-shopping-frenzy-is-triggering-fierce-protests/,0,"WUSTERMARK, Germany — As environmental protesters were heading into Berlin to rally against the post-Thanksgiving shopping frenzy on Friday, others were heading the opposite direction on a hunt for the cheapest coats, socks or pants. At an eastern German outlet mall in Wustermark — about half an hour’s drive from the German capital — global protests against the Black Friday tradition and its impact on the environment went largely unnoticed on Friday. Rushing from store to store, shoppers were predominantly concerned about long lines.

“I don’t care about the protests,” said pensioner Harry Pomerenke, 66, who had come with his wife to purchase Christmas gifts.

The Black Friday lines in front of European stores have grown in recent years, as the U.S. tradition has caught on here after long being ridiculed. This year, Black Friday sales are expected to top prior records in a number of European countries — despite protests across the continent this week.

Prominent climate activist Luisa Neubauer joined scores of protesters in central Berlin on Friday to advocate more environmentally conscious shopping behavior, without “goods produced on the other side of the planet and shipped three times around,” she said. Meanwhile, in Rome, like-minded protesters carried signs that read “Green Friday,” with the word “Black” crossed out.

The backlash against Black Friday was also on full display in France, where more than 200 brands boycotted the sale for environmental reasons. Parliamentary deputies also approved an amendment that would ban Black Friday in the future.

The amendment, approved on Tuesday and attached to a broad anti-waste bill, is still far from becoming law, but the measure exemplified a growing sentiment that sales foster excessive consumerism, which in turn harms the environment. The vote came as environmental activists descended on Amazon facilities across the country. A number of activist groups see Amazon as a symbol of the consumerism they oppose.

“We criticize Amazon for having a destructive policy for the planet, for social conditions, and Black Friday allows this company to achieve exponential revenue,” Sandy Olivar Calvo, a spokeswoman for one of the activist groups, told France’s Le Monde newspaper. (Jeff Bezos, the chief executive and founder of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)

Élisabeth Borne, France’s environment minister, expressed her support for the proposed ban on Black Friday. “We cannot both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and call for a consumer frenzy,” she said, speaking to France’s BFM Television. “Above all, we must consume better.”

“Black Friday uses the legal haze around promotions, but it’s a campaign that’s similar to sales,” Delphine Batho, the parliamentary deputy who spearheaded the anti-Black Friday amendment, told France’s Le Parisien newspaper. “You have to sell stock, advertise. . . . The purpose of the amendment is thus to recognize that this is an aggressive commercial practice.”

Some lawmakers have criticized an outright ban. Bas Eickhout, a Dutch member of the European Parliament for the GreenLeft party, instead advocates providing consumers with more viable alternatives to products traded under environmentally unfriendly conditions.

“Some policymakers [are] suddenly talking about consumer behavior, and it almost feels like [policymakers] are pushing their responsibility aside,” Eickhout said. “We are being steered every day in our consumer behavior — and until now, a lot of those incentives are totally not based on sustainable considerations.”

At the Wustermark outlet mall, such proposals were received with skepticism.

One vendor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak on the record, said she felt that “there are things that would do a lot more for the environment than getting rid of Black Friday.”

But some felt conflicted. “I actually have mixed feelings about [Black Friday],” said Sabina Bertell, 45, a Swedish tourist visiting Berlin. “It’s a materialistic world we’re living in, and you can see it here. A lot of things you don’t need.”

In the interviews, more than 400 insiders offered unrestrained criticism of what went wrong in Afghanistan and how the United States became mired in nearly two decades of warfare.

With a bluntness rarely expressed in public, the interviews lay bare pent-up complaints, frustrations and confessions, along with second-guessing and backbiting.

Since 2001, more than 775,000 U.S. troops have deployed to Afghanistan, many repeatedly. Of those, 2,300 died there and 20,589 were wounded in action, according to Defense Department figures.

This series is the basis for a book, “The Afghanistan Papers: A Secret History of the War,” by Washington Post reporter Craig Whitlock. The book can be ordered here.

The interviews, through an extensive array of voices, bring into sharp relief the core failings of the war that persist to this day. They underscore how three presidents — George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump — and their military commanders have been unable to deliver on their promises to prevail in Afghanistan.

With most speaking on the assumption that their remarks would not become public, U.S. officials acknowledged that their warfighting strategies were fatally flawed and that Washington wasted enormous sums of money trying to remake Afghanistan into a modern nation.

The interviews also highlight the U.S. government’s botched attempts to curtail runaway corruption, build a competent Afghan army and police force, and put a dent in Afghanistan’s thriving opium trade.

The U.S. government has not carried out a comprehensive accounting of how much it has spent on the war in Afghanistan, but the costs are staggering.

Since 2001, the Defense Department, State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development have spent or appropriated between $934 billion and $978 billion, according to an inflation-adjusted estimate calculated by Neta Crawford, a political science professor and co-director of the Costs of War Project at Brown University.

Those figures do not include money spent by other agencies such as the CIA and the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is responsible for medical care for wounded veterans.

Several of those interviewed described explicit and sustained efforts by the U.S. government to deliberately mislead the public. They said it was common at military headquarters in Kabul — and at the White House — to distort statistics to make it appear the United States was winning the war when that was not the case.

John Sopko, the head of the federal agency that conducted the interviews, acknowledged to The Post that the documents show “the American people have constantly been lied to.”

The interviews are the byproduct of a project led by Sopko’s agency, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. Known as SIGAR, the agency was created by Congress in 2008 to investigate waste and fraud in the war zone.

In 2014, at Sopko’s direction, SIGAR departed from its usual mission of performing audits and launched a side venture. Titled “Lessons Learned,” the $11 million project was meant to diagnose policy failures in Afghanistan so the United States would not repeat the mistakes the next time it invaded a country or tried to rebuild a shattered one.

The Lessons Learned staff interviewed more than 600 people with firsthand experience in the war. Most were Americans, but SIGAR analysts also traveled to London, Brussels and Berlin to interview NATO allies. In addition, they interviewed about 20 Afghan officials, discussing reconstruction and development programs.

Drawing partly on the interviews, as well as other government records and statistics, SIGAR has published seven Lessons Learned reports since 2016 that highlight problems in Afghanistan and recommend changes to stabilize the country.

But the reports, written in dense bureaucratic prose and focused on an alphabet soup of government initiatives, left out the harshest and most frank criticisms from the interviews.

“We found the stabilization strategy and the programs used to achieve it were not properly tailored to the Afghan context, and successes in stabilizing Afghan districts rarely lasted longer than the physical presence of coalition troops and civilians,” read the introduction to one report released in May 2018.

The reports also omitted the names of more than 90 percent of the people who were interviewed for the project. While a few officials agreed to speak on the record to SIGAR, the agency said it promised anonymity to everyone else it interviewed to avoid controversy over politically sensitive matters.

Under the Freedom of Information Act, The Post began seeking Lessons Learned interview records in August 2016. SIGAR refused, arguing that the documents were privileged and that the public had no right to see them.

The Post had to sue SIGAR in federal court — twice — to compel it to release the documents.

“We don’t invade poor countries to make them rich. We don’t invade authoritarian countries to make them democratic. We invade violent countries to make them peaceful and we clearly failed in Afghanistan.” — James Dobbins, former U.S. diplomat Listen

The agency eventually disclosed more than 2,000 pages of unpublished notes and transcripts from 428 of the interviews, as well as several audio recordings.

The documents identify 62 of the people who were interviewed, but SIGAR blacked out the names of 366 others. In legal briefs, the agency contended that those individuals should be seen as whistleblowers and informants who might face humiliation, harassment, retaliation or physical harm if their names became public.

By cross-referencing dates and other details from the documents, The Post independently identified 33 other people who were interviewed, including several former ambassadors, generals and White House officials.

The Post has asked a federal judge to force SIGAR to disclose the names of everyone else interviewed, arguing that the public has a right to know which officials criticized the war and asserted that the government had misled the American people. The Post also argued the officials were not whistleblowers or informants, because they were not interviewed as part of an investigation.

A decision by Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court in Washington has been pending since late September.

The Post is publishing the documents now, instead of waiting for a final ruling, to inform the public while the Trump administration is negotiating with the Taliban and considering whether to withdraw the 13,000 U.S. troops who remain in Afghanistan.

The Post attempted to contact for comment everyone whom it was able to identify as having given an interview to SIGAR. Their responses are compiled in a separate article.

Sopko, the inspector general, told The Post that he did not suppress the blistering criticisms and doubts about the war that officials raised in the Lessons Learned interviews. He said it took his office three years to release the records because he has a small staff and because other federal agencies had to review the documents to prevent government secrets from being disclosed.

“We didn’t sit on it,” he said. “We’re firm believers in openness and transparency, but we’ve got to follow the law. . . . I think of any inspector general, I’ve probably been the most forthcoming on information.”

The interview records are raw and unedited, and SIGAR’s Lessons Learned staff did not stitch them into a unified narrative. But they are packed with tough judgments from people who shaped or carried out U.S. policy in Afghanistan.

To augment the Lessons Learned interviews, The Post obtained hundreds of pages of previously classified memos about the Afghan war that were dictated by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld between 2001 and 2006.

Dubbed “snowflakes” by Rumsfeld and his staff, the memos are brief instructions or comments that the Pentagon boss dictated to his underlings, often several times a day.

Rumsfeld made a select number of his snowflakes public in 2011, posting them online in conjunction with his memoir, “Known and Unknown.” But most of his snowflake collection — an estimated 59,000 pages — remained secret.

In 2017, in response to a FOIA lawsuit filed by the National Security Archive, a nonprofit research institute based at George Washington University, the Defense Department began reviewing and releasing the remainder of Rumsfeld’s snowflakes on a rolling basis. The Archive shared them with The Post.

Together, the SIGAR interviews and the Rumsfeld memos pertaining to Afghanistan constitute a secret history of the war and an unsparing appraisal of 18 years of conflict.

Worded in Rumsfeld’s brusque style, many of the snowflakes foreshadow problems that continue to haunt the U.S. military more than a decade later.

“I may be impatient. In fact I know I’m a bit impatient,” Donald Rumsfeld | Rumsfeld memoTap to view full document Rumsfeld wrote in one memo to several generals and senior aides. “We are never going to get the U.S. military out of Afghanistan unless we take care to see that there is something going on that will provide the stability that will be necessary for us to leave.” Donald Rumsfeld | Rumsfeld memoTap to view full document

“Help!” Donald Rumsfeld | Rumsfeld memoTap to view full document he wrote.

The memo was dated April 17, 2002 — six months after the war started.

What they said in public April 17, 2002 “The history of military conflict in Afghanistan [has] been one of initial success, followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure. We’re not going to repeat that mistake.” — President George W. Bush, in a speech at the Virginia Military Institute

With their forthright descriptions of how the United States became stuck in a faraway war, as well as the government's determination to conceal them from the public, the Lessons Learned interviews broadly resemble the Pentagon Papers, the Defense Department's top-secret history of the Vietnam War.

When they were leaked in 1971, the Pentagon Papers caused a sensation by revealing the government had long misled the public about how the United States came to be embroiled in Vietnam.

Bound into 47 volumes, the 7,000-page study was based entirely on internal government documents — diplomatic cables, decision-making memos, intelligence reports. To preserve secrecy, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara issued an order prohibiting the authors from interviewing anyone.

SIGAR’s Lessons Learned project faced no such restrictions. Staffers carried out the interviews between 2014 and 2018, mostly with officials who served during the Bush and Obama years.

About 30 of the interview records are transcribed, word-for-word accounts. The rest are typed summaries of conversations: pages of notes and quotes from people with different vantage points in the conflict, from provincial outposts to the highest circles of power.

Some of the interviews are inexplicably short. The interview record with John Allen, the Marine general who commanded U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2013, consists of five paragraphs.

In contrast, records of interviews with other influential figures are much more extensive. Former U.S. ambassador Ryan Crocker sat for two interviews that yielded 95 transcribed pages.

Unlike the Pentagon Papers, none of the Lessons Learned documents were originally classified as a government secret. Once The Post pushed to make them public, however, other federal agencies intervened and classified some material after the fact.

The State Department, for instance, asserted that releasing portions of certain interviews could jeopardize negotiations with the Taliban to end the war. The Defense Department and Drug Enforcement Administration also classified some interview excerpts.

The Lessons Learned interviews contain few revelations about military operations. But running throughout are torrents of criticism that refute the official narrative of the war, from its earliest days through the start of the Trump administration.

At the outset, for instance, the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan had a clear, stated objective — to retaliate against al-Qaeda and prevent a repeat of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Yet the interviews show that as the war dragged on, the goals and mission kept changing and a lack of faith in the U.S. strategy took root inside the Pentagon, the White House and the State Department.

Fundamental disagreements went unresolved. Some U.S. officials wanted to use the war to turn Afghanistan into a democracy. Others wanted to transform Afghan culture and elevate women’s rights. Still others wanted to reshape the regional balance of power among Pakistan, India, Iran and Russia.

“With the AfPak strategy there was a present under the Christmas tree for everyone,” Lessons Learned interview | 5/18/2015Tap to view full document an unidentified U.S. official told government interviewers in 2015. “By the time you were finished you had so many priorities and aspirations it was like no strategy at all.” Lessons Learned interview | 5/18/2015Tap to view full document

The Lessons Learned interviews also reveal how U.S. military commanders struggled to articulate who they were fighting, let alone why.

Was al-Qaeda the enemy, or the Taliban? Was Pakistan a friend or an adversary? What about the Islamic State and the bewildering array of foreign jihadists, let alone the warlords on the CIA’s payroll? According to the documents, the U.S. government never settled on an answer.

As a result, in the field, U.S. troops often couldn’t tell friend from foe.

“They thought I was going to come to them with a map to show them where the good guys and bad guys live,” Lessons Learned interview | 12/15/2017Tap to view full document an unnamed former adviser to an Army Special Forces team told government interviewers in 2017. “It took several conversations for them to understand that I did not have that information in my hands.

What they said in public Dec. 1, 2009 “The days of providing a blank check are over. . . . It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.” — President Barack Obama, in a speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.

As commanders in chief, Bush, Obama and Trump all promised the public the same thing. They would avoid falling into the trap of ""nation-building"" in Afghanistan.

On that score, the presidents failed miserably. The United States has allocated more than $133 billion to build up Afghanistan — more than it spent, adjusted for inflation, to revive the whole of Western Europe with the Marshall Plan after World War II.

The Lessons Learned interviews show the grandiose nation-building project was marred from the start.

U.S. officials tried to create — from scratch — a democratic government in Kabul modeled after their own in Washington. It was a foreign concept to the Afghans, who were accustomed to tribalism, monarchism, communism and Islamic law.

“Our policy was to create a strong central government which was idiotic because Afghanistan does not have a history of a strong central government,” Former State Department official | Lessons Learned interview | 7/10/2015Tap to view full document an unidentified former State Department official told government interviewers in 2015. “The timeframe for creating a strong central government is 100 years, which we didn’t have.” Former State Department official | Lessons Learned interview | 7/10/2015Tap to view full document

Meanwhile, the United States flooded the fragile country with far more aid than it could possibly absorb.

During the peak of the fighting, from 2009 to 2012, U.S. lawmakers and military commanders believed the more they spent on schools, bridges, canals and other civil-works projects, the faster security would improve. Aid workers told government interviewers it was a colossal misjudgment, akin to pumping kerosene on a dying campfire just to keep the flame alive.

One unnamed executive with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) guessed that 90 percent of what they spent was overkill: “We lost objectivity. We were given money, told to spend it and we did, without reason.” Lessons Learned interview | 10/7/2016Tap to view full document

Many aid workers blamed Congress for what they saw as a mindless rush to spend.

One unidentified contractor told government interviewers he was expected to dole out $3 million daily for projects in a single Afghan district roughly the size of a U.S. county. He once asked a visiting congressman whether the lawmaker could responsibly spend that kind of money back home: “He said hell no. ‘Well, sir, that’s what you just obligated us to spend and I’m doing it for communities that live in mud huts with no windows.’ ” Senior USAID official | Lessons Learned interview | 8/15/2016Tap to view full document

The gusher of aid that Washington spent on Afghanistan also gave rise to historic levels of corruption.

In public, U.S. officials insisted they had no tolerance for graft. But in the Lessons Learned interviews, they admitted the U.S. government looked the other way while Afghan power brokers — allies of Washington — plundered with impunity.

Christopher Kolenda, an Army colonel who deployed to Afghanistan several times and advised three U.S. generals in charge of the war, said that the Afghan government led by President Hamid Karzai had “self-organized into a kleptocracy” Christopher Kolenda | Lessons Learned interview | 4/5/2016Tap to view full document by 2006 — and that U.S. officials failed to recognize the lethal threat it posed to their strategy.

“I like to use a cancer analogy,” Christopher Kolenda | Lessons Learned interview | 4/5/2016Tap to view full document Kolenda told government interviewers. “Petty corruption is like skin cancer; there are ways to deal with it and you’ll probably be just fine. Corruption within the ministries, higher level, is like colon cancer; it’s worse, but if you catch it in time, you’re probably ok. Kleptocracy, however, is like brain cancer; it’s fatal.” Christopher Kolenda | Lessons Learned interview | 4/5/2016Tap to view full document

By allowing corruption to fester, U.S. officials told interviewers, they helped destroy the popular legitimacy of the wobbly Afghan government they were fighting to prop up. With judges and police chiefs and bureaucrats extorting bribes, many Afghans soured on democracy and turned to the Taliban to enforce order.

“Our biggest single project, sadly and inadvertently, of course, may have been the development of mass corruption,” Ryan Crocker | Lessons Learned interview | 1/11/2016Tap to view full document Crocker, who served as the top U.S. diplomat in Kabul in 2002 and again from 2011 to 2012, told government interviewers. He added, “Once it gets to the level I saw, when I was out there, it’s somewhere between unbelievably hard and outright impossible to fix it.” Ryan Crocker | Lessons Learned interview | 1/11/2016Tap to view full document

What they said in public Sept. 4, 2013 “This army and this police force have been very, very effective in combat against the insurgents every single day. And I think that’s an important story to be told across the board.” — Then-Army Lt. Gen. Mark A. Milley, praising the Afghan security forces during a press briefing from Kabul. Milley is now a four-star general and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Year after year, U.S. generals have said in public they are making steady progress on the central plank of their strategy: to train a robust Afghan army and national police force that can defend the country without foreign help.

In the Lessons Learned interviews, however, U.S. military trainers described the Afghan security forces as incompetent, unmotivated and rife with deserters. They also accused Afghan commanders of pocketing salaries — paid by U.S. taxpayers — for tens of thousands of “ghost soldiers.”

None expressed confidence that the Afghan army and police could ever fend off, much less defeat, the Taliban on their own. More than 60,000 members of Afghan security forces have been killed, a casualty rate that U.S. commanders have called unsustainable.

Meanwhile, as U.S. hopes for the Afghan security forces failed to materialize, Afghanistan became the world’s leading source of a growing scourge: opium.

The United States has spent about $9 billion to fight the problem over the past 18 years, but Afghan farmers are cultivating more opium poppies than ever. Last year, Afghanistan was responsible for 82 percent of global opium production, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

In the Lessons Learned interviews, former officials said almost everything they did to constrain opium farming backfired.

From the beginning, Washington never really figured out how to incorporate a war on drugs into its war against al-Qaeda. By 2006, U.S. officials feared that narco-traffickers had become stronger than the Afghan government and that money from the drug trade was powering the insurgency.

No single agency or country was in charge of the Afghan drug strategy for the entirety of the war, so the State Department, the DEA, the U.S. military, NATO allies and the Afghan government butted heads constantly.

“It was a dog’s breakfast with no chance of working,” Former senior British official | Lessons Learned interview | 9/21/2016Tap to view full document an unnamed former senior British official told government interviewers.

The agencies and allies made things worse by embracing a dysfunctional muddle of programs, according to the interviews.

At first, Afghan poppy farmers were paid by the British to destroy their crops — which only encouraged them to grow more the next season. Later, the U.S. government eradicated poppy fields without compensation — which only infuriated farmers and encouraged them to side with the Taliban.

“It was sad to see so many people behave so stupidly,” U.S. official | Lessons Learned interview | 5/11/2016Tap to view full document one U.S. official told government interviewers.

What they said in public Sept. 8, 2008 “Are we losing this war? Absolutely no way. Can the enemy win it? Absolutely no way.” — Army Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Schloesser, commander of the 101st Airborne Division, in a news briefing from Afghanistan

The specter of Vietnam has hovered over Afghanistan from the start.

On Oct. 11, 2001, a few days after the United States started bombing the Taliban, a reporter asked Bush: “Can you avoid being drawn into a Vietnam-like quagmire in Afghanistan?”

“We learned some very important lessons in Vietnam,” Bush replied confidently. “People often ask me, ‘How long will this last?’ This particular battlefront will last as long as it takes to bring al-Qaeda to justice. It may happen tomorrow, it may happen a month from now, it may take a year or two. But we will prevail.”

In those early days, other U.S. leaders mocked the notion that the nightmare of Vietnam might repeat itself in Afghanistan.

“All together now — quagmire!” Rumsfeld joked at a news conference on Nov. 27, 2001.

But throughout the Afghan war, documents show that U.S. military officials have resorted to an old tactic from Vietnam — manipulating public opinion.

In news conferences and other public appearances, those in charge of the war have followed the same talking points for 18 years. No matter how the war is going — and especially when it is going badly — they emphasize how they are making progress.

For example, some snowflakes that Rumsfeld released with his memoir show he had received a string of unusually dire warnings from the war zone in 2006.

After returning from a fact-finding mission to Afghanistan, Barry McCaffrey, a retired Army general, reported the Taliban had made an impressive comeback and predicted that “we will encounter some very unpleasant surprises in the coming 24 months.”

“The Afghan national leadership are collectively terrified that we will tip-toe out of Afghanistan in the coming few years — leaving NATO holding the bag — and the whole thing will collapse again into mayhem,” McCaffrey wrote in June 2006.

Two months later, Marin Strmecki, a civilian adviser to Rumsfeld, gave the Pentagon chief a classified, 40-page report loaded with more bad news. It said “enormous popular discontent is building” against the Afghan government because of its corruption and incompetence. It also said that the Taliban was growing stronger, thanks to support from Pakistan, a U.S. ally.

Yet with Rumsfeld’s personal blessing, the Pentagon buried the bleak warnings and told the public a very different story.

In October 2006, Rumsfeld’s speechwriters delivered a paper titled “Afghanistan: Five Years Later.” Brimming with optimism, it highlighted more than 50 promising facts and figures, from the number of Afghan women trained in “improved poultry management” (more than 19,000) to the “average speed on most roads” (up 300 percent).

“Five years on, there is a multitude of good news,” it read. “While it has become fashionable in some circles to call Afghanistan a forgotten war, or to say the United States has lost its focus, the facts belie the myths.”

Rumsfeld thought it was brilliant.

“This paper,” he wrote in a memo, “is an excellent piece. How do we use it? Should it be an article? An Op-ed piece? A handout? A press briefing? All of the above? I think it ought to get it to a lot of people.”

His staffers made sure it did. They circulated a version to reporters and posted it on Pentagon websites.

Since then, U.S. generals have almost always preached that the war is progressing well, no matter the reality on the battlefield.

“We’re making some steady progress,” Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Schloesser, commander of the 101st Airborne Division, told reporters in September 2008, even as he and other U.S. commanders in Kabul were urgently requesting reinforcements to cope with a rising tide of Taliban fighters.

Two years later, as the casualty rate among U.S. and NATO troops climbed to another high, Army Lt. Gen. David Rodriguez held a news conference in Kabul.

“First, we are steadily making deliberate progress,” he said.

“And this includes the State Department, ambassadors, you know, down at the local level. Everybody did a great job. We’re all doing a great job. Really? So if we’re doing such a great job, why does it feel like we’re losing?” — Michael Flynn, a retired three-star Army general Listen

In March 2011, during congressional hearings, skeptical lawmakers pelted Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, with doubts that the U.S. strategy was working.

“The past eight months have seen important but hard-fought progress,” Petraeus responded.

One year later, during a visit to Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta stuck to the same script — even though he had just personally dodged a suicide attack.

“The campaign, as I’ve pointed out before, I think has made significant progress,” Panetta told reporters.

In July 2016, after a surge in Taliban attacks on major cities, Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan at the time, repeated the refrain.

“We are seeing some progress,” he told reporters.

What they said in public March 27, 2009 “Going forward, we will not blindly stay the course. Instead, we will set clear metrics to measure progress and hold ourselves accountable.” — Obama, in remarks from the White House

During Vietnam, U.S. military commanders relied on dubious measurements to persuade Americans that they were winning.

Most notoriously, the Pentagon highlighted “body counts,” or the number of enemy fighters killed, and inflated the figures as a measurement of success.

In Afghanistan, with occasional exceptions, the U.S. military has generally avoided publicizing body counts. But the Lessons Learned interviews contain numerous admissions that the government routinely touted statistics that officials knew were distorted, spurious or downright false.

A person identified only as a senior National Security Council official said there was constant pressure from the Obama White House and Pentagon to produce figures to show the troop surge of 2009 to 2011 was working, despite hard evidence to the contrary.

“It was impossible to create good metrics. We tried using troop numbers trained, violence levels, control of territory and none of it painted an accurate picture,” Senior National Security Council official | Lessons Learned interview | 9/16/2016Tap to view full document the senior NSC official told government interviewers in 2016. “The metrics were always manipulated for the duration of the war.”

Even when casualty counts and other figures looked bad, the senior NSC official said, the White House and Pentagon would spin them to the point of absurdity. Suicide bombings in Kabul were portrayed as a sign of the Taliban’s desperation, that the insurgents were too weak to engage in direct combat. Meanwhile, a rise in U.S. troop deaths was cited as proof that American forces were taking the fight to the enemy.

“It was their explanations,” the senior NSC official said. “For example, attacks are getting worse? ‘That’s because there are more targets for them to fire at, so more attacks are a false indicator of instability.’ Then, three months later, attacks are still getting worse? ‘It’s because the Taliban are getting desperate, so it’s actually an indicator that we’re winning.’ ”

“And this went on and on for two reasons,” the senior NSC official said, “to make everyone involved look good, and to make it look like the troops and resources were having the kind of effect where removing them would cause the country to deteriorate.”

In other field reports sent up the chain of command, military officers and diplomats took the same line. Regardless of conditions on the ground, they claimed they were making progress.

Other senior officials said they placed great importance on one statistic in particular, albeit one the U.S. government rarely likes to discuss in public.

“I do think the key benchmark is the one I’ve suggested, which is how many Afghans are getting killed,” James Dobbins, the former U.S. diplomat, told a Senate panel in 2009. “If the number’s going up, you’re losing. If the number’s going down, you’re winning. It’s as simple as that.”

Last year, 3,804 Afghan civilians were killed in the war, according to the United Nations.

That is the most in one year since the United Nations began tracking casualties a decade ago."
819,819,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/inspector-general-michael-horowitz-testimony/2019/12/11/b6632b6c-1ba1-11ea-8d58-5ac3600967a1_story.html,0,"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz said Wednesday that the FBI was justified in opening its 2016 investigation into the Trump campaign, but he told sharply divided lawmakers that he could not vindicate the bureau’s former leaders because of other major errors — effectively offering both political parties fresh ammunition in their feud over the Russia case.

In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Horowitz revealed that a prosecutor handpicked by Attorney General William P. Barr to review the same issues had failed to convince him that the FBI lacked a valid reason to initiate the probe. But just as importantly, Horowitz emphasized what he saw as myriad failures by the FBI after opening the case and said officials had not adequately explained their actions.

Since his 434-page report was released Monday, Democrats have emphasized its conclusion that political bias did not drive the investigation into a possible conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia; Barr and fellow Republicans have said the report found so many flaws that the investigation should have never happened.

After the report’s release, former FBI director James B. Comey declared it showed the investigation was “just good people trying to protect America.” Horowitz made clear, however, that no one should claim victory from his report.

“Does your report vindicate Mr. Comey?” asked Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.).

“It doesn’t vindicate anyone at the FBI who touched this, including the leadership,” Horowitz responded. “Does it vindicate Mr. McCabe?” Kennedy asked, referring to Comey’s deputy, Andrew McCabe. “Same answer,” Horowitz responded.

The inspector general found 17 errors or omissions made by the FBI as it sought and received approvals to conduct surveillance on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Those applications were filed to the secret court created by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to oversee intelligence and terrorism cases.

Republicans pressed Horowitz to explain what, other than intentional animus or political bias, would explain so many errors.

“It’s fair for someone to sit there and look at all of these 17 events and wonder how it could be purely incompetence,” Horowitz conceded.

“This has got to be fixed,” Kennedy replied. “At a minimum, someone’s got to be fired.”

The most senior FBI leaders who oversaw the probe have since left the bureau.

Horowitz offered new details about his disagreement with the attorney general and Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, who at Barr’s direction is investigating the FBI’s handling of the Russia probe.

When the report was released, Durham issued an unusual public statement saying he did not completely agree with Horowitz’s conclusion that the opening of the investigation was justified. Asked by the panel’s senior Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), if Durham offered anything to change Horowitz’s view that the FBI had a valid reason to open the probe in July 2016, Horowitz replied: “No, we stand by our finding.”

Durham and Horowitz met in November to discuss the inspector general’s findings, Horowitz said. He told lawmakers that their disagreement centered around whether the FBI should have opened a preliminary investigation, which puts some limitations on the steps agents can take, or a full investigation.

Durham’s investigation is ongoing, and Barr indicated Tuesday it could be spring or summer before it reaches a “watershed.”

In the Trump campaign case, the FBI opened a full investigation based on a tip from the Australian government. Durham “said during the meeting that the information from the friendly foreign government was in his view sufficient to support the preliminary investigation,” Horowitz said.

The distinction is a narrow one that typically has little bearing on the early stages of an investigation. Horowitz said that even if agents had opened a preliminary investigation, rather than a full investigation, they still would have been authorized to use informants as they did in the first month of the case.

The key difference between a preliminary and full investigation is that preliminary investigations don’t allow investigators to seek surveillance warrants. The bureau did not take that step in the Trump campaign case until October 2016, almost three months after the probe was opened.

Horowitz said he was “surprised” to see Durham issue a public statement disagreeing with that part of his report. Barr also disagrees with Horowitz on the issue, and in media interviews Tuesday said the FBI may have acted in “bad faith” by pursuing the case.

Horowitz’s testimony marked his first public pushback to Barr and Durham, revealing the depth of disagreements among senior law enforcement officials about Horowitz’s findings. Before the report was released publicly, The Washington Post reported that Barr disputed Horowitz’s conclusion that the FBI had sufficient grounds to open the investigation.

Horowitz operates independently from Justice Department leadership, and his office, by design, does not take directions from the department hierarchy. Spokespeople for Durham and the attorney general declined to comment on Horowitz’s statements.

Republicans castigated the FBI over its investigation into the Trump campaign, declaring that such a shoddy case should never be pursued again.

While Horowitz was testifying, Trump tweeted: “They spied on my campaign!” And at a campaign event Tuesday night in Hershey, Pa., the president used some of his strongest language yet to attack the FBI.

“The FBI also sent multiple undercover human spies to surveil and record people associated with our campaign,” he said. “They’ve destroyed the lives of people that were great people, that are still great people. Their lives have been destroyed by scum, okay, by scum.”

Asked about that accusation, Horowitz responded, “I would not call people names like that.” He also said that inspector general investigators found no evidence to support the president’s long-standing claims that the FBI wiretapped his phones.

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), the Judiciary Committee chairman and a frequent defender of the president, said politicians of both parties should be alarmed to see how the FBI launched an investigation into a political campaign, told no one inside the campaign of its concerns and kept pursuing that investigation even after gathering a significant amount of exculpatory evidence.

“We can’t write this off as being just about one man or one event. We’ve got to understand how off-the-rails the system got,” Graham said. “I think Democrats and Republicans are willing to make sure this never happens again.”

He also said the FISA court would have to undergo significant changes in order to continue operating.

Graham said he would assume, “for the sake of argument,” that the FBI had an adequate basis to open a counterintelligence investigation — though he noted the standard for doing so is low. But the other failures, he said, were more than a few modest mistakes.

“What happened here is not a few irregularities,” Graham said. “What happened here is the system failed. The people at the highest levels of our government took the law into their own hands.”

Feinstein defended the FBI as doing critical work to pursue disturbing allegations of election-year wrongdoing.

“This was not a politically motivated investigation. There is no ‘deep state,’ ” she said, referencing a pejorative term used by Trump and his allies to describe career civil servants they perceive to be biased against the president. “The FBI’s motivation was motivated by facts, not bias.”

In contrast, Graham invoked J. Edgar Hoover, a former FBI director whose name has become synonymous with abuses of law enforcement powers. He criticized the FBI for deciding to investigate, rather than warn, the Trump campaign about possible Russian involvement with the election. He read a series of anti-Trump texts from two officials involved in the case — agent Peter Strzok and lawyer Lisa Page — which the inspector general had addressed in a previous report.

Among the texts Graham pointed to was an August 2016 message in which Strzok told Page he was at a Walmart in southern Virginia and could “smell the Trump support.” The text, Graham said, showed those with key roles at the FBI did not want Trump to win.

“These are a few bad people that couldn’t believe Trump won, didn’t want him to win, and when he won, couldn’t tolerate the fact that he won,” Graham said. “And all these smelly people elected him. This is bad stuff.”

In the fall of 2016, FBI officials sought and received court approval to conduct electronic surveillance on Carter Page after he had left the campaign, suspecting he might be an agent of the Russian government. The inspector general concluded that FBI agents “failed to meet the basic obligation” to ensure the applications for surveillance on Page were “scrupulously accurate.”

Central to the FBI’s surveillance application for Page was a now-infamous dossier — a collection of shocking and occasionally lurid allegations against Trump, prepared by a former British intelligence officer hired by an opposition research firm working for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.

Barr, the attorney general, said Horowitz’s criticisms did not go far enough, telling the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that the FBI’s handling of one of the most sensitive political investigations it has ever conducted was “a travesty,” and that Durham continues to pursue the matter.

Addressing Barr’s comments about the probe being opened on the “thinnest” of suspicions, Horowitz said: “He’s free to have his opinion. We have our finding.”

Horowitz declined to say whether drafts of his report ever contained an assertion about Durham’s investigation. People who had seen drafts of Horowitz’s report said a footnote in the document explained that the inspector general asked Durham whether he had evidence to support a right-wing theory that the investigation began as a setup by U.S. intelligence using a Maltese professor to entrap the Trump campaign, and that Durham had responded he had not.

Such a footnote about Durham and the origins of the probe was not in Horowitz’s final public report, and the people familiar with earlier drafts said it apparently had been removed or redacted."

She’s doing a tremendous disservice to the country.”

Speaking to reporters who had just witnessed his teleconference from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump aired an array of grievances about the impeachment process, claiming that Democrats “had no evidence at all” about misconduct in his dealings with Ukraine and that he is “in a very good position” as he faces a trial in the Senate.

His comments come amid a standoff regarding the timing and scope of a Senate trial. Pelosi has declined to send the two articles of impeachment — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress — to the Senate yet, as Democrats demand more information about the parameters of a trial.

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has requested subpoenas for several witnesses and documents that were not part of the House impeachment inquiry because of stonewalling by the White House.

“Now they come to the Senate, and they want everything,” Trump said, repeating claims that he did not receive “due process” in the House proceedings.

Trump was invited to participate in the Judiciary Committee hearings that preceded his impeachment but refused to do so. He was impeached on a charge of obstruction of Congress after blocking several witnesses from his administration from providing documents and testimony sought by House Democrats.

At the heart of the Democrats’ abuse-of-power case is the allegation that Trump tried to leverage a White House meeting and military aid, sought by Ukraine to combat Russian military aggression, to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as a probe of an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

Trump also again took aim Tuesday at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), a key player in gathering evidence, calling him “a sick, corrupt politician.”

“Fortunately, we have a president who was able to plow through all of the stuff that went on and that goes on,” Trump said.

Trump’s comments to reporters echoed complaints made about the impeachment process in morning tweets.

“The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats have gone CRAZY,” Trump said in one of them. “They want to make it as hard as possible for me to properly run our Country!”

Democrats responded to Trump’s attacks by noting how they were out of sync with the holiday spirit.

“It’s Christmas Eve. Get. A. Life,” Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) tweeted to Trump in response to the president’s claim that Pelosi “knows nothing” about the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that was recently passed by the House.

Around the same time Tuesday, Trump’s campaign launched a website aimed at helping Trump supporters win arguments with their relatives during the holidays. The site, snowflakevictory.com, includes videos of Trump campaign officials coaching Trump supporters on how to argue with “liberal snowflakes” about several issues, including impeachment.

“Impeaching President Trump has always been an election tactic,” campaign adviser Mercedes Schlapp said in one of the videos. “Democrats have never accepted the results of the last election, so they’re trying to interfere with the next one.”

During his remarks, Trump also responded to reports that North Korea’s Kim Jong Un could deliver a “Christmas surprise” to the United States with some kind of missile test.

“Everybody’s got surprises for me. . . . I handle them as they come along,” Trump said. “Maybe it’s a nice present. Maybe it’s a present where he sends me a beautiful vase as opposed to a missile test, right? I may get a vase. I may get a nice present from him.”

During his phone call with representatives from the military, Trump repeatedly stated that he had rebuilt the armed forces and asked service members on the other end of the line to confirm that they had seen a marked improvement in equipment and resources since his election.

“You feel a lot different than you did three years ago, Frank?” Trump asked Cmdr. Frank Azzarello aboard the destroyer USS Forrest Sherman in the Gulf of Aden.

“Yes, sir,” Azzarello replied.

Asked whether he would offer a pardon for his longtime confidant Roger Stone, Trump said he hadn’t considered it — before asserting that the felon was “a nice guy” who had been mistreated by prosecutors.

“You know, Roger Stone was not involved in my campaign in any way,” Trump said. “Other than the very, very beginning. Before I think I — long before I announced. A little bit.”

In fact, Stone was in direct contact with high-ranking officials in Trump’s campaign throughout much of 2016, including during a period in which he claimed to have insider information about Democratic computer files hacked by Russia and made public by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks. Trump deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates testified during Stone’s trial that he overheard a phone call in which Trump seemed to discuss WikiLeaks with Stone.

Stone was convicted last month of tampering with a witness and lying to Congress about his efforts to learn of hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He faces up to 50 years in prison on seven felony counts.

While distancing himself from Stone, Trump used his conviction to make the case that the Justice Department had been biased against the president and his associates.

“We had dirty cops; we had people spying on my campaign,” Trump said, echoing debunked claims about politically biased wiretapping during the 2016 election. “They did terrible things, the likes of which had never been done before in our country.”"

http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/24/obama-confident-about-immigration-reform-in-a-second-term/?hpt=po_c2",0,"President Obama, criticized as failing to offer a vision for a potential second term, has begun sketching out his agenda with greater specificity in recent days, including a pledge to solve the nation's in­trac­table budget problems within ""the first six months."" In an interview made public Wednesday, Obama said he would pursue a ""grand bargain"" with Republicans to tame the national debt and would quickly follow that with a push to overhaul the nation's immigration laws.

With less than two weeks until Election Day, Obama chose to highlight two issues that have bedeviled him during his presidency: the debt, which has soared past $16 trillion on his watch, and immigration legislation, which never got off the launching pad over the past three years. Both are politically significant, with the debt a concern among independent voters and immigration important to the Hispanics who could decide whether Obama carries swing states such as Colorado and Nevada.

The interview, conducted Tuesday with the editor and publisher of the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in Iowa, also marked an unusual moment in the president’s dealings with the press.

Obama had initially insisted that the exchange, which he conducted by phone from a stop in Florida, be off the record. Then on Wednesday, his campaign abruptly decided to release a transcript after the newspaper’s editor, Rick Green, wrote a blog post calling the interview terms a “disservice” to voters. Obama is seeking the influential paper’s endorsement.

View Graphic A Washington Post - ABC News poll looks at who likely voters say they would vote for if the election were held today. Also, how those opinions vary among voter groups, and who voters trust more for different aspects of the job.

The transcript gave a surprising glimpse of Obama as political pundit, gaming out timetables and calculations for his dealings with Capitol Hill Republicans. He predicted, for instance, that an expectedly poor showing by Republican challenger Mitt Romney among Hispanics would put pressure on GOP lawmakers to ease their opposition to an immigration overhaul that offers a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.

“Since this is off the record, I will just be very blunt,” Obama said at one point. “Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community.”

With polls in battleground states showing the race tightening to a virtual dead heat, Obama appears to be shifting away from a strategy dominated by attacks on his opponent to one that includes a rationale for skeptical voters to send him back to the White House for another four years.

The Obama campaign is distributing glossy brochures that repackage his proposals to hire more teachers, promote manufacturing and raise taxes on the wealthy as “The New Economic Patriotism: A Plan for Jobs & Middle-Class Security.”

Aides said the push to define the president’s second term also includes direct mail and a new, 60-second TV ad featuring Obama looking into the camera and laying out his views on manufacturing, energy and other issues. “Read my plan,” he says.

At the top of the priority list: a promise to forge a bipartisan compromise that reduces rampant government borrowing and makes long-postponed decisions about taxes and spending. In the interview, Obama called a budget deal “one of the best things we can do for the economy.”

“We’re going to be in a position where I believe in the first six months we are going to solve that big piece of business,” Obama said. “It will probably be messy. It won’t be pleasant. But I am absolutely confident that we can get what is the equivalent of the grand bargain that essentially I’ve been offering to the Republicans for a very long time, which is $2.50 worth of cuts for every dollar in [taxes], and work to reduce the costs of our health-care programs.”

Obama offered no details of how he would approach negotiations with congressional Republicans. But with Washington facing a January deadline to undo more than $500 billion in automatic tax hikes and spending cuts next year, Obama said, “There’s going to be a forcing mechanism to deal with what is the central ideological argument in Washington right now, and that is: How much government do we have, and how do we pay for it?”

Republicans reacted with a yawn to the news that Obama is ready to re-engage on a grand bargain if he wins the election. They noted that his proposal for a cuts-to-taxes ratio of $2.50 to $1, embodied in his most recent budget request, was roundly rejected in both the House and Senate.

“President Obama broke virtually every promise that candidate Obama made in 2008 — including his pledges to turn around our economy, fix our dysfunctional immigration system, cut the deficit and change politics as usual in Washington,” Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams said. “Given his history of broken promises, nobody is taking the president’s phony election year commitments seriously — especially those that he thought were being made in secret to a newspaper editorial board.”

Some Democrats and independent budget analysts were cheered by the new urgency Obama appears ready to place on the debt issue.

""I think the message is the president wants to get right to work putting together a plan to boost economic growth and reduce the long-term deficit in a predictable and credible way,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee.

But some Democrats were far less enthusiastic. Obama’s pledge to push again for a grand bargain creates an uncomfortable dynamic for the campaign’s final days, with liberal groups mobilizing to help turn out his voters while simultaneously planning a full-fledged national campaign after Election Day to oppose the kind of budget deal the president has long sought.

The AFL-CIO plans to keep its elaborate network of full-time organizers and union activists in place around the country to pressure lawmakers in both parties — as well as the White House — to steer clear of any cuts to Medicare and Social Security, according to people familiar with the plans.

The same day Obama made his comments to the Iowa newspaper, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, a top supporter, published an op-ed in Politico blasting the notion of a grand bargain as “lower tax rates for rich people — paid for by benefit cuts for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. These are precisely the issues that are being debated so vigorously in the campaign, and voters do not want anything to do with such a deal.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he had expressed concerns privately to the White House that Obama appeared to be steering clear of firm promises to protect entitlement programs."

Thanks and praise for his skilled actions are due Jack Wilson. But what must not be forgotten or forgiven is that two innocent people were shot to death in a house of prayer by a man who — despite a troubled and violent past — had access to a gun because of this country’s lax gun laws.

“Keith is a violent, paranoid person with a long line of assault and batteries with and without firearms. He is a religious fanatic, says he’s battling a demon . . . He is not nice to anyone.” That is how one of his ex-wives described the gunman in 2012 as she sought a protective order against him. Keith Thomas Kinnunen, 43, who killed church deacon Anton Wallace, 64, and church security volunteer Richard White, 67, at the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Tex., had an extensive rap sheet in numerous places across the United States. Included in his troubled history was the 2012 determination by an Oklahoma judge that he was mentally incompetent to stand trial on charges he attacked the owner of a doughnut shop; he was committed to a psychiatric facility. In 2016, he was arrested after being spotted acting suspiciously near an oil refinery in New Jersey while armed with a shotgun; he ended up pleading guilty to criminal trespass.

None of that prevented him from getting a firearm. Exactly how is unclear, but Texas has one of the nation’s least restrictive gun laws with no requirements for background checks when the seller is not a licensed dealer. That irrational permissiveness needs to be addressed, but gun advocates — cheered on by President Trump — instead seized on the terrible events to promote their agenda that the answer to gun violence is more guns. So much for not politicizing tragedy. And never mind the rates of suicides and homicides in Texas, or that the state has been home to some of the country’s deadliest mass shootings.

The hero in Sunday’s shooting was not, as gun advocates would want us to believe, an ordinary churchgoer — the proverbial “good guy with a gun” — but rather a firearms instructor and gun range owner who has been a reserve deputy with a local sheriff’s department. It’s not hard to imagine an even greater tragedy if there had been someone less skilled than Mr. Wilson or if the shooter had been armed with a weapon that didn’t require it to be reloaded. Indeed, the next madman intent on killing as many people as possible, rather than being deterred by Sunday’s events, might conclude that he needs a more lethal weapon. Those who see more armed guards as the only answer are driving down a road of ever-intensifying escalation.

Instead of turning churches and schools into armed camps, we should do a better job of keeping guns away from people who shouldn’t have them. Gun control that includes strong background checks makes sense, as a majority of Americans understand."

In Congress, despite record levels of disapproval with the institution, voters seem likely to opt for the status quo — Democrats in charge of the Senate and Republicans in the House.

Democrats are expected to gain seats in the House but not the 25 needed to recapture the majority lost in the Republican sweep of 2010. In the Senate, Democrats hold a 53-47 majority, including two independents who caucus with them. Although 10 or more races were considered too close to call through much of the fall, Democrats are now in a position to maintain their majority, although perhaps barely.

This election assessment, along with reports on all the states, is based on interviews by a team of Washington Post reporters with strategists in the two parties and both presidential campaigns, as well as state and local officials and independent analysts. The assessment includes an analysis of polls on individual states and races that have poured forth over the final weeks before the election.

In the presidential campaign, the biggest and most consequential unknowns at this point are the size and shape of the voting population. An electorate that resembles or even slightly exceeds 2008 in terms of the share of minority voters vs. white voters would clearly benefit Obama. A slight decline in the minority share of the electorate and a more even split between Democrats and Republicans — closer to the 2004 electorate than 2008 — would greatly help Romney. Obama, however, may do better among white voters in some of the battleground states than he will do nationally.

The latest Washington Post-ABC News national poll shows a dead heat this weekend, with Obama and Romney both at 48 percent among likely voters. The survey has barely fluctuated.

Obama spent part of this past week in his official capacity as commander in chief as Hurricane Sandy devastated the Atlantic Coast, pummeling New Jersey and New York the hardest. His attention to the cleanup earned praise from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Romney supporter who delivered the keynote address at the Republican National Convention.

Almost half of all Americans said Obama’s hurricane response would be a factor in their vote, according to the latest Post-ABC tracking poll. An earlier survey found that 79 percent rated his handling of the situation excellent or good. Another wild card is whether the latest jobs report will have a demonstrable effect on an electorate deeply polarized and with few undecided voters left. The report, released Friday, showed that 171,000 jobs were added while the unemployment rate ticked up to 7.9 percent.

Presidential

Through much of the fall campaign, nine states have defined the presidential battleground: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin.

Obama began the general-election race with a base of 18 states plus the District, totaling 237 electoral votes. Romney began with a base of 23 states, totaling 191 electoral votes. North Carolina is tipping toward Romney and Nevada toward Obama, putting the president at 243 and Romney at 206.

Romney is making a late play in Pennsylvania and Minnesota and will campaign in the Keystone State on Sunday. Both states continue to lean toward the president, but Obama’s campaign has decided to send former president Bill Clinton to Pennsylvania on Sunday for extra measure.

Assuming those states continue to stay in Obama’s column, the president would need only 27 of the remaining 89 electoral votes to win. Romney would need 64 of the 89, which explains why Obama still has an easier — but by no means certain — path to an Electoral College majority. For example, he could win a second term simply by winning Florida, which remains competitive.

If the Sunshine State goes for Romney, then much will depend on Ohio, which is why it is the focus of so much campaign activity in the final days. Its 18 electoral votes represent the bulwark of Obama’s Midwestern line of defense against Romney.

If the president were to carry Ohio — and he continues to hold a narrow lead in public polls there — he could win an electoral majority by adding Virginia (13 electoral votes) or Wisconsin (10) or Colorado (nine), or by winning Iowa (six) and New Hampshire (four).

If Romney does not win Ohio, his path to victory would have to include Colorado, Florida, Virginia, Wisconsin and either Iowa or New Hampshire. But if he does capture the Buckeye State, he could become president by taking Florida and Virginia and then just one other contested state.

Poll

The Post-ABC tracking survey underscored the closeness of the race nationally. During two weeks of polling, the largest lead by either candidate was 50 percent to 47 percent, favoring Romney. Obama's biggest was one point. Neither was statistically significant.

Obama’s job approval rating continues to hold at 50 percent, with 34 percent saying they strongly approve and 39 percent saying they strongly disapprove. Romney holds a statistically insignificant three-point edge on who is trusted more to handle the economy. Obama has a six-point advantage on who better understands Americans’ economic problems.

Through most of the campaign and as recently as October, more voters offered unfavorable than favorable impressions of Romney. Today a majority of likely voters has a favorable view. In fact, he and Obama are virtually tied on this measure: 54 percent say they have a favorable impression of the president, while 53 percent say the same of Romney.

For the first time in the Post-ABC poll, independent voters are evenly split between the two candidates, at 46 percent each. Until now, Romney has held an advantage ranging from three to 20 points. Obama leads among women by six points, Romney among men by seven points.

Obama is winning 38 percent of white voters and 78 percent of non-whites. He gets 33 percent of whites without college degrees and 44 percent of whites with college degrees.

Campaign

Obama’s hopes for a second term rest on his ability to reassemble and motivate a coalition of African Americans, Hispanics, young voters and women, despite disappointment and diminished enthusiasm since his historic 2008 victory.

In Ohio, he is aided by the success of the auto-industry bailout and the campaign’s attacks on Romney’s business background, which have bolstered the president’s support among white working-class voters. Beyond that, Romney has been hammered in Ohio for an ad suggesting that Chrysler’s new owners plan to shift production of Jeeps to China, which the chief executive denied.

Romney has a motivated base, with Republicans eager to defeat a president they think is taking the country in the wrong direction. But he needs both a turnout that is large enough to make the GOP share of the electorate almost equal to that of the Democrats. He also needs an edge among independent voters.

For the past week, Obama’s advisers have expressed confidence that the race is theirs to lose and that they will not lose it. “The economic debate has crystallized,” campaign manager Jim Messina said Saturday. “We have picked up steam and now what we have to do is turn out our vote. We continue to lead or are tied in every battleground state and have the ability to get to 270 electoral votes in a variety of ways.”

Romney advisers have said their polls show that the battlegrounds, particularly Ohio, are closer than public surveys suggest. They also say that an incumbent who is not above 50 percent in the polls in the final days is in a precarious position.

“When you take a look at the big three — Florida, Virginia and Ohio — we feel very good,” said Romney senior adviser Russ Schriefer. “Ohio is tight but it’s tied and I think we’ve got some advantages there. I think then you look at the rest of the map that, in a million years, the Obama campaign never thought they would be campaigning in these states the weekend before the election.”

He added: “We’re going to win this thing.”

Senate

Democrats appear poised to hold on to their narrow Senate majority on Tuesday, a prospect that as recently as a year ago seemed far more difficult, given the disparity in the number of seats Democrats (23) and Republicans (10) had to defend.

The turning point for Democrats may have been the surprise decision by Republican Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (Maine) not to seek another term. Snowe was considered a shoo-in for reelection but in her absence, former governor Angus King, an independent who would caucus with Democrats, has emerged as a favorite.

Then Republicans made a series of self-inflicted mistakes, two centering on the subject of rape. Indiana Treasurer Richard Mourdock, who ousted longtime Sen. Richard G. Lugar in the GOP primary, gave Democratic Rep. Joe Donnelly an opening. Then Mourdock’s comments at a late October debate — where he said a woman who becomes pregnant by rape is carrying a “gift from God” and therefore must have the child — turned the race from a tossup to one that favors Donnelly.

In Missouri, Rep. Todd Akin won the GOP nomination and days later made a comment about “legitimate rape” rarely causing pregnancy that created a national firestorm. Much of the party establishment abandoned Akin, but he refused to drop out of the race. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) is favored to win reelection.

Democrats have growing confidence that former Obama administration official Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard law professor, will beat Sen. Scott Brown (R) in Massachusetts. The contest is the premier Senate race in the country for the seat long held by the late Edward M. Kennedy (D).

Republicans have a number of opportunities to pick up seats held by retiring Democrats. Races in Nebraska and North Dakota, where Democrats are retiring, seem likely to fall for Republicans. Virginia has a very tight race between two former governors: Democrat Timothy M. Kaine and Republican George Allen. In Montana, Sen. Jon Tester (D) and Rep. Denny Rehberg (R) have been tied for months.

Even if several of those races tip to Republicans in the final hours, it still seems unlikely that the GOP will add the four seats it would need to control the Senate if Obama is reelected or the three it would would need if Romney wins. The most likely outcome is no net change, or Republican gains of one or two seats.

House

In the battle for control of the House, it has become clear over the past few months that the wave of elections that roiled the chamber in 2006, 2008 and 2010 will not be repeated Tuesday. Democrats need 25 seats to regain the majority. Not even their most optimistic strategists think that is anything more than a remote possibility.

Because of the decennial redistricting process, both parties will score heavy gains in certain states. Republicans look poised to pick up at least three and maybe four seats in North Carolina. Democrats could take five seats from Republicans in Illinois.

After taking control of more governorships and state legislatures in 2010, Republicans had the political muscle to carve up new congressional districts to their advantage. They shored up some of their most vulnerable incumbents and drew difficult districts for Democrats.

The result: Republicans are now likely to gain at least 10 Democratic seats simply because of the partisanship of redrawn districts, and Democrats are fighting from behind in their effort to win back the House. That is why overall Democratic gains may be held to the mid-single digits."

Booker, who recently announced he had surpassed his fourth-quarter fundraising goal, said his operation would not have the money “to scale up and continue building a campaign that can win,” particularly with a Senate impeachment trial looming and because he would be absent from Tuesday’s debate.

“So I’ve chosen to suspend my campaign now, take care of my wonderful staff, and give you time to consider the other strong choices in the field,” Booker wrote in a message to supporters Monday morning.

On the campaign trail, Booker preached the power of empathy, saying he would beat Trump with love. In his parting message, Booker doubled down on that message.

“I believed to my core that the answer to the common pain Americans are feeling right now, the answer to Donald Trump’s hatred and division, is to reignite our spirit of common purpose to take on our biggest challenges and build a more just and fair country for everyone,” Booker wrote.

“I’ve always believed that. I still believe that. I’m proud I never compromised my faith in these principles during this campaign to score political points or tear down others. And maybe I’m stubborn, but I’ll never abandon my faith in what we can accomplish when we join together.”

Booker plans to run for reelection to the Senate, his campaign said.

“I will carry this fight forward — I just won’t be doing it as a candidate for president this year,” Booker wrote.

Booker is the latest candidate of color to leave a Democratic field that had started out as historically diverse, exiting about two weeks after former HUD secretary and San Antonio mayor Julián Castro said he was suspending his campaign.

Booker, 50, has been seen as a potential presidential candidate for most of his career. In 2002, a documentary crew followed his upstart run for mayor of Newark. Booker won that office in a landslide four years later and was urged by Democrats to run for higher office, which he did by winning a special Senate election in 2013.

In the Senate, Booker has a liberal voting record and took the lead on criminal justice reform legislation, like the First Step Act that passed at the end of 2018. As a senator who lives in a struggling city — a fact he would frequently point out on the presidential campaign trail — Booker was an advocate for policies that would reduce incarceration rates and help poor families build wealth.

He was also friendly with the financial industry, at a time when Democratic voters were turning against it. In 2012, Booker criticized the Obama campaign’s attacks on Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s business career, calling it “nauseating.” In 2017, he opposed an amendment to a budget bill that would have supported reimporting cheaper pharmaceuticals from Canada, a move that drew protests in his state, even though the amendment was largely for show.

As a presidential candidate, Booker was often stuck, unable to convince left-wing voters that he was on their side while turning down donations and initially rejecting super PAC support that could have helped him.

He suffered from bad luck, too. After Booker criticized former vice president Joe Biden for having touted his work with segregationists, the DNC’s randomized rules put the two candidates on different nights of the June debates. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who appeared alongside Biden, criticized those comments and briefly surged in the polls, as Booker stayed mired.

Democrats who watched the candidates were often surprised by Booker’s lack of traction. He scooped up endorsements in early-voting states and got some of the loudest responses at early multicandidate events. Polls taken after debates consistently found voters rating Booker highly, and his favorable ratings rose in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Yet Booker, who had spent years building ties with black leaders, struggled badly with black voters. A hoped-for breakout in South Carolina never came, and in November, former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick entered the race, with Booker’s weakness seeming to create an opening for a black candidate with executive experience.

Sagging in polls, Booker was cut from the December debate in Los Angeles, and joined other Democrats in criticizing polling thresholds that several nonwhite candidates couldn’t meet. His campaign raised $6.6 million over the final months of the year, far less than the candidates who had made the stage.

“We started with one of the most diverse fields in our history, giving people pride, and it's a damn shame now that the only African American woman in this race, who has been speaking to issues that need to be brought up, is now no longer in it,” Booker told MSNBC last month. “We're spiraling towards a debate stage that potentially [c]ould have six people with no diversity whatsoever.”"

http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/04/politics/election-closing-blitz/index.html?hpt=po_t1",0,"And now it is closing time. On Monday, in the final hours of their 17-month, nearly $3 billion marathon, the two candidates and their running mates are scheduled to hold 14 events across eight states. For Republican challenger Mitt Romney, this last full day of campaigning is aimed at achieving what he has seemingly been unable to do over the first 522 days: overcome President Obama's razor-thin but steady leads in the states where the election will be decided.

On Sunday, it appeared that Romney’s task was getting a little harder.

A pair of national polls seemed to show that it was Obama who had a bit of momentum in the race's last weekend. A Washington Post-ABC News poll showed the president at 49 percent to Romney's 48 percent. The tracking poll has had both candidates locked within a narrow band for weeks, although Romney held a brief three-point edge in late October.

Another poll, released Sunday by the Pew Research Center, found Obama with a three-point lead nationwide among likely voters, 48 percent to 45 percent. A week ago, the same poll had the two candidates tied.

The Pew poll found that Hur­ricane Sandy may have given Obama a boost: Sixty-nine percent of likely voters approved of the president's handling of the storm.

Meanwhile, a poll late Sunday by CNN showed the race deadlocked at 49 percent.

Beyond the polls, data on early voting seemed to show Democrats with an edge in several key states, although not as wide as the advantages Obama held four years ago.

Nonetheless, Romney and his aides said they were confident of victory. The Republican made a striking gesture of that confidence by visiting Pennsylvania, a state long assumed to be in Obama's column and one that has not voted for a GOP presidential candidate in more than two decades. A top aide, Ed Gillespie, said Romney has ""expanded"" the map of this election and expects to compete in the Keystone State.

Taking the stage to the “Rocky” theme before a crowd of about 30,000 in Morrisville, Romney declared that “this audience and your voices are being heard all across the nation. . . . We’re taking back the White House, because we’re going to win Pennsylvania!”

The night was so cold that, after Romney was an hour late because of air-traffic delays, people became too chilly and demanded to be let out. Authorities lifted the security fences, and scores filed out while the candidate spoke.

On Sunday, the two campaigns held 14 events in eight states, including six in the battleground of all battlegrounds, Ohio. At one point, the two sides got close enough to see each other: As Air Force Two prepared to take off from the Cleveland airport on Sunday afternoon, Vice President Biden spotted Romney’s campaign plane across the tarmac.

For both candidates, it was a day of big crowds — and final goodbyes.

In the morning, Obama visited New Hampshire for the seventh time during the general-election season after campaigning here extensively four years ago. This, presumably, was his last visit as a candidate. He spoke to a crowd of 14,000 in Concord, the state capital, with former president Bill Clinton.

“I know you guys — you saw a lot of me” in 2008, Obama told the audience. “And back then, we talked about change we can believe in. But I said to people, you know: ‘I’m not just talking about changing parties or changing presidents. I’m talking about changing how our politics works.’ ”

Later Sunday, the president made his last stops in Florida and in Colorado. He also visited Ohio — but he will be back. On Monday, Obama will return for a rally in Cincinnati and will also travel to Wisconsin and Iowa, touching on the Midwestern trio that could provide his path to victory. At day’s end, he will return to his home town, Chicago, for Election Day.

Romney on Sunday made his last stop in Iowa after at least 14 trips there during the general-election campaign and many, many more before that, leading up to the 2008 and 2012 caucuses.

“Talk is cheap, but a record is real, and it’s earned with real effort,” Romney told a boisterous crowd of 4,000 at the Hy-Vee Hall in downtown Des Moines. He reprised a common stump-speech appeal, asking his supporters to reach out to friends and neighbors who may still be undecided. “You can’t measure change in speeches. You measure change in achievements,” he said.

Romney also visited Ohio on Sunday, speaking to 6,000 in Cleveland. At one point, he started to make an argument by saying, “If the president were to be reelected . . . ”

He was interrupted by boos.

“It’s possible,” he told the crowd in response, “but not likely.”

On Monday, Romney will go to Ohio one last time — making at least his 44th trip there during the general-election campaign. His itinerary also includes two stops in Virginia, one in Florida and a last, late-night rally in Manchester, N.H. Romney will then return to his home outside Boston for Election Day.

This weekend, new polls seemed to show that Romney had made little progress on the central mission of his campaign: to wrest these battleground states away from Obama.

In Iowa, a Des Moines Register poll gave Obama the edge, 47 percent to 42 percent. In Ohio, a Columbus Dispatch survey put the president two points ahead. If Obama wins those two states, he will need just one more swing state — even tiny New Hampshire — to win another term.

For Romney, some of the weekend’s best news came from New Hampshire, where a WMUR Granite State Poll released Saturday found the candidates tied. The same poll showed Obama with a nine-point lead in October.

For many voters, of course, the election is over. In the Post-ABC poll, 27 percent of all likely voters said they had cast their ballots already. In some battleground states, the numbers are even higher: In Nevada, the votes already cast are equal to 72 percent of the total vote in 2008. In Colorado, the figure is 68 percent.

For now, it’s impossible to know whom these early voters chose. But some states have released breakdowns by party.

In Iowa, Democrats hold an 11-point advantage in early voting, although that’s down from 18 points in 2008. In Florida, Democrats won by nine points four years ago but lead by only three points this year. And in Colorado, where Democrats had a two-point advantage in 2008, they currently trail by two.

Ohio doesn’t have traditional party registration. But outside polling has consistently shown Obama winning early voters there by double digits. About a quarter of likely voters in the state have already cast ballots.

There, Sunday was the day for “Souls to the Polls,” an effort by the Obama campaign to take churchgoers directly to vote after Sunday services. Nearly 230 churches across the state joined in, providing food, gospel music and vans to drive people to the polls.

At Faith Ministries Church in Columbus, Pastor Dexter Wise asked how many people had voted already. About a third of his 500 members raised their hands.

“The way stuff is happening here, they’ll have some law by tomorrow that says none of us can vote Tuesday,” Wise joked as he urged his congregation to join him in a vehicle caravan after services that would take them to a nearby shopping center.

Among those who said yes was Sharon Saunders, 55, who works a late shift at a nearby Bath and Body Works plant. Wise’s offer of a ride to the polls made her decision to vote much easier.

“It was a blessing — I didn’t have a ride otherwise,” Saunders said. “It worked, and it would have been hard for me because I have to work.”

Marveling at the large crowd, Dana Walch, deputy director of the Franklin County Board of Elections, said the popularity of early voting there has exceeded the levels of 2008. Between Oct. 2, when early voting began, and Saturday, at least 60,000 county residents had cast ballots. Every day, more people have cast early ballots in person than the total number of early ballots cast four years ago, Walch said.

In this area, where voters are largely black and largely Democratic, the early birds were overwhelmingly for Obama. A reporter’s attempt to find a Romney voter over the course of 30 minutes came up empty. A single delivery truck plastered in Romney signs drove around the parking lot and was jeered every time it passed."

Washington CNN —

President Barack Obama rode a wave of broad support from moderates, women and minorities to win re-election Tuesday by defeating Republican challenger Mitt Romney in Democratic strongholds and key battleground states.

According to CNN projections, Obama surpassed the decisive 270-vote threshold in the Electoral College with victory in Ohio. That and a later projected victory in another swing state – Virginia – gave him 303 electoral votes to 206 for Romney, according to the CNN call based on unofficial returns.

Joyful supporters danced and cheered at Obama’s victory party in Chicago, and the president thanked them for ensuring the nation will continue to move forward while warning the battle for change they seek will continue to be difficult.

“Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come,” Obama said to prolonged cheers.

He emphasized his main campaign theme of fighting for equal opportunity for all, saying the political arguments that come with democracy in America were a necessary part of the process.

“We will disagree, sometimes fiercely,” Obama said, noting that “progress will come in fits and starts” and the victory Tuesday night “won’t end all the gridlock.”

Foreshadowing hard decisions ahead, the president said blind optimism and wishful idealism “can’t substitute for the need to make difficult compromises to move forward.”

When he finished, the first family and Vice President Joe Biden and his family joined him onstage in a celebration of waves, hugs amid a blizzard of confetti.

In Boston, Romney supporters hugged and wept in a somber vigil while waiting for their candidate to concede.

Opinion: Five things Obama must do

In a brief speech he delivered alone, Romney congratulated and said his prayers would be with the president at such a challenging time for the country.

“At a time like this we can’t risk partisan bickering and political posturing,” Romney said, later adding that he wished he had “fulfilled your wishes to lead this great country in a different direction.”

Romney’s wife, Ann, and most of his family, as well as running mate Rep. Paul Ryan and his family then came on the stage for a few minutes in what was a subdued farewell.

Late push by Romney falls short

Obama withstood a late push by Romney in Pennsylvania and won battleground states of Ohio, Virginia, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada and Colorado, according to CNN projections.

One other battleground, Florida, remained too close to call early on Wednesday.

He also easily won traditional Democratic strongholds of California, New York and other populous states such as Michigan, the state where Romney was born and his father served as governor.

Exit polls showed Obama received strong support, as expected, from women voters as well as overwhelming support from African Americans and strong backing from Hispanic voters, similar to the coalition that carried him to victory four years earlier to make him the nation’s first African American president.

Meanwhile, CNN projected that Democrats will retain their majority in the Senate, ensuring another divided Congress after Republicans earlier were projected to hold their majority in the U.S. House.

Share your response to the election outcome

The result showed Republicans need to recalibrate their approach to broaden their appeal to a nation of changing demographics, analysts said.

Exit polls indicated that white voters made up 72% of the electorate, with African Americans, Latinos and other minorities comprising a growing share.

“It’s not about geography anymore with the Republican Party,” said Margaret Hoover, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor. “It’s about demographics, and we’ve got to start thinking about growing the party.”

David Gergen, CNN’s senior political analyst, said the Grand Old Party must move its foundation back toward the political center from the increasingly right-wing positions pushed by tea party conservatives.

“It seems to me that the lesson has to be clear to Republicans that they have to adjust,” Gergen said. “They’ve gotten too far out.”

Race was dead even in final polls

Obama and Romney ran dead even in final polls that hinted at a result rivaling some of the closest presidential elections in history, reflecting the deep political chasm in the country.

A heavy turnout was reported in much of the nation, and both campaigns expressed confidence that they would prevail in what was expected to be a long night awaiting results from the eight states still up for grabs that will determine the victor.

Opinion: Obama’s victory won’t transform America

As predicted, the election was decided in the battleground states, and as the returns emerged, it became clear that Romney was failing to win them.

Overall, Obama led by more than one million votes in the popular tally.

The president won his home state of Illinois as well as Romney’ s home state of Massachusetts – where the Republican previously served as governor. He also won Romney’s birth state of Michigan, along with Colorado, Nevada, California, Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Maine, Rhode Island, Hawaii and the District of Columbia, according to the CNN projections.

Romney won North Carolina, Idaho, Montana, Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wyoming, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, Indiana, West Virginia, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Utah, Missouri and Georgia, CNN projects.

According to early exit polls, 60% of voters said the economy was the most important issue, 59% thought abortion should be legal and 50% wanted Obama’s health care reform law repealed while 43% wanted it to remain in place or be expanded.

The breakdown of voters, according to the early exit polls, was 73% white, 13% African American, 10% Latino and 3% Asian. Pre-election polls showed Romney holding an advantage among white men while Obama had the edge with white women, and Obama receiving overwhelming support among minorities.

With the victory, Obama will face the challenge of leading a country facing chronic federal deficits and debt as well as sluggish economic growth in the wake of a devastating recession and financial industry collapse that confronted Obama when he took office in January 2009.

Around the country, voters formed long lines at polling places after record numbers participated in early balloting, indicating a strong turnout.

Sporadic reports of irregularities included malfunctioning voting machines and other problems, including electoral hardships for some struggling to recover from the devastation of Superstorm Sandy in states in the country’s northeast.

A judge in Philadelphia, a heavily Democratic city, ordered election officials to cover a mural of Obama at one school used as a polling location after Republicans complained the painting violated election laws.

Elsewhere in the city, GOP poll monitors were being escorted into precincts by sheriff’s deputies after some observers had been denied access earlier in the day, said Tasha Jamerson, a spokeswoman for the district attorney’s office.

In New Jersey, which permitted electronic balloting in the aftermath of last week’s storm, the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union headed to court on Tuesday on behalf of voters who said their requests for an electronic ballot weren’t being acknowledged.

Candidates usually take Election Day off, but both sides continued to make public appearances even as voting was under way.

Obama visited a local Democratic election center in the Chicago area, while Vice President Joe Biden made “an unannounced but long-scheduled” stop in the key battleground state of Ohio.

Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, also arrived separately in Ohio, with Romney’s campaign plane and Air Force Two, which carries the vice president, crossing paths at Cleveland’s airport.

Earlier Tuesday, Romney cast his ballot outside of Boston on Tuesday, while Obama previously became the first sitting president to vote early when he did so in Chicago last month.

New pressure for deficit deal

With the election over, the White House and Congress will face fresh pressure to legislate a comprehensive deficit reduction deal that has been stymied so far by intransigence on the issue of tax reform, with Republicans refusing to consider any kind of tax increase while Obama and Democrats insist on at least the wealthy paying a higher income tax rate.

Despite the building drama toward Election Day in the campaign expected to cost $2.6 billion, much of the outcome already was known.

Popular, electoral vote split? It’s happened before

Only a handful of states were considered up for grabs and both candidates and their campaigns concluded an exhausting final sprint through them over the weekend and on Monday.

The barnstorming amounted to a montage of Americana electioneering, with Obama and Romney shouting themselves hoarse before boisterous crowds, joined by top surrogates and star power such as Bruce Springsteen singing for Obama and Kid Rock for Romney.

In their final speeches, the candidates and their running mates blended inspirational visions for a better future with well-honed attacks in hopes of ensuring their committed supporters actually cast ballots while trying to coax votes from anyone still undecided.

Obama briefly waxed nostalgic at his first event on Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, referring to Springsteen when he said: “I get to fly around with him on the last day that I will ever campaign, so that’s not a bad way to end things.”

He cited accomplishments of his first term, including ending the war in Iraq, winding down the war in Afghanistan, passing health insurance and Wall Street reforms, and ending the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy that banned openly gay and lesbian personnel from the military.

Emotion overtook the president at the end of the day.

His eyes welled with tears as he thanked the people “who’ve given so much to this campaign over the years,” during a stop in Des Moines, Iowa – a place where his first campaign gained an early foothold in his first run for the White House.

Republicans pick up key seat in governors’ races

For his part, Romney called Obama’s record one of underachievement and failure, telling a cheering Virginia crowd at his second stop of the day that “almost every measure he took hurt the economy, hurt fellow Americans.”

At an earlier event in Florida, Romney asked if people wanted four more years like the last four, raising the specter of continuing gridlock in Washington and adding that “unless we change course, we may be looking at another recession.”

He had promised to repeal the health care and Wall Street reforms of the Obama presidency and to “limit government rather than limiting the dreams” of Americans.

As the challenger, Romney sought to frame the election as a referendum on Obama’s presidency and to capitalize on his own background as multimillionaire businessman by depicting himself as better able to handle economic issues identified by voters as their biggest concern. His campaign stump speech hammered Obama over high unemployment and what he called excessive taxes and regulations that Romney said stifled faster growth.

Obama and his team attacked Romney’s politics and his background as a venture capitalist, saying he would back policies favoring the wealthy over the middle class and exacerbate the already widening income and opportunity disparity in the country. The president wanted the race to come down to competing visions for the future and his oft-repeated goal of restoring the promise of the American dream of equal opportunity for all.

In particular, Obama repeatedly noted he backed a taxpayer bailout that helped restore General Motors and Chrysler while Romney opposed it. The issue resonated in auto industry states like Michigan and Ohio, which was considered the most significant of the battlegrounds in the final days of the race.

Opinion: Obama will get little time to celebrate

Campaign chess match

Aside from the policy differences, the election amounted to a campaign chess match targeting specific states and demographic groups as part of plan to create a path to electoral success. Polling portrayed a race that hinged on the social and democratic divides in American society, with Obama supported most strongly by women, minorities and young respondents, while Romney did better among wealthy and middle class white men, from senior citizens down to 30-year-olds.

In response, Obama emphasized the anti-choice positions of Romney and conservatives on abortion, their stance against gay rights and their opposition to providing a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants.

Re-election offered Obama, 51, the chance to secure a two-term legacy and seek further reforms he promised in his historic campaign of 2008 but was unable to deliver in the first four years. In particular, he has made comprehensive immigration reform a top target, as well as a deficit reduction plan that ends tax breaks for income over $250,000.

However, the wave of optimism that carried to him to victory four years ago seemed muted during the campaign this time, with former supporters angered by the failure to achieve the kind of change in Washington they believed Obama had promised but failed to deliver.

For Romney, a multimillionaire businessman who sought to become the nation’s first Mormon president, the election concluded a six-year quest for the White House.

Romney also failed in his first bid for the Republican nomination in 2008, then spent the next two years preparing for a second run that began in 2011 with a grueling primary campaign featuring a record 20 debates. Romney, 65, shifted to the right for the primary race to overcome a broad field.

Romney declared himself “severely” conservative and adopted stances against abortion, gay marriage and a path to legal residency for undocumented immigrants while also opposing higher tax rates as part of a deficit reduction plan.

His support remained steady – though well below a majority – throughout the primary campaign while opponents dropped out one by one until Romney emerged as the winner and claimed the nomination at the GOP convention in late August.

However, his campaign endured a tough September, due in part to some unforced errors. A secretly recorded video from a May fundraiser became public, showing Romney referring to 47% of the country as dependent on government handouts and therefore unreachable to him as a candidate.

When U.S. diplomatic compounds came under attack on September 11, including an assault that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya, Romney quickly issued a statement that was criticized for mistaken information and seeking to politicize a sensitive national security issue.

Then, in the first presidential debate on October 3, Romney began an energetic shift back to the political center and scored a clear victory over Obama by presenting himself as more moderate than the right-wing zealot portrayed by the president.

Obama’s lackluster showing in the first debate contributed to an overwhelming consensus among analysts and poll results that Romney carried the night, and he began rising in the polls to erase what had been a consistent Obama lead since the conventions a month earlier.

Stronger performances by Obama in the second and third debates began to slow Romney’s momentum, though the Romney team claimed a surge put states like Michigan and Pennsylvania back in play. They were previously thought safe for the president.

With polls tightening in the final weeks, Romney or his surrogates heightened their attacks on key issues, including a campaign ad that implied the auto bailout led to shifting the production of iconic Chrysler Jeeps to China. The automaker joined the Obama campaign in complaining that the ad was misleading, and the president said it was intended to scare workers for political gain.

21 moments that defined the campaign and America

Superstorm Sandy

However, the biggest impact on the end of the campaign was Superstorm Sandy, which blasted the East Coast from Maryland to Connecticut just over a week before Election Day. Obama and Romney canceled campaign events, and the president shifted to full emergency response mode as the storm and its devastation dominated the national focus for much of the final full week of campaigning.

On the ground, record numbers of voters cast early ballots as both sides boasted of ramped-up organizations to identify and contact supporters.

Overall, the total cost of the election for president and Congress could top a record-breaking $6 billion, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The figure covers spending from January 2011 through whatever totals emerge after Tuesday’s election.

Outside groups accounted for the biggest boost in spending, with independent organizations dropping more than $970 million. The increase was largely related to the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that paved the way for super PACs to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money as long as they did not coordinate with the campaigns.

Most Senate Republicans are eager to stage a trial that ends with Trump’s acquittal and vindication on charges that he abused the power of his office in his dealings with Ukraine and obstructed a subsequent investigation in the House. But over the weekend, Trump urged the Senate simply to dismiss the charges against him — without hearing arguments from House prosecutors or his own legal team.

On Monday, senior Republicans said immediate dismissal could not win approval in the chamber, where Republicans hold a 53-seat majority. And even some staunch Trump allies argued that the president’s legacy would benefit from a robust trial.

Congressional Democrats have floated at least six different rationales over the past three weeks for not submitting the impeachment articles to the Senate. (Video: The Washington Post)

“I don’t think there’s any interest on our side of dismissing,” said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), the fourth-ranking GOP senator. “Certainly, there aren’t 51 votes for a motion to dismiss.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said that he wants the trial — only the third impeachment of a president in U.S. history — to follow the format used 21 years ago in the trial of President Bill Clinton. In that case, the Senate approved a resolution that would have allowed the Senate to vote to dismiss the charges.

But senior Republicans signaled Monday that they are not inclined to include such a provision in the resolution that will kick off Trump’s trial, perhaps as soon as Thursday.

“I think the only reason it would be in there is if there’s just some argument for consistency,” Blunt said.

Another GOP senator, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss legislation that is not yet public, also said the inclusion of a provision to dismiss is unlikely.

Republicans were maneuvering behind the scenes about the vexing issue of witnesses as former national security adviser John Bolton said last week that he would be willing to testify if he receives a Senate subpoena.

Still, Trump, in a post Sunday that he also retweeted on Monday, made clear that he was still pressing for the Senate to dismiss the charges.

“Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, ‘no pressure’ Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have. I agree!” he wrote.

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said during a Fox News interview that while Trump is seeking a dismissal “because he did nothing wrong,” if he faces a Senate trial, “he does want it to be fair, which is all he deserves.”

Meanwhile, a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss strategy, said the White House wants the dismissal option “available to the president” and not necessarily tucked into the organizing resolution. The official also noted that a motion to dismiss could come later in the trial, once the senators have had ample time to digest opening arguments and ask questions.

Any senator can move to dismiss the charges, as long as it is done in writing.

Trump has been eager to use the Senate trial on the campaign trail as evidence that he has done nothing wrong and that his impeachment by the House was a political “witch hunt” by Democrats.

The House voted Dec. 18 to impeach Trump, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has held the two articles of impeachment as she sought concessions from McConnell on witnesses. He refused to budge and Pelosi relented last week, signaling that the House would vote this week to approve a slate of impeachment managers who will deliver the articles to the Senate and prosecute the case against Trump.

Senate Republicans, most of whom are prepared not to convict Trump on the two charges, believe a vote to acquit will provide a more emphatic statement to rebut the abuse-of-power and obstruction-of-Congress charges he faces over his demands that Ukraine launch investigations that would benefit him politically.

For that reason, McConnell has long preferred a vote to acquit Trump, rather than a vote to dismiss that has a higher likelihood of failure on the Senate floor — a view echoed Monday by his closest allies and rank-and-file senators.

Several closely watched Republican senators said Monday that they would reject immediate dismissal of the charges against Trump, including Sens. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Mitt Romney (Utah) and Susan Collins (Maine).

“My understanding is most Republicans wanted to have a full trial and then have a vote on acquittal or a conviction, which is at a 67-vote threshold,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.).

Chatter about dismissing the charges began to ramp up last week after Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a measure to alter Senate rules to allow for dismissing articles of impeachment, but only if the House had failed to transmit them to the Senate within 25 calendar days.

McConnell announced last week that he had the votes to proceed with Trump’s impeachment trial without support from Democrats and within the parameters that he sought: hours of opening statements for the House managers and Trump’s defense team, as well as a period for questioning from senators. No Republicans signaled dissent from that strategy last week.

As Senate GOP leaders work to finalize the resolution that would establish Trump’s trial, they also began contending with a growing chorus of Republican senators who could be influential swing votes on procedural matters on the question of witnesses.

One of them, Collins, said last week that she has spoken with a small circle of Republican senators to ensure that the process for Trump hews as closely to the structure that Clinton was granted during his trial.

On Monday, Collins explained that her negotiations are not about “specific witnesses” getting called but are merely an attempt to make sure that no senator could short-circuit the trial without first letting all 100 senators vote on whether to call additional witnesses.

Other like-minded senators on Monday echoed Collins’s view.

“I am working to make sure that we will have a process so that we can take a vote on whether or not we need additional information,” which could include witnesses, said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).

Romney said Monday that he plans to vote against early motions by Democrats for witnesses before opening arguments but that later in the trial, “I presume I’ll be voting in favor of hearing from John Bolton perhaps among others. That could change depending on what happens in the ensuing days and during those arguments, but I’m not going to be voting for witnesses prior to the opening arguments.”

Senior Republicans stressed Monday that such a vote would probably occur, with Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) telling reporters: “I don’t think there’s any question that there’ll probably be that vote at some point in the process.”

“I think we should hear the case. We have a constitutional duty to do that,” Alexander said. “That means to me, number one, hear the arguments. Number two, to ask our questions. Number three, to be guaranteed the right to vote on whether we need additional evidence following hearing the case. Evidence could be witnesses, it could be documents.”"

Washington CNN —

A day after an election that both parties agreed was a mandate to find compromise and avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, Democratic and Republican congressional leaders also continued to sharply disagree over the key issue of whether top tax rates should be raised to help resolve the looming crisis.

Republicans said higher rates would damage the economy, while Democrats said it was the only equitable way to tackle the debt.

Congress faces an end-of-the-year deadline before massive spending cuts kick in and tax breaks begin to expire, including the Bush-era tax cuts at the end of December. The fiscal cliff also includes so-called sequestration – automatic across-the-board spending cuts set to trigger at the beginning of 2013 if Capitol Hill fails to create a deficit-reduction plan.

Next for Obama: Fiscal Cliff

In a formal speech on Capitol Hill Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner sounded conciliatory even as he made it clear higher tax rates would be unacceptable to Republicans who control the House.

“For the purposes of forging a bipartisan agreement that begins to solve the problem, we’re willing to accept new revenue, under the right conditions,” Boehner said.

The speaker then insisted the revenue come from “a growing economy, energized by a simpler, cleaner, fair tax code, with fewer loopholes and lower rates for all,” and not from higher rates on higher earners.

As part of a broader compromise, Boehner said that tax reform must be coupled with “concrete steps to put our country’s entitlement programs on a sounder financial footing.”

Obama win boosts chances for tax hike on rich

A Senate Democratic leadership aide complained Boehner’s approach on revenue – which might not require the wealthy to pay more – was “insufficient” and would not raise enough money to have a significant impact on the deficit.

Earlier Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that he and Boehner had a “pleasant conversation” by phone and that he didn’t expect either man to “draw any lines in the sand” ahead of negotiations.

But Reid insisted several times that raising taxes on wealthier Americans has to be part of any compromise to resolve the crisis and, emboldened by election gains in the House and Senate, Reid said Republicans “can’t push us around” on the issue.

“There was a message sent to us by the American people, based on the campaign,” Reid said at a news conference. “People making all this money have to contribute a little bit more.”

In his speech, Boehner said he hopes an agreement can be reached “that sends a signal to our economy, and to the world, that after years of punting on the major fiscal challenges we face, 2013 is going to be different.”

Fiscal cliff: Boehner’s opening gambit

But he also said he didn’t think a deal could be struck in the next month and a half during a lame duck session of Congress. Instead, he wants to reach an agreement with Democrats on a framework or bridge that would postpone the cuts and tax-rate changes for one year until a broader deal on deficit reduction – including entitlement and tax reform – can be worked out.

That’s at odds with Reid who said he opposes “kicking the can down the road” anymore.

“Waiting for a month, six weeks, six months, that’s not going to solve the problem,” Reid said. “We know what needs to be done. So, I think that we should just roll up our sleeves and get it done.”

Boehner and top House GOP leaders held a conference call with all House Republicans shortly before the speaker made his speech. According to two participants on the call the speaker gave a full readout of what he planned to say publicly, and while he reinforced his pledge not to agree to tax increases, he did urge rank and file members to give him some room to negotiate with the White House.

A senior GOP aide said that the ideas that Boehner outlined in his speech Wednesday were similar to the revenue proposal that Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Pat Toomey and other Republicans on the “supercommittee” offered last summer.

World worries as U.S. fiscal cliff looms

“This is the framework that everyone has been talking about,” the aide said, and admitted, referring to the two parties’ differences on the details on the revenue side. “We haven’t been able to thread the needle yet.”

Boehner’s spokesman said there are no meetings scheduled yet between the speaker and the president, and reiterated that any deal needs to be hashed out between the principals, not in a public back-and-forth series of photo ops.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell reinforced Boehner’s opposition to higher tax rates and he argued it’s up to President Obama to “propose a way for both parties to work together in avoiding the fiscal cliff without harming a weak and fragile economy.”

“Now is the time for the President to propose solutions that actually have a chance of passing the Republican-controlled House and a closely-divided Senate,” McConnell said in a statement.

To that point, a top Senate GOP aide argued that many of the Democrats who won Senate seats Tuesday in swing states like North Dakota, Montana, Virginia and West Virginia, didn’t campaign on raising top rates. The aide said there are several moderate Democrats from GOP-leaning states up for re-election in two years who will chafe against raising taxes.

President Obama weighed in as well by placing separate calls to Reid, Boehner, McConnell, and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. The White House said he told them tax increases for wealthy Americans need to be part of a deal avoid the fiscal cliff and reduce the debt.

Speaking to the seriousness given to his speech, Boehner employed a teleprompter to help him deliver it smoothly. Such devices, popular with presidents, are rarely used on Capitol Hill.

The speaker did not take any questions when it ended.

http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/07/opinion/stanley-romney-history/index.html?hpt=op_t1",0,"In early spring, President Obama’s veteran campaign staff in Chicago confronted the question that would ultimately determine the presidency: how to run against Mitt Romney? The choice discussed on frequent calls between the White House and One Prudential Plaza was whether to campaign against Romney as a flip-flopper — a former centrist governor of Massachusetts who turned conservative to win his party's nomination — or use his career as the head of Bain Capital to cast him as a protector of the privileged at the expense of the middle class.

“The most striking data we saw early on was on the ‘understands problems of people like me’ question,” said a senior White House official involved in the discussions. “Into the summer, Romney was in the teens in this category.”

The choice was made. The onetime campaign of hope and change soon began a sustained advertising assault that cast Romney as a heartless executive, a man who willingly fires people and is disconnected from how average Americans live their lives — an approach reinforced by Romney’s mistakes along the way.

While the Obama campaign bet it could set the campaign’s course in the summer of 2012, Romney’s senior staffers in Boston put their money on winning a decisive autumn, when it believed voters would tune in to the race in earnest and their jobs-first message would convince the nation it was time for a change.

But, as the attacks mounted, so did concern within the Romney camp.

“Ann would come to me and say, ‘Eric, what are we going to do about this? It needs to be addressed,’ ” said Eric Fehrnstrom, Romney’s senior adviser, referring to the candidate’s wife. Romney’s family longed to tell the story of the “real Mitt,” but advisers told them that the time for that would come later, during the convention and debates.

Another Romney adviser said: “The group think today is if we were to go back and change one thing, we’d spend more money and more strongly defend Mitt and push back on the ‘rich guy,’ the tax rate issue, the Bain Capital issue. We knew it was coming and we should’ve done more positive ads to get his favorables up.”

This account of how Obama won is based on more than two dozen interviews with campaign officials on both sides, advocacy groups and super PACs, and current and former White House officials. Obama advisers requested anonymity to speak candidly about the race in advance of Election Day. Several Romney advisers did the same.

Obama's decision to focus on Romney helped set an angry tone for the multibillion-dollar campaign, the first presidential race since the Citizens United decision changed the financial calculus of U.S. elections. But among the most critical elements of his success was the quiet work his staff accomplished last year, not this one, in reviving and expanding a vast field organization that lay dormant for much of Obama's presidency. The turnout Tuesday of African Americans, Latinos, women, and young voters in swing states was a testament to its success.

Obama, weighed down by a poor economy, also needed help — and he often got it from Romney. The Republican’s brash condemnation of Americans who do not pay federal income taxes, his quick criticism of the administration for a spike in Middle East violence, and even his selection of a running mate that brought unexpected tension into the campaign all worked against his mid-fall effort to surmount Obama’s lead.

Amid an angry populism in the country, Obama’s effort to portray Romney as a part of the economic problem resonated in the upper Midwest, where the race in many ways was cemented. In Ohio, Obama’s early decision to bail out the auto industry, and Romney’s opposition to the plan, helped frame the contest in the incumbent’s favor before it even began.

“He looked the part,” a senior Obama campaign official said, “the Brylcreemed executive who comes into a town and asks why we’re making Electrolux vacuums here when we can do it cheaper in China.”

In the final stretch, Obama almost squandered his hard-won lead with a bewildering performance in his first debate with Romney. But, for a candidate whose political career has been touched at times by luck, Hurricane Sandy arrived with a week left in the race and disrupted Romney's effort.

The campaign bore almost no resemblance to the expansive one Obama waged in 2008 — by strategic choice and by financial necessity. Without the clear financial advantage it had last time, Obama’s campaign relied more on the tools of micro-marketing than on the oratorical gifts of the nation’s first black president.

Gone were the soaring speeches that clarified Obama’s candidacy four years ago. Instead the president focused on Romney. Meanwhile, his campaign spoke early and often with “persuadable” voters, selected for targeted e-mails and doorstep visits through demographic data unavailable last time.

“We turned a national election into a school-board race,” a second senior Obama campaign official said.

A 2011 move

Before the effort to define Romney began, before they even knew for certain Romney would be the opponent, the Obama campaign laid the groundwork for victory in a race that would be won in the margins of a polarized electorate.

In January 2011, nearly two years before Obama would face voters, top strategist David Axelrod, campaign manager Jim Messina and other advisers moved from the White House to Chicago to be insulated from what one campaign official described derisively as “Washington’s chattering classes.”

It was not an easy time in Washington. Republicans had just swept the midterm elections and retaken the House. The national unemployment rate was nearly two points higher than when Obama took office.

But what really worried the Chicago brain trust was money — the hundreds of millions they expected the Romney campaign and outside groups to spend on defeating the president.

The Karl Rove-led American Crossroads and affiliated Crossroads GPS, alone, said it would raise $300 million — a goal the group met, an official there said last week. Two-thirds of the funds were spent on the presidential race.

In 2011, something unexpected happened: nothing. The predicted onslaught was largely absent, giving the campaign in Chicago the time and resources to set up the organization a full year before the general election. Without having to respond to negative advertising, the campaign spent its time and money on preparation.

“One of the great mysteries was why they waited so long,” a third senior Obama campaign official said. “We were like the Brits during World War II, staring at the sky waiting for the bombs to fall. They never came.”

The Obama campaign, on the other hand, spent $126 million in 2011 — more than three times Romney’s total that year. The campaign opened field offices, began an extensive outreach effort in swing states and enriched a voter database with information unavailable in the last election.

Some of that expensive new data included viewer habits, collected by cable companies, that provided clues to voter traits and preferences. In a race where middle-class female voters were courted by both camps, the Obama campaign advertised heavily on the CBS's sitcom ""2 Broke Girls,"" according to a Yahoo analysis of Federal Elections Commission data. The campaign bought detailed voter updates, issued every two weeks.

The tools allowed campaign officials to determine — on a house by house basis, rather than on a Zip-code-by-Zip-code basis – how people were likely to vote and whether they were likely to vote at all.

Voters were given “support” scores and “turnout” scores to tell the campaign’s field offices who to go after and how. Field workers were outfitted with mobile applications to give an instant report on every doorstep chat.

“The president defied political gravity for a long time, and a lot of the reason was because of this,” the second Obama campaign official said. “And none of this would have existed if we had spent 2011 bailing out the boat.”

By midsummer, though, Obama had problems as president that overshadowed, at least publicly, the progress being made in Chicago. The prolonged fight over the debt ceiling, during which Obama became the face of a dysfunctional political system, had left him at his weakest point in office.

Crossroads GPS spent $16 million on negative ads during that period, and although that was largely it for the year, the ads did damage. Obama scraped bottom in August 2011 when a Gallup poll showed his job approval rating at 38 percent.

“We had entered Jimmy Carter territory,” the second senior White House official said.

Discouraged, Obama left for his summer break on Martha’s Vineyard. It was a time to figure out the future.

“The president was at the center of the thought process after the debt ceiling,” the second senior adviser said. “He knew where we were, and he was very frustrated with where we were.”

During the next months, Obama injected a new populism into his message, culminating with a speech in Osawatomie, Kan., where Theodore Roosevelt had called for a ""new nationalism"" a century earlier.

“This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class and all those who are fighting to get into the middle class,” Obama said. “At stake is whether this will be a country where working people can earn enough to raise a family, build a modest savings, own a home and secure their retirement.”

It was the essential message, delivered variously as an attack against Romney and as a pledge to voters, of his campaign to come.

Romney: Battered and broke

When Romney launched his campaign in June 2011, he offered himself as the lone Republican who could nurse the ailing economy back to health.

He was back for a second try at the White House, and this time his advisers believed their man, a turnaround specialist during years in the private sector, had met his moment.

What was unclear then was the toll the Republican primaries would take over the next 10 months.

When Rick Santorum finally suspended his campaign in April of this year and Romney emerged as the presumptive nominee, he was battered and broke. He had spent most of the roughly $100 million he had raised and would not be able to tap into his general election funds until after the August convention.

His political image was in tatters, too. He had turned to the right to secure the nomination, complicating his general election run. He suggested “self-deportation” to remove immigrants in the country illegally, and on Tuesday, Latinos turned out overwhelmingly in favor of the president. And Romney defined his term as governor of Massachusetts as “severely conservative.”

“We wanted the primary to end earlier than it did,” said Beth Myers, a senior adviser and Romney confidante. “We recognized we were at a tactical disadvantage for this period. Everything we did had to really matter.”

By then, the Obama campaign strategy to go after Romney’s business career had been set in Chicago.

But the Romney campaign thought it was prepared. Throughout 2011, Romney aides researched each of the roughly 100 deals that Bain Capital made during the candidate’s tenure as chief executive so they could prepare for criticism. When it came in the GOP primaries, Romney easily turned it away, accusing his opponents of attacking success itself.

That instilled a false sense of confidence. When Obama began going after Romney’s time at Bain, advisers in Boston convinced themselves it already had been litigated.

“The Bain attacks were arrows that just bounced off Mitt Romney,” Fehrnstrom said. “They didn’t do lasting damage.”

The Obama campaign thought otherwise.

Deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter argued for a series of Bain-related ads in the late spring. A Massachusetts native, Cutter had studied Romney's unsuccessful 1994 bid to unseat then-senator Edward M. Kennedy (D) and the role Bain had played in it. There was a playbook, and Cutter, as much as anyone, knew it.

In May, the ads began.

“Bain Capital walked away with a lot of money that they made off this plant,” a former employee at GST Steel, a company bought by Bain and eventually closed down, said to the camera. “We view Mitt Romney as a job destroyer.”

The Obama campaign dispatched former Bain employees to Romney primary events. It looked like the work of state party committees, but the organizing force behind it was the campaign in Chicago.

It also looked, at first, like a mistake.

Democrats such as former president Bill Clinton, Newark Mayor Cory Booker, former representative Harold E. Ford Jr. (D-Tenn.), and Steven Rattner, who oversaw the president’s bailout of the auto industry, all condemned the ads as unfair to capitalism.

Still others referred to it as Obama’s attempt to “swift-boat” Romney, the tactic of using a perceived strength against a candidate. The term recalled the 2004 presidential race, when Sen. John F. Kerry’s sterling Vietnam War service record was turned into a liability.

“I think the criticism actually helped push the issue onto local news more than it would have,” a fourth senior Obama campaign official said.

At Romney headquarters, senior officials noticed alarming movement in their internal polls.

“It was the cumulative weight of everything they were doing that moved numbers, changed impressions and made it more difficult for us to climb out of the political hole they put us in,” said Neil Newhouse, Romney’s pollster. “We knew it was hurting. But it was a matter of how long can we survive and how can we raise money to push back.”

Complicating the campaign’s response was Romney’s discomfort discussing his personal wealth. With an estimated net worth of between $190 million and $250 million, Romney is one of the richest Americans ever to win a major party’s presidential nomination, and he has never been at ease talking about it.

Romney refused to disclose more than two years' worth of tax returns and finally did so only under pressure, leading Democrats to suggest that he was hiding something.

That image was reinforced by Romney’s planned expansion of his La Jolla, Calif., beach house, which included a car elevator, his wife Ann’s passion for the elite equestrian sport of dressage and the couple’s summer getaways to their lakeside compound in New Hampshire.

The Romney campaign fought back, complaining about articles they believed contained factual inaccuracies. But advisers chose not to air a number of positive testimonials from business leaders that they lined up on Romney’s behalf. The campaign lacked money, and did not want to distract from the candidate’s core case against Obama’s economic record.

The Republican super PACs, sitting on millions of dollars, also decided not to defend Romney at a time when the campaign could not afford to defend itself.

This became a source of deep frustration for some campaign strategists in Boston, who were legally barred from coordinating with the outside groups. One senior campaign adviser lamented, “We didn’t have any of our allies providing us any kind of cover.”

The Republican problem may also have been the message — or the lack of a single one.

During one week over the summer, the three big GOP super PACs had a different anti-Obama ad up featuring a distinct aspect of his record, including the government’s role in the failed solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra, the lack of jobs, and the rising federal debt. The Romney campaign was hitting Obama for allegedly diluting welfare reform.

All touched on the Republicans’ central theme — that Obama had failed in his management of the economy — but the impression left on voters may not have been as indelible as the Democratic effort.

""There were no ads for him on his positive vision,"" said Bill Burton, co-founder of Priorities USA, the pro-Obama super PAC. ""We were out there by ourselves defining what people knew about him based on his experience in private equity.""

Selection of Paul Ryan

Even before Romney secured the nomination, his advisers began discussing potential running mates, and the habitually cautious candidate made clear that he did not want to repeat the error of 2008, when John McCain made a dramatic pick in Sarah Palin but failed to run a thorough vetting.

The selection of Rep. Paul Ryan, a conservative favorite from Wisconsin, would pose other challenges later. But when Ryan, 42, stepped off the USS Wisconsin as Romney's running mate on Aug. 11, it surprised and delighted the Republican base.

Within the Obama campaign, advisers believed the Ryan pick was a mistake. Ryan was not well-known enough in his home state to help Romney win it, and his conservative positions on fiscal and social issue were likely to bother some independents.

“They were coming up to a convention that was essentially a hostile gathering for Romney,” the third senior Obama campaign official said. “He thought Ryan would help with that.”

Even inside Romney’s campaign, some advisers worried Ryan would be identified too closely with his proposal to turn Medicare into a voucher program, an idea that could alienate seniors critical in Florida.

Those concerns translated into disagreements between Ryan and the leadership in Boston. One week after his selection, Ryan, on his own, gave a speech about Medicare to residents of the Villages, a city-size retirement community in central Florida.

“We want this debate. We need this debate. We will win this debate,” he declared.

To the relief of Romney’s advisers, the debate never materialized. But they did not allow Ryan to set the agenda again.

As part of his role, Ryan had wanted to talk about poverty, traveling to inner cities and giving speeches that laid out the Republican vision for individual empowerment. But Romney advisers refused his request to do so, until mid-October, when he gave a speech on civil society in Cleveland.

As one adviser put it, “The issues that we really test well on and win on are not the war on poverty.”

Ryan did not complain publicly. But he later had reason to.

Benghazi backfires

After a troubled summer trip to Britain, Poland, and Israel, Romney placed foreign policy to the side.

The overseas excursion, described by a member of Romney’s national finance committee as “a mistake from beginning to end,” had been followed by an awkward convention. The Romney campaign searched for something to turn its fortunes around.

On Sept. 11, amid developing reports about an attack on U.S. diplomatic missions in Egypt and Libya, Romney aides found a political opportunity.

Hours earlier, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo had issued a statement responding to outrage in Egypt over an anti-Muslim film made in California. Romney’s advisers viewed the statement as misplaced sympathy for the attackers.

Within hours, on the advice of his messaging shop and with the blessing of his foreign policy advisers, Romney approved a statement that accused Obama of sympathizing with anti-American interests in the Muslim world. It was sent out shortly after 10 p.m.

By sunrise the next day, it was clear to Romney that they had acted too quickly. The campaign learned that four Americans had been killed in an attack on a U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. Even to some Republicans, Romney's hasty statement looked insensitive.

“We screwed up, guys,” Romney told aides on a conference call that morning, according to multiple people on the call. “This is not good.”

His advisers told him that, if he took back his statement, the neoconservative wing of the party would ""take his head off."" He stood by it during an appearance in Florida. Two days later, Obama traveled to Joint Base Andrews to meet the four flag-draped coffins.

From then on, including during the final debate on foreign policy, Romney was reluctant to engage Obama on the Libya attack, a useful way to discredit his otherwise strong record on national security issues.

“The governor felt snake bit by the reaction to our public pronouncement,” said one senior adviser. “I think it made him shy about aggressively prosecuting the Benghazi case against the Obama administration.”

As Romney remained largely silent on the subject, Republicans and some prominent Democrats called on Obama to make clear how the attacks were carried out and by whom.

A New York Times-CBS News poll published a week before the election showed that a majority of likely voters disapproved of Obama's handling of the Benghazi attack.

The 47 percent

The Obama campaign moved quietly through Romney’s bumpy summer, and then, for a candidate who has enjoyed moments of good fortune through his political career, another one came.

On Sept. 17, less than a week after the Benghazi attack, Mother Jones magazine began publishing secretly recorded footage of Romney speaking derisively about ""the 47 percent"" of Americans who pay no income taxes at a spring fundraiser.

“I’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives,” he told the guests, who paid $50,000-a-plate to attend.

The video played perfectly into the image, showcased in Obama’s Bain ads, of Romney as a candidate whose chief concern was protecting the wealthy.

“It reinforced a negative perception of the governor that was being peddled by our opponents, so yeah, of course we were concerned about it,” Fehrnstrom said.

Those close to Ryan, whose idea of talking about rising poverty was rejected by the campaign, were also frustrated.

“If we had been speaking out about these issues before this happened, it would’ve inoculated us a little bit,” an adviser said.

Within a few hours of the video's release, Romney conceded during a news conference in Costa Mesa, Calif., that his remarks were ""not elegantly stated."" The campaign hit a low point.

“Among some of the senior members of the campaign, you found people slip into talking about the campaign in the past tense,” one Romney adviser recalled.

In Chicago, Cutter, the deputy Obama campaign manager, and Ben LaBolt, the communications director, walked into Axelrod’s office within minutes of the video posting on the magazine’s Web site to decide what to do.

By the end of the day, the campaign had issued a statement denouncing Romney for “writing off half the nation.” Then, for a few days, it stood back and watched.

As a fifth senior campaign official said, “We didn’t know what to make of it at first, only that we had to play it right.”

Within 36 hours, Priorities USA aired an ad about the taped comments. And the Obama campaign followed with its own, using Romney's words behind a series of black-and-white photos of working Americans, veterans and seniors.

At a campaign rally in Woodbridge four days after the tape’s release, Obama told a raucous stadium crowd that “we’ve always said that change takes more than one term or even one president, and it certainly takes more than one party.”

“It can’t happen if you write off half the nation before you even took office,” he said.

First debate and aftermath

In the week that followed, Obama widened his lead in the polls. The race appeared over as October approached, the incumbent cruising to a win.

But inside the Obama campaign the new polling showed something that senior advisers worried would not last. The post-47 percent surveys reflected a migration of Republican-leaning independents toward Obama.

Whether they would be there on Election Day was uncertain, and that question occupied Obama advisers as the president left for a resort outside Las Vegas to prepare for the first debate.

For weeks, Obama had resisted the intensive practice that his advisers wanted him to take on. He was the president now, and even those closest to him had a harder time ordering him to do something he didn’t want to do.

And he didn't want to prepare for the debate, one of those political duties, like donor phone calls, that Obama disdained. Once in Nevada, Obama managed to escape ""debate camp"" for a visit to the Hoover Dam and another to a campaign field office.

“It’s a drag,” Obama told the staff. “They are making me do my homework.”

Trailing in the polls, Romney knew the debate was perhaps his last opportunity to reverse the trajectory of the race. During flights between campaign stops or in his hotel room before bed, he studied.

The preparation paid off. In the hours after Romney’s successful debate, his advisers began seeing encouraging data. His “47 percent” remarks had nearly disappeared from the concerns that voters expressed to the campaign’s pollsters.

“It got washed out big time,” said Newhouse, Romney’s pollster.

Romney had pushed around Obama, who appeared alternately sleepy, distracted and peevish. And the conservative Republican from the primaries had made a swift turn to the center on a number of issues important to independent voters.

No one thought what happened in Denver was possible, at least not so late in a race that had been underway, by some measure, for five years.

Calls from nervous donors flowed into the Obama campaign, and within days, a series of polls suggested the race was again too close to call a month before Election Day. To Obama's advisers, the gains from Romney's stumbling September vanished in a night.

“The rubber band that had stretched toward us the previous month suddenly snapped back to where it was,” said the second senior Obama campaign official.

Obama was angry with himself and began studying the tape in preparation for the second debate that was more than a week away.

Vice President Biden called him the day after the Denver debate, and the president said he regretted letting him down. For a campaign that had good fortune on its side for months, suddenly nothing seemed to work in its favor.

The polls showed Romney gaining steadily, despite a good September jobs report released days after the debate that showed that the unemployment had fallen to the lowest point since the month that Obama took office.

As nervous Democrats wondered whether Obama had given the election away, Biden was asked to steady the base in his debate against Ryan.

Unlike Obama, Biden had been preparing, off and on, for months. Advisers had put together one hundred questions that Biden should expect to get, and during even the smallest windows of free time on Air Force Two, they would quiz the vice president: “So why is the economy better off than it was four years ago?”

“I’m nervous,” Obama told him during a call on the day of the debate, according to advisers. “Is this how you felt when you were getting ready to watch me?”

Hours later, Biden turned in an aggressive defense of the administration's record. Before he had even left the stage at Centre College in Danville, Ky., he was handed a mobile phone.

It was Obama calling with congratulations.

The final stretch

The Obama campaign headquarters in Chicago thinned out in late October as some of the 700-plus staff flowed into the field. Perched on some desks and shared tables were signs advising “Keep Calm and Carry On,” a message from Britain during the Blitz in World War II.

In the final days, Obama swept through swing states in an effort to rally his supporters and urge them to the polls, at one point suggesting that casting a ballot would be suitable “revenge” for a nasty campaign. He drew on “Obamadata,” as the campaign refers to its voter lists, to hold conference calls directly with thousands of voters and volunteers.

Romney, too, bounced through Ohio, Virginia, Florida. Polls showed narrow leads — for both candidates — with little over a week to go before Election Day.

Then Hurricane Sandy arrived, stalling out the campaigns. It couldn’t have come at a worse time for Romney.

Obama left the trail for the White House, taking charge of an emergency response that even some Republicans praised.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) was among them.

For months, Christie had been one of Romney’s staunchest allies. He had predicted Romney’s knockout performance in the first debate and spoke for him whenever asked.

With days to go, Christie turned his kind words to Obama. He called Obama “outstanding” in the aftermath of Sandy and, as the two walked the storm-thrashed streets of Atlantic City, he noted that he could not “thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state.”"

1084,1084,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michael-flynn-trump-pardon/2020/11/25/3cd79198-2e65-11eb-bae0-50bb17126614_story.html,0,"President Trump on Wednesday announced he had pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, ending a three-year legal saga that included Flynn’s guilty plea for lying to the FBI, his later effort to withdraw that plea and then a controversial decision by Attorney General William P. Barr to try to drop the case altogether.

Trump’s move marks a full embrace of the retired general he had ousted from the White House after only 22 days on the job — and a final salvo against the Russia investigation that shadowed the first half of his term in office.

The pardon he granted Flynn, an early backer of his 2016 White House bid, underlines how Trump has used his clemency power to benefit allies and well-connected offenders. White House officials said Trump has been considering other pardons before leaving office, including possibly other former aides who were convicted of crimes as part of the special counsel probe of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.

Flynn pleaded guilty to a felony in December 2017, admitting that he had misled investigators about details of his conversations with the Russian ambassador during Trump’s presidential transition.

His plea was one of the first major courtroom victories for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who had been appointed seven months earlier.

The special counsel probe ultimately did not establish the Trump campaign had entered into a criminal conspiracy with the Kremlin. But the investigation documented how Russia interfered in the 2016 race to benefit Trump, and how Trump’s campaign welcomed the assistance.

Flynn was one of six Trump associates to be convicted or charged with crimes before the probe ended in 2019. The president and his allies have repeatedly attacked Flynn’s prosecution as overzealous and flawed in their efforts to discredit the special counsel inquiry.

This spring, Barr and the Justice Department suddenly reversed course, declaring that prosecutors should not have brought the case against Flynn and seeking to have it dismissed. That request has been pending before a federal judge, who has been reviewing the case.

On Wednesday, Trump tweeted, “It is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!”

Not long before Trump announced the pardon publicly, Flynn tweeted an image of the American flag and the words “Jeremiah 1:19,” a reference to a Bible verse in which God says, “They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will rescue you.”

Democrats responded to the long-anticipated pardon with outrage. In a lengthy statement, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Flynn had chosen “loyalty to Trump over loyalty to his country” and that Trump’s decision was intended to insulate himself from criminal investigation. He called the move a “corruption” of what the framers intended in giving the president broad pardon powers.

“It’s no surprise that Trump would go out just as he came in — crooked to the end,” Schiff said.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) called the pardon “undeserved, unprincipled, and one more stain on President Trump’s rapidly diminishing legacy.”

Through a representative, Mueller declined to comment.

But Andrew Weissmann, a former member of the special counsel team, tweeted, “Trump’s abuse of the pardon power undermines the crown jewel of our democracy: the rule of law.”

Trump told one adviser this week that Flynn had considerable support from the conservative community, and that his pardon would be well received among his supporters, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private conversation.

Flynn had also developed close ties with Jenna Ellis, one of the president’s legal advisers, who is pushing his false allegations of fraud in this month’s election.

Last week, the night before she appeared at a news conference at the headquarters of the Republican National Committee in Washington to discuss the president’s claims about the election, Ellis posted a photograph on Twitter of herself with Flynn and the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. She has discussed Flynn’s case with Trump, according to the person.

Chief of Staff Mark Meadows was an advocate for the Flynn pardon, and has often commiserated with the president about how unfair the Mueller investigation was to Flynn and others.

Flynn is the second Trump associate caught up in the Mueller probe to benefit from the president’s power to grant clemency. In July, Trump commuted the sentence of his former adviser, Roger Stone, who had been convicted of lying to Congress about his efforts to secure information from WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign.

Trump has largely eschewed the traditional pardon process, in which people convicted of crimes formally apply for White House consideration and have their applications reviewed by Justice Department lawyers.

Instead, the president has taken recommendations from friends, TV hosts and White House advisers, such as son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has taken a large role in some of the past decisions.

It is unclear whether Trump might seek to preemptively pardon himself or any of his family members, who have told others they expect to face ongoing investigations after Trump leaves office.

After his guilty plea in late 2017, Flynn initially cooperated with special counsel prosecutors pursuing other cases, delaying his sentencing.

But once Mueller’s team disbanded, Flynn hired new lawyers — including attorney Sidney Powell, who this fall has been part of a team of Trump legal advisers working to overturn the November election results by promoting baseless conspiracy theories about fraud.

In the Flynn case, Powell argued that Flynn had been entrapped during his FBI interview, conducted at the White House four days after Trump took office. She maintained that he had never intended to lie and that key documents had been withheld from him by prosecutors.

Prosecutors at first continued to pursue the case, and a federal judge rejected several of Flynn’s new arguments.

But in May, acting on instructions from Barr, the Justice Department reversed course and said a new review of the case’s origins led prosecutors to conclude that Flynn’s lies could not be proved in court. Because of that, the department said, they were not material to an FBI investigation of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election that was underway at the time.

The stunning turnaround prompted fears of politicization at the Justice Department. Barr insisted that a review of the case concluded it should be dismissed.

Rather than immediately accept that, however, U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, who has overseen the case, signaled that he wished to explore whether the Justice Department had acted properly and whether Flynn was being given special treatment because he is an ally of the president.

Flynn objected to Sullivan’s handling of the case, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled the judge did not have to immediately grant the Justice Department’s request to drop the matter.

In September, Powell told Sullivan that she had personally briefed Trump on Flynn’s case and had asked the president not to pardon his former national security adviser.

But on Wednesday, Powell said the pardon was appropriate. “It was high time that he be exonerated of all these charges,” she said on Fox Business. “It was truly a pardon of innocence.”

Trump’s pardon shortcuts Sullivan’s ongoing review. The Justice Department will no longer be able to pursue charges against Flynn for lying to the FBI, even after President-elect Joe Biden and his new attorney general take over next year.

The Supreme Court has ruled that accepting a pardon is akin to an admission of guilt — though some presidents and governors have used their pardon powers to help people who maintained their innocence.

A Justice Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the department was not consulted in advance of the pardon but was given a “heads-up” on Wednesday. The official said the department would have preferred to see if Sullivan would act, and for the matter to be resolved in court.

“We were confident in the likelihood of our success in the case,” the official said. They said, however, the move was “obviously an appropriate use of the president’s pardon power.”

Flynn, now 61, was a highly regarded military intelligence officer who served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan before being named director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama.

But he was pushed out of that job amid concerns about his leadership skills, and a penchant for taking positions on matters related to Iran and militant Islam not supported by underlying intelligence. Associates of Flynn said he was so embittered by his treatment that he turned against Obama, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and others he blamed for his professional demise.

In 2016, he lent Trump’s campaign legitimacy at a time when no other established national security official role was willing to endorse the former reality TV star or advise him on foreign policy issues.

As a campaign adviser, he led crowds in chants of “lock her up!” about Clinton and, in recent years, as his legal woes mounted, Flynn has made statements and postings on Twitter that suggest he has embraced online conspiracy claims espoused by QAnon and other sources.

After Trump was elected, he designated Flynn to serve as his national security adviser. In that role, Flynn conducted a series of meetings and phone calls with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump was inaugurated.

Among the topics the two discussed were new sanctions that were imposed on Russia by Obama on Dec. 29, 2016, in response to Russia’s interference in the election. Declassified transcripts of the call show that Flynn and Kislyak spoke that day, and Flynn asked that Russia not respond aggressively to Obama’s move or escalate the conflict.

The next day, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he would take no action in reaction to the new sanctions, flummoxing officials in Washington.

The reason for the move, however, was made clear in a phone call from Kislyak to Flynn on Dec. 31, in which the Russian envoy told Flynn his views had been “taken into account” at the Kremlin and were the reason for the muted Russian reaction.

When Flynn was asked 24 days later by two FBI agents whether he discussed the sanctions with Kislyak, he told the agents that he did not remember doing so. In pleading guilty, he told the court he knew this was not true.

More recently, he told the court he had not intended to lie.

After a Washington Post columnist reported in January 2017 that Flynn had spoken to Kislyak on the day the sanctions were announced, Vice President Pence and other officials publicly said they had been assured by Flynn that he had not discussed the topic with the Russian ambassador.

Justice Department officials warned the White House that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI. After that, Flynn acknowledged privately to Trump that he might have discussed sanctions with Kislyak.

Trump’s top aides concluded they did not think Flynn could have forgotten the conversation and concluded he had lied. Flynn was then forced to resign from his post.

Why Flynn chose to lie repeatedly about his contacts with Kislyak is one of the lingering mysteries of the Russia investigation. Many legal experts believe that if had he been truthful, he probably would not have faced charges or lost his job.

In pleading guilty, Flynn also told the court that he had acted as a foreign agent of the government of Turkey while working as a consultant during the 2016 presidential campaign — and falsely filed paperwork with the Justice Department in March 2017 indicating that he had not known whether Turkey would benefit from the work or not. Flynn later denied knowingly making false statements about his Turkey work.

His lies to the FBI — as well as his undisclosed work for Turkey — prompted Sullivan to lecture the retired general at a dramatic hearing not long after he pleaded guilty, telling him that his crime was a “very serious offense.”

The judge pointed to the American flag that sat on the bench next to him and told the retired military officer: “Arguably, you sold your country out.”"
1103,1103,https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/12/01/stimulus-congress-coronavirus/,0,"A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a coronavirus aid proposal worth about $908 billion on Tuesday, aiming to break a months-long partisan impasse over emergency federal relief for the U.S. economy amid the ongoing pandemic. The new plan came amid a flurry of congressional jostling about the shape of economic relief, with House Democrats assembling a new proposal, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) creating a new plan and President-elect Joe Biden calling for a massive government response. The growing calls for action have not led to a unified approach, prompting political leaders to forge ahead in different directions.

Still, the new actions and statements Tuesday may reflect movement toward some level of pandemic relief for millions of Americans. Congress has faced increasing pressure to approve additional economic aid since talks between the White House and House Democrats collapsed, first over the summer and then again in the fall ahead of the Nov. 3 election.

While the negotiations among leadership and the administration were stuck, senators in both parties worked together for weeks on a proposal to break the logjam. Several centrist senators — including Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Angus King (I-Maine), Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) — as well as members of the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus held a news conference Tuesday morning to push their proposal as a template for legislation that could pass Congress as the economy faces increasing strain from a fall surge in coronavirus cases.

“Our action to provide emergency relief is needed now more than ever before. The people need to know we are not going to leave until we get something accomplished,” Manchin said, flanked by about half a dozen lawmakers at the Capitol. “I’m committed to seeing this through.”

McConnell disclosed Tuesday that senior Republicans received a new coronavirus relief offer from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Monday night. Democratic aides declined to disclose details of their offer, and Schumer called it a “private proposal to help us move the ball forward.”

Senate Republican leaders circulated a slimmed-down plan Tuesday that would probably be fiercely opposed by Democrats. The measure includes a liability shield for businesses and more small-business assistance. It would provide short-term, limited jobless aid but no additional funding for state and local governments or help for cash-strapped transit agencies.

The plan represented a conservative turn from the Senate Republican leader following the defeat of President Trump, who had pushed the GOP to support more spending ahead of his election. In September, McConnell pushed for a federal supplement of unemployment benefits of $300 per week. The latest proposal from his office would extend base unemployment benefits and a program for gig workers and independent contractors for about one month but would otherwise not provide supplemental federal unemployment benefits — a reversal in Republicans’ positions. A spokesman for McConnell did not immediately respond to a question about the change.

The McConnell bill also reintroduces a Republican plan to allow diners to claim a tax deduction on their meal expenditures, a provision pushed by the business lobby but viewed skeptically by economists and some Republicans.

“We just don’t have time to waste time. We have a couple of weeks left here,” McConnell said. “Obviously, it does require bipartisan support to get out of Congress, but it requires a presidential signature.”

By contrast, the plan circulated by the bipartisan group of senators is light on details but seeks to reach a middle ground on numerous contentious economic issues.

It would provide $300 a week in federal unemployment benefits for roughly four months — a lower amount than the $600 per week Democrats sought, while still offering substantial relief to tens of millions of jobless Americans. The agreement includes $160 billion in funding for state and local governments, a key Democratic priority opposed by most Republicans, as well as a temporary moratorium on some coronavirus-related lawsuits against companies and other entities — a key Republican priority that most Democrats oppose. The measure also includes funding for small businesses, schools, health care, transit authorities and student loans, among other measures.

Aides close to the effort described details as fluid and subject to change. Few outside the group of Senate negotiators endorsed the proposal Tuesday, with some Republican senators complaining the $908 billion price tag was too steep.

Advertisement

But the substantive efforts at a compromise in the Senate reflect growing agitation from influential senators against the hard-line stances of their respective leaders, who have struggled to agree on another round of coronavirus relief aid as the economy continues to suffer under the weight of the pandemic.

McConnell and Schumer have traded barbs, with McConnell on Monday accusing Democrats of “all-or-nothing obstruction.” Schumer said in a floor speech that “both sides must give” but also trashed McConnell for advancing a GOP wish list in stimulus talks.

Some lawmakers have hoped that elements of a bipartisan stimulus deal could be added to the spending bill required to avoid a Dec. 11 government shutdown, although that could complicate the must-pass legislation. Nonetheless, McConnell suggested Tuesday that the spending bill could be an avenue to pass targeted coronavirus relief.

Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke Tuesday afternoon about the government funding bill. As for the bipartisan Senate framework, Mnuchin said he would review it, although the plan got a much icier reaction from the White House.

“The Trump administration has been in ongoing talks with Leader McConnell and [House Minority Leader Kevin] McCarthy about a targeted COVID relief plan,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement. “The $908 billion proposal has not been a topic of discussion.”

Pelosi said in a statement: ″Additional COVID relief is long overdue and must be passed in this lame duck session.”

Biden, who introduced his economic team Tuesday, expressed support for some form of coronavirus relief now and signaled to Republicans that more aid will be necessary next year after his inauguration in January.

“Right now, the full Congress should come together and pass a robust package for relief to address these urgent needs,” Biden said in prepared remarks in Wilmington, Del. “But any package passed in a lame-duck session is likely to be, at best, just a start.”

Asked whether he supported the $908 billion stimulus proposal, Biden told reporters: “I just heard about it. I’ll take a look at it when I get back.” Asked whether he had spoken to McConnell, he said, “Not yet.”

Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the second-highest-ranking Senate Democrat, was involved in the discussions but did not appear with lawmakers at the Tuesday news conference. In a floor speech, Durbin cited disagreements with the group’s decisions, arguing that it should have excluded the liability shield, but he said: “I’m still willing to work on it. … Let us not make the best the enemy of the good.”

Durbin called for the legislation to come to the Senate floor, despite his reservations.

“I’m not happy with a lot of these figures,” he said. “But that’s what it’s all about in this world of the United States Congress: You come together, willing to sit down and listen to the other side and, if necessary, compromise.”

Economists have warned of devastating consequences for the economy and millions of Americans if no stimulus deal is passed. A number of relief programs are set to expire at the end of the year. Twelve million Americans are on pace to lose their jobless benefits, and protections for renters and student borrowers are also set to expire, along with a federal paid-family-leave program.

The White House has largely abandoned its aggressive push for stimulus since Trump lost the Nov. 3 presidential election. It is also unclear whether Biden will push Democrats to accept a smaller package, although some of his economic advisers have been adamant that a stimulus deal must be passed quickly, even if it is smaller than what Democrats prefer.

Republicans continued to try making that case Tuesday.

“I think $900 billion would do a lot more good right now than $2 trillion will do in March,” said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of the GOP leadership. “This is an important time to step up if we can.”

The bipartisan agreement includes about $288 billion in funding for small businesses, including through the Paycheck Protection Program and other aid. It also includes $45 billion for transportation agencies, $82 billion for education, $26 billion in nutrition assistance and $16 billion in health care, including to help with coronavirus testing and tracing, and vaccine distribution.

The effort was expected to leave out a second round of $1,200 stimulus payments, as a way to bring down its overall cost, even though Trump and Pelosi support it.

Hanging over the talks is the concern among Democrats that any package passed now will sap the willingness of congressional Republicans to pursue another, larger bill next year under Biden. That tension helped derail previous rounds of negotiations ahead of the election, and even now, members of the bipartisan group trying to break the logjam express different views on whether multiple rounds of aid are feasible.

""I believe this is the last bite at the apple,"" said Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio), a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus. ""At some point in the second quarter [of 2021], the pandemic is essentially over, most likely. And so, if there's a thought that, well, we'll do this now and then we'll do another one at the end of January or February, I think that's a pipe dream, personally.""

But Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), a co-chair of the caucus, called the emerging bipartisan plan a ""great down payment"" that could be supplemented in the months ahead.

“Now’s the best time to fight, to get as much as we can to help people now. But we’re going to have keep fighting to get more resources as it’s needed, and we’ll do it again under a new president,” Gottheimer said. “But this whole idea that we shouldn’t do anything now because we may get more later -- well, that didn’t work for us last time. And now here we are, and I just don’t think the country is going to accept the fact that we’re going to say, well, we’ve got to wait.”

The measure faced early opposition from both flanks, with liberals opposed to the liability shield and conservatives opposed to spending more money to help the economy. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, criticized the proposal for leaving out another round of $1,200 stimulus checks. Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs for the conservative group FreedomWorks, said conservative GOP senators probably would reject the measure because of its cost. Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) are among those who have resisted another spending package.

“Anything that adds to the deficit is a non-starter,” Pye said.

At the news conference, Romney stressed that he is a deficit hawk and that the proposal costs far less than the $1.8 trillion that White House officials pushed earlier. He also said the legislation would be partly funded by more than $500 billion in unspent money from the Cares Act stimulus measure passed in March, reducing the amount of new spending.

Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, spoke positively of the bipartisan effort and urged lawmakers to quickly approve emergency financial help.

“More will be needed later, but immediate relief is needed now,” she said. “That’s what the senators are talking about. We cannot wait.”"
1135,1135,https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2020/12/03/james-okeefe-cnn-recording-law/,0,"Over the last few years, Project Veritas has gathered evidence in an effort to prove that CNN slants its coverage to hurt President Trump. In the past, that has meant surreptitiously recording and releasing videos of unsuspecting CNN employees talking about the network’s coverage, as well as releasing leaked tapes of comments made by network executives and staffers in editorial meetings. Last year, the conservative group revealed that a contractor hired by CNN as a satellite uplink technician had been a primary “whistleblower” on the effort.

But on Tuesday, Project Veritas — an organization that has used deceptive tactics in some of its attempts to capture proof of what it says is liberal bias and corruption in mainstream media and government — may have crossed a line. To help promote a new cache of two months of recordings of CNN’s daily morning editorial calls, the group’s founder, James O’Keefe, filmed himself calling in to the network’s 9 a.m. meeting and pressing CNN President Jeff Zucker on the network’s journalistic integrity.

While Project Veritas had previously disseminated covert recordings of CNN’s daily meeting, in this video O’Keefe himself could be seen dialing in to a private CNN call — apparently without the knowledge or consent of participants.

In a tweet on Tuesday evening, CNN public relations staff said this move might have broken the law — and that “we’ve referred it to law enforcement.”

CNN would not elaborate further on the legal issues at play when asked for comment. But several of the call attendees participated from states that require the consent of both parties for a recording to be made, a company individual said, including California, where recording a call without the permission of the people involved can draw a fine up to $2,500 and a prison sentence of up to a year, according to state law.

In an interview Wednesday evening, O’Keefe defended his tactics and said he has not been contacted by law enforcement. “Project Veritas has legal experts, too, and we believe Jeff Zucker is just mad and embarrassed,” he said. “Project Veritas follows the law.”

Asked how Project Veritas obtained the meeting recordings, O’Keefe said his organization “was given access to the CNN calls by a brave insider.”

In the first clip released Tuesday, CNN special correspondent Jamie Gangel is heard relaying to colleagues what prominent lawmakers of both parties had advised her about how they think the media should cover the president’s unwillingness to acknowledge Joe Biden’s election victory. “News organizations have to be very careful and very responsible about not giving Trump too much of a platform on his not conceding things, because they feel the transition can go forward,” she said. “… They just don’t want us to exaggerate that Trump isn’t leaving office.” There was no indication of how Project Veritas obtained this audiotape nor anything to suggest that the group had improperly recorded it. CNN declined to comment on the recording and said Gangel would not comment, either.

In a recording of an Oct. 9 CNN meeting, Zucker is heard telling his staffers how to cover Trump’s behavior and comments in the days after he left Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was treated for the coronavirus. “I just wanted to reemphasize that we cannot normalize what has happened here in the last week with Trump and his behavior,” Zucker says. “This is a president who knows he’s losing, who knows he’s in trouble, is sick, maybe is on the aftereffects of steroids or not, I don’t know, but he is acting erratically and desperately, and we need to not normalize that. This is what we’ve come to expect for the last three-and-a-half years, four years, but it clearly is exacerbated by the time that we’re in and the issues that he’s dealing with. And I think we cannot let it be normalized. He is all over the place and acting erratically, and I think we need to lean into that.”

In another mid-October recording, Zucker is heard telling staff, “I don’t think that we should be repeating unsubstantiated smears just because the right-wing media suggests that we should.”

According to CNN, Project Veritas misidentified the speaker in a clip in which an individual can be heard disparaging “the naked racism” of Fox News host Tucker Carlson and calling his nightly show “the white supremacy hour.” Project Veritas attributed the comments to CNN Digital Worldwide executive Marcus Mabry, who is Black, but the network said they were actually made by general counsel David Vigilante, who is White. (“We’re certain you’ll want to correct the record and apologize to the Black executive for assuming he was the voice raising concerns over white supremacy,” CNN wrote on Twitter. “We apologize for the misidentification,” O’Keefe said.) CNN declined to comment on the these recordings as well and said that Zucker, Mabry and Vigilante also would not comment.

Carlson criticized Mabry on his nightly show, but a Fox News spokesperson said the segment “had nothing to do with the Project Veritas clip of CNN’s editorial call” and that the host “did not misidentify Marcus Mabry.” Fox declined to comment on Vigilante’s remarks."

President Obama put a rosy spin on several accomplishments of his administration in his 2013 State of the Union address.

The president claimed that “both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion.” But that’s only an estimate of deficit reduction through fiscal year 2022, and it would be lower if the White House used a different starting point.

Obama touted the growth of 500,000 manufacturing jobs over the past three years, but there has been a net loss of 600,000 manufacturing jobs since he took office. The recent growth also has stalled since July 2012.

He claimed that “we have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas.” Actual mileage is improving, but Obama’s “doubled” claim refers to a desired miles-per-gallon average for model year 2025.

Obama said the Affordable Care Act “is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.” It may be helping, but the slower growth for health care spending began in 2009, before the law was enacted, and is due at least partly to the down economy.

The president also made an exaggerated claim of bipartisanship. He said that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney agreed with him that the minimum wage should be tied to the cost of living. But Romney backed off that view during the campaign.

Analysis

President Barack Obama gave his State of the Union address to Congress Feb. 12, laying out his legislative agenda for the coming year and achievements of his time in office. But Obama puffed up his record.

Deficit Reduction

Obama said the administration and Congress “have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion.” A bipartisan group called the estimate “very reasonable.” But it is only an estimate — and a debatable one at that — for deficit reduction from budgets through fiscal year 2022. Exactly how much will be cut will be up to future Congresses.

And, even if Congress meets those deficit-reduction goals, deficit spending will continue and the federal debt will grow larger — unless much more is done.

Obama: Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion — mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.

Obama has cited the $2.5 trillion figure on numerous occasions, including at a Jan. 14 news conference. It is based largely on two pieces of legislation: the Budget Control Act of 2011, which placed caps on discretionary spending beginning in 2012, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which prevented tax hikes on most Americans in 2013 but allowed rates to go up on the top 1 percent of taxpayers. There was some additional savings from reductions in discretionary spending in the fiscal 2011 appropriations bills.

Republicans challenge the $2.5 trillion figure with some justification, because the amount of savings depends heavily on the baseline — that is, the starting point of comparison. The White House told us it used the Office of Management and Budget’s January 2011 baseline.

In a recent report, the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated the deficit reduction at $2.7 trillion, using the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s August 2010 baseline. But it also acknowledged that “there is no simple answer to the question of how much deficit reduction has been enacted so far.” The report says starting a year earlier or later would reduce the estimated savings.

CRFB, Feb. 11: Although $2.7 trillion is a very reasonable estimate of enacted savings, it is by no means the only way to measure past savings. It is worth noting that the discretionary savings in this number are in fact calculated from the high point of discretionary spending. Measuring either from a year later or from a year earlier would result in a smaller savings number because base discretionary spending (excluding the effects of the stimulus) actually increased between 2009 and 2010 due to larger-than-projected appropriations.

As we have written once before, the vast majority of the deficit reduction has yet to materialize. Congress is supposed to comply with the caps on discretionary spending imposed by the Budget Control Act in future appropriations bills. But whether that happens remains to be seen.

And, even if Congress complies, deficit spending will continue, and the federal debt will rise — just not as quickly as it otherwise would have. The latest CBO figures show the public debt — that is, the amount the federal government owes the public — will approach $20 trillion in 2023, an increase of more than $8 trillion from its current level of $11.6 trillion.

For that reason, most budget experts warn that the president understates the scope of the budget problem when he says, as he did in his speech, that “we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.” The nonpartisan Concord Coalition says the president’s goal of accomplishing $4 trillion in deficit reduction “would hardly mean the ‘job is finished.’ ”

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget struck the same cautionary note in its report, saying the progress so far is “notable” but enacting $4 trillion in deficit reduction will not stabilize the debt.

CRFB, Feb. 11: Declaring victory with an additional $1.5 trillion would be dangerous, however, since it would leave no margin for error, would result in slower economic growth, would leave little fiscal flexibility, and would have little chance of stabilizing the debt beyond the ten-year window. For these reasons, we believe the debt must be not only stable, but on a clear downward path by the end of the decade.

Manufacturing Jobs

The president was correct when he said U.S. “manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three” years, but that’s not the whole story.

Overall, there has been a net loss of more than 600,000 manufacturing jobs since Obama took office in January 2009, and manufacturing job growth during his tenure has stalled since reaching a peak of nearly 12 million jobs in July 2012.

Obama: After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three.

Over the past three years — since January 2010 — the U.S. economy has added 490,000 manufacturing jobs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 11,950,000 manufacturing jobs in January 2013 — up from the 11,460,000 jobs recorded in January 2010. However, there were 12,556,000 manufacturing jobs in January 2009. So overall, there has been a loss of 606,000 jobs since Obama took office.

More recently, “manufacturing growth has been stuck in neutral,” as the National Association of Manufacturers said in a Feb. 12 press release. During the three-year period cited by Obama, manufacturing jobs peaked at 11,957,000 in July 2012. Since then, the jobs figure has fluctuated, and the economy has lost 7,000 manufacturing jobs.

Invoking Romney on Minimum Wage

Making a pitch to raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour, Obama argued for its bipartisan appeal by invoking his 2012 presidential campaign foe, Republican Mitt Romney, as a kindred spirit when it comes to tying the minimum wage to the cost of living. But Romney actually backpedaled a bit on that position during the campaign.

Obama: Tonight, let’s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour. … So here’s an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year: Let’s tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on.

It’s true that during a campaign event on Jan. 7, 2012, Romney remarked: “My view has been to allow the minimum wage to rise with the [Consumer Price Index] or with another index so that it adjusts automatically over time.”

But just two months later, Romney hedged on that position in an interview with CNBC’s Larry Kudlow, saying that in the midst of a recovery, “right now, there’s probably not a need to raise the minimum wage.”

Kudlow, March 5, 2012: Why do you want to raise the minimum wage? Why do you want to index it for inflation? Mitt Romney: Well, actually, when I was governor the legislature passed a law raising the minimum wage. I vetoed it. … And I said, “Look, the way to deal with the minimum wage is this. On a regular basis,” I said in the proposal I made, “every two years we should look at the minimum wage, we should look at what’s happened to inflation. We should also look at the jobs level throughout the country, unemployment rate, competitive rates in other states or, in this case, other nations.” So, certainly, the level of inflation is something you should look at and you should identify what’s the right way to keep America competitive. … Yeah, so that would tell you that right now there’s probably not a need to raise the minimum wage.

Car Mileage Double-talk

The president claimed that “we have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas” — which isn’t remotely close to being true right now.

In fact, according to the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute, the average EPA city/highway sticker mileage of light duty vehicles sold last month was 24.5 miles per gallon. That’s quite good — a record, in fact. And it’s 17 percent better than the 21.0 mpg for vehicles sold four years earlier, in the month Obama took office. That’s an impressive gain, but it’s a far cry from having “doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas.”

Obama was referring to his administration’s actions for raising future federal fuel efficiency standards, which call for cars and light trucks to achieve 54.5 mpg by the model year 2025. But it remains to be seen whether automakers can produce — and consumers will buy — vehicles that achieve such a doubling of average mileage a dozen years from now.

Health Care Costs

Obama said the federal health care law was “helping” to reduce the growth of health care costs. It may be helping, but the slower growth of health care spending began before the law was enacted. And experts say the down economy has played a role. It’s not clear how much impact the federal law has had.

Obama: Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.

From 2009 to 2011, the growth in national health care spending was at its lowest rate in 50-plus years, the entire time the National Health Expenditure Accounts reports have been published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Spending grew by 3.9 percent each year for 2009, 2010 and 2011. (The growth in 2008 was 4.7 percent, and 2007′s was 6.2 percent, with higher growth for years previous — see Table 3.)

But the Affordable Care Act wasn’t signed into law until 2010, after the recent slowing began. And the bulk of the law, including the individual mandate and federal subsidies to help Americans buy insurance, has yet to take effect. Experts have mainly blamed the economic slowdown for a corresponding reduction in health care spending. Economists and statisticians at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reported in 2011: “Job losses caused many people to lose employer-sponsored health insurance and, in some cases, to forgo health-care services they could not afford.”

The New York Times reported this week that the slower growth meant lower deficits, as federal spending also eased. The Congressional Budget Office reduced its projected Medicare and Medicaid spending for 2020 by 15 percent. The federal health care law may be affecting spending, but it’s unclear how much. As the Times said, “Health experts say they do not yet fully understand what is driving the lower spending trajectory.”

The economy is part of the reason, said CBO Director Douglas W. Elmendorf. But the way doctors and hospitals deliver care may be another.

New York Times, Feb. 11: Some insurers have moved away from simply paying per procedure by giving health care providers financial incentives to reduce complications and rehospitalizations, for instance. Doctors, nurses and hospitals have also taken steps to reduce wasteful treatments. Many of the changes predate the 2010 health care overhaul, but the law has also contributed to the changes by offering some financial incentives, health care experts say.

So the health care law gets some credit. It’s “helping” to slow the growth of costs, as Obama said. But the reduced growth began before the law was enacted and is due to forces — such as the economy — beyond the control of the legislation.

Puffing Up Renewable Energy

Obama said wind and solar energy have doubled. True, but they’re still a very small percentage of energy production and consumption in the U.S.

Obama: We have doubled … the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar.

We looked at this claim when Obama made it several times on the presidential campaign trail last fall. We found that wind and solar energy generation had doubled from 2008 to 2011. Consumption for wind also doubled, and it nearly doubled for solar.

But wind and solar were very small portions of energy generated before — and even after — that increase. Wind was 13 percent of all renewable energy generated in 2011. (Renewable includes biomass, such as ethanol, and hydro.) Solar was 1.3 percent of renewable energy generated. Renewable energy altogether accounted for just 9 percent of U.S. energy consumption in 2011.

Frank V. Maisano, an energy expert at the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani, told us: “Making large increases in wind power or solar power is not as big a challenge, let’s say, as making a 50 percent increase in natural gas. … You have to put it into context.”

In a morning tweet, Trump called on the court to “save our Country from the greatest Election abuse in the history of the United States,” repeating his baseless claims of widespread fraud. He had a private lunch at the White House with some of the attorneys general from 18 Republican-led states asking the court to dismiss the results in four swing states that Biden won, an effort supported by the Trump administration.

By late afternoon, 106 GOP House members — a majority of the 196-member Republican caucus — had signed on to an amicus brief to support the Texas-led motion, among them Minority Whip Steve Scalise (La.) and Rep. Tom Emmer (Minn.), the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee.

“78% of the people feel (know!) the Election was RIGGED,” Trump falsely declared in his Twitter post.

In fact, his campaign’s legal team has suffered more than three dozen defeats in federal and state courts, including the high court’s ruling Tuesday denying a motion to block Pennsylvania from certifying Biden’s win in that state.

Democrats denounced the last-ditch legal effort — filed this week by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a staunch Trump supporter who attended the White House lunch — to negate 10.4 million votes in favor of Biden in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

The appeal to the Supreme Court came days before the statutory deadline Monday for electoral college representatives in each state to vote on final certification of the results and send them to Congress for ratification early next month. The justices could decide as soon as Friday whether to accept the case, which seeks to take advantage of the allowance that lawsuits between states may be filed directly at the Supreme Court.

Since Nov. 4, President Trump has repeatedly claimed his election loss as a result of massive fraud. The following is a roundup of his claims. (Video: The Washington Post)

But officials in the targeted states said any claims in the filings have already been dismissed in lower courts. In all, 20 states, along with the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, filed a motion calling on the high court to reject the Texas request.

“Texas’s effort to get this court to pick the next President has no basis in law or fact,” Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) said in a court filing that labeled the case a bid to construct a “surreal alternate reality.”

He added that the court “should not abide this seditious abuse of the judicial process, and should send a clear and unmistakable signal that such abuse must never be replicated.”

Each of the targeted states filed an objection to Texas’s intentions and, taken together, offered the court a wide range of reasons not to get involved: that Texas lacks legal standing to file such a complaint; that the court shouldn’t get involved in the ultimate political question, a presidential election; that Texas has not shown there were any constitutional violations; that the claims come too late; and that its filing simply recycles allegations that have already been rejected by state and local courts.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, who joined the states opposing the lawsuit, called the case unconstitutional and said that Americans “cast their ballots in a free and fair election. Their decision must be respected.”

Trump has waged relentless attacks on the U.S. election system, beginning on election night and continuing even as Biden has run up a margin of victory of more than 7 million votes nationwide, along with an electoral college advantage of 306 to 232, matching Trump’s 2016 advantage over Hillary Clinton.

“The election was not close. There was no evidence of fraud. The states have certified the results,” Clinton tweeted. “Yet Trump continues to try to overturn the election at the expense of our democracy. The emperor has no clothes. Republican electeds who continue to humor him have no spines.”

The president has continued to promote baseless conspiracy theories about the election on a daily basis, calling the Texas case “the big one” this week. On Thursday, he retweeted calls from GOP members of Congress, led by Rep. Lance Gooden (Tex.), for U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr to appoint a special counsel to investigate “election irregularities.”

Barr angered the president last week when he told the Associated Press that the Justice Department has uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could overturn the election.

Legal experts predicted that the Supreme Court will quickly dismiss the Texas filing.

Share this article Share

Edward B. Foley, an election law professor at Ohio State University, said the court is likely to view the Texas filing as far different from the 2000 election dispute between George W. Bush and Al Gore, which was decided after the Supreme Court ruled in Bush’s favor on a small number of disputed ballots in Florida.

The court would be “especially sensitive to making sure it isn’t beholden to political pressure” from Trump, Foley said, suggesting a bigger concern over the president’s relentless assault on the election system is that it has won support from a significant number of Republicans.

The Texas effort “will not make a difference who is inaugurated, but the optics look very different depending on how many Republicans object to Biden’s election on the record,” Foley said.

White House aides said that the state GOP attorneys general who met with Trump were in Washington for a preplanned meeting not affiliated with the White House and that the lunch had been in the works for weeks.

The group “discussed issues important to their citizens and the country, and ways to continue to advance the shared federal-state partnership,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said.

Trump has openly sought to pressure the court to side with his campaign, suggesting before the election that one reason he was moving quickly to name Justice Amy Coney Barrett to fill the vacancy after Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death in September was to be sure there was a strong conservative majority in anticipation of an extended legal battle over the outcome.

His strategy has put Barrett — who declined to say during her Senate confirmation hearings whether she would recuse herself from election challenges involving the president — in a difficult position. She participated earlier this week when the court denied a request for an injunction against Pennsylvania’s election results. Neither she nor Trump’s other nominees on the court, Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, voiced dissent from the one-sentence, unsigned order.

“WISDOM & COURAGE!!!” Trump tweeted Thursday, repeating a mantra he has used to imply that judges and justices must summon inner fortitude to stand up for him.

Yet Trump’s campaign has run into resistance even from some state-level Republicans. Ohio, a state Trump won, said it was not supporting Texas. The Constitution does not give courts the power to dictate how states exercise their constitutional authority, its attorney general said in a filing.

Georgia’s Republican attorney general, Christopher M. Carr, said in his filing that the vote in his state was counted three times, “including a historic 100 percent manual recount.”

The count has been defended against all lawsuits, he said, and Georgia has won each one.

“Texas nevertheless asks this court to transfer Georgia’s electoral powers to the federal judiciary,” Carr wrote. “Respect for federalism and the constitutional design prohibits that transfer of power, but this court should never even reach that issue.”

Instead, the court should simply reject the request to file a complaint as inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s rules, Carr said.

Joshua A. Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky, said Trump’s pressure will have no effect with the justices, calling it “a loser of a case” that he expect the court to “reject quite easily — probably with a one-sentence order.”

But he warned that the effort from Trump and his GOP allies has, in his view, made clear that Republicans in Congress, if they held big enough majorities in both chambers, would plausibly attempt to “undo the will of the voter when they count the electoral college votes on Jan. 6.”"

By the end of the week, the United States could have two coronavirus vaccines. A vaccine developed by biotechnology company Moderna appears poised for regulatory clearance after a detailed data review by Food and Drug Administration scientists confirmed the two-shot regimen was “highly effective” in a clinical trial and carried no serious safety concerns.

The FDA is likely to authorize the Moderna vaccine as soon as Friday, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue. Anticipating that decision shortly, Gen. Gustave Perna, who is overseeing the federal effort to distribute vaccines, said Monday that the United States was preparing to ship almost 6 million doses of the Moderna vaccines to 3,285 locations in the first week.

“It will be a very similar cadence that was executed this week with Pfizer, where we’re hitting initial sites on Monday, follow on Tuesday and Wednesday,” Perna said.

Assessing Moderna’s vaccine, regulators said the two-shot regimen was 94 percent effective at preventing disease in the trial, and particularly effective against severe disease. There were 30 cases of severe covid-19 in the trial, none of them in the group that got the vaccine.

They also confirmed the vaccine worked well in people of all ages, races and genders. Side effects were widespread, occurring in most recipients, but typically short-lived, including fatigue, headaches, muscle aches and pain at the injection site.

Additional data filed by the company suggested the vaccine might prevent asymptomatic infections, not just symptomatic cases of disease. But the FDA review said there was not enough data to assess that or whether the vaccine tamped down transmission of the virus, and called for further studies.

A vaccine that protects against disease, but not infection would be incredibly valuable. But epidemiologists worry about a scenario in which people stop wearing masks but remain vulnerable to asymptomatic infections and spread the disease to others.

One point of contention about the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine — whether it should be authorized for use in 16- and 17-year-olds — will probably be avoided with Moderna, because the company is seeking clearance to use the vaccine only in people 18 and older. Last week, the company began testing its vaccine in adolescents.

Moderna’s vaccine will be reviewed Thursday by the same panel of independent experts who last week recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The data it will consider echoes the evidence that led to a 17 to 4 vote to authorize the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was 95 percent effective.

Paul Duprex, director of the Center for Vaccine Research at the University of Pittsburgh, said the vaccine looked effective and safe, with tolerable side effects and predicted it would be authorized soon. An advantage of the Moderna vaccine, he pointed out, will be its simpler logistics, because it does not require specialized ultracold storage conditions like the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

“I like the fact that now we have something can be stored in a minus-20 [degrees Celsius] fridge — the same kind of fridge you keep your ice cream in,” Duprex said.

Moderna developed its vaccine in partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, with the government underwriting the research and development of the vaccine and the advanced purchase of 200 million doses, bringing the taxpayer investment to $4.1 billion.

The FDA reviews of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines cement the success of a new genetic vaccine technology, which could be used to rapidly create vaccines for other diseases.

Older vaccines work by injecting dead or weakened virus to teach the immune system to recognize the real pathogen. In contrast, the messenger RNA technology at the core of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines delivers a strip of genetic material called RNA, encased in a fat bubble, to a person’s cells.

Once inside a cell, the messenger RNA co-opts the machinery used to make proteins to build tiny replicas of the spike protein that studs the outside of the coronavirus. The immune system learns to recognize — and block — the spike.

In Moderna’s trial, 30,000 people were randomly assigned to receive either two shots of a vaccine given four weeks apart, or two saline shots. Neither the participants, nor the people running the trial knew who was in which group. Investigators then waited as people were exposed to coronavirus in their daily lives, to see whether there were more covid-19 infections in the group that did not receive the vaccine. They counted cases starting two weeks after the second dose, when the immune system had mustered a full response.

The numbers were decisive: There were 196 cases in the trial, all but 11 of them in the group that received the placebo shots. There were 30 cases of severe covid-19, and one death from covid-19 in the trial, also all in the group that received the placebo shots.

There was suggestive evidence that a first dose of vaccine afforded some protection from the virus, but not enough to draw conclusions. “These data do not provide sufficient information about longer term protection beyond 28 days after a single dose,” the review said.

One of the major outstanding questions about this and other coronavirus vaccines is whether they prevent infection, as well as disease. Since many cases of covid-19 are asymptomatic, that question has major implications for whether people will need to continue wearing masks and social distance despite being vaccinated.

Larry Corey, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who co-leads the government’s clinical trial network responsible for testing coronavirus vaccines, is working on a proposal for a trial that would specifically test whether vaccines afford such protection. That trial would give shots to college students and then ask them to test themselves daily to see if they become infected. Corey hopes that study could begin in January.

In the addendum Moderna filed to the FDA, the company presented a tantalizing hint that its vaccine might offer such protection: Before receiving a second dose of vaccine or placebo, 52 people tested positive for the coronavirus but had no symptoms. Most were in the placebo group, indicating the vaccine may have protected the others against asymptomatic infection after a single dose.

In its review of possible safety issues, the FDA noted there were three cases of Bell’s palsy, a temporary facial paralysis, in the group that received the Moderna vaccine, compared with one case in the placebo group. The rate of Bell’s palsy was similar to that expected in the general population and there was not enough evidence to determine if it was caused by the vaccine.

The FDA concluded “a potential contribution of the vaccine to the manifestations of these events of facial palsy cannot be ruled out.” It recommended close surveillance for any additional cases as the vaccine is used in a broader population.

Lymph node swelling was more common in the group that received the vaccine, with 16 percent of participants experiencing the symptom after the second dose. There were no severe allergic reactions, a concern that has emerged after two cases were reported in Britain after the first injections of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Enrollment in Moderna’s trial was slowed down this summer because scientists were concerned it lacked sufficient racial diversity to determine whether it truly protected those at highest risk of the disease. In the end, a fifth of participants were Hispanic, 10 percent were Black and 5 percent were Asian. More than 40 percent of the participants were either over the age of 65 or had medical conditions that increased their risk of severe disease.

“The trial enrolled the right people at risk,” Corey said. “For us who were designing the trial and enrolling the people, that’s so fantastic.”"

In a bizarre outburst on Twitter that Trump’s critics condemned for its alarming disconnect from the facts, the president contradicted his top diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who on Friday pinned the breaches that have afflicted at least five major federal agencies “clearly” on Russia. Rather, the president baselessly suggested that the true culprit “may be China (it may!)”

Trump’s aversion to calling out the Kremlin for its malign activities in cyberspace and his deference to Russian President Vladimir Putin has become a hallmark of his presidency. He has repeatedly trusted the word of Putin over the assessments of his own intelligence community, including its conclusion that Russia waged a sophisticated campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election — a verdict Trump believes calls into question the legitimacy of his victory four years ago.

His tweets Saturday raise fresh concerns that he will seek to shrug off what may turn out to be a cyber hack of unprecedented scale, and that Russia will not be held to account. The president has complained to advisers, who believe Russia is culpable, that the intrusions are a fake narrative meant to damage him politically.

“The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality,” Trump tweeted, despite a federal alert in recent days that called the widespread cyber espionage campaign “a grave risk to” government agencies and the private sector.

“I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control,” he said, while agencies are scrambling to investigate and contain major breaches at agencies including the State, Treasury, Energy, Homeland Security and Commerce departments — an effort that is likely to take months.

He also speculated, with no evidence, that the hacks may also have included “a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big.” Twitter flagged that assertion, saying that “multiple sources called this election differently.” There is no evidence that November’s election was undermined by significant or widespread fraud, despite Trump’s insistence otherwise.

Trump had, until Saturday, studiously avoided the topic, reluctant to address publicly an issue that has bedeviled him since he took office: Russia’s hacking of U.S. targets. He broke his silence only after he was criticized publicly by lawmakers from both parties for an apparent unwillingness to confront Putin.

White House officials had drafted a statement to be released Friday accusing Moscow of carrying out the cyber intrusions in a months-long campaign, but they were blocked from doing so, said a senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity.

But Pompeo, in an interview on “The Mark Levin Show,” had no qualms about speaking out. “This was a very significant effort,” he said, “and I think it’s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity.”

Pompeo did not specify which branch of the Russian government carried out the campaign, but U.S. officials have privately said they believe it is the foreign intelligence service, the SVR, a successor agency to the KGB. None have suggested that China played any role.

Moscow has denied any involvement in the intrusions. Federal agencies were first revealed to have been hacked last weekend.

Pompeo said he could not say much more as the investigations were ongoing. “But suffice it to say, there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems, and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,” he told Levin, a syndicated radio talk show host.

His remarks come as government agencies and affected companies race to figure out the scope of the breaches, how the Russians carried them off without being detected for months and how to prevent future compromises.

The president is intent on turning the conversation to China and its coercive activities in the technology and economic spheres and its human rights abuses, a second official said. He has directed advisers to look for ways in the waning days of his administration to confront Beijing over those issues, the official said.

Trump’s comments Saturday reflect a long-running disregard for the facts and his disinterest in what he calls “the cyber,” analysts and former aides said. “Starting with Trump’s very first meeting with Putin to today’s tweets we’ve seen an almost unbreakable pattern of denying the obvious about Russia’s misdeeds while carrying water for the Kremlin,” said Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert and vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Trump’s comments are totally divorced from reality.”

Gregory F. Treverton, a former chairman of the National Intelligence Council, the government’s senior-most provider of intelligence analysis, said that Trump “behaves so much like a paid Russian agent.”

“If you look at the string of his actions and pronouncements,” Treverton said, “the only consistent interpretation that you can logically draw is that he’s in their thrall.”

The Obama administration saw that campaign, as disturbing as it was, as classic espionage of the sort that states routinely engage in against each other, rather than as a disruptive attack, and so did not retaliate, said Michael Daniel, who was Obama’s White House cyber coordinator. Officials were not aware of the thousands of other victims in the private sector and other countries at the time, he said. The administration never publicly accused Russia of perpetrating the hacks.

This time, the context is different. There is widespread publicity around the breaches, which could turn out to be unprecedented in scale. The nature of the compromises, involving corruption of software commonly used by thousands of large organizations around the globe, is alarming. And the public is much more attuned to Russia’s malign activity in cyberspace, in the wake of its 2016 election interference.

Thus far, there is no sign that the intrusions have resulted in disruption or destruction, and the SVR is known mostly for conducting espionage. That doesn’t mean, however, the activity is not a precursor to something beyond spying, some analysts said.

In any case, Pompeo’s “attribution is a very important step,” said Tom Bossert, who was Trump’s homeland security adviser until April 2018. “The United States can now direct its focus and unite the world against this outrage.”

He said the Russian government is holding American networks at risk. “We must impose a cost on the Russians,” he said. “Until we start defending digital infrastructure as if commercial and government operations depended on it, we will remain rudderless.”

Microsoft, a major software and cloud provider, alerted several federal agencies last weekend to the fact that they were breached, its president Brad Smith told The Washington Post in an interview this past week.

“No one should be shocked that a company like Microsoft would be the first to identify any particular customer that has been breached,” he said.

Smith said so far the company has notified a little more than 40 customers who were breached, and that 80 percent of them were in the United States. The others were in Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, Britain, Israel and the United Arab Emirates.

Britain so far has seen only a small number of victims, all in the private sector.

A major avenue for breaching victims’ networks was an update for computer software made by a Texas-based company called SolarWinds. The firm said about 18,000 customers that received the patch, for network management software called Orion, were potentially exposed. The Russians covertly added malware to the update, which installed a back door on computers that the hackers could use to enter a victim’s system at will.

But the intruders were selective in choosing who to compromise. Not everyone who downloaded the patch was seen as an attractive target, Microsoft said.

The SolarWinds update was not the only path into victims’ networks, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in an alert this past week. “CISA has evidence of additional initial access vectors, other than the SolarWinds Orion platform; however, these are still being investigated,” the agency said.

Microsoft is itself a SolarWinds customer and acknowledged in a statement this past week it had found SolarWinds malware “in our environment,” which it isolated and removed.

In his interview with The Post, Smith said none of Microsoft’s customers had been breached through the software giant. “I think we can give you a blanket answer that affirmatively states, no, we are not aware of any customers being attacked through Microsoft’s cloud services or any of our other services, for that matter, by this hacker.”

Advertisement

He said: “Lots of people have been hacked and a lot of the people that have been hacked happen to be Microsoft customers and Microsoft cloud customers. But that doesn’t mean they were hacked or attacked through the Microsoft cloud.”

Smith in a blog post called for the establishment of a global norm forbidding the type of “broad and reckless activity” used against SolarWinds and its customers, which threatened the integrity of the broader software supply chain.

A norm against compromising that supply chain would “kneecap intelligence collection” by western democracies, said Thomas Rid, a cyber espionage expert at Johns Hopkins University. Worse, nondemocratic states would not abide by it, he said. “Some of the most successful western intelligence operations were supply chain compromises,” he said, citing a decades-long operation in which rigged encryption machines allowed U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on dozens of countries undetected.

Daniel, the former White House cyber coordinator, said a broad-based supply chain compromise that affects many different organizations indiscriminately “should probably be frowned upon.” But, he said, to argue that a western spy agency is never going to use the supply chain to spy on an adversary is unrealistic. “For a well-defended adversary,” he said, “it’s something you may want to consider.”"
1242,1242,https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/12/20/stimulus-congress/?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral,0,"Senate leadership announced a bipartisan deal on an approximately $900 billion economic relief package late Sunday afternoon that would deliver emergency aid to a faltering economy and a nation besieged by surging coronavirus cases. After months of contentious negotiations and seemingly intractable partisan gridlock, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) took to the Senate floor to say that a deal had been finalized and could be quickly approved.

The emerging stimulus package was expected to direct hundreds of billions of dollars in aid to jobless Americans, ailing businesses and other critical economic needs that have grown as the pandemic ravages the country and batters the economy.

“More help is on the way. Moments ago, in consultation with our committees, the four leaders of the Senate and House finalized an agreement. It would be another major rescue package for the American people,” McConnell said. “As our citizens continue battling this coronavirus pandemic this holiday season, they will not be fighting alone.”

Schumer then took to the floor, calling the aid package insufficient but heralding it as a critical measure to “give the new president a boost, a head start, as he prepared to right our ailing economy.”

The House and Senate on Sunday night approved a one-day extension of government funding to allow the final bill text on the relief package to be written. President Trump signed the stopgap measure, preventing a government shutdown.

The legislation includes stimulus checks for millions of Americans of up to $600 per person. The size of that benefit would be reduced for people who earned more than $75,000 in 2019 and disappear altogether for those who earned more than $99,000. The stimulus checks would provide $600 per adult and child, meaning a family of four would receive $2,400 up to a certain income.

Congress would also extend federal unemployment benefits of up to $300 per week, which could start as early as Dec. 27.

The income criteria for the stimulus checks is expected to reflect that of the first round of relief payments sent by the Treasury Department earlier this year.

Adult dependents are not expected to qualify for the stimulus payments, people familiar with the negotiations said, despite a push from congressional Democrats.

The deal to extend federal jobless benefits for millions of unemployed Americans at a level of $300 per week would cover up to 11 weeks of unemployment through March 14, aides familiar with the negotiations said. An unemployment benefits program for contract and gig workers, which is also set to expire at the end of the year, would be extended over the same period for those workers as well.

A compromise proposal reached earlier this month by Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), among other centrist lawmakers, would have provided 16 weeks in unemployment benefits instead of the 11 weeks under the current agreement. It was unclear why congressional leadership trimmed the duration of unemployment benefits in their latest agreement relative to the bipartisan lawmakers’ plan.

Negotiators also agreed to extend the deadline for states and cities to use unspent money approved for them by the Cares Act, two people familiar with internal deliberations said. States and cities have until the end of the year to spend billions of dollars before it expires and has to be returned to the federal government. The deal would extend that deadline for a full year.

Republicans have successfully opposed Democrats in their demands for hundreds of billions of new spending for state and local aid. Many local governments are experiencing steep declines in tax revenue and have been warning of layoffs. Extending the deadline for using leftover local government funding from the Cares Act allows Democratic lawmakers to say they still provided some relief to ailing municipalities. The agreement also leaves out a liability shield to protect businesses from virus-related lawsuits, which McConnell had previously demanded as a precondition for a deal.

The agreement will also extend for one month a moratorium on evictions that is set to expire at the end of the year, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The moratorium will be extended through January, at which point Democrats believe the incoming Biden administration can extend it again if necessary. The legislation will also provide approximately $25 billion in emergency assistance to renters, the people said, although it remained unclear how that money would be disbursed.

The single-biggest expenditure in the legislation is about $325 billion in business relief, including about $275 billion for another round of Paycheck Protection Program funding. The legislation also includes $45 billion for transportation needs such as state transportation departments and Amtrak, $82 billion for schools, $20 billion for vaccine distribution, and $13 billion for a major expansion in food stamps.

There were some unexpected expenditures in the agreement, including $1.4 billion in new funding for Trump’s border wall with Mexico and new border security technology, said House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).

An unexpected tax break in the deal was for corporate meal expenses lobbied for by the White House and strongly denounced by congressional Democrats, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Trump has for months talked about securing the deduction — derisively referred to as the “three-martini lunch” by critics — as a way to revive the restaurant industry badly battered by the pandemic. Critics say the measure, spearheaded by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) will do little to help ailing restaurants but will reduce firms’ tax obligations.

Lawmakers had also appeared to resolve a nettlesome dispute over whether businesses that received PPP loans, and had them forgiven, will be allowed to deduct the costs covered by those loans on their federal tax returns. Those costs would be deductible under a final agreement so long as a PPP recipient can show a loss in revenue in 2020 compared to prior years, according to a lawmaker briefed on the deal.

It may take some more time for congressional staff members to draft those agreements into legislative text and prepare the massive bill for votes in the House and Senate. Lawmakers had also not yet released text of the agreement between senior Democrats and Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) over the central bank, which was a sticking point Saturday.

Toomey initially demanded that a stimulus package prohibit the expiring lending programs, or anything “similar” to them, from being re-created in the future. He ultimately agreed to Schumer’s compromise, which steered away from barring programs “similar” to the ones that expire this year and instead applies more narrowly to the exact same programs.

The spending bill also includes a measure protecting patients from “surprise” medical bills. These bills — which can be as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars — can result when a patient through no fault of their own gets care from a doctor or hospital outside their health plan’s network, often surrounding emergency care.

Under the provision, doctors and hospitals may no longer charge patients the extra out-of-network costs not covered by their insurance plan. Instead, a third-party arbiter would decide the payment for these bills."

Miguel Cardona was named Connecticut’s top schools official last year and if confirmed will have achieved a meteoric rise, moving from an assistant superintendent in Meriden, Conn., a district with 9,000 students, to secretary of education in less than two years.

He was born in Meriden to Puerto Rican parents who lived in public housing. He began his career as a fourth-grade teacher and rocketed up the ranks, becoming the state’s youngest principal at age 28. He was named the state’s principal of the year in 2012.

One person close to the process said Biden made the offer to Cardona on Tuesday and that an announcement from the Biden transition team is expected Tuesday evening.

Cardona met virtually with Biden, his wife, Jill Biden, and Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris on Monday, this person said. This person and others spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

As a candidate, Biden promised to choose a public school educator as secretary, raising expectations that the nominee would come from the world of K-12 schools. He also sought out a person of color for the post, considering several other Latino and Black school leaders. While much of the work of the Education Department centers on higher education, most of the contenders for the secretary position had backgrounds in elementary and secondary education.

Cardona’s experience in public education represents a sharp contrast with President Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, who attended private schools and spent much of her energy advocating for alternatives to public education. And while Cardona has lived in poverty, DeVos is a billionaire who has been wealthy all her life.

A finalist for the job was Leslie Fenwick, former dean of the Howard University School of Education and a fierce critic of education policies such as test-based accountability for schools and teachers who have been popular with centrists in both political parties.

Cardona represented a safer selection. He does not appear to have been a combatant in those education wars, though he did challenge teachers unions as he worked to reopen schools this fall.

Nonetheless, before he was named, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, described him as a “very, very solid” candidate.

Democrats who support accountability-type education changes, concerned that Fenwick would get the job, lobbied for Cardona, and although he is not a leader from their faction, his selection marks a win for them. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus also endorsed him in recent days.

In Connecticut’s top job, much of Cardona’s attention has been focused on the coronavirus pandemic. After schools closed, he worked to procure devices for students who needed them to participate in remote schooling and pushed to reopen buildings.

When teachers unions demanded that the state meet certain safety precautions before opening buildings, Cardona replied: “We will continue to do everything we can to ensure as many children as possible have access to opportunities for in-person learning.”

Cardona added that closed schools were the result of staffing shortages, not evidence of virus transmission.

That record dovetails with Biden’s focus on trying to get schools reopened. He has called on districts to resume in-person teaching within his first 100 days in office. The new education secretary’s first task will be to help guide schools through the final phase of the pandemic.

Cardona has also focused his attention on equity issues and voiced concern that the pandemic was exacerbating inequities among students. Under his tenure, Connecticut became the first state to require high schools to offer courses on Black and Latino studies. Earlier, he served as co-chairman of a state task force examining achievement gaps.

As a candidate, Biden promised to address the shortfalls of U.S. education primarily through increased funding, a sharp departure from Trump, who repeatedly proposed deep cuts to the federal education budget and billions of dollars in tax credits to subsidize tuition to private schools.

Biden’s plan is also a shift from Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who focused on structural revisions and increased accountability for results. Those ideas angered teachers unions and others because they relied in part on testing to assess the effectiveness of schools and teachers.

Biden proposed tripling the $15 billion Title I funds that support high-poverty schools and said he would double the number of psychologists, counselors, nurses and social workers in schools, provide new money for school infrastructure and dramatically increase federal spending for special education."

The 322-to-87 vote was comfortably more than the two-thirds of the House that was needed to pass the measure and set up the legislation for a similar override vote in the Senate later this week. But the House’s margin of victory was smaller than the support the same bill received earlier this month, before the president’s veto. Some Republicans who supported the measure three weeks ago did not vote to override the president’s veto.

Trump made good on repeated threats to veto the legislation last week, when he sent the bill back to Congress with a laundry list of objections. Among the president’s complaints were that it ordered the Pentagon to change the names of military installations commemorating Confederate generals; restricted his ability to pull U.S. troops out of Germany, South Korea and Afghanistan; and did not repeal an unrelated law giving certain liability protections to technology companies.

His move led some of his stalwart supporters, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), to announce that they would not cross the president’s veto, even though they had voted for the defense bill. But despite those gestures of solidarity, the president never had the numbers to sustain a veto, according to congressional officials.

In a statement after the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called on Trump to “end his eleventh-hour campaign of chaos,” and respect the will of Congress.

Trump should “stop using his final moments in office to obstruct bipartisan and bicameral action to protect our military and defend our security,” she said.

Since the summer, the National Defense Authorization Act — an annual measure authorizing funds for everything from overseas military operations to pay increases for service members — has had overwhelming, veto-proof support in both chambers of Congress and the backing of a majority of each political party.

Over several weeks, many leading Republicans, particularly in the Senate, engaged in a concerted effort to get Trump to back off his veto threat, arguing that if the president’s push to retain the Confederate names kept the defense bill — for the first time in six decades — from becoming law, he would be on the wrong side of history.

They also appealed to Trump to abandon his insistence that the bill repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that shields social media companies from legal liability for what third parties post to their websites. Trump has taken special aim at the law as part of his vendetta against Facebook, Google and Twitter for what he alleges is anti-conservative bias.

On Sunday night, Trump included a mention of Section 230 in a statement announcing he had signed a federal budget and pandemic relief bill into law.

Share this article Share

“Congress has promised that Section 230, which so unfairly benefits Big Tech at the expense of the American people, will be reviewed and either be terminated or substantially reformed,” Trump said.

Trump’s statement did not represent a concession from Congress but a reflection of reality. While Democrats and most Republicans are in agreement that Section 230 needs revisiting, they also believe that it should be changed through a more careful process rather than shoehorning it into the defense bill.

Some leaders hoped that Trump’s statement could free some Republicans who were loath to cross his veto over the Section 230 issue to support Monday’s override vote in the House.

Speaking on the floor just before the vote, the House Armed Services Committee’s top Republican, Rep. Mac Thornberry (Tex.), implored his colleagues to do so.

“It’s the exact same bill. Not a comma has changed,” he said, calling on those who had backed the legislation earlier this month to vote in support of it again.

The panel’s chairman, Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), said the defense bill presented Congress with a rare opportunity to close the year on a high note.

“We put together a bipartisan, bicameral product that has gotten an overwhelming number of votes,” Smith said. “Let’s show the American people that the legislative process works, at least a little better than sometimes they think it does.”

The bill now heads to the Senate, which must also pass the measure with a two-thirds majority for it to become law. That vote could happen as soon as Wednesday.

Congress to date has never been able to muster the votes to override any of Trump’s vetoes, of which there have been nine since the start of his presidency. That is a higher rate of vetoes than either Barack Obama or George W. Bush, who each issued 12 vetoes over eight years in office. Before them, Bill Clinton issued 36 vetoes and George H.W. Bush issued 29. Each of those presidents faced at least one veto override by Congress."
1315,1315,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/31/goodbye-2020-you-were-awful-some-lights-shine-through/,2,"For most people, a list of the best news stories in 2020 would be extremely short. But even in a year marked by much grief and countless sorrows, there have been terrific examples of great changes for the better. Chief among these is the success of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s vaccine-development project. Few predicted that one, much less two, pioneering vaccines would result so quickly from this vast outpouring of effort and government funding to the private sector. The remarkable all-hands-on-deck explosion of ventilator production that began last spring might have already faded from memory, but no one whose life has been dealt a blow by the pandemic will ever forget the arrival of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.

The covid-19 pandemic won’t be the last one. Another is inevitable, perhaps more dangerous and possibly arriving relatively soon. Operation Warp Speed’s example of public-private partnership has set the standard for how to respond. The scientific breakthroughs assembled under this banner will be a blessing to medical research for decades to come, just as the U.S. space program fueled a half-century’s worth of dynamic scientific and technological advances. In a year shadowed by deadly illness, closed schools and economic setbacks, Operation Warp Speed offered inspiration and hope.

This was also the year of the Abraham Accords. Israel and the United Arab Emirates took the lead and most of the risk here, with the UAE demonstrating the courage it has shown in many years of deployments of its special forces to Afghanistan. For its part, Israel had to size up the opportunity and agree not merely to suspend settlement expansion in some contested areas of the West Bank,but to also concede that the provision of F-35 stealth fighter jets to the UAE would not imperil the Jewish state. With the subsequent addition of Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco, the accords are a major milestone on the road to stability in the Middle East.

Historians will mark 2020 as the beginning of the great coalescing of an international anti-Chinese Communist Party movement. “Countries that once avoided upsetting Beijing are moving closer to Washington’s harder and largely bipartisan stance,” a Wall Street Journal article noted this week. The United States has led in demanding not just accountability from the CCP on the origins of covid-19 within Wuhan but also on demands that telecommunications giant Huawei cease its attempt to infiltrate and infect the world’s 5G networks — and that the Uighur people be released from the gulags the CCP has built for them. Hong Kong no longer has even the paper-thin veneer of limited freedoms it once had, a devastating loss that has sent shock waves through world capitals. Free states can no longer pretend to not know the nature of Chairman Xi Jinping — yes, he is also President Xi, but the party title is more important — and his plans.

Finally, the sad passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg after long and courageous struggles and decades of principled jurisprudence could have led to yet another confirmation hearing meltdown. But while the questioning of Amy Coney Barrett was heated, attacks from senators on her record did not cross bright-red lines. And her confirmation allowed for a tilt of the Supreme Court toward a consolidation of viewpoints on how the Constitution ought to be applied. There are now six solid originalists on the country’s highest court for the first time in my life as a lawyer. There is reason to hope that the rights of free exercise of religion, speech and due process against “woke” mobs backed by any sort of state action — and a return to the bedrock protection of property rights against impositions from federal, state and local bureaucrats — is at hand. The court’s new majority is a lantern in the dark days of 2020, and it has just begun to burn.

None of these four stories will bring back a single soul lost to the virus around the world, or restore freedom to Hong Kong, or assuage the regret at the loss of a great jurist, or guarantee peace’s full flowering in the Middle East. None will reduce the disappointment of President Trump’s 74 million voters, or of the would-be Democratic senators who thought they would join Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) in a history-making, filibuster-ending and Supreme Court-packing congressional majority. But all four achievements are large and enduring, the sort of signposts every historian far down the road will look back and mark.

May there be many more of them, and far fewer of the terrible setbacks, across the globe in 2021.

On Monday, leaders in the Washington region urged all Americans to stay away from the nation’s capital come Jan. 20, citing the coronavirus pandemic and the recent attack on the Capitol.

“If I’m scared of anything it’s for our democracy,” D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said at a Monday news conference, responding to a reporter who asked if she feared what might happen on Inauguration Day. “Because we have factions in our country . . . that are armed and dangerous.”

Bowser, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) held a joint call on Monday to discuss planning for the 59th presidential inauguration and agreed to discourage all in-person attendance in the interest of public safety.

Hours after Bowser addressed the public, acting homeland security secretary Chad Wolf extended the National Special Security Event (NSSE) period to begin Wednesday instead of Jan. 19. A NSSE designation allows the U.S. Secret Service, the FBI and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to work together to secure certain areas that may be targets for violence.

Over the weekend, Bowser had sent a letter to Wolf asking him to start the NSSE period on Monday and coordinate with other federal agencies to “establish a security and federal force deployment plan for all federal property.”

Shortly after announcing the NSSE expansion, Wolf resigned, citing several court rulings challenging the validity of his appointment to lead the Department of Homeland Security.

The right-wing groups threatening to amass before and during the inauguration are different from the protesters the city normally welcomes, Bowser said.

One online post cited by Alethea Group, an anti-disinformation organization, has called for an “ARMED MARCH ON CAPITOL HILL & ALL STATE CAPITOLS.” Others have discussed a “Million Militia March” on Inauguration Day.

An FBI memo to law enforcement agencies across the country warned that “armed protests” were being planned “at all 50 state capitols” and in D.C. leading up to the inauguration, an official familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive law enforcement matter, told The Washington Post.

The city has already deployed its full police force of 3,700 officers and called in 2,908 additional law enforcement personnel from other states to assist for inauguration. The National Guard could also send up to 15,000 troops to the District during the presidential inauguration, senior defense officials said Monday.

But Bowser, who said she will be briefed by the FBI daily on threats to the city, warned that demonstrations across the country may mean states will rethink their ability to lend help. That could be especially dangerous at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has hamstrung the city’s emergency response teams. On average, the D.C. fire department is operating with a 10 percent reduction in staffing from coronavirus infection and exposure, according to city officials.

Over the weekend, Bowser sent a flurry of letters to federal agencies requesting resources to help keep the city safe. She asked President Trump to declare a pre-emergency declaration in the District.

“Based on recent events and intelligence assessments, we must prepare for large groups of trained and armed extremists to come to Washington, D.C. during the NSSE in an attempt to disrupt the Inauguration,” she said in the letter.



Trump granted the emergency declaration Monday night, which means the federal government will reimburse D.C. for costs related to emergency protective measures such as overtime and hazardous-duty pay. The federal government also granted the District such a declaration in 2009 for President Barack Obama’s inauguration.

Bowser also requested that the Interior Department rescind and deny all permits for gatherings in downtown Washington between Monday and Jan. 24. On Monday, the National Park Service shut down access to the Washington Monument through Jan. 24, citing threats surrounding the inauguration.

The National Park Service has issued two permits that together allow for 75 people to demonstrate around the inauguration, according to Mike Litterst, a department spokesman. On Monday, Litterst said the Park Service was still processing five outstanding permit requests, two of which are for events expecting 5,000 people. The first of those applications was submitted last January by DC Action Lab, a liberal group based in the District. The second was submitted in December by Black Pact, a nonpartisan political group organizing a march for reparations.

In addition to the focus on public safety threats from armed demonstrators, city officials are also pouring resources into preventing the spread of the coronavirus during a week with the potential for mass gatherings downtown. Late Monday night, Bowser issued an order extending restrictions on certain phase two activities, such as on indoor dining, through Jan. 22. The restrictions were set to expire Jan. 15.

The District’s health department has partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to staff 10 first-aid stations downtown. D.C. Health is also providing coronavirus testing for law enforcement traveling to the District from other states and will conduct contact tracing for emergency responders, according Bowser’s letter requesting an emergency declaration.

Bowser also said Monday that she would “likely” extend the mandated closure of indoor dining, which was introduced in December to address rising coronavirus cases, through Jan. 24 in the interest of public safety around the inauguration.

There have already been coronavirus cases linked to the short-lived insurrection at the Capitol. On Monday, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), who took shelter in a room with other lawmakers, tested positive. She is a 75-year-old cancer survivor."
1391,1391,https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/13/us-ban-xinjiang-cotton-tomatoes/?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral,0,"The Trump administration Wednesday issued a sweeping ban on imports of cotton or tomato products from China’s Xinjiang region, saying it had reviewed evidence of forced labor in the region. The move is the administration’s latest effort to punish China over what Western officials and human rights groups call the country’s campaign of repression against the Muslim Uighur population of Xinjiang, which has included the population’s mass detention in camps.

The ban, which covers everything from cotton apparel to canned tomatoes, will affect a wide array of U.S. importers. Xinjiang accounts for almost a fifth of global cotton production, according to official figures and calculations by The Washington Post.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Wednesday it would immediately start detaining cotton and tomato products produced in the region, “based on information that reasonably indicates the use of detainee or prison labor and situations of forced labor.”

The agency said it conducted an investigation that revealed working conditions including “debt bondage, restriction of movement, isolation, intimidation and threats, withholding of wages, and abusive living and working conditions.”

“DHS will not tolerate forced labor of any kind in U.S. supply chains. We will continue to protect the American people and investigate credible allegations of forced labor, we will prevent goods made by forced labor from entering our country, and we demand the Chinese close their camps and stop their human rights violations,” Ken Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Customs and Border Protection, said in a statement.

The ban includes textiles, tomato seeds, tomato sauce and other goods made with cotton and tomatoes.

China’s embassy in Washington called the allegation of forced labor “a political lie concocted by some U.S. politicians.”

“The U.S. side resorts to pressure, sanctions and other means to suppress Xinjiang enterprises and undercut Xinjiang’s stability, development and prosperity,” the embassy said in an emailed statement. “China will continue taking necessary measures to safeguard the lawful rights and interests of relevant parties and companies.”

In a statement, the American Apparel & Footwear Association, the National Retail Federation and two other industry groups said they “remain outraged” by reports of forced labor in the region and “have long made eradicating forced labor in our supply chains a top operational and public policy priority.”

“We look forward to working with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to make sure enforcement is smart, transparent, targeted, and effective,” the groups said. “We urge CBP to share with industry the evidence gathered, and the evidentiary thresholds used, that led to today’s announcement.”

The measure follows a more targeted ban the Trump administration issued in December against cotton products made by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, which CBP called “an economic and paramilitary organization subordinate to the Chinese Communist Party.”

In September, the United States banned the import of certain apparel and computer parts from China, saying they were made by forced laborers from Xinjiang.

Over the past three years, a heavy-handed Chinese anti-extremism campaign has swept an estimated 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into what the government calls “reeducation centers.” Satellite images show these high-security compounds are similar in layout to prisons, and former detainees have alleged they were subject to torture.

Many detainees were placed at textile factory jobs in Xinjiang upon their release, according to official reports. Local officials have said it is voluntary work for rehabilitated criminals, but some workers have alleged they were threatened with detention if they refused."

With solemn looks on their mask-covered faces, the nine House impeachment managers walked over to the Senate shortly after 7 p.m. Monday to deliver the article against Trump, setting in motion his second Senate impeachment trial.

While no final decisions on trial strategy have been made, House managers are concentrating on building their case around Trump personally — both what he said in the run-up to the Jan. 6 attack and at a rally that day, and how his words were interpreted within the White House and outside of it, according to people familiar with the deliberations.

The impeachment managers and their advisers have been meeting daily, scouring hundreds of hours of evidence — including footage scraped from the conservative social media site Parler and other sites — to build an elaborate timeline that is being constantly updated, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal discussions.

One idea under consideration: to produce a video that highlights how the rioters reacted to Trump’s remarks that day and shows footage of the violent mob inside the building.

But at the same time, allies of Trump are growing bullish that as more time passes since the fatal siege, the momentum in favor of convicting the former president and permanently barring him from public office is fading.

“There are only a handful of Republicans and shrinking who will vote against him,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) who has been advising Trump on the upcoming proceedings.

Trump’s coming Senate trial, which is not set to begin in earnest until Feb. 9, has ensured that the remnants of the Trump presidency are hanging over the first days of President Biden’s tenure, complicating his immediate agenda on Capitol Hill such as the confirmation of his Cabinet and passage of a massive coronavirus relief package.

Biden and his aides have assiduously avoided getting involved in the political morass of impeachment surrounding his predecessor, although the trial is likely to consume all of the oxygen in Washington once opening arguments begin next month.

Senators will be sworn in as jurors Tuesday, when Trump will receive the official summons. But the official trial proceedings will be delayed until the week of Feb. 8 under a delayed timeline first proposed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and later approved by Biden.

A handful of Republican senators, including McConnell himself, have made it clear they would consider voting to convict Trump. But it still remains highly unlikely that at least 17 GOP senators would favor doing so.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said Monday that Democrats, in pursuing impeachment against Trump, were being “sore winners” and said there were not enough Republicans who would vote to convict him.

“Why are we doing this?” he added.

Only three Republicans were on the Senate floor Monday evening when the House managers arrived to deliver the article of impeachment: McConnell, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas.

“President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the lead impeachment manager, said on the Senate floor, reading the article. “He threatened the integrity of the Democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power and imperiled a coequal branch of government.”

Advertisement

Senior GOP officials said they expected at least one Senate Republican to move to dismiss the charge against Trump quickly, although such a vote would serve primarily as an early litmus test of how receptive certain GOP senators would be to arguments that Trump fomented the riot at the Capitol and that he should be permanently barred from public office because of it.

The party remains split over how fiercely to back Trump during the impeachment, with Republican Party committee members debating whether to pass a resolution on the former president’s behalf over a long email thread throughout the weekend. A number of them have been pushing for a formal resolution of support of the former president.

The sharp debate over whether to back the president and the resolution ended when Henry Barbour, a GOP committee member from Mississippi, asked the conversation to be taken offline, according to people familiar with the emails.

The next two weeks will give both the president’s lawyers, led by South Carolina attorney Butch Bowers, and the nine House impeachment managers time to prepare briefs and their legal arguments.

House Democrats have already pulled together an extensive outline of the case and the constitutional arguments intended to rebut arguments from some Republicans that a former president cannot be constitutionally impeached, according to the people familiar with the discussions.

One item of particular interest to impeachment managers is a 10-minute video released Monday by Just Security, an online forum hosted by the Reiss Center on Law and Security at New York University School of Law, which shows how Trump’s words were heard and interpreted by those who ransacked the Capitol, according to the people familiar with the managers’ trial preparations.

The House managers believe visuals are central in prosecuting the case against Trump, because the evidence is in plain sight and will remind senators of what they experienced that day, when the rioters got perilously close to lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence.

Democrats are collecting key video clips of the siege and will probably contract with an outside firm that will weave together the images as evidence to be presented to senators, according to the people with knowledge of the plan.

Any rules regarding whether videos can be submitted during the impeachment trial will probably be handled in an agreement between Senate Democrats and Republicans setting up the parameters of the proceedings in advance. If not, senators can later vote whether to admit video evidence, as well as witnesses.

The House managers are operating under the expectation that there will be an opportunity for video presentations, the people said.

Share this article Share

They are also deliberating the issue of presenting witnesses, including those who were caught up in the Capitol attack and those who may have interacted with Trump during the Jan. 6 riot and the days leading up to it. House Democrats have informally discussed with their Senate counterparts their desire to call witnesses during the trial, although — as with the video evidence — nothing has been finalized.

The prospect that footage of Trump could be used as evidence against him is a marked contrast with his first impeachment trial, when Democrats were forced to call a parade of witnesses to testify before a House committee — and then featured clips of their public testimony in the Senate.

In that trial, the case they sought to make, that Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress in pressuring Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his family, hinged on testimony about actions that occurred largely behind the scenes.

But this time, much of the evidence is in the public sphere, and Democrats say the senators themselves are effectively witnesses, having lived through the violent siege at the Capitol themselves.

Raskin, an expert in constitutional law and the lead impeachment manager, will also make the Democrats’ case to senators that it is constitutional to impeach a president even if he is no longer in office, according to a person briefed on the strategy.

Democrats and some Republicans, such as Romney, have said they believe a former president can be impeached. But other GOP senators who were infuriated by Trump’s conduct but nonetheless do not feel compelled to convict a president who is no longer in office have suggested the move may not be constitutional.

“It makes no sense whatsoever that a president or any official could commit a heinous crime against our country and then defeat Congress’s impeachment powers by simply resigning so as to avoid accountability and a vote to disqualify them from future office,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said.

John Bolton, the former Trump national security adviser who emerged as a vocal critic of the former president, savagely criticized the idea of a Senate impeachment trial Monday in a piece in the conservative outlet National Review, saying the exercise was ultimately impractical and would benefit Trump, not those who wish to see him banished from the national political stage.

“Like Impeachment 1.0, the 2021 edition is badly conceived, poorly executed, and likely to produce precisely what the first round did: results 180 degrees contrary to the objectives that impeachment supporters say they want,” Bolton wrote in the conservative publication.

Now ensconced at his private club in southern Florida, the former president is continuing to cobble together his legal and public relations team, which will differ significantly from the formal White House apparatus that surrounded him in his first impeachment trial last year. Trump is expected to stay in Florida during the trial, according to an adviser.

Jason Miller, who has served as a Trump senior adviser in both his presidential bids, is handling much of the communications work for impeachment, and the former president has asked a coterie of House Freedom Caucus members to flood the airwaves to defend him.

Trump’s team is planning to circulate additional polling in the coming days, paid for by his PAC, to warn Republican senators of the political consequences of voting to convict him.

Graham said he has reassured Trump that he will not be convicted and that it was a simple case.

“He’s thinking about the trial and decompressing,” Graham said. “I think he appreciates having some of the extra time he didn’t have in the past.”

Bowers, a longtime South Carolina GOP lawyer whom Graham connected with Trump, did not respond to requests for comment.

Graham and others said the president was likely to expand his legal team, but many of his longtime lawyers, including Jay Sekulow, Pat Cipollone and Rudy Giuliani, are either uninterested or not involved.

Sekulow, Cipollone and Giuliani did not return requests for comment.

In another difference from last year’s trial, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. is not expected to preside over next month’s proceedings and in his place will be Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), the president pro tempore and the most senior Democrat in the Senate, according to an official familiar with the matter.

The Constitution calls for the chief justice of the United States to preside over an impeachment trial for a sitting president. Otherwise, senators preside over proceedings for any official who is not in the White House, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the process.

Leahy’s role, first reported by CNN, began sparking some pushback from some of Trump’s conservative allies who argued that not having the chief justice preside delegitimizes the trial, although he doesn’t appear to be constitutionally required to do so because Trump is not the current president.

“If Chief Justice Roberts can’t be bothered to come over for the so-called impeachment, makes you wonder if this exercise is constitutional at all,” tweeted Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).

A Supreme Court spokeswoman said Roberts had no comment on whether he declined entreaties to preside over Trump’s second impeachment trial. But Leahy defended his ability to be impartial in his presiding duties, which are largely ceremonial anyway.

“I’m not presenting the evidence. I am making sure that procedures are followed,” Leahy told reporters Monday. “I don’t think there’s any senator who — over the 40-plus years I’ve been here — that would say that I am anything but impartial in voting on procedure.”"

Meanwhile, the fractures within the Republican Party were evident Sunday as GOP senators appeared split over whether it was constitutional to hold an impeachment trial for a president who had already left office. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), one of Trump’s most outspoken GOP critics, stopped short of saying he would vote to convict Trump, while Republican allies of the former president continued to argue that an impeachment trial should be abandoned for the sake of “unity.”

Members of the Republican National Committee also were in a heated debate over the weekend on how to respond to impeachment — and how fiercely to defend Trump, who maintains support among a majority of the 168 committee members, party officials and members said.

House impeachment managers are planning to send an article of impeachment to the Senate on Monday, alleging “incitement of insurrection” after a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in a violent riot that left a Capitol Police officer and four others dead. On Friday, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced that the second impeachment trial will start Feb. 9 after reaching a deal with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that will allow the Senate to focus on President Biden’s agenda and also for Trump to put together a defense.

When asked whether the trial’s two-week delay would cost Democrats the little Republican support they had for impeachment, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) balked and said the events of Jan. 6 went far beyond the many other norms Trump had broken in office.

“I can’t imagine how Republican opposition to insurrection would fade over the space of a couple of weeks,” Warren said on CNN’s “Inside Politics” on Sunday. “We’re talking about a president who stood in front of a mob and told them to go to the Capitol and invade, told them to go to the Capitol and stop the lawful business of government so that he could try to stay in the White House. That is so fundamentally wrong. . . . We need accountability, accountability for Donald Trump and accountability for everyone who participated in that insurrection.”

Romney, who clashed frequently with Trump, said there was a “preponderance” of legal opinions that supported moving forward with a trial even though Trump’s term is finished. He said he hoped the impeachment process would be over quickly.

Romney did not say whether he would vote to convict Trump, but he did say “there’s no question” that the article prepared by the House suggests impeachable conduct. He said he wanted to hear the president’s defense before deciding.

“It is pretty clear that over the last year, there has been an effort to corrupt the election in the United States, and it was not by President Biden, it was by President Trump,” Romney told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.”

Within his party, Romney was in the minority Sunday. Later on the same show, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called a second impeachment trial of Trump “stupid” and “bad for America.” On ABC’s “This Week,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) refused to say outright that the election was not stolen, echoing a number of other Republicans who have called for unity but refused to acknowledge that Biden won fairly, thereby perpetuating the falsehood that fueled the Capitol riots.

On “Meet the Press,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said whether Trump had committed an impeachable offense was a “moot point” because he is no longer president. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who has argued that holding a trial after the president left office is beyond the Senate’s constitutional authority, said on Fox News that “the more I talk to other Republican senators, the more they’re beginning to line up behind the position I announced a couple weeks ago.” He did not specify which senators.

Meanwhile, RNC member ­Demetra DeMonte of Illinois sent a mass email to dozens of RNC members praising Trump and urging the RNC chairwoman and others to embrace a resolution she drafted opposing impeachment.

In a recent interview, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told The Washington Post she opposed impeaching Trump. McDaniel declined to comment on the resolution.

But Bill Palatucci, a committee member from New Jersey and a close ally of former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, responded to the email, opposing the resolution. He said there was a constitutional argument that a trial could go forward.

“The RNC can best contribute to that healing process by acknowledging the role former president Trump played in the insurrection, condemn it and promise that we will do our best to make sure it never happens again,” Palatucci wrote.

A resolution, Palatucci said, could address whether a trial was in order, because there’s a constitutional argument for and against a trial.

Biden has largely refrained from weighing in on impeachment issues, though on Friday, he signaled an openness to delay the trial by two weeks so that the Senate could confirm more of his Cabinet nominees and take up his initial request of Congress: approval of a $1.9 trillion relief package to address the coronavirus pandemic and the economic fallout it has caused.

On ABC’s “This Week,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said she believed the Senate could juggle all those tasks at once — perhaps confirming nominees in the mornings, running the impeachment trial in the afternoons and passing legislation at night.

Klobuchar also argued that not only is the trial constitutional, but there is a legal remedy beyond simply removing Trump from office — in this case, barring Trump from holding office again if he is convicted. She cited a report from the New York Times that revealed the former president had considered a plan to oust the acting attorney general to install at the top of the Justice Department an official more open to pursuing the baseless allegations that the election had been rigged for Biden.

“I think we’re going to get more and more evidence over the next few weeks, as if it’s not enough that he sent an angry mob down the Mall to invade the Capitol, didn’t try to stop it and a police officer was killed,” Klobuchar told ABC News journalist George Stephanopoulos. “I don’t really know what else you need to know. The facts were there.”

Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), one of the House’s nine impeachment managers who essentially will serve as prosecutors during the Senate trial, said Sunday that the fact that 10 GOP House members voted for impeachment gave her hope that an increasing number of Republican senators will come to the same view.

“Ten was an historically high number,” Dean said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “I find that to be heartening.”

Dean declined to say whether the allegations against Trump will be expanded to include recent revelations that he may have tried to do more to overturn the election results, including having considered ousting the acting attorney general to install a Justice Department official sympathetic to Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of election fraud.

“I think you will see that we will put together a case that is so compelling because the facts and the law reveal what this president did,” Dean said. “I will not be previewing our strategy and our case. . . . We will put forward a very strong case for impeachment, for disqualification, for conviction.”

Asked how long she anticipated the Senate trial to last, Dean said she “would expect that it would go faster” than the Senate’s first impeachment trial of Trump last January, which ended in an acquittal after three weeks.

“Some people would like us to turn the page,” Dean said.

She then invoked Biden’s words on the eve of his inauguration in which he said that healing from the losses brought by the coronavirus requires people to remember.

“We must remember,” Dean said Sunday, “that this impeachment trial . . . [is] those first very powerful steps toward unity in our country moving forward.”"
1472,1472,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/01/21/gop-response-biden-speech-unity/,0,"President Biden declared in his inaugural address that our prospects for much-needed “unity” are threatened by various political forces. Among them, he said, are racism, nativism, political extremism, white supremacy and domestic terrorism. Republicans promptly decided that in condemning those things, Biden was actually talking about them. Republican officials and their media allies are now widely condemning these words as an attack on themselves and their voters. The obvious trick is to game the media into saying Biden is already reneging on his unity promise by being divisive.

But there’s a deeper ploy here. With this new fake outrage fest, Republicans are working to reframe the national debate over how to repair the damage done during Donald Trump’s presidency on terms favorable to them.

This reframing is designed to bury their own culpability for the injuries they inflicted by actively enabling Trump and by deliberately harnessing the destructive forces he unleashed toward their own instrumental ends.

“If you read his speech and listen to it carefully, much of it is thinly veiled innuendo calling us white supremacists, calling us racists, calling us every name in the book, calling us people who don’t tell the truth,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) whined to Fox News.

“The next four years will be about shaming, blaming and cancelling until diversity of thought is completely extinguished,” complained the chairwoman of the Minnesota GOP.

“As long as you agree with radical progressives, you will be tolerated,” raged one House Republican about Biden’s speech, adding that it was about “coercing” conservatives to agree with the left or get “canceled.”

Meanwhile, as Matt Gertz documents, this argument is plastered all over Fox News programming. As Tucker Carlson dissected Biden’s speech, a chyron blared: “PARTY IN POWER IS DEMONIZING HALF OF THE COUNTRY.”

Carlson purported to justify this with a convoluted argument: Because Biden claimed we must “defeat” extremism, white supremacism and domestic terrorism, he’s actually pledging to “wage war” (Carlson’s words) against a broader segment of the population, and Biden is being cagey about who that includes.

The real reason for GOP rage

Let’s talk about the real reason for all this anger. It’s because Biden placed the primary blame for our recent breakdown precisely where it belongs: On right-wing extremism.

Biden did state clearly that unity requires “the defeat” of “political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism.” As it happens, intelligence services agree that violent white supremacy is “the most persistent and lethal threat” facing the homeland, and that Trump’s lie about the election’s illegitimacy threatens to incite more extremist violence going forward.

To be clear, this cannot mean intelligence or law enforcement is used in any way to denigrate or target legitimate right-wing political activity. Such overreach is a genuine danger with a long history in this country. We need to draw a hard line against it and not let that line get fuzzy.

But Biden is absolutely correct in saying that the primary threat to unity in this country — to civic peace, to democratic coexistence, to mutual acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the opposition — is the bundle of right-wing movements he described.

The problem is right-wing extremism

Right-wing extremism is responsible for the crisis we all just lived through. Full stop. This is not to say left-wing extremism is never a problem or that the protests over the summer didn’t get violent at times.

Rather, it’s to say that our post-election cataclysm was entirely driven by a war on democracy waged entirely by the right. The sentiments unleashed and harnessed for this purpose dramatically dwarf anything we’ve seen recently on the left.

Republicans want to cast our problem as one of generalized division. In fact, it’s that anti-democracy forces have waged sustained warfare, sometimes violent, on pro-democracy ones.

Republicans want to make all this disappear, precisely because many of them actively encouraged and fed all those sentiments. This does not mean they are directly to blame for the violent storming of the Capitol. But it does mean they bear culpability for feeding the authoritarian and democracy-despising impulses that drove the assault.

Large swaths of the GOP spent months feeding the lie that the election’s outcome was illegitimate. They stood by while Trump whipped up his supporters into believing that delusion and tried to corruptly strong-arm officials into helping him steal the election. After the assault, more than 100 congressional Republicans voted to overturn the results.

It’s telling that Republicans who have correctly identified the true nature of Trump’s assault on democracy liked Biden’s speech. Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) declared that Biden’s speech was “very much needed” in terms of getting us to “come together” by stating “enduring American principles.”

In other words, Biden was right to finger right-wing extremism as the primary cause of dragging us to the brink.

This is exactly what Republicans (unlike Romney) who actively enabled and encouraged all that right-wing extremism cannot admit. Because this admission blows back on them.

We don’t have to play this game

Their game now is to extort a price in exchange for agreeing that Biden is actually pursuing unity. That price is that Democrats must refrain from holding them accountable for all they’ve done to feed the impulses that threatened to tear the country apart.

Republicans now think they can exploit a tendency in press coverage to place the entire onus of “unity” on Biden. The president promised unity, but he hasn’t soothed Republicans, who say he’s being divisive. Why can’t he deliver unity?

We are not required to play this game. Biden may or may not succeed in securing “unity.” But Republicans don’t get to unilaterally dictate in advance what counts as a true attempt to achieve it."

Obama on Tuesday surrounded himself with firefighters and other first responders at the White House, where he said Republicans would be at fault if the spending reductions take effect and cost the jobs of emergency personnel. The campaign-style event marked the beginning of what aides described as an intensifying push to pressure Congress to postpone the cuts — or to blame Republicans in Congress if it doesn't.

Republicans fought back by seeking to portray Obama as the mastermind of the spending reductions, known as the sequester, thereby making him responsible for any damage they cause to the military and the economy.

The escalating efforts are a reflection of how crucial the sequester has become in the long-running debate over the size and scope of the federal government.

No matter how the idea came about, the $1.2 trillion in cuts to defense and domestic spending will nevertheless serve as a high-profile test of the deep reductions in federal spending that have been a hallmark of Republican economic thinking for years.

You’ve heard the word “sequester” mentioned by politicians a lot lately. The Washington Post’s Ed O’Keefe explains what the term means, and why it matters. (Video: The Washington Post)

If the cuts are instituted and Americans do not see them as a major problem, that could serve as an affirmation of the GOP view that the government is unnecessarily big and a hindrance to private-sector growth. If there is a significant backlash, public sentiment is likely to shift toward the Democrats, who generally see the government as a positive force.

The sequester is the result of a summer 2011 deal between Obama and Congress that was designed to be so distasteful that it would compel lawmakers to agree on a broader framework to tame federal borrowing.

That hasn’t happened. And with no recent communication between the White House and congressional Republicans, much of Washington seems resigned to the cuts taking effect March 1.

The deal requires the government to dramatically trim spending on a wide range of domestic programs, including education as well as research and development. It would lead to the furlough of thousands of workers, officials say. And it would also sharply reduce spending at the Pentagon — a prospect that would help stabilize the federal debt over the next decade but that also creates deep anxiety among military leaders.

Macroeconomic Advisers, an independent economic group, said Tuesday that sequestration would cost 700,000 jobs and push the unemployment rate a quarter of a percentage point higher than it otherwise would have been.

The group said in its analysis that the cuts would be a significant economic hit, given that taxes have already gone up this year and “with the economy still struggling to overcome the legacy of the Great Recession.”

Obama said he prefers to delay the sequester through the end of the year by trimming other spending, such as farm subsidies, and raising more money by limiting breaks and loopholes that favor top earners and select industries, such as oil and gas companies.

“So far, at least, the ideas that the Republicans have proposed ask nothing of the wealthiest Americans or biggest corporations, so the burden is all on first responders or seniors or middle-class families,” Obama said Tuesday. “They double down, in fact, on the harsh, harmful cuts.”

Senior administration officials say they have the upper hand in the debate because Americans have shown their broad support, in polls and at the voting booth, for asking the wealthy to pay higher taxes rather than just cutting government services.

“So now Republicans in Congress face a simple choice,” Obama said Tuesday. “Are they willing to compromise to protect vital investments in education and health care and national security and all the jobs that depend on them? Or would they rather put hundreds of thousands of jobs and our entire economy at risk just to protect a few special-interest tax loopholes that benefit only the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations?”

Leading Republicans, however, were pointing the finger directly at the president.

""The president offered no credible plan that can pass Congress — only more calls for higher taxes,"" House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said Tuesday. ""Washington Democrats' newfound concern about the president's sequester is appreciated, but words alone won't avert it.""

Republicans believe they are well positioned because Obama needs their support to avoid the spending cuts, which are set to happen automatically, and they believe Obama will be blamed for the negative effects.

“Today, just 10 days prior to the implementation of these draconian cuts, the President held another campaign event to blame ­Republicans for sequestration, which was actually his idea in the first place,” they said in a joint statement. “This country needs a Commander-in-Chief, not a Campaigner-in-Chief.”

Time is running short to stop the sequester, with lawmakers not planning to return to Washington until Monday.

Republicans say more taxes are out of the question, while administration officials said Tuesday that they could not imagine a compromise that does not open the door to higher taxes on the wealthy.

""Senate Republicans are going to have to spend this week explaining to their constituents why they would rather see sequestration hit than support the Democrats' bill to replace it with a balanced mix of responsible spending cuts and new revenue from the wealthiest Americans,"" said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.

Over the long term, Obama wants to replace the sequester with cuts to Medicare and other mandatory spending programs and hundreds of billions of dollars in new tax revenue achieved through limiting deductions benefiting wealthy Americans and corporations.

Republicans favor a plan that would trim domestic and mandatory spending while largely sparing defense spending. Republicans want to limit deductions through an overhaul of the tax code, too, but they want to use any new tax revenue generated through that process to lower tax rates."
1496,1496,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/01/11/maya-kamala-harris-sister/?arc404=true,0,"This story has been updated from an earlier published version.

Finding people to trust in politics — a field full of mercenaries with their own interests at heart — can be a tough thing to do. It is no wonder so many people turn to family members: John F. Kennedy had Bobby, Joe Biden’s sister, Valerie, once ran his campaigns and Ivanka Trump has been one of the 45th president’s most visible advisers.

Kamala D. Harris has her younger sister, Maya Harris. The two are not only extremely close; during Kamala’s year-long presidential run, Maya served as her campaign chairwoman.

It is a job she for which she was uniquely qualified: She had been a senior adviser for Hillary Clinton in 2016, knows her sister better than anyone else and, professionally, is something of a yin to Kamala’s yang.

The partnership, however, did not yield the desired results, and Harris dropped out of the primary months before any votes were cast. Now, Maya Harris is stepping back from her sister’s career — at least officially, at least for now.

She has been far less visible in her sister’s public life since the elder Harris was named to the Democratic ticket in mid-August. Aides to the Vice President-elect have gone out of their way to emphasize that Maya will have no official role in the Biden-Harris administration, and Maya hopes to remove herself from the spotlight — in part to avoid even the tiniest semblance of the nepotism that defined the Trump era.

But many who have known the Harris sisters for years chuckle politely at the notion that Maya would ever be out of the loop. She has been a constant companion along Kamala Harris’s journey into history, the most trusted confidante of a political climber known to be slow to trust and hard to impress.

For that reason, Maya’s position at the top of Kamala’s presidential campaign became, at times, a complicating factor. Multiple campaign aides said later that, because of the close family connection, few ventured to speak up when they disagreed, which they did — particularly on the question of how the longtime prosecutor should handle critiques of her criminal justice record.

While Kamala came up through politics as a law enforcement official — district attorney and then California’s attorney general — Maya, 53, had been at the forefront of criminal justice reform: as a leader at the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, as a vice president at the Ford Foundation, helping edit her friend Michelle Alexander’s seminal book about mass incarceration, “The New Jim Crow.”

In Maya’s line of work, prosecutors were often seen as the opposition. They were gatekeepers of an unjust system that locked up people of color in disproportionate numbers, lawyers who often cared more about their conviction rate than actual justice.

When it came time to address Kamala’s prosecutorial record in her presidential campaign, Maya favored acknowledging things her sister would do differently now. Harris’s longtime California-based political advisers, meanwhile, believed the former attorney general’s record was a key part of her presidential pitch. They did not want her to undermine it.

Ultimately, Harris tried both strategies as her campaign struggled to forge a clear identity throughout the primary. Donors started showing concern about her ability to distinguish herself from the field and looked elsewhere. Soon, money grew short and a campaign that began with one of the biggest crowds of the 2020 presidential cycle ended two months before the Iowa caucuses.

A close childhood

The Harris sisters do not look all that much alike. Kamala resembles their father: taller and angular; where Maya has the softer features of their late mother, who clocked in at 5-foot-1. But the sisters share a contagious, body-shaking laugh so similar that strangers often guess they are related.

Their father, Donald, was a Stanford economics professor from Jamaica, and their mother, Shyamala, was a scientist from India. They split when the sisters were young, after which it was mostly just “Shyamala and the girls,” and sometimes, when Shyamala had to travel for work, it was just the girls. (Shyamala died in 2009.)

When feasible, Kamala and Maya would tag along to their mother’s conferences, getting the run of the place in hotels around the world. Other times, Shyamala would travel without them, leaving the girls under the care of neighbors they considered family.

When the girls were 12 and 9, Shyamala accepted a job at McGill University, moved the family to Montreal and enrolled Kamala and Maya in a neighborhood school where everyone spoke French except for them. They remember the Mayflower truck coming to move their belongings across the continent; they remember arriving at their apartment and hiding from the cold in the closet; and they remember how their relationship further solidified in a place where no one else spoke their language.

“We leaned on each other,” Kamala said in an interview last year. “We forged a bond that is unbreakable. When I think about it, all of the joyous moments in our lives, all of the challenging moments, all of the moments of transition, we have always been together.”

Almost always, anyway.

Kamala graduated from high school and went to Howard University in Washington. She immersed herself in the campus political scene, running for student government and protesting apartheid outside of the South African Embassy with fellow students. Big things were happening in the world, and Kamala wanted to be a part of it.

With Kamala at Howard, Maya moved back to the Bay Area. Her mother technically moved back, too, but still had work in Montreal, which meant at times Maya lived alone among their community of honorary aunts, uncles and cousins.

“If the alarm went off at the house, she’d call me,” said Peter Monroe, who lived nearby. “Her mother instructed me to keep the boys from chasing after Maya.”

Maya’s transition was easy enough. She was pretty (best-looking, according to her graduating yearbook), got stellar grades and was popular. So no one seemed to notice anything was up as she made her way through senior year wearing bigger and chunkier sweatshirts (it was, after all, the ’80s).

“Nobody knew she was pregnant until she was about eight or nine months,” recalled Judy Robinson, a close friend whose mother used to take care of the Harris sisters when Shyamala was away. Maya graduated from high school with honors at 17, in her second trimester, while keeping a secret that even her closest friends did not know about.

“I remember Shyamala saying she cried for about four days,” Robinson said. “She cried for the fact that she was not there, that Maya went through this on her own without her.”

Maya does not talk about this part of her life. Not the pregnancy. Not who the father was (other than to say he was never really in the picture). Not whom she kept the secret from nor for how long.

She will talk about what came next: the birth of her daughter, Meena, now 36 (also a lawyer and civil rights activist); her mother helping babysit while she finished college on time; the handsome law school friend and future husband, Tony West (now Uber’s chief legal officer), who would help look after Meena at Stanford; the fact that her daughter and sister always had a “special relationship.”

When asked to talk about what it was like to be pregnant at 17, she politely dodges the question: “For me,” she says, “it’s always about pushing forward, never really looking back.”

When asked about how Kamala found out and what her reaction was, both sisters declined to comment.

Together, differently

Maya has been with Kamala every step along her professional and political road. She worked on her first campaign, to be San Francisco’s district attorney, and spoke at her inauguration in 2004. “Given all my lefty friends,” she said then, “it still amazes me that this ACLU lawyer ended up with a sister — and a husband — who both became prosecutors.” She joked about the possibility of awkward Thanksgiving dinners with “the ACLU lawyer on one end of the table and the district attorney at the other.”

Fifteen years later, Maya quit her job as an MSNBC analyst to volunteer for her sister’s presidential run. (“She’s invaluable,” Kamala said back then. “There’s no amount of money I can pay her, so I pay her no amount of money.”)

But Kamala’s most invaluable adviser will serve a far different role as her sister steps into the vice presidency. Maya Harris has been stationed in New York, quarantining through the pandemic and offering support for the Biden-Harris ticket from afar. In April, Maya published an article in the Atlantic about her experience with lupus, an autoimmune disease she has been battling since her early 20s.

She hosted a few remote events for the Biden-Harris campaign during the run-up to the general election. She was present the night Biden and Harris declared victory in Wilmington, Del.

Otherwise, she has slid out of the spotlight. But she remains one of her sister’s most outspoken advocates on Twitter. Her daughter, Meena, has become a go-to social media follow for devotees of the second-family-in-waiting — a close-knit cohort of which Maya has always been in the center. After all, when Kamala married Doug Emhoff in 2014 at the Santa Barbara courthouse, Maya officiated the ceremony.

She even helped write the vows."
1504,1504,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/01/28/covid-vaccine-variant-south-africa/,0,"A coronavirus vaccine made by Maryland biotech company Novavax proved effective at stopping symptomatic infections in global hot spots where concerning variants are dominant, the company announced Thursday. But warning signs lurked amid those findings: The protective effect of the vaccine was substantially muted in South Africa, where a worrisome virus variant is in wide circulation.

The data, presented by a company news release, is ominous news for other vaccine developers. They have been scrambling to determine whether current vaccines would remain effective against the variant found in South Africa and are designing new versions in case the virus can break through the protection provided by the shot. The data is the first, highly anticipated evidence of how well a vaccine performs against variants that have drawn global concern.

The company also noted that a third of the participants in its South African trial appeared to have already been infected with the original strain of coronavirus, based on antibodies in their blood when they were vaccinated. Some of those people became infected again, according to the company, suggesting natural immunity generated by an infection might not fully protect against the new variant.

“The South African variant is looking like it’s going to be a far more complicating factor than we had hoped,” said Peter Jay Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Hotez is developing a different coronavirus vaccine and said his team has already designed one against the South African variant.

In a United Kingdom trial, where the B.1.1.7 variant has become dominant, the vaccine was 89 percent effective, and about half the infections were with the variant.

In a smaller and less definitive South African trial, where nearly all the participants who got sick were infected with the variant first identified in that nation, the vaccine was 49 percent effective. But the company underscored that when looking only at people not infected with HIV, the efficacy was 60 percent.

“I think the constructs for all current vaccines are similar; thus, I will expect similar results,” said David Ho, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University.

Laboratory tests had suggested that the immune response elicited by vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech would be diminished against the variant first identified in South Africa. A 49 percent effective vaccine against a particularly difficult variant could still hold merit — the Food and Drug Administration had drawn the line for efficacy at 50 percent — but it clearly speeds up the urgency in developing a vaccine targeting the variant.

“It really signals that we really can’t take it for granted that these vaccines will work as well against all variants and that we need to really have systems in place that allow us to monitor them, just like how we monitor [to make] flu vaccine every year,” said Natalie Dean, an epidemiologist at the University of Florida.

Novavax began developing a new version of its vaccine targeting the South African variant in January and expects to select a design and begin small-scale production within weeks, chief executive Stanley Erck said, with trials to begin in the second half of the year. Novavax is one of the vaccines supported by the American government, including $1.6 billion for clinical development and a pre-purchase of 100 million doses. A large Phase 3 trial is ongoing in North America.

“The 60 percent reduced risk against COVID-19 illness in vaccinated individuals in South Africans underscores the value of this vaccine to prevent illness from the highly worrisome variant currently circulating in South Africa, and which is spreading globally,” said Shabir Maddi, executive director of the Vaccines and Infectious Diseases Analytics Research Unit at Wits University and a principal investigator in the Novavax coronavirus vaccine trial in South Africa.

“This is the first COVID-19 vaccine for which we now have objective evidence that it protects against the variant dominating in South Africa,” Maddi said in a statement."
1547,1547,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/gamestop-sec-regulation/,0,"Long before an army of small investors buying shares of GameStop shocked Wall Street, regulators saw the need for a clearer, real-time view of the trillions of dollars that sloshed through the markets each day. In May 2010, a trader in London using an algorithm to manipulate a futures market helped trigger a chain reaction that wiped 9 percent off the Dow Jones industrial average in minutes. The market quickly recovered. But that “flash crash” underscored regulators’ urgent need for a tool that would allow them to pinpoint who was buying and selling what securities down to the millisecond, equipping them to monitor a business already transformed by the explosion of computerized trading.

More than a decade later, industry resistance and bureaucratic snags have conspired to leave that database — known as the Consolidated Audit Trail — years behind schedule and a shell of what regulators originally envisioned, advocates of stronger financial oversight say.

Now, the system’s limitations will make it harder for Wall Street’s Washington minders to make quick sense of the turmoil still rocking the markets. Amid the GameStop furor, regulators face a growing list of questions over the potential use of social media to manipulate stock trading; the adequacy of online brokers’ capital reserves; and the need for hedge funds to disclose more about their holdings.

“Understanding the sequence of events will be very hard to do, and it would have been relatively easy if the CAT [consolidated audit trail] was up and running,” says Tyler Gellasch, founder of the nonprofit Healthy Markets Association and a former Securities and Exchange Commission counsel. He said it points to the agency’s disappointing track record. “The smart bet on the SEC historically has been, name the issue, and the response will be muted.”

The SEC declined to comment. A spokesperson for the CAT’s operating committee said it is “not a shell and it is being built exactly to what the SEC has mandated, with no decrease in its scope. It is currently being built and will not include all customer data until July of 2022.”

Regulators aren’t waiting for an authoritative timeline of the market frenzy apparently initiated by amateur traders organizing on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets. As soon as Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is convening leaders of the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to review the matter.

Yellen requested a “discussion of recent volatility in financial markets and whether recent activities are consistent with investor protection and fair and efficient markets,” Treasury spokeswoman Alexandra LaManna said in a statement.

Regulators face questions about whether the apparently amateur trading crowd’s activities amounted to illegal market manipulation — and if sophisticated professionals used the cloak of online anonymity to stoke the frenzy. The SEC already is sifting through social media and message boards for evidence of such efforts, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday.

But beyond nabbing any wrongdoers, those who set and enforce market rules are considering a wide array of issues raised by the emergence of retail traders as a powerful force. Possible responses range from the practical — barring online brokers from selling their customers’ orders to giant Wall Street firms — to the philosophical. Some are calling for a wholesale rethinking of a system they say operates more like a casino than an efficient machine for redistributing capital.

“The best mathematicians in America are trying to beat the other best mathematicians to a stock trade by a millionth of a second,” said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), chair of the House Financial Services subcommittee on investor protection, entrepreneurship and capital markets. “I’d like to see our capital markets be a place for investing because you think a company is going to do well, and where companies can raise the capital they need to create jobs. Instead you have high-frequency trading, whose social utility is hard to identify, consuming enormous intellectual resources, and I don’t know with what purpose.”

The full House committee will consider the issue at a Feb. 18 hearing. House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said she is still finalizing the witness list for the hearing and aims for it to shed light on “exactly what happened.” She said she wants to hear from Reddit, Robinhood, GameStop and “some of the hedge funds.” She said a legislative response isn’t imminent. “I think we have a long way to go.”

The Senate Banking Committee has announced its own hearing, though no date has been set. And its as-yet-unscheduled confirmation hearing for Gary Gensler, President Biden’s pick to head the SEC, will focus at least in part on how he intends to address the matter.

Allison Herren Lee, the agency’s acting chair, said her first priority is looking into the decision-making by Robinhood and other online trading platforms, which caused an uproar last week when they limited trading in GameStop and other stocks that retail investors had sent soaring. In an interview Monday with NPR, Lee said the SEC wants to ensure those decisions are “compliant with regulations, that they’re transparent to their customers and that they’re consistently and fairly applied.”

Hedge funds — a number of which suffered billions of dollars in losses from taking short positions against stocks that retail traders bought up — also face greater scrutiny. Waters said in a statement their “unethical conduct directly led to the recent market volatility.” And Sherman and others have called for more disclosures from hedge funds, including their short positions, and potentially higher capital requirements.

The industry is primed to fight back. “Short sellers conduct in-depth research and analysis that can expose financial fraud and corruption,” said Bryan Corbett, who leads the Managed Funds Association, the industry’s lobbying group. “This is a highly regulated activity through both the SEC and [the Commodity Futures Trading Commission], and existing frameworks provide abundant protection for the markets and all investors.”

The GameStop mania is not the first time the SEC has probed the link between the Internet and securities fraud. But the market watchdog has lagged in policing the use of social media and other new technologies in the financial markets, a deficiency that could hamper efforts to unravel the GameStop episode, according to Joshua Mitts, an associate professor at Columbia Law School.

“They’re really behind the curve,” Mitts said. “The SEC isn’t really stepping in and saying, ‘These are the rules of the road on social media.’”

Share this article Share

The commission in recent years has made greater use of advanced data analytics to detect cases of insider trading and accounting and disclosure violations. But the SEC’s enforcement division remains heavily populated by securities law experts and lacks the data science specialists needed to combat market manipulation cases executed via social media, Mitts said.

“The average SEC enforcement person is a lawyer who probably hasn’t done much with data,” Mitts said. “They need data scientists.”

More than two decades ago, as the 1990s tech bubble was drawing to a close, the commission pursued several cases involving alleged securities fraud involving the use of digital tools.

Any GameStop investigation will probably share similarities with those earlier Internet-era cases, according to John Stark, the first head of the SEC’s office of Internet enforcement. Many involved scam artists posting false or misleading information on websites in a bid to drive up the price of selected stocks.

In the GameStop case, which has seen an army of retail investors enthusiastically posting about the video game retailer’s shares, individuals who were paid to post about the stock and had not disclosed that fact could be vulnerable to manipulation charges, Stark said. But given the volume of postings on r/WallStreetBets, which has 8.4 million members, sifting the evidence will be a daunting task.

Along with countless Reddit postings, investigators also will confront a potential avalanche of tips submitted by members of the public through an online SEC form.

“I’m confident the SEC enforcement staff will get to the bottom of it if manipulation occurred. But it will be difficult to prove,” said Stark.

After the tech bubble burst in 2000, with the Nasdaq index losing more than half of its value, SEC officials pursued a number of fraud cases involving the use of the Internet to goose stock prices.

In 2002, the SEC reached a settlement of civil charges with Cole Bartiromo, a high school student who had engaged in an Internet “pump-and-dump scheme.” Bartiromo, then 17, manipulated the stock prices of 15 companies by buying up large numbers of shares and then posting “false and misleading information” about them on Yahoo! Finance and Raging Bull message boards, the commission alleged.

Over less than two months, Bartiromo posted more than 6,000 messages claiming news of imminent merger deals or buyouts, which he falsely attributed to sources such as Bloomberg and JP Morgan. In the case of one over-the-counter stock that Bartiromo claimed was headed to $10 per share, he sold his entire stake for less than 25 cents, the SEC told a federal district judge in Manhattan.

The settlement required Bartiromo to disgorge $93,731 in illicit gains and interest.

Two years earlier, the commission settled civil fraud charges against an even younger Internet tout. High school sophomore Jonathan Lebed, then 15, without admitting or denying the charges, agreed to pay the government $285,000 in ill-gotten gains and interest, the commission said.

On 11 occasions, Lebed purchased shares in thinly traded small companies, then used multiple phony names to post “baseless price predictions and other false and/or misleading statements,” the SEC said.

Lebed posted claims that a $2 stock would soon trade for $20 or that a stock would be the next “to gain 1000 percent,” the commission said. He often set automatic sell orders with his broker to “ensure that he would not miss the price increase of the stock while he was in school the next day,” the commission said.

“I implore investors to be highly skeptical of any advice they receive from the Internet. People should do thorough research before making investment decisions and verify all information before acting on it,” Ronald C. Long, administrator of the SEC’s regional office in Philadelphia, who led the probe, said at the time.

In 1999, the SEC filed a civil complaint alleging that four Southern California men had joined in a scheme to manipulate the stock of a bankrupt commercial printer company by spreading phony takeover rumors on the Web.

Over a November weekend, working in a library at the University of California at Los Angeles, the three created numerous accounts on Internet message boards and posted messages falsely claiming that NEI Webworld would be acquired by LGC Wireless, a privately held telecommunications company.

The rumors, which were fabricated, drove NEIP’s share price from 13 cents on a Friday to more than $15 by the following Monday, according to the SEC complaint, giving the men a profit of about $364,000."

In the most detailed account of the ramifications of across-the-board cuts, called the sequester, Defense Department officials said civilian personnel could be put on leave one day a week for 22 weeks — effectively cutting their pay by 20 percent for nearly six months. According to the Office of Personnel Management, 107,000 of these workers live in the District, Maryland and Virginia.

The nation’s two senior national security officials, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta and Secretary of State John F. Kerry, said Wednesday that the reductions would hurt the nation’s global standing.

“There is no mistaking that the rigid nature of the cuts forced upon this department, and their scale, will result in a serious erosion of readiness across the force,” Panetta told employees in a memo.

The Pentagon announcement sparked fresh partisan sniping, with Republicans insisting that it is President Obama's responsibility to prevent the defense cuts from taking effect.

“As the commander-in-chief, President Obama is ultimately responsible for our military readiness, so it’s fair to ask: what is he doing to stop his sequester that would ‘hollow out’ our Armed Forces?” House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) said in a statement.

Obama, on the other hand, continued his efforts to pressure GOP lawmakers to embrace his proposed fix for the sequester, sitting for eight interviews with handpicked television stations in states that would be hit hard by reductions.

“There’s a better way to do it than this,” Obama told Boston’s WCVB, an ABC affiliate. “But the key is for [Republicans] to go ahead to put forward a balanced, responsible approach that will avoid cuts to things like Head Start programs, medical programs, help for the mentally ill, all these things that have an impact on people’s day-to-day lives.”

The interviews were part of an intensifying push by the president to persuade lawmakers to pass a short-term measure delaying the start of the sequester, which cuts $85 billion in federal spending this year and $1.2 trillion over the next decade.

A report this week by economists at Wells Fargo Securities said Maryland, Virginia and the District — in addition to Hawaii and Alaska — are the places that are likely to be most hurt by the sequester. Federal spending represents about 20 percent of economic activity in those three local jurisdictions — higher than anywhere else in the country, the economists said.

Defense Comptroller Robert F. Hale told reporters Wednesday that $1.1 billion out of $4.8 billion in civilian payroll cuts in fiscal 2013 will come from the paychecks of residents of the District, Maryland and Virginia.

The cuts also will have a “very substantial” impact on the private sector because of reductions in contract spending, Hale said, although he did not provide details. Uniformed personnel are exempt from the sequester.

Obama has backed a Democratic proposal to delay the scheduled reductions through the end of the year by adopting alternative spending cuts — largely by reducing expenditures on farm subsidies — and by limiting tax breaks that benefit the wealthy.

For the longer term, he favors raising new tax revenue from the wealthy and select industries and trimming spending on programs such as Medicare to generate savings. The steps would build on $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction already achieved through earlier deals.

Republicans say raising new tax revenue is out of the question and want to replace the defense part of the sequester with deeper cuts to other domestic programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Republicans also say the federal budget must be balanced within 10 years, which would require far greater cost-cutting than the sequester.

The Pentagon memo was the latest in a long line of warnings about potential furloughs, which would not start until April because of a required notice period. Many details of who would be furloughed, on what days and for how long would be subject to bargaining with public employee unions.

The 20 percent pay cut would hit civilian defense employees hard, union officials said.

“Taking away one day’s pay every week could mean the difference between covering the mortgage and putting food on the table,” said J. David Cox, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 270,000 civilian defense workers.

“It really scares the hell out of me,” said a Pentagon official who has worked for the government for more than 12 years.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter, said he is particularly worried about making ends meet this year. “It’s going to affect my retirement and now I have a new baby, so my expenses are going to go up with day care and formula and diapers and everything else.”

Dave Miller, a Pentagon intelligence analyst, said that “cutting salaries is like cutting people. It’s the lifeblood of the department.”

“Our younger folks are really going to be hurt by this significantly,” he said. “They just want to do their jobs.”

Pentagon chiefs have been warning in recent days that the reductions are likely to significantly weaken the readiness of a force reeling from the wear and tear of two long wars. If the budget is cut according to the congressional guidelines, by the end of the year, Hale said, two thirds of the Army’s brigade combat teams will be unfit for deployment.

“It could affect their ability to deploy to new contingencies that come up, or even, if it goes on long enough, to Afghanistan.”

Panetta held out hope in the memo that the cuts might be avoided. Even if a deal between the White House and Republicans doesn’t materialize by March 1, when the automatic cuts will take effect, the parties could reach an agreement that spares the Pentagon."

A top Justice Department lawyer, in a letter to the court, reversed the government’s position in a case argued last November and in which a decision has not been announced. While it is rare for the government to switch its position in a case, this change was expected, and this case could be the first of several before the high court in which Biden’s administration separates itself from positions held by former president Donald Trump.

Just as Trump vowed to demolish Obamacare, as former president Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement is known, Biden, who was Obama’s vice president, promised during the 2020 campaign to strengthen and build on the health-care law.

The court is considering a case brought by Republican-led states and endorsed by the Trump administration.

The issue is whether a 2017 decision by Congress to remove Obamacare’s penalty for not buying health insurance — what is called the individual mandate — meant that the requirement to purchase health insurance was itself unconstitutional. In 2012, the Supreme Court said the penalty was key to the law’s constitutionality and was a legitimate use of Congress’s taxing power.

The Trump administration argued that the elimination of the penalty made the mandate to purchase health insurance unconstitutional, and that the entire law, including such popular provisions as keeping young adults on their parents’ insurance policies and ensuring coverage for those with preexisting medical conditions, should fall.

But in the letter, Deputy Solicitor General Edwin S. Kneedler, a career department lawyer, said the government “no longer adheres” to that position.

“Rather than imposing a new burden on covered individuals, the 2017 amendment preserved the choice between lawful options and simply eliminated any financial or negative legal consequence from choosing not to enroll in health coverage,” Kneedler wrote.

Moreover, he said, even if the requirement to purchase health insurance is now questionable, the Supreme Court should stick to its usual course of action and retain as much of the rest of the Affordable Care Act as possible.

In this case, Kneedler noted, the same Congress that in 2017 reduced to zero the penalty for not securing insurance “simultaneously left in place the remainder of the ACA.”

It is unclear how much influence the government’s change might have on the court.

The arguments of the Republican states, led by Texas, and the Trump administration received a skeptical reception when the justices heard the case Nov. 10.

The court has a 6 to 3 conservative majority, but two of those on the right, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, said plainly during oral arguments that they doubted Congress’s actions indicated a desire for the entire law to fall.

When the Trump administration declined to defend the law, courts allowed Democratic-led states such as California and lawyers for the House of Representatives to step in. Kneedler said that because the Biden administration’s view of the case had been adequately advanced by those parties, there was no need for additional briefing."
1586,1586,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/01/technology-202-new-report-calls-conservative-claims-social-media-censorship-a-form-disinformation/,0,"with Aaron Schaffer A new report concludes that social networks aren't systematically biased against conservatives, directly contradicting Republican claims that social media companies are censoring them. Recent moves by Twitter and Facebook to suspend former president Donald Trump's accounts in the wake of the violence at the Capitol are inflaming conservatives' attacks on Silicon Valley. But New York University researchers today released a report stating claims of anti-conservative bias are “a form of disinformation: a falsehood with no reliable evidence to support it.”

The report found there is no trustworthy large-scale data to support these claims, and even anecdotal examples that tech companies are biased against conservatives “crumble under close examination.” The report's authors said, for instance, the companies' suspensions of Trump were “reasonable” given his repeated violation of their terms of service — and if anything, the companies took a hands-off approach for a long time given Trump's position.

The report also noted several data sets underscore the prominent place conservative influencers enjoy on social media. For instance, CrowdTangle data shows that right-leaning pages dominate the list of sources providing the most engaged-with posts containing links on Facebook. Conservative commentator Dan Bongino, for instance, far out-performed most major news organizations in the run-up to the 2020 election.

The report also cites an October 2020 study in which Politico found “right-wing social media influencers, conservative media outlets, and other GOP supporters” dominated the online discussion of Black Lives Matter and election fraud, two of the biggest issues in 2020. Working with the nonpartisan think tank Institute for Strategic Dialogue, researchers found users shared the most viral right-wing social media content about Black Lives Matter more than ten times as often as the most popular liberal posts on the topic. People also shared right-leaning claims on election fraud about twice as often as they shared liberals' or traditional media outlets' posts discussing the issue.

But even so, baseless claims of anti-conservative bias are driving Republicans' approach to regulating tech.

Republican lawmakers have concentrated their hearing exchanges with tech executives on the issue, and it's been driving their legislative proposals. That could complicate efforts in the new Congress to regulate social media companies — especially because the Democrats' razor-thin majority means bipartisan momentum is needed to make significant changes.

The New York University researchers called on Washington regulators to focus on what they called “the very real problems of social media.""

“Only by moving forward from these false claims can we begin to pursue that agenda in earnest,” Paul Barrett, the report's primary author and deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights said in a statement.

The researchers want the Biden administration to work with Congress to overhaul the tech industry.

Their recommendations focus particularly on changing Section 230, a decades-old law shielding tech companies from lawsuits for the photos, videos and posts people share on their websites. The law was a frequent target of Trump, who zeroed in on it after tech companies began labeling his posts and eventually suspended his accounts.

The researchers warn against completely repealing the law. Instead, they argue companies should only receive Section 230 immunity if they agree to accept more responsibilities in policing content such as disinformation and hate speech. The companies could be obligated to ensure their recommendation engines don't favor sensationalist content or unreliable material just to drive better user engagement.

“Social media companies that reject these responsibilities would forfeit Section 230’s protection and open themselves to costly litigation.” the report proposed.

The researchers also called for the creation of a new Digital Regulatory Agency, which would serve as an independent body and be tasked with enforcing a revised Section 230.

The report also suggested Biden could empower a “special commission” to work with the industry on improving content moderation, which would be able to move much more quickly than legal battles over antitrust issues. It also called for the president to expand the task force announced by Biden on online harassment to focus on a broad range of harmful content.

They also called for greater transparency in Silicon Valley.

The researchers said the platforms typically don't provide much justification for sanctioning an account or post, and when people are in the dark they assume the worst.

“The platforms should give an easily understood explanation every time they sanction a post or account, as well as a readily available means to appeal enforcement actions,” the report said. “Greater transparency—such as that which Twitter and Facebook offered when they took action against former President Trump in January— would help to defuse claims of political bias, while clarifying the boundaries of acceptable user conduct.”

Facebook executives knew about the prevalence of calls for violence in Groups.

In August, the company’s own data scientists warned that misinformation and calls for violence were common in the majority of the social media network’s civic groups, the Wall Street Journal’s Jeff Horwitz reports. The findings and the recent attack on the Capitol have led to an overhaul of a feature that Zuckerberg said was the new “heart of the app” in 2019.

About “70% of the top 100 most active US civic groups are considered non-recommendable for issues such as hate, misinfo, bullying and harassment,” an internal presentation concluded.

Facebook has said it will permanently keep political and civil groups out of recommendations, after initially saying such a change would just be temporary in the United States during the 2020 elections.

More than 2,000 U.S. police and fire departments have partnered with Amazon-owned doorbell-camera firm Ring.

The total number of partnerships — which allow officials to ask Ring owners in a given area for footage that might assist them in investigations — has more than doubled since last year, the Financial Times’s Dave Lee reports. But the company has been at the center of privacy and security controversies, raising concerns among privacy advocates of the risk of surveillance.

The number of formal law enforcement information requests, such as subpoenas and search warrants, that the company received last year more than doubled since 2019, from 737 to 1,900. But compliance has also dropped, with only 57 percent (down from 68 percent in 2019) of requests resulting in data being handed over.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on digital rights, said the growth in Ring's partnerships supports its contention that the company is a “massive and unchallenged de facto CCTV surveillance network.”

EFF policy analyst Matthew Guariglia said that people captured on Ring cameras have not necessarily consented to being recorded. Guariglia obtained Los Angeles Police Department records that show what the requests look like:

A national security panel that reviews tech deals is poised to play a key role in Biden's China strategy.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., a panel that scrutinizes foreign investment in U.S. companies, has been building up its enforcement team and has zeroed in on venture capital deals where money can be traced back to China, the Wall Street Journal’s Heather Somerville reports. The committee's powers expanded significantly with a new law under Trump, and professionals say the more aggressive approach is here to stay under Biden.

“It was sort of a sleepy sheriff’s office and now it’s a buzzy SWAT team,” said Reid Whitten, an attorney who leads the CFIUS practice at law firm Sheppard Mullin.

Recent hires include professionals with venture-capital, investment bank and technology experience.

On the campaign trail, Biden voiced concerns about Chinese tech theft. National security officials and those involved with CFIUS tell the Journal the administration will provide greater clarity on what technologies are crucial to the U.S. military, potentially allowing the committee to work more swiftly in securing them from investors in Russia, China and other adversary states.

A Biden spokeswoman said that the administration “will ensure that CFIUS evolves into a 21st-century committee and is able to appropriately evaluate new and evolving risks.”

Big time""

Washington CNN —

Proving once again that any controversy will be intensified – if not illuminated – by random references to race, class, and gender, Education Secretary Arne Duncan has ignited a storm of protest by noting opposition from “white suburban moms” to one of his prized educational initiatives.

In a meeting with state education chiefs Friday, Duncan said some opposition to the Common Core State Standards – a controversial effort to standardize education – has come from parents displeased that test results have exposed local weaknesses. Duncan said he found it “fascinating” that opponents include “white suburban moms who – all of a sudden – (discovered that) their child isn’t as bright as they thought they were, and their school isn’t quite as good as they thought they were.”

Duncan apologized for the remark Monday afternoon.

Speaking to CNN, he said: “My wording, my phrasing, was a little clumsy and I apologize for that.”

Duncan said his point was that the goal is to prepare U.S. students for a “globally competitive work force” and to challenge education leaders to better explain to parents why higher standards are needed and what it takes to achieve them.

“I didn’t say them perfectly, and I apologize for that,” he added. “My point is that children from every demographic across this country need a well-rounded, world-class education and frankly we have challenges not just in our inner cities but in our suburban areas, too, and we need to have honest conversations about that.”

The “white suburban moms” remark was first reported Friday by Politico, which later reported that Duncan backpedaled, saying that he “didn’t say it perfectly.”

The incident, if nothing else, is thrusting Common Core State Standards into red-hot glare of politically oriented social media.

Duncan has pushed the initiative, which seeks to establish a single set of educational standards for kindergarten through high school for math and English.

Advocates say the standards are essential to improve student skills, prepare them for college, and make the United States competitive with other nations.

But opponents say the standards instill students with elitist values and rob communities of local control of schools.

The remarks triggered a barrage of online comments, and a WhiteHouse.gov petition. As of noon Monday, 1,800 people had signed the petition to remove Duncan as secretary of education. A separate ‘“National Don’t Send Your Child to School Day,” protest over the standards has gained thousands of supporters on its Facebook page, though the number of children who were kept from school is unclear.

Conservative commentator and Common Core foe Michelle Malkin scolded Duncan.

“Ohhhh yes, the red blood underneath my brown skin is boiling. This Obama educrat has stepped in it. Big time. Race card-wielding Education Secretary Arne Duncan is nothing but a corrupt and bankrupt bigot,” Malkin wrote.

Tweeted Randi Winegarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers: “Arne-if u are reading- you shld walk this back..very insensitive-and not right-moms care abt their kids!!

One Virginia-area mother posted a personal response on the left-leaning DailyKos arguing that Duncan missed the point. She said her own son was late to focus and achieve, and standardized testing would have marginalized him.

“I don’t fight the Common Core because I think my child is brilliant, but because I’m tired of these one size fits all educational solutions,” wrote Gretchen Moran Laskas. “So yes, I’m opposed. Not because I don’t understand it. Not because I think it will make my children look bad. But because I know that children already look bad – and by the time they might get it together and look good the way (my son) could, it might be too late.”

A Department of Education official said in an e-mail that, in making his remarks, Duncan was encouraging state education chiefs to better communicate why higher standards are so important.

“The far right and far left have made up their minds,” spokesman Massie Ritsch wrote. “But there’s angst in the middle – which includes many open-minded suburban parents – that needs to be addressed.”

“Arne – a white suburban dad married to a white suburban mom, with two kids in public schools – has always been clear that test scores are an imperfect measure of student achievement and school quality, but tests are an indicator nonetheless,” Ritsch wrote. “And when that indicator conflicts with parents’ notions of their child’s abilities or their school’s quality, it’s understandable that some parents would be concerned.”

The White House spokesman also defended Duncan, though Jay Carney said he had not seen all the comments.

“His point was that we need to be honest with kids and parents – all can agree on that,” Carney said on Monday."

The decision to delay action on new sanctions came as a new Washington Post-ABC News poll showed widespread approval for a deal with Iran, even if that deal means lifting some of the economic restrictions that have helped force Iran to the negotiating table.

A bipartisan group of senators emerged from a two-hour White House meeting saying there would likely be no vote this week on proposed new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil industry. Still, some lawmakers continue to push to ratchet up the pressure on Iran, despite warnings that such a move could prompt the country’s representatives to abandon international negotiations scheduled to resume Wednesday in Geneva.

""People are concerned that we're giving up some leverage,"" Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.), the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters after the White House meeting.

The agreement to delay a sanctions vote came as diplomats from the United States, Iran and five other countries arrived in Geneva for the start of potentially decisive negotiations on the future of Iran’s nuclear program. Diplomats — after coming close to a deal two weeks ago — are seeking to finalize what U.S. officials describe as a first step in a comprehensive agreement on permanent limits to Iran’s nuclear capabilities.

The planned initial stage would require Iran to freeze key parts of its nuclear program in return for modest, temporary relief from some of the economic sanctions that have decimated the country’s economy over the past two years. But the plan has drawn harsh criticism from Israel as well as many prominent members of Congress who oppose any relief from sanctions without more sweeping concessions from Iran.

The Obama administration has defended the proposed phased approach as a necessary confidence-building step leading to a broader deal. White House officials say the bulk of the sanctions against Iran would remain in place until Iran agreed to limits that would essentially prevent it from ever using its nuclear facilities to build atomic bombs.

Iranian officials have insisted their nuclear program is solely for peaceful, energy-producing purposes.

“The president made clear that achieving a peaceful resolution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is profoundly in America’s national security interests,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said. “The president is determined to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and firmly believes that it would be preferable to do so peacefully.”

The new poll released Tuesday showed that Americans supported a negotiated settlement with Iran by a ratio of 2 to 1. Poll respondents were asked if they supported a deal that would lift some economic sanctions “in exchange for Iran restricting its nuclear program in a way that makes it harder for it to produce nuclear weapons.”

Sixty-four percent of the respondents approved of the theoretic deal, including sizable majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents.

Share this article Share

The same poll, however, suggested that most Americans are skeptical that a deal can be concluded.

The White House meeting on Tuesday was part of an intense lobbying effort by President Obama to stall congressional efforts on new sanctions while negotiations are at a critical phase. Administration officials have argued that such actions — in addition to antagonizing Iran — risk angering U.S. allies who have sought in good faith to reach an agreement on the first significant restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in a decade.

Attending the White House meeting in addition to Corker were Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Tim Johnson (D-S.D.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). Secretary of State John F. Kerry and White House national security adviser Susan E. Rice also attended the meeting.

Corker said Kerry and the other officials at the meeting were “very explicit about what they think they may be able to negotiate” when talks resume.

“There is a much greater understanding of what is on the table,” he said, without providing details.

Corker said he expected that some senators at the meeting were satisfied and some were “very unsatisfied.”

After the meeting, a group of senior senators released a letter voicing support for the continued talks, but urging the administration to reconsider its diplomatic strategy.

The senators said that the current negotiations would require the United States “to make significant concessions before we see Iran demonstrably commit to moving away from developing a nuclear weapons capability.”

“If we are reducing sanctions, Iran should be reducing its nuclear capabilities,” the senators wrote.

Separately, a group of six Republican senators introduced an amendment to a defense bill that would, if approved, increase sanctions on Iran. It appeared unlikely that the amendment would come up for a vote until after the Thanksgiving recess at the earliest, congressional officials said.

Two senators, McCain and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), also called on the Senate Banking Committee to move ahead with sanctions legislation “as soon as possible.”

Western governments and Iranian officials alike have expressed optimism in recent days that the Geneva talks could yield at least the outlines of a deal, while also cautioning that significant obstacles remain. Iran’s chief negotiator at the talks, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in a videotaped message that the country’s newly elected leadership had set a course for “ending an unnecessary crisis and opening new horizons.” But he added that Iranians would insist on being treated respectfully by the West.

“To seize this unique opportunity, we need to accept equal footing and choose a path based on mutual respect and recognition of the dignity of all peoples,” he said, speaking in English."

http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/budget-deal-100854.html?hp=f3",0,"House and Senate negotiators were putting the finishing touches Sunday on what would be the first successful budget accord since 2011, when the battle over a soaring national debt first paralyzed Washington. The deal expected to be sealed this week on Capitol Hill would not significantly reduce the debt, now $17.3 trillion and rising. It would not close corporate tax loopholes or reform expensive health-care and retirement programs. It would not even fully replace sharp spending cuts known as the sequester, the negotiators' primary target.

After more than two years of constant crisis, the emerging agreement amounts to little more than a cease-fire. Republicans and Democrats are abandoning their debt-reduction goals, laying down arms and, for the moment, trying to avoid another economy-damaging standoff.

The campaign to control the debt is ending “with a whimper, not a bang,” said Robert Bixby, executive director of the bipartisan Concord Coalition, which advocates debt reduction. “That this can be declared a victory is an indicator of how low the process has sunk. They haven’t really done anything except avoid another crisis.”

Details of the agreement remained murky Sunday as aides to the principal negotiators, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.), continued to work behind closed doors. Ryan and Murray chair a 29-member conference committee tasked with approving a plan to fund federal agencies through fiscal 2014, which began Oct. 1, and avoid another government shutdown when a temporary funding measure expires in January.

With lawmakers due back in town Tuesday, aides said Ryan and Murray are likely to bypass the committee and take the deal, if finalized, straight to the full House and Senate. Congressional leaders hope to finish work quickly and leave town for the holidays as soon as Friday.

Senior aides familiar with the talks say the emerging agreement aims to partially repeal the sequester and raise agency spending to roughly $1.015 trillion in fiscal 2014 and 2015. That would bring agency budgets up to the target already in place for fiscal 2016. To cover the cost, Ryan and Murray are haggling over roughly $65 billion in alternative policies, including cuts to federal worker pensions and higher security fees for the nation’s airline passengers.

Republican leaders are also seeking additional savings to knock a small dent in deficits projected to exceed $6 trillion over the next decade. But the deal would do nothing to trim the debt, which is now larger, as a percentage of the economy, than at any point in U.S. history except during World War II.

In that sense, the talks have followed the game plan Ryan sketched in October after Republicans agreed to reopen the government following a 16-day shutdown. Despite his own ambitious blueprint for shrinking spending, Ryan said he would not attempt a big deal, because it would require a ""grand bargain"" in which Democrats agree to cut safety-net spending in exchange for Republican concessions on taxes.

A grand bargain has been the holy grail in half a dozen rounds of negotiations, including talks between President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) in summer 2011.

""I saw those earlier episodes, these grand-bargain pursuits, as ultimately destined for failure because it required one of the parties in power to compromise core principles, and I just didn't see that happening,"" Ryan said in October. ""That's why it's more appropriate to the moment we have to focus on common ground . . . to get some minimal accomplishments.""

In essence, Ryan was saying, “ ‘If we agree not to do anything, we can get something done.’ And he was right,” Bixby said. “There’s no budgetary or fiscal strategy in the choices they’ve used, except the strategy of avoiding any hard choices.”

Budget analysts say it is difficult to work up much enthusiasm for any of the small-bore moves under discussion.

Take pensions for federal workers. In his most recent budget blueprint, Ryan called for federal workers to pay an additional 5.5 percent toward their retirement, saving taxpayers $130 billion over 10 years. Even Obama proposed a 1.2 percent increase aimed at saving $20 billion.

Share this article Share

But aides said Ryan and Murray were headed toward a smaller number — less than $17 billion. Republicans will need a substantial number of Democratic votes to push a deal through the House, and Washington area lawmakers — including House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer, House budget negotiator Chris Van Hollen and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Barbara A. Mikulski, all Maryland Democrats with large constituencies of federal workers — are having an outsize influence.

Meanwhile, Ryan and Murray were looking to squeeze billions more from the sale of broadcast spectrum. But analysts are already worried that an auction set for early next year could fall tens of billions of dollars short of revenue targets because smaller networks are lobbying to limit participation by wireless giants AT&T and Verizon.

A Senate hearing on the matter is set for Tuesday. Whatever the underlying math, revenue from spectrum sales may be “an easy thing to throw into a budget negotiation,” said Urban Institute budget expert Gene Steuerle. “But it seems like a gimmick.”

Even this modest package faces political hurdles. Democrats began pressing last week for a $25 billion extension of emergency benefits for the long-term unemployed that are set to expire at the end of the month, cutting off 1.3 million people. The last-minute demand frustrated Republicans, who note that the jobless rate fell to 7 percent in November, the lowest level in five years.

On Sunday, however, Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said Democrats are not drawing a line in the sand.

“I don’t think we’ve reached that point where we’ve said this is it, take it or leave it,” Durbin said on ABC’s “This Week.” “What I hear from Patty Murray,” he added, is that “negotiations are making progress, moving in the right direction.”

More worrisome to many observers is the prospect that Republican leaders may prove unable to rally support for the agreement. Boehner has a long history of overestimating his ability to deliver Republican votes. And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been notably unenthusiastic about repealing the sequester, which he has characterized as the most important prize of the GOP crusade to reduce government spending.

On the other hand, Republicans have also been unable to pass spending bills that include the sequester cuts. With an additional $20 billion reduction set to hit the Pentagon in January, many GOP lawmakers now agree with Democrats that the sequester should go.

""I don't even want to think about"" what would happen if Ryan and Murray fail to prevent the next defense cut, said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard P. ""Buck"" McKeon (R-Calif.). ""I just hope they get a deal.""

If negotiators navigate the land mines and push an agreement through Congress, there will be one more cloud on the horizon — the Treasury Department will need another increase in the debt limit, perhaps as soon as late February. Congress agreed in October to suspend enforcement of the debt limit until Feb. 7.

Ryan has raised the idea of using the debt limit to demand progress on an overhaul of the tax code. But GOP leaders have shown little interest. Analysts in Washington and on Wall Street are betting that, after showdowns over the debt limit in 2011 and this fall drove GOP approval ratings to record lows, Republicans lack the appetite to do it again.

Where would that leave the nation’s financial outlook? Not in a particularly good place, budget analysts say. The most recent Congressional Budget Office projections show the red ink receding over the next two years. But annual deficits would start growing again in 2016 as the baby-boom generation moves inexorably into retirement. And the debt would again soar."

Calling it an “enrollment surge,” Obama officials gushed to POLITICO that this figure “surpasses the total for the whole month of October” and “provide the clearest evidence yet that the federal exchange is on the mend.” High fives all around!

Sorry to break the bad news, but they might want to hold off on popping the champagne corks over at the White House just yet.

29,000 may have signed up for Obamacare, but as of Monday about 5.6 million Americans have had their health insurance cancelled because of Obamacare.

That means the administration is still in a deep, deep hole. If those people don’t find new insurance (either on the exchanges or elsewhere) soon, the White House is going end up having millions of newly un-insured Americans on January 1. To avoid that humanitarian and political disaster, they would have to be signing up about 240,000 people on federal and state exchanges a day, every single day, starting on Dec. 1 until Dec. 23rd — and that’s just to break even.

Advertisement

Put in that context, and given that the federal site serves 36 states, 29,000 signups over two days doesn’t sound so hot, does it?

It’s a drop in the bucket.

Moreover, it’s the Post reported yesterday that the website is still failing to transmit enrollment information to insurers, or is sending inaccurate or incomplete data, meaning that many who think they’ve bought policies actually have not. These enrollment errors, the Post reports, “cumulatively have affected roughly one third of the people who have signed up for health plans since Oct. 1.”

For argument’s sake, let’s be generous and give the administration credit for about 200,000 total sign-ups since October in both the federal website and state exchanges so far.

That still leaves them about 5.4 million short if they are to get all the folks they have driven out of their individual market plans covered. The clock is ticking. They’ve now got 20 days left to do it. And 29,000 every two days is not going to cut it.

With just 29,000 over the first two days since the re-launch, the number they must sign up every day has now grown from 240,000 to 270,000 a day. And every day they miss the mark, the number gets higher and more unattainable.

At this rate, they are on pace for a grand total of 330,500 signups on the federal exchanges before the Dec. 23 deadline — which leaves them about 5.27 million short of breaking even."

By the judgment of Time's editorial staff, the pope -- elected earlier this year after a surprise resignation by predecessor Pope Benedict XVI -- was the most influential global newsmaker of the past 12 months. Earlier this week, Time narrowed the finalists down to 10, then five. Pope Francis ultimately won out over NSA leaker Edward Snowden, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Texas senator Ted Cruz and gay rights activist Edith Windsor.

""[W]hat makes this Pope so important is the speed with which he has captured the imaginations of millions who had given up on hoping for the church at all,"" Howard Chua-Eoan and Elizabeth Dias write in the cover story. ""In a matter of months, Francis has elevated the healing mission of the church.""

The magazine first released such a cover in 1927 under the name ""Man of the Year,"" and conferred the title on Charles Lindbergh for his solo transatlantic flight. Since then, the annual covers have featured global peacemakers, U.S. presidents, tech billionaires, dictators and more amorphous concepts, such as ""the protester"" and ""the endangered Earth."" The editors' intention is not to praise the figures selected but to acknowledge their influence in shaping the news and history of the outgoing year. (Hence the selection of Adolf Hitler for the cover in 1938.)

Francis, of course, has made lots of news in 2013. After Benedict announced his resignation in February -- the first pope to do so in 600 years -- the Catholic Church elected Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina, ending the long line of European popes. Since then, Pope Francis has shaped the global conversation on religion by showing an openness to homosexuality and women's leadership within the church, as well as by placing an emphasis on reforming the Vatican's finances while addressing inequality and poverty around the world.

This makes him the third pope to appear as Time's Person of the Year. Pope John Paul II made the cover in 1994, and Pope John XXIII was chosen in 1962. His public acts of humility, from washing the feet of criminals to embracing a disfigured man, have gone viral online and have quickly reshaped many believers', as well as non-believers', view of the Catholic Church.

A new Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 92 percent of Catholics and 62 percent of non-Catholics view Francis favorably -- a significant jump in popularity over his predecessor and the highest favorability rating the Catholic Church has seen in a decade.

After opening presents and singing Christmas carols with his family at their lush and secluded vacation compound, Obama paid a visit to about 580 active duty troops and their families at Marine Corps Base Hawaii in what has become an annual tradition for this president. He said he also called 10 troops who are deployed in such far-away locales as Afghanistan, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.

“It was just a sampling of the incredible sacrifices that all of you and your families make every single day,” Obama said, with his wife at his side. “Michelle and I know that we would not enjoy the freedoms we do if it weren’t for the incredible dedication and professionalism and work that you do. The least we can do is just let you all know we’re grateful to you.”

The president, dressed in island-casual, wrapped up his brief remarks by wishing the troops a “Mele Kalikimaka,” the Hawaiian greeting for “Merry Christmas.”

Earlier in the day, the White House released a Christmas video message in which the Obamas urged Americans to help out at soup kitchens, buy gifts for children in need or organize food or clothing drives for their neighbors in need.

“This is a season for millions of Americans to be together with family, to continue long-held holiday traditions and to show our gratitude to those we love,” the president said in the video. “And along the way, some of us might even watch a little basketball or eat some Christmas cookies, too.”

The Obamas singled out military families for special attention this Christmas. Noting that many veterans already have returned home from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Michelle Obama said, “Now it’s our turn to serve - it’s our turn to step up and show our gratitude for the military families who have given us so much.”

In the Republican address, Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho said America’s most prized gifts include freedom and worship. Risch also thanked the military for defending American freedoms.

The Obamas have been enjoying a low-key vacation in Hawaii, with the president spending three of the past five days golfing with his buddies. He has enjoyed some family time, too, including a beach outing and taking in a college basketball game.

On Christmas Eve, the president made holiday telephone calls to U.S. service members from each branch of the military who are stationed around the globe, including personnel who were wounded last weekend in an operation in South Sudan.

South Sudan was also on the first lady’s mind as she took calls from young children checking in on Santa’s progress using the NORAD Tracks Santa program.

As Michelle Obama answered calls, NORAD's tracker showed Santa passing through some of the world's hot spots - including South Sudan, where an increasingly violent political and ethnic conflict has drawn more of her husband's attention this week.

She made no mention of the conflict as she told a girl named Ella: “I see his sleigh with eight tiny reindeer, and he is over Sudan — South Sudan.”

http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/18/politics/senate-budget-deal/index.html?hpt=po_c1",0,"Congress declared a holiday truce in the budget wars Wednesday, sending President Obama a blueprint for funding the government through 2015. But the next skirmish was already on the horizon: an election-year fight over the national debt. The budget deal that passed the Senate on Wednesday amounts to a handshake agreement to avoid a government shutdown when a temporary funding measure expires Jan. 15. However, the accord does not address the need once again to raise the debt limit, setting up a potentially complicated confrontation in late February or early March.

That fight would come just months before midterm congressional elections, and the GOP is deeply divided over tactics to deal with the debt, a core issue for the Republican base. Some conservatives are calling for another showdown, insisting on an additional round of spending cuts in exchange for granting the Treasury Department more borrowing authority to pay the nation’s bills.

But GOP leaders, especially in the House, have no appetite for another Washington fiscal crisis that could destroy their popularity among voters, aides said. Instead, they are hoping for a more peaceful resolution modeled on the latest budget deal — a bipartisan compromise that solves small problems and aims to offend almost no one.

“Republicans kind of look at this election as probably the best opportunity we’ve ever had at taking control” of the Senate, said Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.). As a political message, threatening to default on the debt “hasn’t really worked all that successfully in the past,” he said.

As they rushed to finish work and leave town for a three-week Christmas break, senators were more inclined to bask in the glow of the budget deal than to plot strategy for the debt limit. The agreement draws to a close nearly three years of fighting over agency budgets — battles that repeatedly risked shutting down the government and actually did close parks, museums and federal offices for 16 days in October.

Congressional leaders appointed Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to negotiate a cease-fire. The resulting agreement would roll back sharp spending cuts known as the sequester over the next two years, sparing the Pentagon from more reductions and restoring billions of dollars for domestic programs.

The $62 billion cost would be more than covered by $85 billion in alternative policies, such as higher security fees for airline passengers, deeper cuts for Medicare providers and less generous retirement benefits for federal workers, including military retirees younger than 62.

The deal makes no effort to solve the nation’s biggest budget problem: a social safety net strained by an aging population. But it also would not raise taxes or reduce Medicare benefits, leaving each party’s core ideological commitments intact.

Last week, the deal sailed through the House and, on Wednesday, it easily passed the Senate, 64 to 36. Nine Republicans joined all 55 members of the Senate Democratic caucus in voting yes. Murray stood in the well of the chamber as the vote unfolded, accepting pats on the back from colleagues in both parties.

“The American people are sick and tired of the constant crises we’ve seen here in D.C. over the past few years,” Murray said on the Senate floor. “I am hopeful this deal can be a foundation for continued bipartisan work, because we have so many big challenges we need to tackle for the families and communities we represent.”

Afterward, senators voted overwhelmingly to end debate on a defense bill that sets Pentagon policy and military pay levels. A final vote to approve the National Defense Authorization Act was scheduled for Thursday, with hopes rising that the chamber also would approve several pending nominations and head home Friday.

Meanwhile, leaders of the congressional spending committees immediately began working on 2014 appropriations — the first in two years — to distribute about $45 billion in extra cash to federal agencies.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) was optimistic that she and her House counterpart, Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), could work through some minor disagreements and deliver an omnibus spending bill to Obama's desk by Jan. 15.

""I'm like a Raven: It's the fourth quarter. There are seconds to go on the clock. And I'm ready to kick a 61-yard field goal,"" said an exultant Mikulski, referring to Baltimore's come-from-behind victory over the Detroit Lions on Monday Night Football.

Once that deadline is cleared, attention will turn to the national debt, which stands at $17.2 trillion. Enforcement of the debt limit has been suspended until Feb. 7, when Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said he will have about a month before he starts running short of cash to pay the nation’s bills.

On Wednesday, White House press secretary Jay Carney said the president will not negotiate over the debt limit, sticking to the stance he adopted earlier this year. Although Republicans won $2.1 trillion in spending cuts — including the sequester — in exchange for raising the debt limit in 2011, they suspended enforcement of the debt limit twice this year without significant concessions.

“The president’s position is unchanged. He will not negotiate over Congress’s responsibility to pay the bills that Congress has racked up,” Carney told reporters, adding that administration officials do not expect Republicans “to travel down this road again.”

Republicans have devoted little thought to the debt limit, said senior aides and lawmakers. “There hasn’t been any discussion of it in any of the caucuses or committees that I’ve been on. And I don’t think it’s very clear what might happen,” said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who served with Ryan and Murray on the special panel tasked with forging the budget deal.

This weekend, Ryan said that the GOP will demand something in exchange for raising the debt limit, but that party leaders had not decided what.

“We don’t want ‘nothing’ out of this debt limit,” Ryan said on “Fox News Sunday.” “So we’re going to meet in our retreats after the holidays and discuss exactly what it is we’re going to try and get for this.”

This week, Senate Republican leaders echoed that view. “The plan is no clean debt ceiling,” said Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. “We’re going to fight for some control on spending, and I predict we’ll get it.”

But even some conservatives were skeptical that party leaders would risk another economy-rattling standoff that could alienate voters so close to a critical election — especially after they proved willing to weaken the sequester to avert another shutdown.

“I think they’ll raise the debt ceiling and they’ll punt and try to win the election [by running against] Obamacare. But they’re not going to do anything useful to head off the bankruptcy of the country,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said of GOP leaders.

http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/white-house-obamacare-affordable-care-act-canceled-plans-101355.html?hp=f1",0,"The Obama administration on Thursday night significantly relaxed the rules of the federal health-care law for millions of consumers whose individual insurance policies have been canceled, saying they can buy bare-bones plans or entirely avoid a requirement that most Americans have health coverage. The surprise announcement, days before the Dec. 23 deadline for people to choose plans that will begin Jan. 1, triggered an immediate backlash from the health insurance industry and raised fairness questions about a law intended to promote affordable and comprehensive coverage on a widespread basis.

The rule change was issued in a bulletin from the Department of Health and Human Services. It is the second major response by the Obama administration to a public and political furor that erupted in the fall when several million people who bought their own insurance began to receive notices that their policies were being canceled because they fell short of new benefit standards. The cancellations prompted complaints that President Obama had reneged on an oft-repeated promise that, under the Affordable Care Act, people who like their health plans could keep them.

At a news conference in mid-November, an apologetic Obama relented to the criticism, announcing that the federal government would let insurance companies continue for another year to offer individuals and small businesses health plans that do not meet the new requirements. The decision, however , is up to each state’s insurance regulator, and not all have gone along.

This second change, prompted by a group of Democratic senators — most of whom face tough reelection campaigns next year — goes substantially further in accommodating people upset about losing their policies. The latest rule will allow consumers with a canceled health plan to claim a “hardship exemption” if they think the plans sold through new federal and state marketplaces are too expensive.

The ability to get an exemption means that the administration is freeing these people from one of the central features of the law: a requirement that most Americans have health insurance as of Jan. 1 or risk a fine. The exemption gives them the choice of having no insurance or of buying skimpy “catastrophic” coverage.

Until now, the law allowed people younger than 30 to buy catastrophic coverage — an exception to the law’s benefit rules in an effort to attract young adults who have been particularly prone to avoiding coverage in the past. The law also has allowed hardship exemptions for people 30 and older who could not afford the regular coverage.

It is unclear how many people facing canceled policies will choose no insurance, bare-bones coverage or a plan through the insurance exchanges that meet new federal standards. But the prospect that healthy people with canceled insurance might opt out of the new health plans set off immediate alarm among insurance industry leaders, who already have been worried whether enough people who are inexpensive to cover will sign up.

“This latest rule change could cause significant instability in the marketplace and lead to further confusion and disruption for consumers,” said Karen Ignagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry’s main trade group.

Another health insurance official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he lacked authorization to discuss the matter publicly, pointed out that the hardship exemption also gives one group the ability to buy coverage whenever they want, rather than during annual open-enrollment periods. As a result, he said, more people might not buy insurance unless they get sick.

Federal health officials estimated Thursday that, of all the people whose substandard health plans have been canceled, less than half a million have not chosen new coverage. But they acknowledged that they were not certain.

The insurance official suggested that some people who have chosen new health plans after receiving a cancellation notice might back out of their new coverage to take advantage of the administration's sudden offer.

Federal health officials, however, predicted that relatively few people would take advantage of the opportunity to avoid the law’s benefits requirement, reasoning that they have had insurance in the past so would probably want it in the future.

“This is a common-sense clarification of the law,” said Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. “For the limited number of consumers whose plans have been canceled and are seeking coverage, this is one more option.”

The administration’s move is a swift response to the dozen Democratic senators, who contended that steps the president had taken did not go far enough to help people whose insurance was canceled.

Six of those senators sent a letter on Wednesday to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, asking for her to allow people whose plans have been canceled to claim hardship exceptions and buy bare-bones catastrophic coverage. “We have heard from many of our constituents who are upset by the cancellation of the health plans,” said the letter, whose signers include both of Virginia’s senators, Mark R. Warner (D) and Timothy M. Kaine (D).

The six senators issued a statement Thursday night, saying that they are ""pleased the administration appears to have responded to the concerns we've raised. . . . We will closely monitor how the administration implements this option, and we remain committed to proposing responsible solutions.""

As administration officials are granting more flexibility to one group of consumers, they also are working to cope with what is expected to be a rush of people signing up for health plans through the new federal insurance marketplace by the Dec. 23 enrollment deadline. After a trouble-ridden first two months for the insurance Web site, HealthCare.gov, it is working smoothly, they said. They also have added 800 trained staff members to their call centers for people who want enrollment advice by phone, so that there are now 12,000 staffers at 17 call centers nationwide.

Washington CNN —

The National Security Agency notched a much-needed win in court Friday after a series of setbacks over the legality and even the usefulness of its massive data collection program.

A federal judge in New York ruled the NSA’s bulk collection of data on nearly every phone call made in the United States was legal.

The ruling contrasts with another ruling last week by a federal judge in Washington, who called the same program “almost Orwellian” and likely unconstitutional.

In his ruling Friday, U.S. District Judge William Pauley said the NSA’s bulk collection of phone records under Section 215 of the Patriot Act was legal. The program was revealed in classified leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

“But the question of whether that program should be conducted is for the other two coordinate branches of government to decide,” said the ruling by Pauley, an appointee of President Bill Clinton.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the case, said it would appeal Pauley’s ruling.

“We are extremely disappointed with this decision, which misinterprets the relevant statutes, understates the privacy implications of the government’s surveillance and misapplies a narrow and outdated precedent to read away core constitutional protections,” said Jameel Jaffer, the ACLU’s deputy legal director.

Review: NSA snooping program should stay in place

President Barack Obama is examining a review of the surveillance efforts that recommended changes in how the NSA program was conducted. Obama said last week he would decide what to do about it in January.

Last week, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said the NSA’s bulk collection of metadata – phone records of the time and numbers called without any disclosure of content – apparently violates privacy rights.

His preliminary ruling favored five plaintiffs challenging the practice, but Leon limited the decision only to their cases.

“I cannot imagine a more ‘indiscriminate’ and ‘arbitrary invasion’ than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval,” said Leon, an appointee of President George W. Bush. “Surely, such a program infringes on ‘that degree of privacy’ that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment.”

Leon’s ruling said the “plaintiffs in this case have also shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of a Fourth Amendment claim,” adding “as such, they too have adequately demonstrated irreparable injury.”

He rejected the government’s argument that a 1979 Maryland case provided precedent for the constitutionality of collecting phone metadata, noting that public use of telephones had increased dramatically in three decades.

Leon also noted the government “does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA’s bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature.”

However, he put off enforcing his order barring the government from collecting the information, pending an appeal by the government.

A Justice Department spokesman said in response to Leon’s ruling that “we believe the program is constitutional as previous judges have found.”

Explosive revelations this year by Snowden triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks.

Snowden’s disclosures led to more public disclosure about the secretive legal process that sets in motion the government surveillance.

The NSA has admitted it received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of metadata from telecom giant Verizon and leading Internet companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook.

The case before Leon involved approval for surveillance in April by a judge at a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for “foreign intelligence purposes.”

Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of the 1970s, the secret courts were set up to grant certain types of government requests – wiretapping, data analysis and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the United States.

The Patriot Act that Congress passed after the 9/11 attacks broadened the government’s ability to conduct anti-terrorism surveillance in the United States and abroad, eventually including the metadata collection.

In order to collect the information, the government has to demonstrate it is “relevant” to an international terrorism investigation.

However, the 1978 FISA law lays out exactly what the special court must decide: “A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States, interfere with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or physical safety of any person.”

In defending the program, Gen. Keith Alexander, the NSA’s director, told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that “15 separate judges of the FISA Court have held on 35 occasions that Section 215 (of the Patriot Act) authorizes the collection of telephony metadata in bulk in support of counterterrorism investigations.”

Initially, telecommunications companies such as Verizon were the targets of legal action against Patriot Act provisions. Congress later gave retroactive immunity to those private businesses.

The New York ruling makes it more likely that the U.S. Supreme Court will have to tackle the issue of privacy and settle the dispute over the the NSA program.

For years, the courts have relied on a 1979 Supreme Court precedent that found privacy rights didn’t extend to personal information people give to third-parties such as the phone companies, which store basic data on calls made. The secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has relied on that ruling to periodically reauthorize the NSA phone data program.

But technology has come a long way since then; modern cell phones are in constant communication with phone towers and tell a lot more information about phone customers than old land line phones. And at least some justices may be ready to take on the issue again.

Ruling last year in an unrelated case, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the 1979 standard may be “ill suited to the digital age” because people reveal a lot more information in seemingly mundane tasks.

“It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties,” she wrote."

He checked the reply against his watch and described a place to meet. “I’ll see you there,” he said. Edward Joseph Snowden emerged at the appointed hour, alone, blending into a light crowd of locals and tourists. He cocked his arm for a handshake, then turned his shoulder to indicate a path. Before long he had guided his visitor to a secure space out of public view.

During more than 14 hours of interviews, the first he has conducted in person since arriving here in June, Snowden did not part the curtains or step outside. Russia granted him temporary asylum on Aug. 1, but Snowden remains a target of surpassing interest to the intelligence services whose secrets he spilled on an epic scale.

Late this spring, Snowden supplied three journalists, including this one, with caches of top-secret documents from the National Security Agency, where he worked as a contractor. Dozens of revelations followed, and then hundreds, as news organizations around the world picked up the story. Congress pressed for explanations, new evidence revived old lawsuits and the Obama administration was obliged to declassify thousands of pages it had fought for years to conceal.

Taken together, the revelations have brought to light a global surveillance system that cast off many of its historical restraints after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Secret legal authorities empowered the NSA to sweep in the telephone, Internet and location records of whole populations. One of the leaked presentation slides described the agency’s “collection philosophy” as “Order one of everything off the menu.”

Six months after the first revelations appeared in The Washington Post and Britain’s Guardian newspaper, Snowden agreed to reflect at length on the roots and repercussions of his choice. He was relaxed and animated over two days of nearly unbroken conversation, fueled by burgers, pasta, ice cream and Russian pastry.

Snowden offered vignettes from his intelligence career and from his recent life as “an indoor cat” in Russia. But he consistently steered the conversation back to surveillance, democracy and the meaning of the documents he exposed.

New photos of Edward Snowden + 3 The former NSA contractor’s leaks have altered the U.S. government’s relationship with its citizens and the rest of the world. Six months later, he reflects.

“For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission’s already accomplished,” he said. “I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated. Because, remember, I didn’t want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself.”

“All I wanted was for the public to be able to have a say in how they are governed,” he said. “That is a milestone we left a long time ago. Right now, all we are looking at are stretch goals.”

‘Going in blind’

Snowden is an orderly thinker, with an engineer’s approach to problem-solving. He had come to believe that a dangerous machine of mass surveillance was growing unchecked. Closed-door oversight by Congress and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was a “graveyard of judgment,” he said, manipulated by the agency it was supposed to keep in check. Classification rules erected walls to prevent public debate.

Toppling those walls would be a spectacular act of transgression against the norms that prevailed inside them. Someone would have to bypass security, extract the secrets, make undetected contact with journalists and provide them with enough proof to tell the stories.

The NSA’s business is “information dominance,” the use of other people’s secrets to shape events. At 29, Snowden upended the agency on its own turf.

“You recognize that you’re going in blind, that there’s no model,” Snowden said, acknowledging that he had no way to know whether the public would share his views.

“But when you weigh that against the alternative, which is not to act,” he said, “you realize that some analysis is better than no analysis. Because even if your analysis proves to be wrong, the marketplace of ideas will bear that out. If you look at it from an engineering perspective, an iterative perspective, it’s clear that you have to try something rather than do nothing.”

By his own terms, Snowden succeeded beyond plausible ambition. The NSA, accustomed to watching without being watched, faces scrutiny it has not endured since the 1970s, or perhaps ever.

The cascading effects have made themselves felt in Congress, the courts, popular culture, Silicon Valley and world capitals. The basic structure of the Internet itself is now in question, as Brazil and members of the European Union consider measures to keep their data away from U.S. territory and U.S. technology giants including Google, Microsoft and Yahoo take extraordinary steps to block the collection of data by their government.

For months, Obama administration officials attacked Snowden’s motives and said the work of the NSA was distorted by selective leaks and misinterpretations.

On Dec. 16, in a lawsuit that could not have gone forward without the disclosures made possible by Snowden, U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon described the NSA's capabilities as ""almost Orwellian"" and said its bulk collection of U.S. domestic telephone records was probably unconstitutional.

The next day, in the Roosevelt Room, an unusual delegation of executives from old telephone companies and young Internet firms told President Obama that the NSA's intrusion into their networks was a threat to the U.S. information economy. The following day, an advisory panel appointed by Obama recommended substantial new restrictions on the NSA, including an end to the domestic call-records program.

“This week is a turning point,” said the Government Accountability Project’s Jesselyn Radack, who is one of Snowden’s legal advisers. “It has been just a cascade.”

‘They elected me’

On June 22, the Justice Department unsealed a criminal complaint charging Snowden with espionage and felony theft of government property. It was a dry enumeration of statutes, without a trace of the anger pulsing through Snowden's former precincts.

In the intelligence and national security establishments, Snowden is widely viewed as a reckless saboteur, and journalists abetting him little less so.

At the Aspen Security Forum in July, a four-star military officer known for his even keel seethed through one meeting alongside a reporter he knew to be in contact with Snowden. Before walking away, he turned and pointed a finger.

“We didn’t have another 9/11,” he said angrily, because intelligence enabled warfighters to find the enemy first. “Until you’ve got to pull the trigger, until you’ve had to bury your people, you don’t have a clue.”

It is commonly said of Snowden that he broke an oath of secrecy, a turn of phrase that captures a sense of betrayal. NSA Director Keith B. Alexander and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., among many others, have used that formula.

In his interview with The Post, Snowden noted matter-of-factly that Standard Form 312, the ­classified-information nondisclosure agreement, is a civil contract. He signed it, but he pledged his fealty elsewhere.

“The oath of allegiance is not an oath of secrecy,” he said. “That is an oath to the Constitution. That is the oath that I kept that Keith Alexander and James Clapper did not.”

People who accuse him of disloyalty, he said, mistake his purpose.

“I am not trying to bring down the NSA, I am working to improve the NSA,” he said. “I am still working for the NSA right now. They are the only ones who don’t realize it.”

What entitled Snowden, now 30, to take on that responsibility?

“That whole question — who elected you? — inverts the model,” he said. “They elected me. The overseers.”

He named the chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees.

""Dianne Feinstein elected me when she asked softball questions"" in committee hearings, he said. ""Mike Rogers elected me when he kept these programs hidden. . . . The FISA court elected me when they decided to legislate from the bench on things that were far beyond the mandate of what that court was ever intended to do. The system failed comprehensively, and each level of oversight, each level of responsibility that should have addressed this, abdicated their responsibility.""

“It wasn’t that they put it on me as an individual — that I’m uniquely qualified, an angel descending from the heavens — as that they put it on someone, somewhere,” he said. “You have the capability, and you realize every other [person] sitting around the table has the same capability but they don’t do it. So somebody has to be the first.”

‘Front-page test’

Snowden grants that NSA employees by and large believe in their mission and trust the agency to handle the secrets it takes from ordinary people — deliberately, in the case of bulk records collection, and “incidentally,” when the content of American phone calls and e-mails are swept into NSA systems along with foreign targets.

But Snowden also said acceptance of the agency’s operations was not universal. He began to test that proposition more than a year ago, he said, in periodic conversations with co-workers and superiors that foreshadowed his emerging plan.

Beginning in October 2012, he said, he brought his misgivings to two superiors in the NSA’s Technology Directorate and two more in the NSA Threat Operations Center’s regional base in Hawaii. For each of them, and 15 other co-workers, Snowden said he opened a data query tool called BOUNDLESSINFORMANT, which used color-coded “heat maps” to depict the volume of data ingested by NSA taps.

His colleagues were often “astonished to learn we are collecting more in the United States on Americans than we are on Russians in Russia,” he said. Many of them were troubled, he said, and several said they did not want to know any more.

“I asked these people, ‘What do you think the public would do if this was on the front page?’ ” he said. He noted that critics have accused him of bypassing internal channels of dissent. “How is that not reporting it? How is that not raising it?” he said.

By last December, Snowden was contacting reporters, although he had not yet passed along any classified information. He continued to give his colleagues the “front-page test,” he said, until April.

Asked about those conversations, NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines sent a prepared statement to The Post: “After extensive investigation, including interviews with his former NSA supervisors and co-workers, we have not found any evidence to support Mr. Snowden’s contention that he brought these matters to anyone’s attention.”

Snowden recounted another set of conversations that he said took place three years earlier, when he was sent by the NSA’s Technology Directorate to support operations at a listening post in Japan. As a system administrator, he had full access to security and auditing controls. He said he saw serious flaws with information security.

“I actually recommended they move to two-man control for administrative access back in 2009,” he said, first to his supervisor in Japan and then to the directorate’s chief of operations in the Pacific. “Sure, a whistleblower could use these things, but so could a spy.”

That precaution, which requires a second set of credentials to perform risky operations such as copying files onto a removable drive, has been among the principal security responses to the Snowden affair.

Vines, the NSA spokeswoman, said there was no record of those conversations, either.

U.S. ‘would cease to exist’

Just before releasing the documents this spring, Snowden made a final review of the risks. He had overcome what he described at the time as a “selfish fear” of the consequences for himself.

“I said to you the only fear [left] is apathy — that people won’t care, that they won’t want change,” he recalled this month.

The documents leaked by Snowden compelled attention because they revealed to Americans a history they did not know they had.

Internal briefing documents reveled in the “Golden Age of Electronic Surveillance.” Brawny cover names such as MUSCULAR, TUMULT and TURMOIL boasted of the agency’s prowess.

With assistance from private communications firms, the NSA had learned to capture enormous flows of data at the speed of light from fiber-optic cables that carried Internet and telephone traffic over continents and under seas. According to one document in Snowden's cache, the agency's Special Source Operations group, which as early as 2006 was said to be ingesting ""one Library of Congress every 14.4 seconds,"" had an official seal that might have been parody: an eagle with all the world's cables in its grasp.

Each year, NSA systems collected hundreds of millions of e-mail address books, hundreds of billions of cellphone location records and trillions of domestic call logs.

Most of that data, by definition and intent, belonged to ordinary people suspected of nothing. But vast new storage capacity and processing tools enabled the NSA to use the information to map human relationships on a planetary scale. Only this way, its leadership believed, could the NSA reach beyond its universe of known intelligence targets.

In the view of the NSA, signals intelligence, or electronic eavesdropping, was a matter of life and death, ""without which America would cease to exist as we know it,"" according to an internal presentation in the first week of October 2001 as the agency ramped up its response to the al-Qaeda attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

With stakes such as those, there was no capability the NSA believed it should leave on the table. The agency followed orders from President George W. Bush to begin domestic collection without authority from Congress and the courts. When the NSA won those authorities later, some of them under secret interpretations of laws passed by Congress between 2007 and 2012, the Obama administration went further still.

Using PRISM, the cover name for collection of user data from Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple and five other U.S.-based companies, the NSA could obtain all communications to or from any specified target. The companies had no choice but to comply with the government's request for data.

But the NSA could not use PRISM, which was overseen once a year by the surveillance court, for the collection of virtually all data handled by those companies. To widen its access, it teamed up with its British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, to break into the private fiber-optic links that connected Google and Yahoo data centers around the world.

That operation, which used the cover name MUSCULAR, tapped into U.S. company data from outside U.S. territory. The NSA, therefore, believed it did not need permission from Congress or judicial oversight. Data from hundreds of millions of U.S. accounts flowed over those Google and Yahoo links, but classified rules allowed the NSA to presume that data ingested overseas belonged to foreigners.

‘Persistent threat’

Disclosure of the MUSCULAR project enraged and galvanized U.S. technology executives. They believed the NSA had lawful access to their front doors — and had broken down the back doors anyway.

Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith took to his company's blog and called the NSA an ""advanced persistent threat"" — the worst of all fighting words in U.S. cybersecurity circles, generally reserved for Chinese state-sponsored hackers and sophisticated criminal enterprises.

""For the industry as a whole, it caused everyone to ask whether we knew as much as we thought,"" Smith recalled in an interview. ""It underscored the fact that while people were confident that the U.S. government was complying with U.S. laws for activity within U.S. territory, perhaps there were things going on outside the United States . . . that made this bigger and more complicated and more disconcerting than we knew.""

They wondered, he said, whether the NSA was “collecting proprietary information from the companies themselves.”

Led by Google and then Yahoo, one company after another announced expensive plans to encrypt its data traffic over tens of thousands of miles of cable. It was a direct — in some cases, explicit — blow to NSA collection of user data in bulk. If the NSA wanted the information, it would have to request it or circumvent the encryption one target at a time.

As these projects are completed, the Internet will become a less friendly place for the NSA to work. The agency can still collect data from virtually anyone, but collecting from everyone will be harder.

The industry’s response, Smith acknowledged, was driven by a business threat. U.S. companies could not afford to be seen as candy stores for U.S. intelligence. But the principle of the thing, Smith said, “is fundamentally about ensuring that customer data is turned over to governments pursuant to valid legal orders and in accordance with constitutional principles.”

‘Warheads on foreheads’

Snowden has focused on much the same point from the beginning: Individual targeting would cure most of what he believes is wrong with the NSA.

Six months ago, a reporter asked him by encrypted e-mail why Americans would want the NSA to give up bulk data collection if that would limit a useful intelligence tool.

“I believe the cost of frank public debate about the powers of our government is less than the danger posed by allowing these powers to continue growing in secret,” he replied, calling them “a direct threat to democratic governance.”

In the Moscow interview, Snowden said, “What the government wants is something they never had before,” adding: “They want total awareness. The question is, is that something we should be allowing?”

Snowden likened the NSA’s powers to those used by British authorities in Colonial America, when “general warrants” allowed for anyone to be searched. The FISA court, Snowden said, “is authorizing general warrants for the entire country’s metadata.”

“The last time that happened, we fought a war over it,” he said.

Technology, of course, has enabled a great deal of consumer surveillance by private companies, as well. The difference with the NSA’s possession of the data, Snowden said, is that government has the power to take away life or freedom.

At the NSA, he said, “there are people in the office who joke about, ‘We put warheads on foreheads.’ Twitter doesn’t put warheads on foreheads.”

Privacy, as Snowden sees it, is a universal right, applicable to American and foreign surveillance alike.

“I don’t care whether you’re the pope or Osama bin Laden,” he said. “As long as there’s an individualized, articulable, probable cause for targeting these people as legitimate foreign intelligence, that’s fine. I don’t think it’s imposing a ridiculous burden by asking for probable cause. Because, you have to understand, when you have access to the tools the NSA does, probable cause falls out of trees.”

‘Everybody knows’

On June 29, Gilles de Kerchove, the European Union's counter­terrorism coordinator, awoke to a report in Der Spiegel that U.S. intelligence had broken into E.U. offices, including his, to implant surveillance devices.

The 56-year-old Belgian, whose work is often classified, did not consider himself naive. But he took the news personally, and more so when he heard unofficial explanations from Washington.

“ ‘Everybody knows. Everybody does’ — Keith Alexander said that,” de Kerchove said in an interview. “I don’t like the idea that the NSA will put bugs in my office. No. I don’t like it. No. Between allies? No. I’m surprised that people find that noble.”

Comparable reactions, expressed less politely in private, accompanied revelations that the NSA had tapped the cellphones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. The blowback roiled relations with both allies, among others. Rousseff canceled a state dinner with Obama in September.

When it comes to spying on allies, by Snowden’s lights, the news is not always about the target.

“It’s the deception of the government that’s revealed,” Snowden said, noting that the Obama administration offered false public assurances after the initial reports about NSA surveillance in Germany “The U.S. government said: ‘We follow German laws in Germany. We never target German citizens.’ And then the story comes out and it’s: ‘What are you talking about? You’re spying on the chancellor.’ You just lied to the entire country, in front of Congress.”

In private, U.S. intelligence officials still maintain that spying among friends is routine for all concerned, but they are giving greater weight to the risk of getting caught.

“There are many things we do in intelligence that, if revealed, would have the potential for all kinds of blowback,” Clapper told a House panel in October.

‘They will make mistakes’

U.S. officials say it is obvious that Snowden’s disclosures will do grave harm to intelligence gathering, exposing methods that adversaries will learn to avoid.

“We’re seeing al-Qaeda and related groups start to look for ways to adjust how they communicate,” said Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center and a former general counsel at the NSA.

Other officials, who declined to speak on the record about particulars, said they had watched some of their surveillance targets, in effect, changing channels. That evidence can be read another way, they acknowledged, given that the NSA managed to monitor the shift.

Clapper has said repeatedly in public that the leaks did great damage, but in private he has taken a more nuanced stance. A review of early damage assessments in previous espionage cases, he said in one closed-door briefing this fall, found that dire forecasts of harm were seldom borne out.

“People must communicate,” he said, according to one participant who described the confidential meeting on the condition of anonymity. “They will make mistakes, and we will exploit them.”

According to senior intelligence officials, two uncertainties feed their greatest concerns. One is whether Russia or China managed to take the Snowden archive from his computer, a worst-case assumption for which three officials acknowledged there is no evidence.

In a previous assignment, Snowden taught U.S. intelligence personnel how to operate securely in a “high-threat digital environment,” using a training scenario in which China was the designated threat. He declined to discuss the whereabouts of the files, but he said that he is confident he did not expose them to Chinese intelligence in Hong Kong. And he said he did not bring them to Russia.

“There’s nothing on it,” he said, turning his laptop screen toward his visitor. “My hard drive is completely blank.”

The other big question is how many documents Snowden took. The NSA's incoming deputy director, Rick Ledgett, said on CBS's ""60 Minutes"" recently that the number may approach 1.7 million, a huge and unexplained spike over previous estimates. Ledgett said he would favor trying to negotiate an amnesty with Snowden in exchange for ""assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured.""

Obama’s national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, later dismissed the possibility.

“The government knows where to find us if they want to have a productive conversation about resolutions that don’t involve Edward Snowden behind bars,” said the American Civil Liberties Union’s Ben Wizner, the central figure on Snowden’s legal team.

Some news accounts have quoted U.S. government officials as saying Snowden has arranged for the automated release of sensitive documents if he is arrested or harmed. There are strong reasons to doubt that, beginning with Snowden’s insistence, to this reporter and others, that he does not want the documents published in bulk.

If Snowden were fool enough to rig a “dead man’s switch,” confidants said, he would be inviting anyone who wants the documents to kill him.

Asked about such a mechanism in the Moscow interview, Snowden made a face and declined to reply. Later, he sent an encrypted message. “That sounds more like a suicide switch,” he wrote. “It wouldn’t make sense.”

‘It’s not about me’

By temperament and circumstance, Snowden is a reticent man, reluctant to discuss details about his personal life.

Over two days his guard never dropped, but he allowed a few fragments to emerge. He is an “ascetic,” he said. He lives off ramen noodles and chips. He has visitors, and many of them bring books. The books pile up, unread. The Internet is an endless library and a window on the progress of his cause.

""It has always been really difficult to get me to leave the house,"" he said. ""I just don't have a lot of needs. . . . Occasionally there's things to go do, things to go see, people to meet, tasks to accomplish. But it's really got to be goal-oriented, you know. Otherwise, as long as I can sit down and think and write and talk to somebody, that's more meaningful to me than going out and looking at landmarks.""

In hope of keeping focus on the NSA, Snowden has ignored attacks on himself.

“Let them say what they want,” he said. “It’s not about me.”

Former NSA and CIA director Michael V. Hayden predicted that Snowden will waste away in Moscow as an alcoholic, like other “defectors.” To this, Snowden shrugged. He does not drink at all. Never has.

But Snowden knows his presence here is easy ammunition for critics. He did not choose refuge in Moscow as a final destination. He said that once the U.S. government voided his passport as he tried to change planes en route to Latin America, he had no other choice.

It would be odd if Russian authorities did not keep an eye on him, but no retinue accompanied Snowden and his visitor saw no one else nearby. Snowden neither tried to communicate furtively nor asked that his visitor do so. He has had continuous Internet access and has talked to his attorneys and to journalists daily, from his first day in the transit lounge at Sheremetyevo airport.

“There is no evidence at all for the claim that I have loyalties to Russia or China or any country other than the United States,” he said. “I have no relationship with the Russian government. I have not entered into any agreements with them.”

“If I defected at all,” Snowden said, “I defected from the government to the public.”"

http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/barack-obama-news-conference-101402.html?hp=f1",0,"President Obama signaled Friday that he may halt the National Security Agency’s collection and storage of millions of Americans’ phone records and instead require phone companies to hold the data. Speaking at a White House news conference near the end of a very difficult year, Obama said that he would have a “pretty definitive statement” on proposed NSA reforms in January, following his family’s annual holiday break in Hawaii.

His remarks suggested that Obama’s views have changed significantly since details of the NSA’s far-reaching surveillance programs were publicly revealed in June. He said he believed his administration has struck the right balance between intelligence gathering and privacy protection but acknowledged that concerns about the potential for abuse may make it necessary to rein in the programs to restore public trust.

“The environment has changed,” Obama said. He said that it “matters more that people right now are concerned,” and added, “Just because we can do something doesn’t mean we necessarily should.”

During the 60-minute news conference, Obama also reiterated his claim of personal responsibility for the disastrous rollout of his health-care law. In addition, he expressed optimism that he could advance his agenda in 2014, beginning with immigration reform.

“I think 2014 needs to be a year of action,” Obama said.

The president said his NSA review, based on the assessments of intelligence officials and other officials inside and outside of the federal government, would determine which programs to maintain or eliminate, both domestically and internationally.

An independent White House panel released a report this week questioning whether the NSA’s sweeping collection of personal data had played any meaningful role in preventing terrorist attacks. A federal judge also ruled that the data collection was probably unconstitutional.

Obama acknowledged that the United States needs to provide “more confidence” to the international community amid widespread outrage over revelations of U.S. spying on many foreign allies.

“What has been more challenging is the fact that we do have a lot of laws and checks and balances and safeguards and audits when it comes to making sure that the NSA and other intelligence communities are not spying on Americans,” Obama said. “We’ve had less legal constraint in terms of what we’re doing internationally.”

He added, “In a virtual world, some of these boundaries don’t matter anymore.”

Obama defended the NSA, saying that he has seen no evidence that the agency “acted inappropriately” with the billions of call records it has assembled in a secret database, a claim that is at odds with compliance reports and other documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

Obama all but endorsed one of the White House panel’s proposals, which would require phone companies to hold the data that the NSA has been collecting.

Share this article Share

""It is possible that some of the same information . . . can be obtained by having private phone companies keep those records longer"" and allowing the government to search them under tight guidelines, Obama said.

That prospect has drawn fire from privacy advocates and technology experts, who say it would be as bad as or worse than having the NSA hold the records. Phone companies also do not want to be the custodians of data sought by law enforcement or civil attorneys.

“Mandatory data retention is a major civil liberties problem and something that other groups would oppose categorically,” said Rainey Reitman, activism director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Currently, phone companies keep call records for periods ranging from six months to 10 years.

“Requiring by law that companies retain call records longer than they do for business reasons subjects those records to risk of theft by hackers and subpoena by state and local law enforcement and by civil litigants,” said Gregory Nojeim, senior counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology. “Because many entities other than the NSA would gain access, it is a step backwards for privacy.”

During the news conference, Obama sought to grapple with a year of partisan turmoil in Washington and his inability to advance an ambitious second-term domestic policy agenda through Congress. Initiatives on gun violence and immigration failed or stalled in the face of Republican opposition, and the president was unable to prevent broad spending cuts known as the sequester or a partial shutdown of the federal government.

When asked whether 2013 had been the worst year of his presidency, Obama laughed off the suggestion.

“We have had ups and we have had downs,” Obama said. He added, jokingly, “I think this room has recorded at least 15 near-death experiences.”

He said that despite the disastrous rollout of the online insurance exchanges at the heart of his signature health-care law, more than 1 million people have signed up for new health-care insurance since October.

Obama also noted that statistics released Friday showed the fastest economic growth in two years and said that this month’s budget deal with Congress could be a sign of greater cooperation in Washington.

“It’s probably too early to declare an outbreak of bipartisanship, but it’s also fair to say that we are not condemned to endless gridlock,” Obama said.

Recent polls suggest that record numbers of Americans disapprove of Obama's job performance and that his earlier advantages over Republicans in Congress have eroded in many areas. Obama dismissed the importance of the results, saying, ""My polls have gone up and down a lot through the course of my career.""

Obama defended his selection of openly gay athletes to lead the U.S. delegation at the 2014 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, considering Russia’s discriminatory laws.

“When it comes to the Olympics and athletic performance, we don’t make distinctions on the basis of sexual orientation,” Obama said. He added that this was “a value at the heart of not just America, but American sports.”"
1688,1688,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/01/06/liz-cheneys-exit-means-nothing-for-the-2014-landscape/,0,"When Republican Liz Cheney abruptly ended her bid for a U.S. Senate seat Monday, she closed the book on a short-lived but heavily scrutinized campaign, raised numerous questions about her political future, and virtually assured Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) a fourth term. But there's one thing Cheney's decision didn't do: Alter the 2014 landscape in any way or say anything about the broader themes of this election cycle.

Liz Cheney abruptly ended her bid for the Senate Monday, but don't assume her campaign taught us anything about the state of the Republican Party. (Video: The Washington Post)

While Cheney's bid to unseat Enzi by running to his right (or something) ostensibly put her into the same class as a cluster of other Republicans trying to dislodge GOP senators -- six of the 12 Republican incumbents up for reelection this year face capable or potentially tough primary challengers -- she didn't fit the mold of her counterparts, who are mainly pitching themselves as tea party candidates.

Cheney is not the darling of the Club for Growth and Senate Conservatives Fund like Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel. Nor is she a far-right antagonist a la Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Tex.). And her background as the daughter of a former vice president distinguished her from the considerably lower-profile underdogs challenging Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.).

In Enzi, Cheney also faced an opponent who was distinct from his colleagues. While tea party activists have long been aching to take on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), for example, Enzi was not at the top of many target lists at the beginning of the cycle. And why would he be? He was the eighth most conservative senator, according to National Journal's 2012 vote ratings.

Cheney's departure -- which she attributed to family health issues -- does not upset the balance of ongoing tea-party-versus-establishment battle. Her campaign was never really part of that calculus in the first place. As The Fix boss wrote earlier, Cheney's campaign never really found an identity. It certainly wasn't one fashioned after Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) or Rand Paul (R-Ky.). (Side note: Paul notably backed Enzi.)

Nor does it mean the battle for the majority has been altered. Wyoming has long been near-certain to remain in GOP hands no matter who is nominated for the Senate race in August. That reality is no different than it was yesterday. Democrats don't even have a major candidate yet. And even if they did, the state's strong conservative tilt would give that person little chance of competing.

The media -- this blog was no exception -- covered Liz Cheney's campaign with close scrutiny. Part of the reason was that someone named Cheney was back on the political scene. Some of it was simply because there was really no race to which it could be compared. And a large part was due to the fact that the race had become part of the broader GOP debate over gay marriage in a remarkably public way."

http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/07/republicans-use-gates-new-book-to-hammer-clinton-biden/?hpt=po_c1",0,"In a new memoir, former defense secretary Robert Gates unleashes harsh judgments about President Obama’s leadership and his commitment to the Afghanistan war, writing that by early 2010 he had concluded the president “doesn’t believe in his own strategy, and doesn’t consider the war to be his. For him, it’s all about getting out.”

Leveling one of the more serious charges that a defense secretary could make against a commander in chief sending forces into combat, Gates asserts that Obama had more than doubts about the course he had charted in Afghanistan. The president was ""skeptical if not outright convinced it would fail,"" Gates writes in ""Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War.""

Obama, after months of contentious discussion with Gates and other top advisers, deployed 30,000 more troops in a final push to stabilize Afghanistan before a phased withdrawal beginning in mid-2011. “I never doubted Obama’s support for the troops, only his support for their mission,” Gates writes.

As a candidate, Obama had made plain his opposition to the 2003 Iraq invasion while embracing the Afghanistan war as a necessary response to the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, requiring even more military resources to succeed. In Gates’s highly emotional account, Obama remains uncomfortable with the inherited wars and distrustful of the military that is providing him options. Their different worldviews produced a rift that, at least for Gates, became personally wounding and impossible to repair.

In a statement Tuesday evening, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Obama “deeply appreciates Bob Gates’ service as Secretary of Defense, and his lifetime of service to our country.”

“As has always been the case, the President welcomes differences of view among his national security team, which broaden his options and enhance our policies,” Hayden said in the statement. “The President wishes Secretary Gates well as he recovers from his recent injury, and discusses his book.” Gates fractured his first vertebra last week in a fall at his home in Washington state.

It is rare for a former Cabinet member, let alone a defense secretary occupying a central position in the chain of command, to publish such an antagonistic portrait of a sitting president.

Gates's severe criticism is even more surprising — some might say contradictory — because toward the end of ""Duty,"" he says of Obama's chief Afghanistan policies, ""I believe Obama was right in each of these decisions."" That particular view is not a universal one; like much of the debate about the best path to take in Afghanistan, there is disagreement on how well the surge strategy worked, including among military officials.

The sometimes bitter tone in Gates’s 594-page account contrasts sharply with the even-tempered image that he cultivated during his many years of government service, including stints at the CIA and National Security Council. That image endured through his nearly five years in the Pentagon’s top job, beginning in President George W. Bush’s second term and continuing after Obama asked him to remain in the post. In “Duty,” Gates describes his outwardly calm demeanor as a facade. Underneath, he writes, he was frequently “seething” and “running out of patience on multiple fronts.”

The book, published by Knopf, is scheduled for release Jan. 14.

Gates, a Republican, writes about Obama with an ambivalence that he does not resolve, praising him as “a man of personal integrity” even as he faults his leadership. Though the book simmers with disappointment in Obama, it reflects outright contempt for Vice President Biden and many of Obama’s top aides.

Biden is accused of “poisoning the well” against the military leadership. Thomas Donilon, initially Obama’s deputy national security adviser, and then-Lt. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, the White House coordinator for the wars, are described as regularly engaged in “aggressive, suspicious, and sometimes condescending and insulting questioning of our military leaders.”

In her statement, Hayden said Obama “disagrees with Secretary Gates’ assessment” of the vice president.

“From his leadership on the Balkans in the Senate, to his efforts to end the war in Iraq, Joe Biden has been one of the leading statesmen of his time, and has helped advance America’s leadership in the world,” Hayden said. “President Obama relies on his good counsel every day.”

Gates is 70, nearly 20 years older than Obama. He has worked for every president going back to Richard Nixon, with the exception of Bill Clinton. Throughout his government career, he was known for his bipartisan detachment, the consummate team player. “Duty” is likely to provide ammunition for those who believe it is risky for a president to fill such a key Cabinet post with a holdover from the opposition party.

He writes, “I have tried to be fair in describing actions and motivations of others.” He seems well aware that Obama and his aides will not see it that way.

While serving as defense secretary, Gates gave Obama high marks, saying privately in the summer of 2010 that the president is “very thoughtful and analytical, but he is also quite decisive.” He added, “I think we have a similar approach to dealing with national security issues.”

Obama echoed Gates's comments in a July 10, 2010, interview for my book ""Obama's Wars."" The president said: ""Bob Gates has, I think, served me extraordinarily well. And part of the reason is, you know, I'm not sure if he considers this an insult or a compliment, but he and I actually think a lot alike, in broad terms.""

During that interview, Obama said he believed he “had garnered confidence and trust in Gates.” In “Duty,” Gates complains repeatedly that confidence and trust were what he felt was lacking in his dealings with Obama and his team. “Why did I feel I was constantly at war with everybody, as I have detailed in these pages?” he writes. “Why was I so often angry? Why did I so dislike being back in government and in Washington?”

His answer is that “the broad dysfunction in Washington wore me down, especially as I tried to maintain a public posture of nonpartisan calm, reason and conciliation.”

His lament about Washington was not the only factor contributing to his unhappiness. Gates also writes of the toll taken by the difficulty of overseeing wars against terrorism and insurgencies in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Such wars do not end with a clear surrender; Gates acknowledges having ambiguous feelings about both conflicts. For example, he writes that he does not know what he would have recommended if he had been asked his opinion on Bush’s 2003 decision to invade Iraq.

Three years later, Bush recruited Gates — who had served his father for 15 months as CIA director in the early 1990s — to take on the defense job. The first half of “Duty” covers those final two years in the Bush administration. Gates reveals some disagreements from that period, but none as fundamental or as personal as those he describes with Obama and his aides in the book’s second half.

“All too early in the [Obama] administration,” he writes, “suspicion and distrust of senior military officers by senior White House officials — including the president and vice president — became a big problem for me as I tried to manage the relationship between the commander in chief and his military leaders.”

Gates offers a catalogue of various meetings, based in part on notes that he and his aides made at the time, including an exchange between Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that he calls “remarkable.”

He writes: ""Hillary told the president that her opposition to the [2007] surge in Iraq had been political because she was facing him in the Iowa primary. . . . The president conceded vaguely that opposition to the Iraq surge had been political. To hear the two of them making these admissions, and in front of me, was as surprising as it was dismaying.""

Earlier in the book, he describes Hillary Clinton in the sort of glowing terms that might be used in a political endorsement. “I found her smart, idealistic but pragmatic, tough-minded, indefatigable, funny, a very valuable colleague, and a superb representative of the United States all over the world,” he wrote.

March 3, 2011

“Duty” reflects the memoir genre, declaring that this is how the writer saw it, warts and all, including his own. That focus tends to give short shrift to the fuller, established record. For example, in recounting the difficult discussions that led to the Afghan surge strategy in 2009, Gates makes no reference to the six-page “terms sheet” that Obama drafted at the end, laying out the rationale for the surge and withdrawal timetable. Obama asked everyone involved to sign on, signaling agreement.

According to the meeting notes of another participant, Gates is quoted as telling Obama, “You sound the bugle . . . Mr. President, and Mike [Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] and I will be the first to charge the hill.”

Gates does not include such a moment in “Duty.” He picks up the story a bit later, after Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the central commander in charge of both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, made remarks to the press suggesting he was not comfortable with setting a fixed date to start withdrawal.

At a March 3, 2011, National Security Council meeting, Gates writes, the president opened with a “blast.” Obama criticized the military for “popping off in the press” and said he would push back hard against any delay in beginning the withdrawal.

According to Gates, Obama concluded, “ ‘If I believe I am being gamed . . .’ and left the sentence hanging there with the clear implication the consequences would be dire.”

Gates continues: “I was pretty upset myself. I thought implicitly accusing” Petraeus, and perhaps Mullen and Gates himself, “of gaming him in front of thirty people in the Situation Room was inappropriate, not to mention highly disrespectful of Petraeus. As I sat there, I thought: the president doesn’t trust his commander, can’t stand [Afghanistan President Hamid] Karzai, doesn’t believe in his own strategy, and doesn’t consider the war to be his. For him, it’s all about getting out.”

‘Breaches of faith’

Lack of trust is a major thread in Gates’s account, along with his unsparing criticism of Obama’s aides. At times, the two threads intertwine. For example, after the devastating 2010 Haitian earthquake that had left tens of thousands dead, Gates met with Obama and Donilon, the deputy national security adviser, about disaster relief.

Donilon was ""complaining about how long we were taking,"" Gates writes. ""Then he went too far, questioning in front of the president and a roomful of people whether General [Douglas] Fraser [head of the U.S. Southern Command] was competent to lead this effort. I've rarely been angrier in the Oval Office than I was at that moment. . . . My initial instinct was to storm out, telling the president on the way that he didn't need two secretaries of defense. It took every bit of my self-discipline to stay seated on the sofa.""

Gates confirms a previously reported statement in which he told Obama’s first national security adviser, retired Marine Gen. James Jones, that he thought Donilon would be a “disaster” if he succeeded Jones (as Donilon did in late 2010). Gates writes that Obama quizzed him about this characterization; a one-on-one meeting with Donilon followed, and that “cleared the air,” according to Gates.

His second year with Obama proved as tough as the first. “For me, 2010 was a year of continued conflict and a couple of important White House breaches of faith,” he writes.

The first, he says, was Obama’s decision to seek the repeal of the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy toward gays serving in the military. Though Gates says he supported the decision, there had been months and months of debate, with details still to work out. On one day’s notice, Obama informed Gates and Mullen that he would announce his request for a repeal of the law. Obama had “blindsided Admiral Mullen and me,” Gates writes.

Similarly, in a battle over defense spending, “I was extremely angry with President Obama,” Gates writes. “I felt he had breached faith with me . . . on the budget numbers.” As with “don’t ask, don’t tell,” “I felt that agreements with the Obama White House were good for only as long as they were politically convenient.”

Gates acknowledges forthrightly in “Duty” that he did not reveal his dismay. “I never confronted Obama directly over what I (as well as [Hillary] Clinton, [then-CIA Director Leon] Panetta, and others) saw as the president’s determination that the White House tightly control every aspect of national security policy and even operations. His White House was by far the most centralized and controlling in national security of any I had seen since Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger ruled the roost.”

It got so bad during internal debates over whether to intervene in Libya in 2011 that Gates says he felt compelled to deliver a “rant” because the White House staff was “talking about military options with the president without Defense being involved.”

Gates says his instructions to the Pentagon were: “Don’t give the White House staff and [national security staff] too much information on the military options. They don’t understand it, and ‘experts’ like Samantha Power will decide when we should move militarily.” Power, then on the national security staff and now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has been a strong advocate for humanitarian intervention.

Another time, after Donilon and Biden tried to pass orders to Gates, he told the two, “The last time I checked, neither of you are in the chain of command,” and said he expected to get orders directly from Obama.

Life at the top was no picnic, Gates writes. He did little or no socializing. “Every evening I could not wait to get home, get my office homework out of the way, write condolence letters to the families of the fallen, pour a stiff drink, wolf down a frozen dinner or carry out,” since his wife, Becky, often remained at their home in Washington state.

“I got up at five every morning to run two miles around the Mall in Washington, past the World War II, Korean, and Vietnam memorials, and in front of the Lincoln Memorial. And every morning before dawn, I would ritually look up at that stunning white statue of Lincoln, say good morning, and sadly ask him, How did you do it?”

The memoir’s title comes from a quote, “God help me to do my duty,” that Gates says he kept on his desk. The quote has been attributed to Abraham Lincoln’s war secretary, Edwin Stanton.

At his confirmation hearings to be Bush’s defense secretary in late 2006, Gates told the senators that he had not “come back to Washington to be a bump on a log and not say exactly what I think, and to speak candidly and, frankly, boldly to people at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue about what I believe and what I think needs to be done.”

But Gates says he did not speak his mind when the committee chairman listed the problems he would face as secretary. “I remember sitting at the witness table listening to this litany of woe and thinking, “What the hell am I doing here? I have walked right into the middle of a category-five shitstorm. It was the first of many, many times I would sit at the witness table thinking something very different from what I was saying.”

“Duty” offers the familiar criticism of Congress and its culture, describing it as “truly ugly.” Gates’s cold feelings toward the legislative branch stand in stark contrast to his warmth for the military. He repeatedly describes his affection for the troops, especially those in combat.

Gates wanted to quit at the end of 2010 but agreed to stay at Obama’s urging, finally leaving in mid-2011. He later joined a consulting firm with two of Bush’s closest foreign policy advisers — former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and Stephen Hadley, the national security adviser during Bush’s second term. The firm is called RiceHadleyGates. In October, he became president-elect of the Boy Scouts of America.

Gates writes, “I did not enjoy being secretary of defense,” or as he e-mailed one friend while still serving, “People have no idea how much I detest this job.”

The court, as is its custom, gave no reason for declining to review a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit that the law was unconstitutional because it violated standards established by the justices 40 years ago in Roe v. Wade.

About a dozen other states have passed laws similar to Arizona’s, hoping they would provide a way to challenge the court’s ruling that abortion must be generally available to women before a fetus reaches viability, which is generally considered to be around 24 weeks. Pregnancies last about 40 weeks.

It is the third time this term that the court has decided not to review a lower court decision that struck down a restrictive state abortion law. The other two came from Oklahoma, where new rules would have practically eliminated drug-induced abortions and required what opponents said would be unnecessary ultrasound tests.

On the other hand, the court denied a stay of a new Texas law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, a rule opponents said will lead to some clinics having to close. The law is being reviewed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R) signed her state's law in 2012. It provided exceptions for medical emergencies but was one of the most restrictive of the new provisions.

“The Supreme Court’s decision to deny [the state’s petition] in this case is wrong, and is a clear infringement on the authority of states to implement critical life-affirming laws,” Brewer’s office said in a statement. “Governor Brewer will continue to fight to protect Arizona women, families and our most vulnerable population — unborn children.”

Abortion rights supporters applauded the court’s decision to stay out of the fight, but noted a rise in restrictive abortion laws they say limit access to the procedure.

""The Supreme Court soundly declined to review the Ninth Circuit's sound decision that Arizona's abortion ban is clearly unconstitutional under long-standing precedent,"" Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. "". . . But women should not be forced to run to court, year after year, in state after state, to protect their constitutional rights and access to critical health care.""

Jennifer Dalven, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Reproductive Freedom Project, said the laws affect a “very, very small sliver of women” because most abortions occur well before the limit in the law."

http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/bob-mcdonnell-virginia-indictment-scandal-102460.html?hp=t2_3",0,"Former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were charged Tuesday with illegally accepting gifts, luxury vacations and large loans from a wealthy Richmond area businessman who sought special treatment from state government. Authorities allege that for nearly two years, the McDonnells repeatedly asked executive Jonnie R. Williams Sr. for loans and gifts of money, clothes, golf fees and equipment, trips, and private plane rides. The gifts and loans totaled at least $165,000.

In exchange, authorities allege, the McDonnells worked in concert to lend the prestige of the governor’s office to Williams’s struggling company, Star Scientific, a former small cigarette manufacturer that now sells dietary supplements.

McDonnell, 59, is the first governor ever to face criminal charges in Virginia, a state that has prided itself on a history of clean and ethical politics, and the charges will probably accelerate a push for the legislature to tighten state ethics laws.

The criminal prosecution marks a stunning crash for a politician who was considered for the Republican vice presidential nomination in 2012 and who, just a year ago, was considered a credible prospective candidate for president.

The 43-page, 14-count indictment adds new details to a story line of largess that was first recounted by The Washington Post in March. It depicts an elected official in financial trouble who sought help from a businessman with something to gain.

McDonnell and his legal team immediately denounced the charges and said prosecutors overstepped their authority. In an unprecedented televised public appearance Tuesday night, McDonnell said, “ I come before you this evening as someone who has been falsely and wrongfully accused and whose public service has been wrongfully attacked.”

He went on to insist, “I repeat again, emphatically, that I did nothing illegal for Mr. Williams.”

Prosecutors contend that the then-first couple arranged access for Williams to top state officials, allowed the historic governor’s mansion to be used for a launch party for a company pill not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and attended Star events designed to boost the company’s prestige, particularly with university researchers with whom the company was trying to build credibility.

They also said the couple took significant steps to hide the relationship. They accuse the former first lady of lying to investigators about how and when her husband had met Williams and of trying to pass off luxury clothes he purchased for her as a loan from his daughter.

The former governor, they said, illegally failed to disclose to banks the loans he had received from Williams as he sought to refinance several home loans.

If convicted of the charges, the couple could face a maximum of 30 years in prison, though they probably would serve far less. They are scheduled to be arraigned Friday.

“We will continue to work tirelessly with our law enforcement partners to investigate and prosecute public corruption,” U.S. Attorney Dana J. Boente said in a statement.

Through an attorney, McDonnell repeated an apology he has offered several times for his interactions with Williams. But he strongly denied that his actions were illegal and promised to fight the charges in court.

His attorneys were even more forceful, filing court papers Tuesday that in unusually strong language accused prosecutors of ignoring evidence that might damage the credibility of a witness and overzealously pursuing a case built on the testimony of Williams, who was offered immunity from prosecution.

“The federal government’s decision to use these deceitful tactics in order to prosecute a popular and successful Republican Governor immediately upon his leaving office is disgraceful, violates basic principles of justice, and is contemptuous of the citizens of Virginia who elected him,” McDonnell’s attorneys wrote.

William Burck, an attorney for the former first lady, said she, too, is innocent. “The Department of Justice has overreached to bring these charges,” he said.

Jerry Kilgore, an attorney for Williams, declined to comment. Abbe Lowell, an attorney for Star Scientific, said the company has “cooperated with authorities and will continue to do so.”

The threat of indictment loomed over the final months of McDonnell’s four-year term, which ended with the inauguration of Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) on Jan. 11.

Although Boente had informed McDonnell in December that he intended to pursue charges, McDonnell made a final appeal to top Justice Department officials in Washington and no action was taken until 10 days after he left office.

McDonnell’s indictment comes during the General Assembly’s annual legislative session and is likely to step up efforts to overhaul the state’s ethics and gifts laws, long considered among the most lax in the nation. McAuliffe and leading state lawmakers in both parties have said they support such changes.

During the one term allowed to him under Virginia’s constitution, McDonnell presided over a state whose jobless rate was declining and fiscal outlook was brightening. Even his political opponents admired his civil temperament, and he had faced no challenges to his ethics or character before the relationship with Williams emerged.

But the indictment alleges that there was another side to the governor and his wife. Authorities contend that the McDonnells, as first couple, relied on the wealthy political benefactor to support a life of luxury. At the same time, they came to rely on Williams’s assistance to stave off mounting personal financial difficulties.

“We are broke, have an unconscionable amount in credit card debt already, and this Inaugural is killing us!!” Maureen McDonnell wrote in an e-mail to an aide to the then-governor-elect in December 2009, after the aide expressed concerns about an offer by Williams to buy her inaugural gown. “I need answers and I need help, and I need to get this done.”

The first lady told Williams that she would take a “rain check” from him, authorities said, and made good on that promise during an April 13, 2011, shopping trip in New York City. Williams paid $11,000 for clothes at Oscar de la Renta and spent $5,685 at Louis Vuitton and $2,604 at Bergdorf Goodman.

Items from that trip were on a long list of gifts that authorities said the couple must forfeit. They include black and white Louis Vuitton shoes, two gold Oscar de la Renta dresses, a blue Giorgio Armani jacket and two matching dresses, two sets of golf clubs, two iPhones and a silver Rolex inscribed “71st Governor of Virginia.”

Twice, authorities said the McDonnells went to Williams for loans as they struggled to make payments on expensive beach houses they had bought in Virginia Beach with the intention of renting them to vacationers.

First, in May 2011, Maureen McDonnell met with Williams at the governor’s mansion, where she said she and her husband were having “severe financial difficulties” and asked for a $50,000 loan. According to authorities, she told Williams that she could help Star Scientific but needed financial assistance.

According to authorities, Williams insisted on talking directly to the governor, who explained that the rental income on the properties was not covering the bills and said he would appreciate a loan with a two-year term at 5 percent interest. Williams agreed and said there was no need for formal loan papers.

Less than a year later, in February 2012, authorities said McDonnell began discussing a new loan with Williams. First, they talked about whether the businessman could give the couple 50,000 shares of company stock, but then decided on a $50,000 payment to avoid having to disclose the stock. The loan went to a small real estate company that McDonnell owned with a sister, which managed the Virginia Beach properties.

In addition to the Virginia Beach houses, purchased for $2 million in 2005 and 2006, the McDonnells owned a $1 million home at the Wintergreen resort with his sisters and an $835,000 home outside Richmond.

In exchange, authorities said the couple worked to lend the prestige and help of the governor’s office to Star Scientific and repeatedly connected him with state officials who could help the company.

Maureen McDonnell attended Star events in Richmond and Michigan and one in Florida — held just days before a daughter’s 2011 wedding, for which Williams footed the $15,000 bill for catering —where she spoke to investors and doctors on the company’s behalf.

The indictment reveals that she attended the conference in place of her husband, after a staff member e-mailed Williams that he could not attend “due to some Dad commitments” before the wedding. “What else can we do to fix this?” the staffer wrote.

The McDonnells attended a Star event intended at Richmond’s Jefferson Hotel to persuade doctors to use the company’s product in February 2011. According to prosecutors, McDonnell spoke and said he supported the company.

In 2011 and 2012, Star Scientific was also trying to persuade scientists at the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University to submit an application on the company’s behalf to the state’s tobacco commission, which distributes Virginia’s share of the 1998 legal settlement with major cigarette companies.

The company needed university involvement to fund research on its Anatabloc pill because the tobacco commission does not accept applications from for-profit entities. According to the indictment, Maureen McDonnell in a February 2012 e-mail pressed an aide of the governor’s to intervene to speed the process. “I’m just trying to talk w [JW]. Gov wants to get this going w VCU and MCV.”

Eight days later, the governor chimed in as well to the staffer: “Pls see me about anatabloc issues at VCU and UVA. Thx,” he wrote in an e-mail.

“Will do. We need to be careful with this issue,” the staffer wrote back.

Even as she complained of financial distress to friends, the first lady used $30,000 of the money she received from Williams in 2011 to buy thousands of shares of Star Scientific stock.

Her attorney has said she honestly believed in the company’s promise, part of a long-standing interest by the former Redskins cheerleader in wellness and diet.

But according to the indictment, she told her stockbroker that she needed to avoid publicly revealing her ownership and then purposely sold and repurchased her shares to avoid Virginia disclosure.

Authorities said she also told investigators, when first questioned, that Williams and her husband had once worked together and met years ago. In fact, they met in 2009, while he was running for governor.

And in March, not long after she was interviewed by investigators, she tried to return clothing that Williams had given her.

“I truly hope your daughter will now be able to enjoy these lovely outfits and show them off on many grand occasions,” she wrote in a note, which she gave to Williams’s brother, along with a box of clothes. She suggested auctioning the clothes for charity, given that they had once been worn by Virginia’s first lady.

McDonnell first apologized for his interactions with Williams in July, paying back the loans and then returning what he called “tangible” gifts his family accepted from Williams.

But he has insisted that he did not abuse his office. Star Scientific, after all, received no state grants, contracts or economic incentives, and its employees got no state appointments."

The 1,582-page bill would fully restore cuts to Head Start, partially restore cuts to medical research and job training programs, and finance new programs to combat sexual assault in the military. It would also give all federal workers a 1 percent raise.

But in a blow to the District, it provides only partial funding to continue constructing buildings for the Department of Homeland Security’s campus in Anacostia.

The White House and leaders of both parties praised the measure, which would fund federal agencies for the remainder of the fiscal year and end the lingering threat of a government shutdown when the current funding bill expires at midnight Wednesday.

""The bipartisan appropriations bill represents a positive step forward for the nation and our economy,"" White House budget director Sylvia Mathews Burwell said in a statement.

The spending bill puts flesh on the bones of a bipartisan budget deal struck in December, when Republicans and Democrats agreed to partially repeal the sequester, heading off a roughly $20 billion cut set to hit the Pentagon on Wednesday and restoring funding to domestic agencies, which had already absorbed sequester reductions.

Despite the increases, the bill would leave agency budgets tens of billions of dollars lower than Obama had requested and ­congressional Democrats had sought. That represents a victory for congressional Republicans, who, after three years of fevered battles over the budget, have succeeded in rolling back agency appropriations to a level on par with the final years of the George W. Bush administration, before spending skyrocketed in an effort to combat the recession.

Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, said he expects a majority of lawmakers in both parties to support the measure.

“Everybody can find something to complain about — legitimately so,” Cole said. “But from the Republican standpoint, gosh, this is $164 billion less than Bush’s last discretionary budget, so that’s pretty good progress in cutting spending.”

Many Democrats agreed.

""Compared to the sequester, this is obviously a big improvement. But compared to investments we should be making, it falls far short,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee. The measure proves, he said, that ""this notion that the federal government is on a spending binge is just nonsense.""

With the deadline for a government shutdown fast approaching Wednesday night, House and Senate leaders were preparing a temporary bill to keep the government open through Saturday. That would give lawmakers the rest of the week to review the massive new measure, which proposes funding and policy changes that would reach into every corner of the federal government.

House Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) met through the weekend to put the finishing touches on the package. The pair released a joint statement late Monday, along with a photo showing them smiling happily and shaking hands.

“As with any compromise, not everyone will like everything in this bill,” the statement said. “But in this divided government a critical bill such as this simply cannot reflect the wants of only one party.”

Given barely a month to complete work on the package, Mikulski and Rogers were able to overcome early partisan disputes over funding for the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature legislative achievement, and payments due to the International Monetary Fund, a frequent target of conservatives. To sweeten the package, they agreed to include a provision that would exempt disabled veterans from a modest pension reduction for military retirees enacted last month to help cover the cost of the sequester repeal.

All told, the bill would provide $1.012 trillion to the Pentagon and other federal agencies. An additional $92 billion would be set aside for overseas operations, including military activity in Afghanistan and assistance for the growing flow of refu­gees fleeing the war in Syria. The bill also authorizes $6.55 billion for domestic disaster relief.

The measure authorizes a 1 percent pay increase for civilian federal workers and U.S. military personnel. But in response to several examples of excess spending by federal agencies, the bill would put in place new limits on certain conferences, official travel and employee awards.

The National Institutes of Health would receive $29.9 billion, $1 billion more than under the sequester but $714 million less than the agency was due to receive last year before the sequester hit last March.

Carrie Wolinetz, president of United for Medical Research, a consortium of patient, provider and research organizations, said the proposal ""won't adequately reverse the damage done by last year's budget sequester and ensure the nation's biomedical research enterprise makes continued progress in lifesaving research and development.""

Head Start, which had to drop children from its rolls due to the sequester, would get $8.6 billion, fully reversing the cuts. And while Republicans refused to finance Obama’s push for universal pre-kindergarten classes, they granted his request to expand Head Start partnerships that benefit toddlers and infants.

The Department of Homeland Security would face a reduction in funding of about $336 million, with most of the cuts at the scandal-ridden Transportation Security Administration. In a victory for Republicans who have sought for years to boost the use of private security contractors, the agreement increases funding for private security screeners and caps the TSA’s overall screening personnel at 46,000.

The agreement is riddled with dozens of controversial policy riders. One would bar funding to enforce a law that requires incandescent light bulbs to meet new efficiency standards.

The measure would continue a ban on transferring terrorism detainees at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to sites in the United States. It would also withhold additional funding for the government of Afghanistan until the country agrees to a new bilateral security agreement. And the measure would ban foreign aid for Libya until Secretary of State John F. Kerry ""confirms Libyan cooperation"" with ongoing investigations into the Sept. 11, 2012, attack at the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi.

The measure would also provide new congressional backing for Obama’s strategy of continuing aid to Egypt, despite a law that forbids U.S. military aid to governments that have taken power by military coup, as Egypt’s interim military-backed government did in July.

Several issues regarding gun control are also included in the bill. The legislation restricts the Justice and Homeland Security departments from establishing programs similar to the ""Fast and Furious"" gun-tracking effort. In response to allegations that the administration has been stockpiling ammunition for use by federal agents, the measure also requires Homeland Security to provide detailed reports on its purchase and use of ammunition.

The measure also continues a ban on the use of federal funding to perform most abortions, including abortions in the District and for federal prisoners. But Republicans agreed to jettison other contentious proposals, including a ban on new federal regulations for greenhouse gases and the ""global gag rule,"" which sought to prohibit U.S. funding for organizations that give women information about abortion."

Chris Christie apologized Thursday for a scandal that threatens his political future, announcing that he had fired a senior aide and banished his top campaign adviser for their roles in days of traffic jams orchestrated to punish a small-city Democratic mayor.

Christie at once accepted responsibility as the state's chief executive but also insisted he had no involvement in shutting down a pair of access lanes to the heavily trafficked George Washington Bridge over four days in early September. The Republican governor said he was ""blindsided"" by this week's release of e-mails and text messages detailing his office's role in the plot to create severe gridlock in Fort Lee, N.J.

In a meandering, two-hour news conference in his office here at the State Capitol, Christie said he was ""embarrassed and humiliated"" by an episode that left him feeling ""heartbroken"" and ""betrayed."" Despite his reputation for ""directness and blunt talk,"" the governor said, ""I am not a bully.""

Christie, a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, also tried to tamp down allegations that he had nurtured a culture of intimidation in his administration and his political campaigns.

“This is the exception — it is not the rule — of what’s happened over the last four years in this administration,” Christie said. He added that he was “stunned by the abject stupidity that was shown here.”

Graphic Read the e-mails

Christie repeatedly invoked his ignorance of key events, providing a stark contrast to his carefully cultivated image as a hands-on, can-do chief executive and former prosecutor who helped guide New Jersey in the painful aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.

Christie said he delegates “enormous authority” to his staff, despite his reputation as a micromanager. He said he first learned of the damning e-mails between his staff and associates by reading the Bergen Record’s breaking-news report Wednesday on his iPad at the governor’s mansion, as he got ready to shower after his morning workout.

The e-mails suggest that Christie operatives jammed traffic in Fort Lee to retaliate against Mark Sokolich, the city’s mayor, who did not endorse Christie’s 2013 re­election. But Christie said that he never knew his team was pursuing Sokolich’s endorsement and that, until he saw the mayor’s picture on television, “I wouldn’t have been able to pick him out of a lineup.”

After his marathon news conference, Christie traveled to Fort Lee to apologize personally to Sokolich and the community for the lane closures, which severely delayed commuters, school buses and emergency vehicles.

Although the mayor initially thought a meeting would be disruptive, he later said that he accepted Christie’s apology. “I take him for his word,” Sokolich said.

The bridge controversy is certain to continue. The office of U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman announced Thursday that it had opened a preliminary inquiry after a referral from the inspector general at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversees the bridge. Fishman was nominated as the state’s top federal prosecutor in 2009 by President Obama.

Also Thursday, six residents of the state filed a class-action lawsuit against Christie, his top aides and the Port Authority claiming they lost pay because of delays caused by the lane closures.

In Trenton, former Christie appointee David Wildstein, who is shown helping to orchestrate the gridlock plan in e-mails, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in refusing to answer questions in front of the General Assembly’s transportation committee. The panel voted unanimously to refer Wildstein to authorities for a possible contempt charge.

State Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D), who is friendly with Christie, said Democratic lawmakers will continue their investigations but will not rush the process. “We don’t want to create a political circus,” he said, “but answers have to be had.”

Thousands of additional pages of e-mails connected to the legislative inquiry could be made public as early as Friday.

Christie said he could not say “unequivocally” that no other aides were involved in the bridge scheme or other acts of political bullying. But, he said, “if there’s any other evidence that comes forward that requires action to be taken, I will take it, no matter how much it hurts me personally or dismays me.”

Christie said that he had fired his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, who, like other members of his tight-knit inner circle, was considered family. E-mails show that Kelly was closely involved in executing the gridlock plan, including a message sent to Wildstein in August declaring, “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.”

Christie described Kelly as “stupid” and “deceitful,” adding: “I’ve terminated her employment because she lied to me.”

The governor said he told his senior aides before a news conference last month that they had one hour to share any information they may have about the lane closures with Kevin O’Dowd, his chief of staff, and Charlie McKenna, his chief counsel. Kelly said nothing, Christie said, prompting him to unwittingly mislead the public by insisting that the governor’s office had nothing to do with the gridlock.

Christie also announced Thursday that he had removed Bill Stepien — his closest political adviser and his campaign manager in 2009 and 2013 — from his political organization, at least temporarily. Christie said he directed Stepien to withdraw his name from becoming state Republican Party chairman and to end his consulting arrangement with the Republican Governors Association, which Christie took over as chairman late last year.

No evidence has surfaced that Stepien was involved in closing the lanes, but e-mails show he communicated about the incident after the fact with Wildstein, who resigned late last year as the scandal began to escalate.

“I am embarrassed and humiliated by the conduct of some of the people on my team,” Christie said. “There’s no doubt in my mind that the conduct that they exhibited is completely unacceptable and showed a lack of respect for the appropriate role of government.”

Later, the governor added: “I’m a sad guy standing here today.”

Christie’s calm demeanor and tough words may reassure national GOP operatives and donors for the time being, but lawmakers in Trenton said there would be more subpoenas for Christie’s staff.

“It’s very hard for me to accept that Bridget Kelly is the key person or that this was her idea,” said state Sen. Joseph Vitale (D). “She may have pushed the button, but we need to know about the other names that have so far been redacted.”

The bridge scandal has cast a cloud over Christie’s plans to introduce himself to voters around the country in anticipation of an expected presidential campaign. Because of his leadership after Hurricane Sandy ravaged coastal New Jersey in 2012, Christie has been celebrated as a bipartisan straight talker.

“I am not a focus-group-tested, blow-dried candidate or governor,” Christie said Thursday. He added: “I’ve worked for the last 12 years in public life developing a reputation for honesty and directness and blunt talk, one that I think is well deserved. But when something like this happens, it’s appropriate to question yourself.”

When a reporter asked whether he considered resigning, the governor said: “Oh, God, no. . . . That’s a crazy question, man.”"

http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/chris-christie-inauguration-102429.html",0,"It wasn’t supposed to be this way for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. No doubt he imagined there would be national attention as he took the oath of office for a second term. No doubt he assumed that what he said in his second inaugural address would be scrutinized. But context is everything in politics, and in the time between Christie’s impressive reelection victory in November and his snowy swearing-in on Tuesday, so much has changed.

Inauguration Day once might have focused on Christie, the GOP establishment favorite for the party’s presidential nomination; Christie, a Republican capable of winning blue states in a general election; Christie, a politician who had good relationships with many Democrats; Christie, a no-nonsense governor who led his state back after Hurricane Sandy.

This is the Christie who, a week after winning reelection, was on the cover of Time magazine with the subheadline, “How Chris Christie Can Win Over the GOP,” and the Christie who did a victory lap on the Sunday morning talk shows.

Gov. Chris Christie's current ""Bridge-gate"" incident has brought new attention to an old allegation from the Democratic mayor of Elizabeth, N.J. (Video: Julie Percha/The Washington Post)

Instead, it was a day in which the national attention cast the governor in a far less flattering light, focusing on Christie, a politician now under state and federal investigations; Christie, a Republican whose hardball style may be more liability than asset; Christie, a governor whose administration is accused of threatening to hold Sandy relief money hostage; Christie, a perhaps future national candidate pinned down and politically damaged.

The message of his inaugural address was the same one Christie preached during and after his reelection campaign: that of seeking bipartisan cooperation with Democrats in his state, in contrast to the red-blue divisions that have left Washington in gridlock and legislative paralysis.

“We cannot fall victim to the attitude of Washington, D.C.,” Christie said. “The attitude that says, ‘I am always right and you are always wrong.’ The attitude that puts everyone into a box they are not permitted to leave. The attitude that puts political wins ahead of policy agreements. The belief that ‘compromise’ is a dirty word.”

That is the image the governor has tried to project and would try to project in a national campaign. That is the Christie who won a fifth of the African American vote in November and half of the Hispanic vote, who won a third of the Democratic vote in his reelection and two-thirds of independents.

Since then, Christie’s world has changed. First came revelations that some of his top advisers were involved in a decision to close down lanes approaching the George Washington Bridge in September, leading to massive traffic jams around Fort Lee, N.J. More recently have come charges from Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer (D) that Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno told her last spring that Sandy relief money for her city would depend on her support for a commercial development project in Hoboken.

The Pew Research Center offers a different portrait of Christie today. A poll suggests that the patina of him as a governor with bipartisan appeal has been chipped away by what has happened since he was reelected.

Compared with a year ago, favorable impressions of Christie have changed little — 40 percent in January 2013, 38 percent now. But his unfavorable ratings have doubled, from 17 percent to 34 percent. Among Democrats, they have jumped 25 points, to 43 percent negative, and among independents they are 18 points higher, at 33 percent negative.

Christie’s credibility is also at issue. The governor has said he knew nothing about his aides’ involvement in the lane closures. But almost six in 10 Americans said they do not believe that. Among Democrats, it’s two in three.

With the Hoboken mayor’s allegations, the battle between Christie and his accusers took on a sharply partisan tone. Until then, Christie had projected the image of a politician who apologized for what happened on the bridge and who said he would cooperate with any reasonable investigation. Now he is fighting back.

On Saturday, the governor’s office issued a lengthy and pointed statement in an effort to rebut Zimmer’s charges and to call her credibility into question. The governor’s allies also took aim at MSNBC, which has pounced on the story and which aired the first interview with Zimmer on Saturday’s “Up With Steve Kornacki.”

On Sunday, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) charged on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Democrats in the state legislature are on a “partisan witch hunt” in their efforts to damage the governor. On Monday, Guadagno denied the charges from Zimmer, who said she met with the U.S. attorney’s office on Sunday to tell her story. Other Republicans are coming forward to defend Christie.

His advisers believe Zimmer is a flawed accuser whose new charges do not square with her past statements of praise for Christie. They are making that argument in every conversation they have. They believe her credibility can be challenged. With Guadagno’s denial, investigators must sort out a she-said, she-said controversy.

They also believe Christie can continue his role as chairman of the Republican Governors Association as the investigations unfold. His weekend fundraising trip to Florida told them that there is no reason to think he cannot carry out those responsibilities effectively. He has trips scheduled for February. “Donors lining those events up remaining steadfast,” a Christie adviser said Monday.

The governor did not mention the investigations in his inaugural address, in contrast to his State of the State speech. He sought to turn back the clock to fall, reminding people that he had won an overwhelming victory — the largest in three decades, he said — that he said he took as affirmation to continue his bold leadership. “I will not let up,” he said. “I will insist we work together.”"

http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/23/conservative-commentator-author-dinesh-dsouza-indicted/?hpt=po_c2",0,"Conservative author Dinesh D’Souza was indicted Thursday on federal charges of violating campaign finance laws by using straw donors to funnel money to a U.S. Senate candidate. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced the grand jury charges in a statement Thursday. D'Souza is expected to be arraigned Friday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

D’Souza, who has written over a dozen books imparting his provocative views on religion and politics, could not be reached for comment Thursday evening. But his attorney, Benjamin Brafman, released a statement to reporters saying that D’Souza’s efforts to help a friend running for the Senate in 2012 was “at most” an “act of misguided friendship.”

""Mr. D'Souza did not act with any corrupt or criminal intent whatsoever,"" Brafman said in the statement. ""He and the candidate have been friends since their college days, and ""at worst, this was an act of misguided friendship by D'Souza. . .It is important to note that the indictment does not allege a corrupt relationship between Mr. D'Souza and the candidate.""

The indictment did not name the Senate candidate in the case. But it appears to be Wendy Long (R), who lost overwhelmingly in 2012 to incumbent Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat. Long raised less than $1 million for her long-shot campaign.

Read the indictment The U.S. District Court filed an indictment against Dinesh D'Souza alleging campaign finance fraud. Read it.

D'Souza, whose books include ""The Roots of Obama's Rage,"" went to Dartmouth College with Long and his name was listed on an invitation as co-hosting a fundraiser for Long during the campaign. Long, a former clerk to Supremc Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and D'Souza worked together on the Dartmouth Review, famous for its outspoken take on social and political topics.

The indictment was the result of a routine review by the FBI of campaign filings with the FEC by various candidates after the 2012 election, according to the U.S. Attorney's office.

""This office and the FBI take a zero tolerance approach to corruption of the electoral process,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. ""If, as alleged, the defendant directed others to make contributions to a Senate campaign and reimbursed them, that is a serious violation of federal campaign finance laws.""

D'Souza, who now lives in San Diego, has long been a lightning rod for controversy. In his 2010 book on Obama, he theorizes that Obama is motivated largely by the ""inherited rage"" of his absent Kenyan father.

The criminal charges, filed in U.S. District Court, allege that D'Souza in 2012 illegally reimbursed associates whom he asked to make donations valued at $20,000 to an unnamed Senate campaign. At the time, primary and general election campaign contributions to federal candidates were limited to $2,500 each from any individual to any single candidate.

Those limits on candidate donations have been dramatically surpassed by the increasingly common practice of using nonprofit groups as a vehicle to make unlimited contributions to independent political committees. Recent court decisions have sanctioned and encouraged large-dollar donations from individuals, unions and corporations, provided the funds are spent independently of a candidate's official campaign.

According to the indictment, D'Souza's straw donor scheme caused the campaign committee to falsely report to the FEC the sources of its contributions.

D'Souza was charged Thursday with one count of making illegal campaign contributions, which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison. He also is charged with one count of causing false statements to be made to the FEC, which carries a maximum of five years in prison."
1732,1732,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/01/30/what-henry-waxmans-retirement-tells-us-about-the-2014-election/,0,"Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) announced Thursday that he won't seek reelection to Congress this November. The lesson? Democrats aren't really counting on re-taking the House in 2014. Waxman is the fourth top Democrat on a House committee who has either called it quits or opted to run for another office, and a fifth -- House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) -- said this week that he's still weighing his options.

In other words, about 20 percent of the people who stand to become chairmen if Democrats re-take the House are choosing not to stick around (there are 20 standing committees in the House) -- and possibly 25 percent, if Peterson calls it quits.

""The House Democrats don't think they're going to be wielding the gavels,"" National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) told my colleague Paul Kane shortly after Waxman's retirement was announced.

Advertisement

The others headed out the door are Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) -- a classmate of Waxman's in the post-Watergate election of 1974 who announced his retirement earlier this month -- and Mike Michaud (D-Maine) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.). Michaud is running for governor, while Markey won a special election for Senate in June.

Share this article Share

In the latter two cases, leaving the House might have had as much or more to do with the fact that they had very winnable races for higher office sitting right in front of them. It's really Miller, Waxman and (potentially) Peterson who tell the story. All three would likely head up major House committees in a Democratic-led 114th Congress -- Miller on Education, Waxman on Energy and Commerce and Peterson on Agriculture.

Of course, age and electoral prospects play a role. Waxman and Miller are among the 11 longest-serving members of Congress, Waxman had his first tough race in decades in 2012, and Peterson is an emerging GOP target in a district that Mitt Romney won by 10 points in 2012. But all three were very likely to return to Congress if they ran again.

Advertisement

The fact that they aren't sticking around suggests the cost-benefit analysis of serving another two years versus their odds of becoming chairmen isn't looking great.

That's not to say Democrats have bigger retirement problems than the GOP (Republicans are clearly hurting more right now), or that it's impossible for Democrats to win back the House -- just that they these longtime members don't think it's worth sticking around to find out."

David Wildstein, a former Christie appointee who presided over the George Washington Bridge lane closures at the center of the controversy, said through a letter from his attorney that ""evidence exists . . . tying Mr. Christie to having knowledge of the lane closures, during the period when the lanes were closed, contrary to what the Governor stated publicly.""

Christie’s office denied the accusation.

Wildstein is the first Christie ally to publicly question the governor’s account, and his claim could further damage Christie as he tries to restore his image amid aggressive investigations by Democratic lawmakers and a federal prosecutor.

Also Friday, Bill Stepien, a longtime political adviser to Christie, said he would refuse to testify before the state legislative committee investigating the episode — raising the possibility that more damaging information could emerge.

Graphic Read the e-mails

Wildstein, who attended the same high school as Christie, was appointed by Christie to a position at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

In September, Wildstein and another of Christie’s top appointees at the Port Authority ordered the lane closures, causing four days of gridlock in Fort Lee, apparently as retribution against the town’s mayor for not endorsing Christie for reelection. Wildstein resigned in December.

“Mr. Wildstein contests the accuracy of various statements that the Governor made about him and he could prove the inaccuracy of some,” wrote his attorney, Alan L. Zegas.

The main purpose of the letter to the Port Authority was to argue that it should pay Wildstein’s legal fees during the investigations.

Wildstein gave almost no details about what he is asserting is untrue in Christie’s accounts. And he said nothing about what the important evidence is, or who has it.

Advertisement

That made it hard to judge what role Wildstein's letter — first reported by the New York Times — would play in the investigations.

In rejecting Wildstein’s accusations, a Christie aide said in an e-mail: “Mr. Wildstein’s lawyer confirms what the Governor has said all along — he had absolutely no prior knowledge of the lane closures before they happened and whatever Mr. Wildstein’s motivations were for closing them to begin with.”

The aide added: “As the Governor said in a December 13th press conference, he only first learned lanes were closed when it was reported by the press and as he said in a January 9th press conference, had no indication that this was anything other than a traffic study until he read otherwise the morning of January 8th. The Governor denies Mr. Wildstein’s lawyer’s other assertions.”

During a news conference in January, Christie said he had only recently learned that the closures had been ordered by his administration.

“I had no knowledge of this — of the planning, the execution or anything about it — and I first found out about it after it was over,” Christie said then. Even when he found out about it, he said then, “what I was told was that it was a traffic study.”

Christie’s supporters were quick Friday to rally behind the governor, a possible Republican presidential hopeful. Anthony Carbonetti, a GOP consultant and longtime friend of Christie, said Wildstein’s letter is “not a smoking gun.”

“If he had a smoking gun, he would have immunity already,” Carbonetti said. “Wildstein’s letter does not contradict Christie and it’s the work of someone who is trying to get his legal bills paid.”

In January, Wildstein pleaded the Fifth Amendment when he appeared with Zegas before a state assembly hearing about the traffic snarl.

In an interview last month, Zegas told The Washington Post that Wildstein is eager to share information, as long as state and federal prosecutors grant him immunity.

“My client is willing to speak freely if he is conferred immunity,” Zegas said. “If he is granted immunity, he will fully cooperate. In the meantime, he intends to fully comply with his legal obligations, and we will voluntarily supply more documents without redactions.”

Wildstein and Christie attended Livingston High School in northern New Jersey, with Wildstein graduating in 1979 and Christie in 1980. The school had about 600 students per class, and the two were vastly different. Christie was the hyper-social class president, and Wildstein an introvert. “We didn’t travel in the same circles in high school,” Christie said in his January news conference.

But they shared an interest.

“They both were associated with the baseball team at the same time, Chris as a player, David as a statistician,” said Tony Hope, a coach at Livingston at the time.

But, he said, Wildstein’s role with the team was mainly limited to watching games from the stands. “There was no friendship of Chris Christie and David Wildstein during their high school days,” Hope said. “A casual acquaintance, at best.”

In recent interviews, several of Christie’s fellow players said they did not recall Wildstein and Christie being close. “I think he was the manager or the assistant manager of the team,” said Mike Inga, a former player now living in San Diego. “He used to travel. But I never saw him and Chris hanging out. It definitely wasn’t somebody that he would consider a friend.”

The flurry of activity Friday created a fresh distraction for Christie, who has been busy preparing for Sunday’s Super Bowl, which will be held in East Rutherford, N.J.

He was undeterred Friday night, however, appearing at radio personality Howard Stern's birthday party in New York City and introducing rock star Jon Bon Jovi. Pictures on Twitter showed Christie, dressed in a suit, grasping a microphone as he addressed the glitzy crowd.

""Happy birthday, Howard,"" he said, according to an account in the Newark Star-Ledger. ""I'm here to bring all praise from New Jersey to Howard Stern."""

This worry was pronounced for people with preexisting conditions, but it was not limited to them. Consider families with young children in which one parent would like to get out of the formal labor market for a while to take care of the kids. In the old system, the choices of such couples were constrained if only one of the two received employer-provided family coverage.

Or ponder the fate of a 64-year-old with a condition that leaves her in great pain. She has the savings to retire but can’t exercise this option until she is eligible for Medicare. Is it a good thing to force her to stay in her job? Is it bad to open her job to someone else?

By broadening access to health insurance, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) ends the tyranny of ""job lock,"" which is what the much-misrepresented Congressional Budget Office (CBO) study of the law released Tuesday shows. The new law increases both personal autonomy and market rationality by ending the distortions in behavior the old arrangements were creating.

Follow this author E.J. Dionne Jr. 's opinions Follow

But that's not how the study has been interpreted, particularly by enemies of the law. Typical was a tweet from the National Republican Congressional Committee, declaring that ""#ObamaCare is hurting the economy, will cost 2.5 millions [sic] jobs.""

Will 2014 be the year of progressives? + 9 Post columnists E.J. Dionne and Katrina vanden Heuvel explain why the left should look forward to this year.

Glenn Kessler, The Post's intrepid fact checker, replied firmly: ""No, CBO did not say Obamacare will kill 2 million jobs."" What the report said, as the Wall Street Journal accurately summarized it, is that the law ""will reduce the total number of hours Americans work by the equivalent of 2.3 million full-time jobs.""

Advertisement

Oh my God, say opponents of the ACA, here is the government encouraging sloth! That’s true only if you wish to take away the choices the law gives that 64-year-old or to those parents looking for more time to care for their children. Many on the right love family values until they are taken seriously enough to involve giving parents/workers more control over their lives.

And it’s sometimes an economic benefit when some share of the labor force reduces hours or stops working altogether. At a time of elevated unemployment, others will take their place. The CBO was careful to underscore — the CBO is always careful — that “if some people seek to work less, other applicants will be readily available to fill those positions and the overall effect on employment will be muted.”

The CBO did point to an inevitable problem in how the ACA’s subsidies for buying health insurance operate. As your income rises, your subsidy goes down and eventually disappears. This is, as the CBO notes, a kind of “tax.” The report says that if the “subsidies are phased out with rising income in order to limit their total costs, the phaseout effectively raises people’s marginal tax rates (the tax rates applying to their last dollar of income), thus discouraging work.”

Advertisement

But the answer to this is either to make the law's subsidies more generous — which the ACA's detractors would oppose because, as the CBO suggests, doing so would cost more than the current law — or to guarantee everyone health insurance, single-payer style, so there would be no ""phaseout"" and no ""marginal tax rates."" I could go with this, but I doubt many of the ACA's critics would.

The rest of the CBO report contained much good news for Obamacare: Insurance premiums under the law are 15 percent lower than originally forecast, ""the slowdown in Medicare cost growth"" is ""broad and persistent"" and enrollments will catch up over time to where they would have been absent Obamacare's troubled rollout.

The reaction to the CBO study is an example of how willfully stupid — there’s no other word — the debate over Obamacare has become. Opponents don’t look to a painstaking analysis for enlightenment. They twist its findings and turn them into dishonest slogans. Too often, the media go along by highlighting the study’s political impact rather than focusing on what it actually says. My bet is that citizens are smarter than this. They will ignore the noise and judge Obamacare by how it works.

At the University of Michigan, students and faculty members are protesting the school’s use of Accenture to help cut costs, citing a report by a committee of alumni and graduate students that said the firm has “a disturbing pattern of problematic past performance.” In North Carolina, glitches in an Accenture-configured computer system contributed to massive backlogs for food-stamp recipients, leading the Obama administration last month to threaten to withdraw the state’s food-stamp funding.

Federal officials have also on occasion criticized the company's integrity. The U.S. Postal Service Inspector General's Office wrote in June that Accenture had ""demonstrated an absence of business ethics"" and said that the agency should consider terminating the firm's more than $200 million in contracts. The office cited in part a 2011 settlement with the Justice Department in which Accenture paid $63 million to resolve alle­gations of what the government called ""kickbacks"" and ""bid-

rigging"" in numerous federal contracts. The company denied wrongdoing in the case.

The Obama administration decided last month to select Accenture for the Affordable Care Act contract, perhaps the firm's

highest-profile job yet. Although the Web site has improved since its disastrous Oct. 1 launch, federal officials concluded that the previous contractor, CGI Federal, had not been effective enough in fixing the intricate computer system that underpins it, according to government documents and interviews.

Administration officials say that Accenture is uniquely qualified for the estimated $91 million, one-year contract because of its breadth of resources and experience in building major online systems for federal agencies such as the Census Bureau and the Education Department. The officials also cited the firm’s work on the California health-insurance marketplace, which has enrolled large numbers of residents in health plans despite suffering technical glitches.

An office built with the millennial worker in mind + 9 With its office in Arlington, Accenture wanted to reflect what it was consistently hearing from 20-something workers. The result is a space with a heavy emphasis on flexibility, mobility and connectivity.

“Accenture was selected to help us maintain the site’s high performance and make important enhancements as we prepare for next year’s open-enrollment period,’’ said Tasha Bradley, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

Accenture, which is based in Ireland and operates throughout the United States, is a consulting and technology powerhouse with $28 billion in annual revenue. It works with more than three-

quarters of Fortune 500 companies, maintains a thriving U.S. government practice and has a generally solid reputation, analysts and IT experts say.

Accenture officials defended their past performance and commitment to ethics, pointing out that the firm has received strong ratings from industry analysts. In the United States alone, they said, the company has successfully worked on more than 1,000 federal, state and local projects in the past year.

“Accenture is known for taking on the most complex and ­mission-critical assignments and getting the job done,’’ said Jim Mc­Avoy, a company spokesman. “We have long-term relationships with the world’s leading companies and our clients value our capabilities and our track record, and the quality of our work has been recognized.”

The firm’s federal subsidiary, Accenture Federal Services, was chosen by CMS over three other companies for HealthCare.gov in what one CMS document described as an “abbreviated” process. A CMS official said that the agency did a thorough analysis of Accenture’s record.

“Past performance was a key criteria when evaluating Accenture’s potential to serve as the new contractor,’’ said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal decision making.

But during the past decade, nearly 30 Accenture projects in the United States and abroad have encountered problems, including technical malfunctions and cost overruns, according to interviews, media accounts, government audits and other records.

Accenture officials declined to answer questions about specific projects the company has previously performed.

“There is nobody in the government-contracting space with an unblemished record,’’ said Steven L. Schooner, a former senior federal procurement official who co-directs the government procurement law program at George Washington University. “You assume everyone comes with baggage. The fundamental issue is, I hope the government did sufficient research to find out who the most qualified firms were and to weigh the positives and negatives.’’

John Belden, a senior executive at UpperEdge, a Boston firm that advises companies on major IT projects, agreed that Accenture is “at the top of the stack” in the IT industry.

But, he said, Accenture is at a disadvantage on a project as politically sensitive as HealthCare.gov, because the company lacks experience in federal health care. Less than half of 1 percent of Accenture’s $10 billion in U.S. federal contracts since 2000 have involved CMS, according to data compiled by USAspending.gov.

“Understanding those systems rapidly — that’s going to be an issue,’’ Belden said.

Company officials said the firm has substantial experience with health-care projects at the state and local levels.

Arthur Andersen roots

Accenture is descended from the onetime venerable accounting firm Arthur Andersen. In 1989, a group of Andersen partners resigned to form Andersen Consulting, which was legally separate but under the same umbrella organization.

In 2001, Andersen Consulting changed its name to Accenture. Arthur Andersen went out of business the following year because of its role in the Enron accounting scandal; Accenture had no role in that scandal.

By then, Accenture was an industry giant and experiencing problems with some of its projects.

Between 2004 and 2007, the Pentagon and four states canceled Accenture contracts to develop online voting or voter-

registration systems, citing problems such as software flaws and inadequate computer security. At the time, Accenture defended its work on the projects, and in some instances blamed state officials or workers for the difficulties.

In Texas, state officials encountered difficulties with an Accenture contract to operate call centers to process social-service benefits applications. The system led to ""massive delays"" in access to food stamps and health care for hundreds of thousands of low-

income residents, said Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Texas-based Center for Public Policy Priorities.

In the District, an Accenture-developed city tax office computer system often incorrectly calculated penalties and interest for tax bills, according to a 2006 report by the Wendell Group, an outside IT firm. “Accenture has provided a poorly designed tax accounting system and mismanaged this poor design,” said the report, which also blamed District officials for poor oversight.

Accenture’s occasional problems also extended to the federal level. A 2007 report by the Interior Department’s inspector general blasted the firm’s work on a computer system for the Minerals Management Service, which regulated the oil industry. One accountant told auditors that the system took 15 times as long as the one it replaced.

The inspector general at the time, Earl Devaney, recalled in an interview that he “could not understand why Accenture had not been thrown out the door. Millions of dollars, and they still hadn’t gotten this up and running after all that time.’’

‘Probably the best choice’

Some experts in federal contracting warn that Accenture’s record is worrisome, while others say there is no better firm to take on the troubles of HealthCare.gov.

Daniel I. Gordon, who headed government procurement policy earlier in the Obama administration and is now associate dean for government procurement law studies at George Washington University, said: ""There is a real concern. This company has problems in their past performance that are relevant and recent. . . . The real question is whether the government did its due diligence.''

In contrast, Larry Allen, president of McLean-based Allen Federal Business Partners and a 24-year federal IT professional, called Accenture “a very solid firm” and said that all major contractors have some problems, because large IT projects are so complex.

“I think their error rate is pretty consistent with other large firms,’’ Allen said. “Does that excuse things they did wrong? No, but it does put it into context.’’"

Washington CNN —

Vice President Joe Biden sounded like someone who wants to be President when he spoke to CNN’s “New Day” on Friday.

He talked about America’s potential and its role as a global leader, as well as his commitment to helping the middle class. He never mentioned the overwhelming early favorite for the 2016 Democratic nomination – former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

What would the Democrats do without Clinton in 2016?

Clearly Biden, the longtime senator who now is the White House conduit to blue-collar union workers essential to Democratic support, is seriously considering a presidential run.

Asked by CNN’s Kate Bolduan when he would decide, Biden answered a realistic timetable would be the summer of 2015.

That response, and a closer look at Biden’s words Friday, also show that if Clinton decides to run – as expected – then Biden will step aside.

“He is effectively saying, look, it depends on what Hillary Clinton decides to do,” noted Gloria Borger, CNN’s chief political analyst.

Here are some of Biden’s remarks in the interview with Bolduan, and a look at what he was really saying:

1) “There may be reasons I don’t run, but there’s no obvious reason for me why I think I should not run.”

Biden is hedging his bets. He acknowledges it may not happen, but makes clear the reason won’t be because he doesn’t want to or isn’t qualified for the job.

That’s another way of saying there are circumstances beyond his control, meaning a Clinton decision to enter the race.

Supporters are already raising money for the former first lady and senator who served with Biden in President Barack Obama’s Cabinet and would be the nation’s first woman President.

First on CNN: Ready for Hillary heads to South Carolina

Clinton has said she will make up her mind sometime in 2014. Polls show her with a commanding lead over other possible Democratic contenders, including Biden.

CNN/ORC Poll: Christie’s loss appears to be Clinton’s gain

2) “Realistically, a year this summer.”

Biden’s answer when Bolduan asks for a timetable for his decision is the clearest signal that his choice depends on whether Clinton runs.

To Peter Hamby, CNN Digital’s national political reporter, waiting until the middle of 2015 – just six months or so before the Iowa caucuses – would be way too late to take on Clinton.

“If these guys are going to get in and run for president, whoever it is, challenging Hillary Clinton, they really have to start laying groundwork,” Hamby said. “They have to raise money and hire staff and recruit volunteers in these early states.”

Hillary Clinton’s Iowa problem

As vice president, Biden has the advantage of constant media focus if desired, which would help him maintain a high profile without some of the normal steps of mounting a presidential campaign.

That could help if Clinton doesn’t run and lesser-known contenders such as Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley enter the race. However, Biden’s lag in announcing his candidacy would leave him at a huge disadvantage against a Clinton campaign expected to have the backing of the party machinery.

Does Obama secretly support Hillary Clinton for 2016?

3) “Am I the best qualified person to focus on the two things I’ve spent my whole life on – give ordinary people a fighting chance to make it and a sound foreign policy that’s based on national interest of the United States, where we not only are known for the power of our military, but the power of our example.”

Biden lays out his rationale for running, stressing his two major strengths as a candidate – foreign policy and working-class ties.

As the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden has the necessary foreign policy credentials, particularly against candidate ABC (Anybody But Clinton). However, her four years as secretary of state negates some or all of a Biden advantage.

On appealing to middle class workers, Biden showed his strength in the 2010 and 2012 elections when he went to states such as Ohio where Obama was less popular.

In Clinton, though, he would face the wife of former President Bill Clinton, who remains extremely popular among traditional Democratic constituencies.

In Friday’s interview, Biden didn’t mention Hillary Clinton by name, but she is the biggest factor in whether he goes for it.

4) “It doesn’t mean I’m the only guy that can do it, but if no one else I think can and I think I can, then I will. If I don’t I won’t.”

The vice president sums up his future decision with two qualifiers – that no else runs who can do what he can, and that he still thinks he can deliver the goods.

Biden could decide that he is better qualified than Clinton on what he considers the key issues, but he would have to think twice if her already anticipated campaign has started strongly and generated initial momentum.

If he were to run and win in 2016, Biden would be 74 when he took office, making him the oldest ever to begin a presidency. By the end of his first term, he would be the oldest U.S. President in history.

So while he remains energetic and passionate, talking about getting his Corvette Z06 from zero to 60 in 3.4 seconds, the clock is ticking and Biden knows it.

It is nearly seven in 10.

For the second time in a year, the Obama administration is giving certain employers extra time before they must offer health insurance to almost all their full-time workers. Under new rules announced Monday by Treasury Department officials, employers with 50 to 99 workers will be given until 2016 — two years longer than originally envisioned under the Affordable Care Act — before they risk a federal penalty for not complying.

Companies with 100 workers or more are getting a different kind of one-year grace period. Instead of being required in 2015 to offer coverage to 95 percent of full-time workers, these bigger employers can avoid a fine by offering insurance to 70 percent of them next year.

How the administration would define employer requirements has been one of the biggest remaining questions about the way the 2010 health-care law will work in practice — and has sparked considerable lobbying. By providing the dual phase-ins for employers of different sizes, administration officials have sought to lighten the burden on the small share of affected employers that have not offered insurance in the past.

As word of the delays spread Monday, many across the ideological spectrum viewed them as an effort by the White House to defuse another health-care controversy before the fall midterm elections. The new postponements won over part, but not all, of the business community. And they caught consumer advocates, usually reliable White House allies, by surprise, particularly because administration officials had already announced in July that the employer requirements would be postponed from this year until 2015.

Congressional Republicans seized on the announcement as the latest justification for scrapping the health-care law. In particular, they renewed their opposition to the law’s requirement that most Americans have insurance, saying it is unfair to delay rules for businesses and not for individuals.

“If unilateral delays were an Olympic sport, the White House would sweep the gold, silver, and bronze,” House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said in a statement. “The White House is in full panic mode, and rather than putting politics ahead of the public, it is time for fairness for all.”

Originally, the employer mandate — which affects companies employing 72 percent of all Americans — was to have gone into effect Jan. 1, at the same time the law began requiring most Americans to have health insurance.

A senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the proposal on the condition of anonymity shortly before the rule became public, said the Treasury Department decided to allow medium-size businesses more latitude because they “need a little more time to adjust to providing coverage.”

The law says that anyone who works 30 hours or more is a full-time employee, and it compels many employers to offer affordable insurance to those workers and their dependents. It defines affordable as premiums of no more than 9.5 percent of an employee’s income, and employers must pay for the equivalent of 60 percent of the actuarial value of a worker’s coverage. Businesses that fail to do so will eventually face a fine of up to $2,000 for each employee not offered coverage, though workers are not required to sign up for the benefits.

Under the health-care law, small employers — those with fewer than 50 workers — do not have to offer insurance. Instead, they will be allowed to buy health plans through new marketplaces created under the law. Because of hardware and software problems, the federal small-business marketplace, which was supposed to open in October, will not become available until the fall.

But until now, the government had not spelled out important details. Nor had it defined exactly what insurance benefits must be covered by employer-sponsored health plans.

Administration officials said Monday that they will issue a separate set of rules in coming weeks that will cover related questions about how employers must report their workers’ insurance status to the government.

Trade associations — which represent many of the U.S. businesses affected by the new requirements — had a mixed reaction to the rule.

The National Restaurant Association, whose nearly 500,000 members were concerned because many industry employees work odd schedules and do not receive benefits, lauded the phase-in. “It’s welcome news, as is anything that helps employers figure this out and gives them time to comply,” said the group’s director of labor and workforce policy, Michelle Neblett, who noted that many members do not yet have systems in place to keep track of worker hours.

But Joe Trauger, the National Association of Manufacturers’ vice president of human resources policy, said businesses will still face massive new compliance costs under the law. “What they’ve released is doing what they can to make some things that are not great policy more livable,” Trauger said. “But at the end of the day, it’s not great policy.”

Ron Pollack, executive director of the consumer lobby Families USA and an ally of the administration, said he was ""very surprised"" by the new postponements. He contended that, because most large employers already offer insurance, the law's requirements are not that burdensome. But Pollack added that for workers at large companies that do not provide coverage, ""it's very unfortunate . . . that they don't have a guarantee it will be extended to them for quite some time.""

Senior administration officials said the latest postponement will have little real-world impact, because the vast majority of employers have fewer than 50 workers.

But employees of bigger companies represent a much larger fraction of the U.S. workforce, with nearly seven in 10 at companies and other organizations that employ 100 or more people.

The extra time before certain employers must offer insurance is among a variety of specifics that Treasury Department officials spelled out for the first time in the final rule they issued late Monday afternoon. Each addressed an issue that, while narrow, had become controversial among certain constituencies.

For instance, the rule pleased fire companies, which had feared that the government might have required them to offer insurance to volunteer firefighters and other first responders. The rule also said that educators who have summers off are nonetheless to be treated as full-time workers entitled to be offered coverage. Adjunct faculty members will be counted as working 2.25 hours for ever hour in the classroom. And the rule said that seasonal workers — such as farm workers or extra department-store hires around Christmastime — are considered full time only if they work for at least half the year.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/12/politics/senate-debt-ceiling/index.html?hpt=po_c2",0,"After a dramatic vote, the Senate cleared the critical 60-vote threshold Wednesday that allowed for passage of legislation to suspend the Treasury’s borrowing limit. The cliffhanger vote was scheduled for 15 minutes, but it lasted an hour. It ended when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his leadership team voted to end a potential GOP filibuster, casting votes that left them exposed to attacks from conservative opponents.

After the filibuster threat was choked off, the Senate approved the debt ceiling legislation on a party-line vote, 55 to 43, sending it on to President Obama for his signature, ensuring that the Treasury will not default on more than $17 trillion in federal debt.

Stock markets, already jittery this month, started a slow but steady drop throughout the 2 o'clock hour as the vote looked in doubt, ending the day down slightly. The votes came two weeks before the Feb. 27 deadline established by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, after which experts warned of havoc in financial markets if Congress did not act.

Democrats were relieved at the outcome. “It was painful to watch,” Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.) said afterward.

View Graphic Since 1980, the debt ceiling has been raised 42 times.

That followed Tuesday’s vote in the Republican-controlled House, which required overwhelming Democratic support to approve the legislation.

The bill, which passed the House by a 221 to 201 vote, received the support of just 28 Republicans. In previous years, House Republicans had proved to be the greatest obstacles in striking compromise fiscal deals. So after the Tuesday vote, Senate approval was expected to be a pro forma matter.

Instead, Wednesday turned into a wild ride in the Senate. All the political unrest that has roiled the Republican Party in recent years — the establishment vs. conservative outsiders who threaten incumbent Republicans with primary challenges from the right — was on full display.

As he has for the past year, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) placed himself at the center of the day's action. McConnell and Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) had sought to allow a simple majority – all Democrats – to approve the suspension of the debt limit until March 2015. But Cruz refused to go along, forcing more complicated procedural moves. That infuriated his Republican colleagues, because it meant that at least five GOP senators would have to vote with the Democrats to end the filibuster.

“Today was a classic victory for Washington establishment interests, and the people who lost today are the American people,” Cruz told reporters after the vote. He said he didn’t regret forcing 12 Republicans into a vote that could hurt them with conservative voters in GOP primaries.

“It should have been an easy vote,” he said. Cruz declined to say whether he supported McConnell’s continued leadership of the Republican caucus. “That is ultimately a decision . . . for the voters of Kentucky,” he said before ducking into an elevator.

McConnell is facing a difficult reelection bid. If he fends off a challenge by a conservative businessman in the Republican primary, he will confront Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes in the general election in November.

Republicans had been trying to warm up to their relatively new colleague after openly feuding with him in the fall, but Wednesday's actions brought out Cruz's critics again. ""There was no endgame there,"" said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). ""There was no stated outcome by anyone other than a clean debt ceiling. We can put the country through two weeks of turmoil, or we can get this vote done.""

The drama came at 2 p.m. as Republicans exited a closed-door lunch without a clear plan for how many would join with the 55 members of the Democratic caucus to end the filibuster, but they were determined to avoid having the vote fail and create financial uncertainty as the deadline neared.

Early in the vote, just two or three Republicans had given their support on the procedural vote. A long standoff ensued. Attention focused on Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who has supported many recent compromises with Democrats but was initially unwilling to stick her neck out without a lot of support from other senior Republicans.

""I got a chance to visit with a lot of close friends,"" Murkowski joked afterward, alluding to the many huddles she had on the floor with McConnell.

Murkowski lost her 2010 Republican primary to a tea party-backed challenger but then won the general election as a write-in candidate.

At that point, McConnell’s leadership team was unanimously opposed to cutting off the filibuster, but in a surprise move, the GOP leader and his top deputy, Minority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.), stepped up to vote yes.

Rank-and-file Republicans appreciated the tough votes by McConnell and Cornyn.

""They did what they thought was best for the party and the future of the caucus. I think people appreciate that,"" said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who is facing a collection of primary challengers this year. Graham voted to sustain the filibuster.

“They were leaders who led,” Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), who was one of the first yes votes among Republicans, told reporters."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/19/world/europe/ukraine-protests/index.html?hpt=hp_t1",0,"President Viktor Yanukovych met with opposition political leaders Wednesday evening and announced that they had reached an agreement on a truce to end the fighting that broke out Tuesday and has left at least 26 dead. The two sides also said they had agreed to resume negotiations toward a settlement. They met after a day that brought signs of turmoil within Yanukovych’s government, including the unexplained dismissal of the chief military commander.

Despite the truce, there were reports of fighting early Thursday morning between protesters and police in Kiev.

The development came as U.S. and European leaders condemned the violence and the United States said it was imposing visa sanctions on 20 Ukrainian officials. Russia, meanwhile, condemned the opposition.

The pressure on Ukraine — internal and external — has only increased, and the two sides are so far apart that reconciliation appears impossible. They are now faced with the challenge of getting the country back on track even without reconciling politically.

The hostility between Yanukovych and the political opposition is deep and intense, and now has been paid for in blood. Regional differences are flaring, with governors in the east near the Russian border denouncing the protesters and demanding a crackdown, while in the west, cities are declaring virtual autonomy from the central government. Opposition leaders, for their part, are leading a movement that includes hard-line militants who are not keen on political compromise.

Abroad, the Western nations and Russia blamed each other for supporting one of the two sides in Ukraine’s long-running political crisis.

The country, which has experienced regular bouts of political turmoil since the downfall of the Soviet Union two decades ago — but never the sort of violence seen Tuesday — appears to be at a point of fracture.

That may now be extending to the government itself.

As fires continued to burn Wednesday on the Maidan, or Independence Square, forming a buffer of flame and thick greasy smoke between protesters and police, the state security service announced that it was launching an “anti-terrorist operation.” A little while later, the Defense Ministry said it might join in.

It appeared as though a serious escalation was in the works. But then Yanukovych fired his chief military commander Wednesday evening.

Col. Gen. Volodymyr Zamana was quoted a month ago as saying that the armed forces should never be used against Ukrainian civilians, and this may have been the reason for his ouster.

The Ukrainian army is not as well-funded or powerful a force as the Interior Ministry. Nonetheless, it wields heavy weaponry that the opposition fears may come into play.

U.S. military leaders have been unable for the past several days to reach their Ukrainian counterparts to warn them against getting involved in the crisis, a senior U.S. official said Wednesday night, and this is a matter of some concern.

Ukraine’s military has joined with NATO in Iraq and Afghanistan and has particularly close relations with the Polish military. But Poland has been Yanukovych’s most vocal critic, and that may leave him uncertain of his own army’s loyalty in a fight portrayed as East vs. West.

Later in the evening, the security service said that although it was making preparations for an anti-terrorist operation, it had not put one into effect, according to the Interfax news agency.

All this has left Ukrainians wondering whether a crackdown is coming and, if so, how effective it might be given the conflicting pressures on the beleaguered country.

Small but violent protests Wednesday left several people wounded and one reported dead in the Black Sea port of Odessa and in the western city of Khmelnytskyy.

In the east — in Donetsk, Yanukovych’s home town, and Kharkov — governors talked tough about defeating the protests.

But the city of Lviv in western Ukraine effectively declared itself autonomous of the central government. In nearby Ivano-Frankivsk, the local commander of the security forces pledged not to carry out or give any illegal orders.

Obama warns both sides

The Russian Foreign Ministry, which backs Yanukovych, said Tuesday’s violence was an attempted coup by the opposition, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called on Western countries to use their influence with the opposition to force it into negotiations with the government.

The White House and the European Union strongly criticized Yanukovych earlier Wednesday, blaming him for the violence.

President Obama had warnings for both Yanukovych and protest leaders.

“I want to be very clear as we work through these next several days in Ukraine that we’re going to be watching closely and we expect the Ukrainian government to show restraint, to not resort to violence in dealing with peaceful protesters,” Obama said. “We’ve also said we expect peaceful protesters to remain peaceful, and we’ll be monitoring very closely the situation, recognizing that with our European partners and the international community there will be consequences if people step over the line.”

E.U. Commission President Jos

Manuel Barroso expressed “shock and utter dismay” Wednesday over the “violence and use of excessive force,” which he blamed on Ukraine’s “political leadership.” He said he expects the E.U. to agree on “targeted measures against those responsible.”

The Swedish foreign minister, Carl Bildt, said Yanukovych ""has blood on his hands.""

Bildt said Ukraine would have been on its way to a better future by now, with a trade agreement with the E.U., were it not for threats from Moscow.

The foreign ministers of Poland, Germany and France intend to travel here Thursday to hold talks about the crisis and then to Brussels for an E.U. meeting to consider targeted sanctions against Ukrainian officials.

Authorities said that 800 people have been injured, and that of the 26 killed, 10 were Interior Ministry troops.

There have been guarded expressions of unease within the ruling Party of Regions over the violence. Ukraine is without a prime minister a month after Mykola Azarov was forced from office. Rinat Akhmetov, an oligarch once very close to Yanu­kovych, has called for an end to violence by both sides.

If an “anti-terrorist” campaign begins, it is not clear what it will entail or how effectively it can be carried out. Government officials say hard-line protesters have stolen 1,500 firearms during the three months of demonstrations and have used them against police.

A special operation would presumably give the security service the authority to seize people and property without court orders for a specified period.

Vice President Biden has warned Yanukovych several times — most recently on Tuesday — against declaring a state of emergency.

The Defense Ministry denied that armored units were moving to Kiev. Paratroop battalions have been deployed to guard Defense Ministry sites, but not to take part in an attack on protesters, officials said.

Focus on rightists

Yanukovych, echoing the Russians, has said that the top political leaders of the opposition must disassociate themselves from the right-wingers among the protesters who have done most of the fighting with police.

Helmeted young militants of the group that calls itself Pravy Sektor have without question complicated the role of more moderate political leaders and, in important ways, have helped set the opposition agenda.

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-21/russia-says-ukraine-failing-to-halt-extremists-seeking-civil-war.html",0,"Russia warned Monday that Ukraine's government is igniting a civil war in the eastern regions of the country, and it said Moscow is prepared to step in if those efforts do not stop. Ukrainian officials said Moscow has already stepped in — and that is the problem. Mounting photographic evidence suggests that Russian special forces have been active in eastern Ukraine for at least the past week, in support of pro-Russian militants.

And residents in the restive regions who are opposed to Russia were beginning to speak out Monday against Moscow.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s warning about Russian intervention was the most explicit declaration yet of his country’s intentions toward eastern Ukraine. It came as Vice President Biden arrived in Kiev for a two-day visit to meet with political leaders, civil society groups and American diplomats.

Biden brought a commitment of U.S. economic assistance. He also warned Russia that future intervention in Ukraine’s volatile east will incur new costs.

But the Russian threats held out the possibility that Moscow will be on the move — and soon.

“Those who are deliberately pursuing a civil war, in a possible attempt to start a big, serious bloody conflict, are pursuing a criminal policy,” Lavrov said. “And we will not only condemn this policy, but will also stop it.”

A tentative agreement reached Thursday in Geneva by Ukraine, Russia, the European Union and the United States has gained little traction. The armed pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine have not abandoned the buildings they have occupied, defying the pact.

Geoffrey Pyatt, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said Monday evening that Washington wants to see movement under the accord in “days, not weeks.”

Lavrov, in contrast, lashed out at the new Ukrainian government for “flagrantly” refusing to dismantle the protest camp at Kiev’s Independence Square, known as the Maidan, about 350 miles west of the disputed regions. It was the epicenter of the months-long protest against now-ousted President Viktor Yanukovych. Lavrov demanded that the camp be dispersed at once as a prerequisite for further de-escalation.

On Sunday, three people were killed in a shootout near the eastern city of Slovyansk. Lavrov said the residents of the surrounding Donetsk region craved Russian protection.

“There has been a surge in appeals to Russia to save them from this outrage,” he said at a news conference here in Moscow, invoking a time-honored Russian rationale for military intervention in another country. “We are being put into an extremely complex position.”

Pro-unity forces speak out

As Russia shook its fist, residents of eastern Ukraine who want to remain unified under a central government in Kiev began to publicly oppose the pro-Russian agitators.

In the port of Mariupol and the industrial city of Khartsyzk, residents staged some of the first “pro-unity” rallies in the region.

Protected by a low-key police presence, businessman Vyacheslav Redko stood before a crowd in front of the Soviet-era Palace of Culture in Khartsyzk and demanded that authorities take down the Russian flag now flying above City Hall and remove the barricade of tires at the entrance.

“It is a myth that everyone here wants to join our big brother Russia,” Redko said afterward. “But our side has not been heard, because people are scared or intimidated or they assume they cannot win.”

Redko said he was surprised to see a few hundred of his neighbors at the rally. He would have been happy with a few dozen. “For Khartsyzk? This is a big deal,” he said.

A dozen people mounted the steps of the palace. One elderly pensioner sang a popular Ukrainian folk song. A retired teacher of Russian literature complained that his former students, now pro-Russian activists, had roughed him up for supporting Ukrainian unity.

“We’re afraid of a war with Putin. We know his troops are on the border. But I think the more people see that they are not alone, the bigger these rallies will become,” said Lyudmila Pogromskaya, an English-language instructor, referring to the Russian president.

""The people's mayor"" of Slovyansk, Vladimir Ponomaryov, told Russian reporters that self-defense militia members in the city have detained 20 people suspected of spying for Kiev. One of them was Ukrainian journalist and activist Irma Krat, who was shown on Russian TV blindfolded and being escorted by local militia members.

He also said that two bodies have been pulled from the river that runs through the city. The victims, members of the pro-Russian group Donetsk People’s Republic, had been stabbed to death, he said. It was not possible to confirm the claim.

Biden pays visit

Biden, whose main meetings in Kiev are scheduled to take place Tuesday, is the most senior Obama administration official to visit Ukraine since its crisis with Russia began two months ago, leading to Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s autonomous Crimea region last month.

The challenge presented by pro-Russian groups in eastern Ukraine has become “the most acute” facing the country’s leadership, said a senior U.S. official traveling with Biden.

“There are currently ongoing threats to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the most effective response to that is for all of Ukraine to pull together,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the trip.

Pyatt said Ukrainians “are now wondering what comes next and are looking for reassurance that the United States is going to stand by Ukraine.”

Biden is expected to announce a new U.S. technical-support package aimed at boosting Ukraine’s economy, energy sector and political reform efforts in the run-up to presidential and mayoral elections next month.

In the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, just over the border from Ukraine, Yanukovych called Monday for a pullback of Ukrainian forces from the east and the holding of regional referendums on federalization of the country before presidential and parliamentary elections are held.

Otherwise, Ukraine risks civil war, he said in a statement released to news agencies. The referendums should be held under an international system of control and observation, he said.

“This is the only way to preserve the integrity of Ukraine,” his statement said. “If this is not done, our country will be threatened with fragmentation, which would hardly be a peaceful process. A civil war would be more likely. Come back to your senses! You are setting brother against brother, while somebody else would take advantage of this disaster.”"

I'm not a global warming denier. I've long believed that it cannot be good for humanity to be spewing tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. I also believe that those scientists who pretend to know exactly what this will cause in 20, 30 or 50 years are white-coated propagandists.

""The debate is settled,"" asserted propagandist in chief Barack Obama in his latest State of the Union address. ""Climate change is a fact."" Really? There is nothing more anti-scientific than the very idea that science is settled, static, impervious to challenge. Take a non-climate example. It was long assumed that mammograms help reduce breast cancer deaths. This fact was so settled that Obamacare requires every insurance plan to offer mammograms (for free, no less) or be subject to termination.

Now we learn from a massive randomized study — 90,000 women followed for 25 years — that mammograms may have no effect on breast cancer deaths. Indeed, one out of five of those diagnosed by mammogram receives unnecessary radiation, chemo or surgery.

So much for settledness. And climate is less well understood than breast cancer. If climate science is settled, why do its predictions keep changing? And how is it that the great physicist Freeman Dyson, who did some climate research in the late 1970s, thinks today's climate-change Cassandras are hopelessly mistaken?

They deal with the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere and oceans, argues Dyson, ignoring the effect of biology, i.e., vegetation and topsoil. Further, their predictions rest on models they fall in love with: ""You sit in front of a computer screen for 10 years and you start to think of your model as being real."" Not surprisingly, these models have been ""consistently and spectacularly wrong"" in their predictions, write atmospheric scientists Richard McNider and John Christy — and always, amazingly, in the same direction.

Settled? Even Britain's national weather service concedes there's been no change — delicately called a ""pause"" — in global temperature in 15 years. If even the raw data is recalcitrant, let alone the assumptions and underlying models, how settled is the science?

But even worse than the pretense of settledness is the cynical attribution of any politically convenient natural disaster to climate change, a clever term that allows you to attribute anything — warming and cooling, drought and flood — to man’s sinful carbon burning.

Accordingly, Obama ostentatiously visited drought-stricken California last Friday. Surprise! He blamed climate change. Here even the New York Times gagged, pointing out that far from being supported by the evidence, ""the most recent computer projections suggest that as the world warms, California should get wetter, not drier, in the winter.""

How inconvenient. But we've been here before. Hurricane Sandy was made the poster child for the alleged increased frequency and strength of ""extreme weather events"" like hurricanes.

Similarly tornadoes. Every time one hits, the climate-change commentary begins. Yet last year saw the fewest in a quarter-century. And the last 30 years — of presumed global warming — has seen a 30 percent decrease in extreme tornado activity (F3 and above) versus the previous 30 years.

None of this is dispositive. It doesn’t settle the issue. But that’s the point. It mocks the very notion of settled science, which is nothing but a crude attempt to silence critics and delegitimize debate.

Washington CNN —

Republicans call it a government cover-up similar to what forced Richard Nixon to resign. Democrats call it a right-wing conspiracy theory.

The fallout from the September 11, 2012, terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans continues more than 19 months later, with further details last week that raised questions about how the Obama administration responded to the violence less than two months before the President’s re-election.

Few issues reveal the hyper-partisan politics of Washington more than the ongoing debate over an issue now known simply as Benghazi.

Last Friday, House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa announced that he had subpoenaed Secretary of State John Kerry to testify at a May 21 hearing, alleging that the State Department failed to comply with an earlier subpoena for documents.

House Speaker John Boehner followed up by announcing a special congressional committee led by a Republican colleague would investigate the matter. The House voted on party lines Thursday to create the panel, but Democrats have yet to decide if they will take part in what they claim could be a Republican-led witch hunt.

GOP-led House votes to establish select committee on Benghazi

Hillary Clinton: No reason for new Benghazi committee

Issa called the administration’s lack of compliance “in violation of any reasonable transparency or historic precedent at least since Richard Milhous Nixon.”

At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney shot back that Republicans continued trying to reap political benefit with what he called conspiracy theories about a Benghazi cover-up.

“What we have seen since hours after the attack, beginning with a statement by the Republican nominee for president, is an attempt by Republicans to politicize a tragedy, and that continues today,” Carney told reporters, adding that “what hasn’t changed has been the effort by Republicans to … claim a conspiracy when they haven’t been able to find one.”

Here are some answers to questions about the latest twists in the story:

What happened in Benghazi?

In September of 2012, a demeaning video made in the United States about the Prophet Mohammed got posted on YouTube and sparked protests at U.S. embassies in the Muslim world.

On September 11, the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, an assault occurred at a U.S. compound in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

The Obama administration initially blamed the Benghazi attack on a protest against the video that escalated into a full-blown tactical assault. As details emerged in ensuing days, it became clear that an al Qaeda-affiliated group took part in what was a coordinated terrorist attack instead of a spontaneous demonstration.

Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton created a special panel called an Accountability Review Board to investigate what happened.

The group led by former Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen and retired U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering criticized aspects of diplomatic security and made 29 recommendations, all of which were accepted by the State Department.

Why all the controversy?

Coming less than two months before the presidential election, the Benghazi attack quickly became a political flashpoint.

President Barack Obama had campaigned heavily on his decision to approve the mission that killed Osama bin Laden and boasted of putting the al Qaeda leader’s organization “on the run.”

On September 16, five days after the Benghazi attack, then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice went on Sunday talk shows and said the assault grew out of a protest against the controversial video.

Republicans immediately challenged the administration’s version of what happened, calling it an attempt by the Obama administration to hide a major security breakdown that signaled the broader failed policy in the region.

Obama won re-election in November, but Republicans have mounted congressional investigations into what happened in Benghazi and why Rice gave an incorrect explanation to the American people.

What is the Benghazi email everyone is talking about?

Last Tuesday, the conservative group Judicial Watch made public State Department documents it received in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.

One of the documents was a previously undisclosed email on September 14, 2012, from Ben Rhodes, a national security official specializing in communications, that listed talking points for Rice about the protests that had erupted at U.S. embassies and compounds in the Muslim world.

Among the goals listed in the Rhodes email was to “underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy.”

Republicans contend the email proves White House manipulation of the messaging for political purposes in the immediate aftermath of Benghazi, despite the administration’s contention that Rice relied on talking points provided by the CIA for the sake of uniformity of messaging.

“This is all about an effort to convince the American people that the president of the United States had everything under control,” GOP Sen. John McCain said.

Boehner and other Republicans questioned why the Rhodes email wasn’t included in documents that the State Department provided to Congress under the earlier subpoena.

In announcing the new subpoena of Kerry, Issa cited what he called “a disturbing disregard for the (State) Department’s legal obligations to Congress.”

Carney argued that the Rhodes email referred to the broader topic of protests throughout the Muslim world, rather than the specific Benghazi attack.

Meanwhile, a State Department spokeswoman took issue with Issa’s latest subpoena, telling reporters it was a political stunt.

Noting Kerry was scheduled to be out of the country on the date of the hearing in the subpoena, Marie Harf said Issa’s committee “would have known if they reached out to us instead of issuing a subpoena.”

Is this new or just more of what we already knew?

The existence of the Rhodes email is new, and that provides Republicans with a fresh front in their attacks on the administration over Benghazi.

Labeling the situation a “defiance of the House’s subpoena power,” Boehner called it “the most flagrant example yet of the administration’s contempt for the American people’s right to know the truth about what happened when four Americans died in a fiery terrorist attack.”

However, the messaging contained in the Rhodes email is the same as included in previously released documents, such as the CIA talking points that Rice relied on.

Carney noted that the only reference in the Rhodes email to Benghazi – denying that there was actionable intelligence ahead of time of an imminent assault – was lifted from the CIA talking points.

I thought the government promised to release all information?

The Obama administration previously pledged to release all pertinent information on Benghazi sought by Congress. Carney noted that it turned over 25,000 pages of documents and that various officials testified at a series of hearings by various congressional committees investigating the matter.

Asked why the Rhodes email obtained by Judicial Watch hadn’t been turned over previously, Carney said it came under a FOIA request that differed from the congressional subpoenas from Issa’s committee.

Underlying Carney’s explanation was that the Rhodes email referred to the broader issue of protests rather than the specific Benghazi attack, which was the focus of the subpoenas.

The talking points supplied by Rhodes were intended to prepare Rice for possible questions in her talk show appearances, he said, calling the document a normal duty of a communications officer in any government.

Republicans questioned that explanation, noting the Benghazi attack would clearly be the dominant topic that Rice would face and arguing the administration clearly knew that.

What’s the upshot of all this?

For Republicans, the issue resonates with their conservative base, especially the accusation that the administration failed to provide proper security for American diplomats and was unable to send military assets to respond to the Benghazi attack.

At a hearing last week by Issa’s committee, a retired Air Force general on duty at U.S. Africa Command that night complained that the military should have tried to save the Benghazi victims even if the effort would have been futile.

When Republican Rep. James Lankford asked Brig. Gen. Robert Lovell “did we have their back that night,” Lovell responded: “Obviously not, sir.”

Boehner’s announcement of a special panel to further investigate Benghazi fulfilled a request by many GOP colleagues eager to frame the final years of Obama’s presidency on their terms.

Until now, Boehner had resisted calls to establish such a committee, pointing to the four House panels already investigating the matter.

Democrats wanting to get past the issue portray Republicans as driven by partisan desire to hurt Obama. Carney has referred to what he described as GOP conspiracy theories regarding Benghazi that have failed to pan out.

“Everything that this committee would look at has already been looked at ad nauseam by multiple committees,” Harf said. “What’s the point?”

Is there more than meets the eye?

In Washington, always.

The issue gives Republicans perhaps their lone line of attack against Hillary Clinton, the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 if she decides to run.

A new poll Thursday showed Clinton’s strong standing. The Quinnipiac University survey from Florida had Clinton topping former two-term Gov. Jeb Bush, the leading potential Republican contender in the nation’s most populous swing state.

Because Clinton was secretary of state when the Benghazi attack occurred, Republicans have sought to depict her as inattentive to security needs of diplomatic staff.

At the Oversight Committee hearing last week, Lovell described how he and others desperately considered possible deployment of a rapid-force team to Benghazi, but needed a State Department request that never came.

“Were they doing what they were trained to do or were they sitting around and waiting for the State Department and Hillary Clinton to call them up and say do something?” GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah asked him.

However, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Howard “Buck” McKeon of California, issued a statement that said his panel investigated the matter and found “no evidence that Department of State officials delayed the decision to deploy what few resources (the military) had available to respond.”

Democrats face what analysts expect will be a difficult mid-term election in November, with little chance of winning back the House from Republicans and facing the possibility of losing their majority in the Senate.

Boehner’s call for yet another congressional committee to investigate could provide Democrats with a rallying point to motivate voters to prevent Republicans from retaking the Senate in November and gaining full control of Congress."
1832,1832,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/05/06/tillis-wins-republican-nomination-for-u-s-senate-in-north-carolina/,0,"The establishment wing of the Republican Party scored a major victory in North Carolina Tuesday when state House Speaker Thom Tillis won the party's nomination for U.S. Senate, turning back tea party challengers who threatened to complicate the GOP's effort to unseat Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) in a key midterm battleground.

""The party has triangulated pretty well so far and this was the first test,"" said Michael Steele, a former Republican National Committee chairman. ""Tillis and his people have worked hard to control how this plays out. But they have to be careful to not rub the base's nose in their success.""

Tillis's ability to gallop ahead late in the race, in spite of the steep competition he faced on his right, signals that the Republican establishment may be better poised than previously thought to push through its favored candidates in Senate primaries later this month in Georgia and Kentucky, where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell faces Matt Bevin, a tea party challenger.

McConnell, who headlined fundraisers for Tillis, leads by a significant margin in the polls and has benefited from Bevin's stumbles, which include a stop at a rally for legalized cockfighting — an appearance McConnell's campaign has lampooned.

In Georgia, Jack Kingston, a 10-term Republican congressman and a powerful appropriator, has also seen his campaign blessed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other mainstream Republican groups, and he has since climbed to near the top of the polls, lagging slightly behind wealthy businessman David Perdue, according to an April automated survey.

The rest of the field, filled mostly with tea party favorites such as Rep. Paul Broun, who once said President Obama upholds the ""Soviet constitution,"" has struggled to combat the financial heft of the leading pair.

By winning more than 40 percent of the Republican vote, Tillis avoided having to endure a primary runoff election. Now, he can focus his attention on Hagan, a top target of national Republicans looking to net the six seats they need to pick up the Senate majority this fall.

In his victory speech, Tillis sought to link Hagan to the Obama administration. ""If want to change the mess of Obamacare, we have to change our senator,"" said Tillis.

Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Justin Barasky accused Tillis of embracing ""extreme, far-right tea party positions"" during the primary.

Tillis was bolstered against a field of seven other GOP hopefuls by well-heeled outside groups who regarded him as the most electable candidate in the race. American Crossroads and the Chamber spent big money to shore up Tillis's image as Democrats sought to raise questions about his position on Obamacare in advertisements during the lead up to Tuesday's vote, an apparent effort to stoke doubts about him in the minds of conservatives.

With all precincts reporting, Tillis won with 46 percent of the vote. Tea party-aligned obstetrician Greg Brannon finished second with 27 percent; and pastor Mark Harris, another tea party candidate, came in third, with 18 percent.

Share this article Share

Neither Harris nor Brannon ever picked up much momentum despite trying to carry the tea party mantle in the race. National conservative groups like the Club for Growth and Senate Conservatives Fund, both known for meddling on behalf of insurgent candidates, steered clear of the contest.

Tea party groups spent less than $200,000 on yard signs, phone banks and online ads to boost Brannon, according to campaign finance data compiled by the Sunlight Foundation.

Tillis, on the other hand, had prominent Republicans in his corner. He had the support of former Florida governor Jeb Bush and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Brannon campaigned with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Monday, but it wasn't enough to overcome Tillis's structural advantages in the sprawling, populous state. The challenge of running as an underdog is amplified in North Carolina since there are so many media markets where advertising is expensive.

Paul endorsed Tillis after he clinched the GOP nomination.

Hagan, a low-key senator who was first elected along with the Obama wave of 2008, faces a tougher contest this time around.

Robert Shrum, a longtime Democratic strategist, said he believes that Hagan can win, and predicted the race would be a ""toss up."" But he acknowledged that turning out Democratic voters for a midterm election has often been difficult. Republicans, he added, have done a better job this cycle of filtering candidates and giving Democrats fewer targets.

""The Republican establishment is trying to prevent a repetition of what happened in Missouri and Indiana last time, and in Delaware and Alaska before that, when they nominated people who were off the charts,"" he said.

North Carolina, which was a blue state six years ago but was carried by Romney in 2012, has tilted to the right in the past year, with Tillis, fellow GOP state legislators, and Gov. Pat McCrory, who was elected in 2012, aggressively pushing a conservative agenda, blocking the state's expansion of Medicaid, cutting taxes, and enacting anti-abortion regulations.

Democrats will look to closely associate Tillis with the flurry of activity at the state capital, which has caused unrest. In February, more than 80,000 people swarmed into Raleigh to champion progressive causes and protest the state legislature's controversial conservative measures to tighten voter registration procedures and implement new election rules.

Hagan backers have also been highlighting a video from 2011, when Tillis said Republicans need to ""divide and conquer"" people on public assistance, which have drawn partisan comparisons to Romney's infamous ""47 percent"" remarks during the 2012 presidential campaign.

Voters also went to the polls in Indiana and Ohio, where House Speaker John A. Boehner easily defeated tea party challengers.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/05/politics/scotus-new-york-public-prayer/index.html?hpt=hp_t2",0,"A divided Supreme Court ruled Monday that legislative bodies such as city councils can begin their meetings with prayer, even if it plainly favors a specific religion. The court ruled 5 to 4 that Christian prayers said before meetings of an Upstate New York town council did not violate the constitutional prohibition against government establishment of religion; the justices cited history and tradition.

""Ceremonial prayer is but a recognition that, since this Nation was founded and until the present day, many Americans deem that their own existence must be understood by precepts far beyond the authority of government,"" Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court's conservative majority.

The ruling reflected a Supreme Court that has become more lenient on how government may accommodate religion in civic life without crossing the line into an endorsement of a particular faith. All nine justices endorsed the concept of legislative prayer, with the four dissenters agreeing that the public forum “need not become a religion-free zone,” in the words of Justice Elena Kagan.

But there was sharp disagreement after that, and the majority ruling could encourage public bodies to give more leeway to religious expression in their ceremonial prayers and less deference to the objections of religious minorities.

The court’s five conservatives said legislative prayers need not be stripped of references to a specific religion — the prayers at issue often invoked Jesus Christ and the resurrection — and said those given the opportunity to pray before legislative meetings should be “unfettered” by what government officials find appropriate.

“Absent a pattern of prayers that over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissible government purpose, a challenge based solely on the content of a particular prayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation,” Kennedy wrote.

He was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.

Kagan’s dissent was both narrow — the town could have remedied its problems by finding more religiously diverse prayer-givers, she said — and broad. The First Amendment’s promise, she wrote, is that “every citizen, irrespective of her religion, owns an equal share in her government.”

Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor joined her.

The decision split the court along its usual ideological divide and, to a lesser extent, by religion. All members of the majority are Catholic, as is Sotomayor. The other dissenters are Jewish.

The case involved the New York town of Greece, just outside Rochester, where the council regularly opened its meetings with a prayer delivered by someone from the community. The speakers were recruited from local houses of worship, which were overwhelmingly Christian.

In fact, every meeting from 1999 to 2007 opened with a Christian prayer, and even after two of the town’s residents filed a lawsuit, only a handful of non-Christians have delivered the invocation.

A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit found that “the town’s prayer practice must be viewed as an endorsement of a particular religious viewpoint” because the town had not reached out to a more diverse group of prayer-givers or made clear that the prayers did not represent the town’s beliefs.

The Supreme Court decided 30 years ago that state legislatures may begin sessions with an invocation. But the new case asked whether there might need to be different rules for local council meetings, where citizens often come to ask for favorable official action.

The town residents who objected to the prayer practice, Susan Galloway and Linda Stephens, also argued that the court's 1983 decision in Marsh v. Chambers authorized only inclusive, nonsectarian prayers to a ""generic God.""

Kennedy began by referring to history: The same founders who wrote the First Amendment — with its prohibition on the establishment of a government religion but also protections for religious liberty — provided money for congressional chaplains, he said.

“Legislative prayer has become part of our heritage and tradition, part of our expressive idiom, similar to the Pledge of Allegiance, inaugural prayer, or the recitation of ‘God save the United States and this honorable Court’ at the opening of this Court’s sessions,” he wrote.

And he said there was no evidence that Greece town council members “allocated benefits and burdens based on participation in the prayer.”

The court’s majority split on how to judge whether prayers amount to coercion of nonbelievers.

“The analysis would be different if town board members directed the public to participate in the prayers, singled out dissidents for opprobrium, or indicated that their decisions might be influenced by a person’s acquiescence in the prayer opportunity,” Kennedy wrote in a part of the opinion joined only by Roberts and Alito.

Thomas and Scalia differed. They said that to the extent coercion is relevant to whether there is a violation of the Constitution’s establishment clause, “it is actual legal coercion that counts.” Peer pressure, they said, is not enough.

Thomas, speaking only for himself, again questioned whether the establishment clause even applies to state and local governments. He allowed that as an initial matter, it “probably prohibits Congress from establishing a national religion.”

Kagan said Greece’s policy violates the norm of religious equality — “the breathtakingly generous constitutional idea that our public institutions belong no less to the Buddhist or Hindu than to the Methodist or Episcopalian.”

She said town hall meetings are different from sessions of legislatures or Congress. They are “occasions for ordinary citizens to engage with and petition their government, often on highly individualized matters.” Such meetings require more sensitivity to the prayers offered before a diverse audience, she said.

But in Greece, she wrote, “month in and month out for over a decade, prayers steeped in only one faith, addressed toward members of the public, commenced meetings to discuss local affairs and distribute government benefits.”

She compared it — using the text of some of the prayers offered before the council’s meetings — to the idea of a judge inviting a minister to open a hearing with a prayer about “the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ” or an election official reciting the Lord’s Prayer before opening the polls.

“I would hold that the government officials responsible for the above practices — that is, for prayer repeatedly invoking a single religion’s beliefs in these settings — crossed a constitutional line,” Kagan wrote. “I have every confidence the Court would agree.”

The decision was not unexpected. The court's precedent in Marsh — in which the justices said Nebraska had not violated the Constitution by employing a Presbyterian minister for 16 years to lead the legislature in prayer — paved the way.

Still, those who favor a strict separation of church and state said Monday’s decision was an expansion.

“The rule announced by the Court today authorizes elected officials or clergy to give sectarian prayers in the name of Jesus, Hashem, Allah or any other deity before Congress, state legislatures, or local town boards,” the Anti-Defamation League said in a statement. “The religiously divisive implications of this new rule are troubling in any of these contexts, however it is particularly disturbing at the local level.”

But David Cortman, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, praised the ruling.

“Opening public meetings with prayer is a cherished freedom that the authors of the Constitution themselves practiced,” he said. “Speech censors should have no power to silence volunteers who pray for their communities just as the Founders did.”

Those divisions were apparent on the court as well.

Alito wrote a concurring opinion just to respond to Kagan. He said he was troubled by her “rhetoric and its highly imaginative hypotheticals.”

He said that if what Kagan perceives as Greece’s constitutional problems could be solved simply with more nonsectarian prayers and greater religious diversity, “the dissent’s objection, in the end, is really quite niggling.”

Kagan responded that if Alito thinks her objection is “really quite niggling,” that “says all there is to say about the difference between our respective views.”"
1837,1837,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/05/07/house-votes-to-hold-lois-lerner-in-contempt-of-congress/,0,"Updated 9:19 p.m. The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to hold a former Internal Revenue Service official in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with an ongoing investigation into the agency's special targeting of groups with “tea party” or “patriot” in their names that were seeking tax-exempt status. On a 231 to 187 vote, the House approved a contempt citation against Lois G. Lerner, whose admission last year that the tax-enforcement agency had targeted conservative groups infuriated lawmakers in both parties, led to an overhaul of the IRS and Lerner's eventual retirement from government service.

Six Democrats -- a band of moderates and others facing difficult reelection challenges -- joined with all voting Republicans to approve the contempt charge.

Now the matter will be referred to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. The contempt charge will then be referred to a grand jury for further review, but it is unclear how the Justice Department will proceed. Politically, however, House Republicans will be able to declare victory after working swiftly in the last year to investigate the matter and hold a senior IRS official accountable for the agency's decision and her unwillingness to cooperate with a congressional investigation.

If ever convicted, Lerner could face between one and 12 months in jail and a fine of up to $100,000.

With Wednesday's vote, Lerner becomes one of only a handful of government officials found in contempt of Congress in recent years. Most recently, the GOP House voted in 2012 to hold Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt for withholding documents related to a failed gunrunning operation. During the George W. Bush administration, his chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten and the White House counsel, Harriet Miers, were held in contempt by a Democratic-controlled House.

Separately, the House also passed a resolution Wednesday evening that called on Holder to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the IRS's targeting of conservative groups. Lawmakers voted 250 to 168 to pass the resolution; 26 Democrats joined all voting Republicans to approve it.

The Justice Department has said it is conducting an investigation of the IRS’s actions and that the case ""remains a priority.""

The two votes came 362 days after she admitted during a conference held by the American Bar Association that the agency had targeted certain groups. Her admission appeared to happen by chance and came in response to a question asked during the conference. In the hours and days after her admission, the IRS was exposed as unprepared for the firestorm that ensued.

A hastily arranged conference call with reporters was clumsily handled, with Lerner at one point attempting to do arithmetic over the phone and admitting: ""I'm not good at math.""

Later, an IRS watchdog audit concluded that the agency had inappropriately targeted groups for extra scrutiny based on their political leanings. Those findings sparked a Justice Department investigation, congressional inquiries and a leadership shake-up at the IRS. When Lerner was called to Capitol Hill to testify at hearings, she invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Her decision led to further bipartisan outrage, with Democrats and Republicans alike calling for her removal or resignation.

Lerner retired from the IRS last September.

But House Republicans kept their attention on Lerner and ordered her to appear before the Oversight and Government Reform Committee again in March, where she once again invoked her Fifth Amendment right. That decision set off an emotional exchange between Republicans and Democrats on the panel.

Lerner’s attorney, William Taylor, has repeatedly denied that his client did anything illegal. Democrats on the Oversight Committee have expressed frustration with Lerner's refusal to testify, but have also opposed efforts to punish her for invoking the Fifth Amendment.

But the Oversight panel approved a contempt resolution on a party-line vote last month and sent the matter to the full House. The measure asks the Justice Department to consider criminally prosecuting Lerner. The House Ways and Means Committee last month also agreed in a separate party-line vote to request criminal prosecution of Lerner for various alleged violations, including misleading investigators and exposing confidential taxpayer information.

Hoping to continue currying political favor with Americans concerned about potential government overreach and coverups, Republicans will shift their focus Thursday to the Sept. 2012 attacks on U.S. diplomatic outposts in Benghazi, Libya. The House is scheduled to vote to establish a select committee to investigate the attacks. While Republicans are expected to vote to approve establishing the panel, it is unclear whether any Democrats will join them in doing so."

Official results show a clear majority for one party, a first in three decades for India Narendra Modi is a Hindu nationalist who was viewed as a pro-business candidate But controversies in his past have led to strained relations with the United States

New Delhi CNN —

Narendra Modi, the leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, claimed victory as India’s next Prime Minister on Friday, bringing to power a man whose controversial past at one point led the United States to deny him a visa.

Official results show his party winning at least 275 of 543 parliamentary seats, bringing a clear majority, according to the India Election Commission.

It’s the first time in three decades that India’s 540 million voters delivered a resounding mandate to a single party to rule the world’s second-most populous nation.

Fractured electoral verdicts leading to coalition governments had been common in India since 1989.

Manmohan Singh, India’s outgoing Prime Minister, called Modi to congratulate him on his “party’s victory,” said Singh’s Twitter page.

Viewed as pro-business, Modi, 63, has pledged reforms to revive the nation’s flagging economy.

But his past is not without controversy. Throughout his campaign, his relationship with the country’s huge Muslim minority came under scrutiny.

In 2002, Gujarat state was wracked with anti-Muslim violence, in which more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed.

Modi, the state’s chief minister, was criticized for not doing enough to halt the violence, but a Supreme Court-ordered investigation absolved him of blame last year.

Analysts predict his arrival in India’s top office will bring a marked change in direction for the world’s most populous democracy, a nation whose modern character has been defined by the defeated Indian National Congress Party, which has been dominant since the country’s independence in 1947.

Modi’s victory had long been anticipated, as polls indicated a slump in support for the ruling Congress Party, which has been dogged by high-profile corruption scandals amid stubborn inflation and a slowed economy.

Congress Party spokesman Randeep Surjewala told CNN, “We bow before the wishes of the people of India with all humility. We will continue to play the role assigned to us. We will try with greater vigor and determination to work with the large populace of this country.”

Modi’s relationship with the rest of the world

The United States denied Modi a visa over the anti-Muslim violence in 2005, suggesting a strained relationship between the United States and India’s next Prime Minister.

But President Barack Obama called Modi to congratulate him on winning the election and to invite him to Washington, according to the White House.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also congratulated Modi, saying in a tweet that he looks forward to “growing shared prosperity.” State Department officials told CNN that Modi will be given a visa to the United States once he takes office and forms a government.

The tensions between Modi and the United States in the past could have an impact on relations during his term, said Arati Jerath, an analyst and journalist in India.

“There is a feeling that Narendra Modi will be much more pro-China than pro-U.S., and that could be rooted to the fact that he’s had this tension with the United States over his visa, whereas the Chinese laid out the red carpet for him,” Jerath said.

Modi’s ascent to the national stage

Celebrations broke out as updates from the five-week-long election were released throughout the day. Modi’s supporters sang, danced, played music, threw flowers and even brought elephants into the mix as initial results indicated a huge lead for the BJP. Supporters celebrated outside the party’s office and in the streets in Gujarat, where Modi has served as chief minister since 2001.

He tweeted: “Good days are here to come.”

India has won! भारत की विजय। अच्छे दिन आने वाले हैं। — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 16, 2014

At a news conference, BJP chief Rajnath Singh declared, “Till some time ago, it was said India’s success story is over. Now, the time has come to rewrite India’s success story.”

India’s potential for growth was once mentioned in the same breath as that of China. But the world’s second-most populous nation has not delivered.

Modi, a former tea seller, sprang into the national spotlight for his work in Gujarat, where he cultivated an image of a man who gets things done.

Gujarat, a state of some 60 million people, has seen China-like rates of growth in recent years, which have been eyed enviously by the rest of the country. The “Gujarat model” of development means a focus on infrastructure, urbanization and eradicating red tape.

India’s stock market surged Friday as initial results suggested a huge lead for Modi and his party.

UK Foreign Minister William Hague congratulated Modi and his party, saying Britain looked “forward to forging an even closer partnership with India.”"

The landmark case paves the way for more indictments and demonstrates that the United States is serious about holding foreign governments accountable for crimes committed in cyberspace, officials said at a news conference Monday.

The Obama administration “will not tolerate actions by any nation that seeks to illegally sabotage American companies and undermine the integrity of fair competition in the operation of the free market,” Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said.

The decision to confront China grew out of a White House strategy formulated two years ago to impose increasing costs on Beijing if it didn't respond to requests to stop its widespread hacking for commercial advantage. The indictment is intended to address what President Obama and senior intelligence officials have called one of the top threats to national and economic security, with an estimated annual cost to the U.S. economy that ranges from the tens of billions of dollars to more than $100 billion.

The criminal charges provoked a response from Beijing, which said Monday that it was suspending high-level cyber talks with the United States that began in June.

China has summoned the U.S. ambassador over the hacking charges. According to an online notice posted Tuesday by state-run Xinhua on Weibo, Assistant Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang summoned Abassador Max Baucus to complain that U.S. authorities published their indictment ignoring the strong protests by Chinese authorities.

""Given the lack of sincerity by the United States for cooperation to solve cyber security problems through dialogue, China has decided to suspend the activities of the Sino-U.S. Cyber Working Group,"" Foreign Ministry Spokesman Qin Gang said in a statement.

The charges are “purely ungrounded and absurd,” Qin said. He added that the United States had “fabricated facts” in the indictment, which he said “seriously violates basic norms of international relations and damages Sino-U.S. cooperation and mutual trust.”

The leaks from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden already had complicated the talks. Beijing has pointed to disclosures by Snowden of vast NSA surveillance activities — including spying on Chinese companies — to assert that the United States is the greater aggressor in the area.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, “We regret China’s decisions.” But she added that she does not think the development will affect strategic and economic dialogue meetings with China, scheduled for early July.

The indictment, which was filed May 1, charges five officials in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) — hackers with handles such as UglyGorilla and KandyGoo — with computer fraud, conspiracy to commit computer fraud, damaging a computer, aggravated identity theft and economic espionage.

China has no extradition treaty with the United States and none of the suspects is likely to see aa U.S. courtroom. Nonetheless, Holder said he hopes Beijing will “respect our criminal justice system and let justice take its course.”

The indictment is the result of years of work, officials said, in which investigators followed a complex trail of computer bits to one building in one Chinese city.

That nondescript 12-story building under military guard in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai is home to Unit 61398 — part of the PLA and identified by researchers as one of the most prolific hacking crews targeting Western companies' trade secrets and intellectual property.

The 56-page indictment describes the hacking of five companies and a trade union. All but one are located in the Western District of Pennsylvania, where the charges were brought.

The companies — which include U.S. Steel, the country’s largest steelmaker, and Alcoa, the largest aluminum manufacturer — agreed to come forward, bucking what for years had been a reluctance by many firms to acknowledge that they had been hacked for fear of shareholder lawsuits and damage to reputation.

“There has come a point at which enough is enough,” said David Hickton, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. “The companies are tired of being raided.”

The other companies are Westinghouse Electric, which builds nuclear power plants; Allegheny Technologies, a metals manufacturer; and SolarWorld, which makes solar products in Hillsboro, Ore. Also hit was the United Steelworkers union, which opposes Chinese trade practices.

The indictment alleges that the hackers stole trade secrets that would have been particularly beneficial to Chinese companies.

PLA member Wen Xinyu — also known as ""WinXYHappy"" — hacked SolarWorld's computers and stole thousands of files containing cost and pricing information, prosecutors allege. Hackers took detailed production information that could help a competitor shorten its research and development timeline.

The American company rapidly lost market share to Chinese competitors that were accused of systematically pricing exports well below production costs.

After a complaint from SolarWorld, the Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission found that China had “dumped” solar products in the U.S. market.

In another case, defendant Wang Dong — or UglyGorilla — gained access to a U.S. Steel computer, which allowed him to steal descriptions for more than 1,700 other company computers and worm his way into vulnerable machines, according to the indictment. He gained access after fellow PLA hacker Sun Kailiang, also known as Jack Sun, sent spear-phishing e-mails to employees, including one purporting to be from the firm's chief executive. The

e-mails contained malware that, when clicked on, surreptitiously loaded onto employees' computers and allowed back-door access.

John Carlin, the assistant attorney general for national security, said the Chinese have long challenged U.S. officials to provide hard evidence of their data theft that could stand up in court. “Well today, we are,” he said. “For the first time, we are exposing the faces and names behind the keyboards in Shanghai used to steal from American businesses.”

Although the indictment does not name the state-owned enterprises that may have benefited from the espionage, according to open-source literature, they are State Nuclear Power Technology, the Baosteel Group and the Aluminum Corporation of China, which is commonly known as Chinalco.

James Lewis, a cyber policy expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said China’s withdrawal from the talks was “childish” and a mistake. “If you want to get the United States to do something different, you don’t say, ‘I’m not going to talk to you,’ ” he said.

Lewis said he thinks that China will find ways to retaliate but that it cannot go too far. “Their economy is weaker than ours now,” he said. “Now is not the time for the Chinese to go full-bore in retaliation.”

Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the CrowdStrike cybersecurity firm, said the indictments will send a signal to U.S. companies that have thought that the government could not do anything to hold state-sponsored hackers accountable. “Now they can look at these indictments and say, ‘Hey, if I want these people to be punished, the U.S. government is willing to step up and do it,’ ” he said. “That’s a very important message.”"

Republican lawmakers may question the secretary about how long he took to order the preservation of electronic and paper evidence related to the purported delays. House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) criticized the VA last week for taking eight days to comply with his early-April request to protect the records.

In an interview on Wednesday, Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said the delay is not surprising. “Anyone who knows the VA knows it’s a bureaucracy that moves slowly — often too slowly,” he said.

Sanders has been adamant about waiting for the VA inspector general’s office to finish its investigation of the allegations before drawing conclusions. “I’ll let the facts speak for themselves,” he said Wednesday.

The VA has placed three Phoenix executives on administrative leave as the review takes place, and Shinseki has ordered face-to-face audits of the scheduling systems at all the department’s medical centers.

The chairman indicated he wants to know more on Thursday about VA staffing levels and whether additional personnel could help the clinics provide care in a more timely fashion.

Share this article Share

Sanders also said he will examine the department’s goal of seeing patients within 14 to 30 days to determine whether that timeframe is realistic considering the VA’s current budget limitations and workload.

“I don’t know there are enough staff to provide the healthcare veterans need,” he said. “We have to take a look at that.”

President Obama’s 2015 budget proposal asks Congress to provide $56 billion for veteran medical care. That amount would represent an increase of 3 percent compared to the enacted level for 2014.

Sanders noted that the VA health system generally receives high marks from patients who use it. The American Customer Satisfaction Index shows that the network, which serves more than 8 million veterans, achieved scores equal to or better than those in the private sector last year.

In terms of what Sanders expects from the VA at this point, he said he wants the department to be responsive to congressional inquiries and to take action if the investigation uncovers wrongdoing or mismanagement.

“They are funded by taxpayers, and the VA has to be responsive to the concerns that these committees are raising,” he said. “If there are managers around the country who are not doing their jobs, then those people have to be held accountable.”

Republicans on the committee will probably challenge Shinseki over bonuses that have gone to executives overseeing troubled health facilities in locations such as Pittsburgh, where a Legionnaires disease outbreak killed several patients in 2012, and in Atlanta, where a federal audit determined that the clinic there was not sufficiently addressing patient safety.

Shinseki resigned as secretary of veterans affairs Friday, apologizing for a scandal in which employees throughout the VA’s massive hospital system conspired to hide months-long wait times that veterans faced when seeking care. The size and scope of the coverups in an agency that he had presided over for more than five years left Shinseki dumbfounded and President Obama searching for a replacement for one of his longest serving and most trusted Cabinet officials. Obama said Sloan D. Gibson, the deputy secretary of veterans affairs, will take over the VA until a new secretary is named.

In announcing Shinseki's resignation, Obama went out of his way to describe the former Army general as a person of integrity who presided over a bureaucracy that was overwhelmed by two long wars and an aging veteran population, and which ultimately succumbed to widespread cheating to hide its shortcomings.

“I want to reiterate, he is a very good man,” the president said at the White House. “I don’t just mean that he’s an accomplished man. I don’t just mean that he’s been an outstanding soldier. He’s a good person, who’s done exemplary work on our behalf.”

Obama, however, concluded that the growing calls for Shinseki's firing had become too much of a distraction from the complicated work of fixing the troubled department.

The problems surrounding long wait times for care — and VA employees’ attempts to cover them up — have been around for years, detailed in more than 18 watchdog reports dating back to 2000. The latest, and most damning, review was released earlier this week by the VA inspector general and immediately spurred the wave of bipartisan calls for Shinseki’s ouster. Shinseki himself seemed stunned by the report’s conclusion that he had, for the last five years, been presiding over a deeply flawed and dishonest bureaucracy.

“I can’t explain the lack of integrity among some of the leaders of our healthcare facilities,” Shinseki said shortly before he quit his post. “This is something I rarely encountered during my 38 years in uniform. I cannot defend it because it is indefensible. But I can take responsibility for it, and I do.”

Shinseki’s fall at the VA was triggered by a confluence of problems including poor leadership at VA hospitals, woefully dated technology and a health-care system that couldn’t handle the strain caused by almost 13 years of war and Vietnam veterans who were using the system in greater numbers, according to his former top aides. Shinseki’s forced resignation amid dwindling political support raises a difficult question for the Obama administration: Can anyone reform an agency that, as the president acknowledged Friday, had been dogged by management and funding problems for a “very long” time?

Soon after he took over the VA in 2009, Shinseki tried to improve the leadership culture in the VA by meeting quarterly with every hospital director in the agency’s giant network, sometimes for hours. “It was months and months and months . . . every single day getting a personal read,” said Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) who worked for Shinseki at the VA. “No other secretary had ever done that.”

The former Army general, who lost half of his right foot to a mine in Vietnam, also pushed for more education and training, similar to the kind the Army had instituted in the 1970s when it wrestled with widespread discipline problems, mistrust and dissent in its own ranks. Neither of those efforts was enough to ensure that managers — seeking performance bonuses and promotions — were willing to acknowledge the problems inside VA’s healthcare system, which grew worse over the last five years as more than 2 million patients were added to the rolls.

“As Ric Shinseki himself indicated, there is a need for a change in culture within the [Veterans Health Administration] and perhaps the VA as a whole to make sure that bad news gets surfaced quickly so things can be fixed,” Obama said.

John Gingrich, Shinseki’s chief of staff until 2012, summed up the problem in even starker terms: “When people don’t have integrity, it is hard to transform them.”

Shinseki also struggled to update the VA’s electronic scheduling systems, some of which had been in place since the 1980s. The aging system made it difficult for low-level employees to track patients and made it almost impossible for top VA officials in Washington to get reliable data on how long veterans were waiting for care. The president on Friday described these technology problems as “eminently fixable.”

Share this article Share

Plans to build a new scheduling system, however, have been on the books for more than 14 years and have languished because of a lack of funding and the need to address more pressing needs within the overburdened VA system. “It’s a simple question of bandwidth and priorities,” said Peter Levin, a former senior technology adviser to Shinseki at the VA.

As the strain on the system and mid-level VA managers mounted, a culture of cheating and lying took hold within the department, former officials said. ""It is like the Army at the end of the Vietnam War,"" said a top VA official, who requested anonymity in order to speak frankly about the VA's problems. ""You can only press so hard before even people with the highest values start to succumb to the lowest common denominator.""

Until recently, Shinseki was best known in Washington as the four-star Army general who had drawn the ire of the George W. Bush administration by predicting that several hundred thousand troops would be needed to stabilize Iraq in the wake of a U.S. invasion. “He has never been afraid to speak truth to power,” the president said Friday.

Shinseki’s reputation as a straight shooter who had fought for his countrywon him widespread admiration in Washington. One of those admirers was Duckworth, a first-term lawmaker who lost both her legs after a helicopter accident in Iraq in 2004. She became an outspoken critic of the war as she recovered and befriended then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, who backed her unsuccessful 2006 congressional bid. Later, she joined the Obama administration as a VA assistant secretary for public affairs — the public face of the department — and reported to Shinseki.

“I’d mop floors for Ric Shinseki,” she said in a 2009 interview with The Washington Post shortly after she took the job. She reaffirmed those sentiments in an interview last week. “He cares about veterans as deeply as anyone,” Duckworth said. “His entire life has been spent taking care of soldiers. ”

By Friday morning — after reading the VA inspector general report, speaking with fellow veterans and hearing from constituents — Duckworth delivered a significant psychological and political blow to Obama, her political patron, and Shinseki, her former boss.

“Our first priority should be the veterans, and at this point whether Secretary Shinseki will stay or go is too much of a distraction,” she told The Washington Post shortly before Shinseki submitted his resignation. “I think he has to go.”

Many of Shinseki's closest aides and his backers on Capitol Hill pointed to his achievements during his time running the VA, especially his effort to reduce veteran homelessness by 25 percent during his tenure. An hour before he submitted his resignation, Shinseki received a sustained standing ovation from the crowd at the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans' annual conference in Washington. ""Now is not the time to let up or get complacent,"" he said. ""We all need to work harder. This coalition can end veteran homelessness by next year. So let's get on with it.""

Shinseki cut waiting times for GI bill benefits from months to less than one week and changed the rules on disability benefits so that hundreds of thousands of veterans who were battling diseases related to Agent Orange could get help.

Some lawmakers said that Shinseki’s lack of political and media savvy had made it harder for him to survive a steady stream of scandals and problems that had hit the VA as the number of veterans seeking healthcare and disability swelled."

Washington CNN —

An internal Veterans Affairs audit released Monday said tens of thousands of newly returning veterans wait at least 90 days for medical care, while even more who signed up in the VA system over the past 10 years never got an immediate appointment they requested.

The review provides a more complete picture of widespread problems at the agency’s health care facilities – as reported by CNN over the past seven months – than preliminary findings last month that led to the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki.

“This data shows the extent of the systemic problems we face, problems that demand immediate actions,” said acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson, who took over after Shinseki stepped aside.

Deadly waits

Reports of the sometimes fatal waits, with the VA acknowledging 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care, sparked public anger over problems at the VA that have existed for years.

Despite efforts to address some issues in recent years, including reductions in backlogs for benefits and the number of homeless veterans, the long waits have continued for newly enrolled veterans to get initial appointments for care.

Reasons for the chronic problems include the increasing number of veterans returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a bonus system that rewarded managers for meeting goals regarding access to treatment.

14-day goal “not attainable”

The audit findings, covering 731 VA facilities nationwide and based on interviews with more than 3,700 staff members, said a 14-day goal for providing care to newly enrolled veterans proved “simply not attainable” due to growing demand and a lack of capacity.

“Imposing this expectation on the field before ascertaining the resources required and its ensuing broad promulgation represent an organizational leadership failure,” it said of the deadline imposed under Shinseki.

According to CNN’s previous reporting, managers in Phoenix and elsewhere used secret waiting lists to cover up the amount of time it took for veterans to get appointments.

“In some cases, pressures were placed on schedulers to utilize unofficial lists or engage in inappropriate practices in order to make waiting times appear more favorable,” said a fact sheet released with the audit.

At the same time, the audit said that questions it posed “were not worded to ascertain the reason that policy may have been violated,” adding that its findings “cannot be extended to identify deliberate deception, fraud, or malfeasance.”

Keyword search the audit

The figures in the audit – 57,436 newly enrolled veterans facing a minimum 90-day wait for medical care; 63,869 veterans who enrolled over the past decade requesting an appointment that never happened – show the scope of the problem.

At the same time, both figures represent about 1% of the total 6 million or so appointments in the VA system now, and don’t reflect possible changing circumstances, such as enrolled veterans who seek care at a different facility than the one where they first signed up.

Gibson’s statement said the VA has contacted 50,000 veterans “to get them off of wait lists and into clinics” so far, and planned to contact another 40,000.

Steps taken

Other steps he announced included:

• Removing the 14-day scheduling goal.

• Suspending all performance awards for VHA senior executives for fiscal year 2014, which runs through September.

• A hiring freeze at VA central headquarters in Washington and the 21 VHA regional offices, “except for critical positions to be approved by the secretary on a case-by-case basis.”

• A new patient satisfaction measurement program.

• Ordering an independent, outside audit of VHA scheduling practices across the system. This would differ from a review being conducted by the VA inspector general’s office.

• Applying reforms announced for the Phoenix VA facility to others considered the “most challenged.”

• Deploying mobile medical units to provide services to veterans awaiting care.

CNN first reported the extensive problems at the Phoenix VA facility, including an interview with a whistleblower who said dozens of veterans died while waiting for care there.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the new audit showed “some personnel changes need to be made and some have already,” in reference to Shinseki’s departure and some top managers in Phoenix placed on administrative leave.

“It’s also clear there need to be some management changes in terms of … the procedures that the VA has in place to fulfill their responsibilities,” Earnest said.

Some in Congress on both sides of the aisle have called for a criminal investigation, and 21 senators sent a letter Monday to Attorney General Eric Holder asking for the FBI to get involved.

“This challenge requires resources that only the Department of Justice can provide in developing and assessing evidence, pursuing leads, and initiating active prosecutions aggressively if warranted,” said the letter from 10 Republicans and 11 Democrats.

Bring in the feds

The signers included Kay Hagan in North Carolnia, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas – Democrats from traditionally conservative states who face tough re-election battles in November.

Richard Griffin, the acting VA inspector general conducting his own review of the system, has said he regularly consults with the Justice Department as part of his inquiry.

A Justice spokesperson said Monday that “the department continues to consult with the Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General regarding their ongoing review.”

Declining further comment on an “ongoing matter,” the spokesperson said the department “often consults with inspectors general on legal matters and acts on any referrals should they find sufficient predicate for a criminal investigation.”

Griffin said on Monday that his office is now looking at 69 VA facilities."
1900,1900,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/06/10/abc-newss-diane-sawyer-destroys-hillary-rodham-clinton-on-benghazi/?tid=pm_pop,1,"ABC US News | ABC Celebrity News A standard defense for Hillary Rodham Clinton when facing questions about Benghazi, Libya, has been to cite her commissioning of a report from the State Department’s Accountability Review Board (ARB), which took a deep look at the attacks that claimed the lives of four U.S. personnel on Sept. 11, 2012. In testimony before Congress in January 2013, Clinton said: “I hurried to appoint the Accountability Review Board led by Ambassador Pickering and Admiral Mullen so we could more fully understand from objective, independent examination, what went wrong and how to fix it. I have accepted every one of their recommendations.”

In an interview with Clinton that aired last night on ABC News, anchor Diane Sawyer threw the ARB right back in the face of the former secretary of state. The two tangled over the preparedness of the U.S. diplomatic installation in Benghazi for a terrorist attack. In defending her work on this front, Clinton stressed that she had delegated the particulars of security to the experts in the field. “I’m not equipped to sit and look at blueprints to determine where the blast walls need to be, where the reinforcements need to be. That’s why we hire people who have that expertise,” said Clinton, who did the interview as part of the tour for her book “Hard Choices.”

Sensing an opening, Sawyer cited the document that Clinton herself has so often cited: “This is the ARB: the mission was far short of standards; weak perimeter; incomplete fence; video surveillance needed repair. They said it’s a systemic failure.”

Clinton replied, “Well, it was with respect to that compound.”

The anchor continued pressing, asking Clinton whether the people might be seeking from her a “sentence that begins from you ‘I should have…’?” Clinton sort of ducked that one. The accountability-heavy moment came when Sawyer’s slow and steady line of questioning on Benghazi security prompted Clinton to utter this self-contradictory and sure-to-be-repeated statement: “I take responsibility, but I was not making security decisions.”

For the record, possible-presidential-candidates-in-abeyance should never attach conjunctions to their declarations of responsibility-taking.

Another telling moment came when Sawyer placed before Clinton all the warnings that bad things were afoot in Benghazi. “Did you miss it? Did you miss the moment to prevent this from happening?” Sawyer asked. Clinton’s response started with these two words: “No, but …”

The fantastic grilling served up by Sawyer wasn’t exceptional just because of its smartness, its civility or its persistence. It was exceptional for the way in which it upended the emphases of Benghazi “scandal” coverage. Ever since the issue roared to life amid the 2012 presidential campaign, media fixation has attached to how the Obama White House managed the post-attack phase. The allegation here is that Obama’s advisers attempted to frame the events as a random spasm of violence in reaction to an anti-Islam video, as opposed to admitting right away that the United States had been victimized again by terrorism.

Instead of obsessing over that phase of Benghazi, Sawyer went heavy on the security questions: They came first, they dominated the nearly 10-minute Benghazi discussion and they may well fuel a new round of questions for the former secretary. Fox News, which interviews Clinton on June 17, might consider giving her a chance to clarify just what taking responsibility means."

All outside parties should do everything they can to end a war in which both Israel and Hamas have seemed willing to fight to the death of the last Palestinian civilian. Perhaps a path out of the madness can be found during the 72-hour humanitarian cease-fire set to begin early Friday today.

Kerry has been slammed as naive for pressing Israel to end its attack, which as of this writing has cost the lives of more than 1,300 Palestinians and 59 Israelis. The contention of Kerry's critics — essentially that more killing of innocent civilians is justified if, in the end, Hamas is defanged and discredited — strikes me as morally untenable. Israel's undeniable right to self-defense does not extend to shelling a school crowded with unarmed refugees.

It is understandable that Israel would want to destroy tunnels that terrorists might use for attacks or kidnappings. But Kerry's cease-fire proposal did not call for the Israeli armed forces to withdraw from Gaza, and U.S. officials reportedly gave assurances that Israel could continue its demolition of the tunnels during any pause in the fighting.

The real objection of those who ridicule the secretary’s efforts seems to be that he came up with a plan that Hamas and its key remaining allies — the Islamist governments of Qatar and Turkey — could actually accept.

To say that Hamas is increasingly isolated is an understatement. Its most important patron — the Muslim Brotherhood-led government in Egypt — is gone, replaced by the brutally anti-Islamist regime of President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi. Rather than come to Hamas's defense, Egypt has sealed the border crossing at Rafah, in effect helping Israel squeeze Gaza in a vise.

Meanwhile, the governments of Saudi Arabia and Jordan, which usually provide rhetorical and diplomatic support to the Palestinian side during these periodic clashes, have been publicly silent. And the West Bank leadership of the Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas has been anything but full-throated in calling for an end to the Israeli campaign.

These Arab regimes see the Islamist political movement — which is threatening to fill the power vacuums left by the tumult of the Arab Spring — as a potentially mortal threat. Crushing Hamas would be a major blow against the Islamists. So why press the Israelis to stop?

This is the broader strategic context that Kerry allegedly fails to appreciate. But I disagree, both on Kerry’s supposed inability to see the big picture and on what that picture really looks like. It would be a tragic mistake, in my view, to accept the proposition that U.S. policy in the Middle East must be entirely shaped by the Islamists vs. secularists framework as construed by pro-Western — but clearly self-interested — governments in the region.

The view that Israel should be left to “finish the job” against Hamas sounds like clear-eyed realpolitik. Actually, it is an illusion. There are two major problems with having U.S. policy adopt this approach.

Advertisement

First is the tremendous loss of human life. It matters that civilians are in the line of fire between Israel and Hamas — even if, in some instances, it seems clear that Hamas put them there. Israel is and will remain one of the United States’ closest allies. But while it is not possible to specify an exact number of acceptable Palestinian casualties, that number has clearly been surpassed.

Second, it seems obvious to me that further smashing of Hamas is unlikely to bring either Israel or the United States closer to what should be our common strategic goals.

Eventually, Islamist militants in Gaza — whether they remain in power or not — will dig new tunnels and restock their stores of rockets. Even if Hamas were to cease to exist as a formal organization, how long would it be before something very much like Hamas arose to take its place?

The way for Israel to minimize Islamist radicalism in Gaza and the West Bank is to show Palestinians a brighter potential future under moderate secular leadership. Instead, Israel undermines Abbas by building on land that would have to be Palestinian territory in any equitable two-state solution.

As far as U.S. interests are concerned, it is obvious that our policy should be to fight Islamist terrorist groups such as the Islamic State. But we should not lose sight of the fact that radical Islam, as a regionwide phenomenon, is an ideological force that cannot be bombed out of existence.

Channeling the Islamist impulse onto a constructive path is one of the great international challenges of our age. Killing civilians in Gaza makes that task even harder.

But that's only half the story. More significant is the consternation of America's Arab partners, starting with the president of the Palestinian Authority. Mahmoud Abbas was stunned that Kerry would fly off to Paris to negotiate with Hamas allies Qatar and Turkey in talks that excluded the PA and Egypt.

The talks also undermined Egypt's cease-fire proposal, which Israel had accepted and Hamas rejected (and would have prevented the vast majority of the casualties on both sides). ""Kerry tried through his latest plan to destroy the Egyptian bid,"" charged a senior Palestinian official quoted in the Arab daily Asharq Al-Awsat — a peace plan that the PA itself had supported.

It gets worse. Kerry did not just trample an Egyptian initiative. It was backed by the entire Arab League and specifically praised by Saudi Arabia. With the exception of Qatar — more a bank than a country — the Arabs are unanimous in wanting to see Hamas weakened, if not overthrown. The cease-fire-in-place they backed would have denied Hamas any reward for starting this war, while what Kerry brought back from Paris granted practically all of its demands.

Which is what provoked the severe criticism Kerry received at home. When as respected and scrupulously independent a national security expert as David Ignatius calls Kerry's intervention a blunder, you know this is not partisan carping from the usual suspects. This is general amazement at Kerry's cluelessness.

Kerry seems oblivious to the strategic reality that Hamas launched its rockets in the hope not of defeating Israel but of ending its intra-Arab isolation (which it brilliantly achieves in the Qatar-Turkey peace proposal). Hamas's radicalism has alienated nearly all of its Arab neighbors.

●Egypt cut it off — indeed blockaded Gaza — because of Hamas's support for the Muslim Brotherhood and terrorist attacks on Egyptian soldiers in Sinai.

●Fatah, the main element of the Palestinian Authority, is a bitter enemy, particularly since its Gaza members were terrorized, kneecapped, expelled and/or killed when Hamas seized Gaza in a 2007 coup.

●Hamas is non grata in Syria, where it had been previously headquartered, for supporting the anti-government rebels.

●Hamas is deeply opposed by Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, which see it, correctly, as yet another branch of the Islamist movement that threatens relatively moderate pro-Western Arab states.

Kerry seems not to understand that the Arab League backed the Egyptian cease-fire-in-place, which would have left Hamas weak and isolated, to ensure that Hamas didn't emerge from this war strengthened and enhanced.

Why didn’t Kerry just stay home and declare unequivocal U.S. support for the Egyptian/Arab League plan? Instead, he flew off to Paris and sent Jerusalem a package of victories for Hamas: lifting the blockade from Egypt, opening the border with Israel, showering millions of foreign cash to pay the salaries of the 43,000 (!) government workers that the near-insolvent Hamas cannot.

Forget about Israeli interests. Forget about Arab interests. The American interest is to endorse and solidify this emerging axis of moderate pro-American partners (Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf states, and the Palestinian Authority) intent on seeing Islamist radicalism blunted and ultimately defanged.

Share this article Share

Yet America's secretary of state doesn't see it. Speaking of Hamas-run Gaza, Kerry actually said in Paris: ""The Palestinians can't have a cease-fire in which they think the status quo is going to stay."" What must change? Gazans need ""goods that can come in and out . . . a life that is free from the current restraints.""

But the only reason for those “restraints,” why goods are unable to go in and out, is that for a decade Hamas has used this commerce to import and develop weapons for making war on Israel.

Remember the complaints that the heartless Israelis were not allowing enough imports of concrete for schools and hospitals? Well, now we know where the concrete went — into an astonishingly vast array of tunnels for infiltrating neighboring Israeli villages and killing civilians. (More than half a million tons, estimates the Israeli military.)

Lifting the blockade would mean a flood of arms, rockets, missile parts and other implements of terror for Hamas. What is an American secretary of state doing asserting that Hamas cannot cease fire unless it gets that?

Moreover, the fire from which Hamas will not cease consists of deliberate rocket attacks on Israeli cities — by definition, a war crime.

Whatever his intent, Kerry legitimized Hamas’s war criminality. Which makes his advocacy of Hamas’s terms not just a strategic blunder — enhancing a U.S.-designated terrorist group just when a wall-to-wall Arab front wants to see it gone — but a moral disgrace.

Kerry's error has been to put so much emphasis on achieving a quick halt to the bloodshed that he has solidified the role of Hamas, the intractable, unpopular Islamist group that leads Gaza, along with the two hard-line Islamist nations that are its key supporters, Qatar and Turkey. In the process, he has undercut not simply the Israelis but also the Egyptians and the Fatah movement that runs the Palestinian Authority, all of which want to see an end to Hamas rule in Gaza.

A wiser course, which Kerry rejected in his hunt for a quick diplomatic solution, would have been to negotiate the cease-fire through the Palestinian Authority, as part of its future role as the government of Gaza. Hamas agreed last April to bring the authority back to Gaza as part of a unity agreement with Fatah that was brokered by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

Kerry has been motivated by two understandable short-term needs: First, he wants to stop the horrific slaughter in Gaza, with its heavy loss of life among Palestinian civilians, including children. Second, he seeks to fulfill the instructions of President Obama, who wants an immediate cease-fire and has become skeptical about solving the knotted Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Kerry's approach has ignited a firestorm in Israel, with commentators left and right accusing him of taking Hamas's side and betraying Israel. That criticism is unfair, and it prompted a complaint Sunday from Obama in a phone call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Kerry’s mistake isn’t any bias against Israel but rather a bias in favor of an executable, short-term deal.

A case can be made for this ""kick the can down the road"" approach, as I did last week in discussing Kerry's recent diplomatic negotiations over Iran's nuclear program and with rival political leaders in Afghanistan. But Gaza has suffered from a generation of brutal expediency. Any deal that reinforces Hamas's stranglehold — rather than building a path toward change of government, elections and eventual disarmament — is misconceived. In the name of stopping bloodshed this week, it all but guarantees it in the future. That's why public opinion polls show a strong majority of Gazans back the idea of returning to Palestinian Authority control — because they want an end to the cycle of intermittent warfare.

Israel has undermined its own cause with statements that appear to be insensitive to Palestinian loss of life. One example is the claim of Israel's ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, that ""the Israeli Defense Forces should be given the Nobel Peace Prize"" for showing ""unimaginable restraint,"" at a time when photos and videos provide wrenching evidence of civilian casualties in the densely packed cities of Gaza.

Follow this author David Ignatius 's opinions Follow

Kerry’s initial plan was to support Egypt’s demand that Hamas accept a cease-fire. When Hamas balked at surrender and it was clear that Egypt lacked the clout to make the deal stick, Kerry turned to Turkey and Qatar, which as friends and financial backers of Hamas had more leverage. That put the deal first and a stable solution to Gaza’s problems second. The deal blew up anyway, victim of Israeli and Palestinian inability to get to yes.

By turning to Turkey and Qatar, Kerry also enhanced their position in the regional power game. That's contrary to the interests and desires of the United States' traditional allies, such as Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the moderate Palestinian camp headed by Abbas.

If Kerry has been shortsighted about seeking a path toward a more stable Gaza, so has Netanyahu's government. The Israeli prime minister denounced the Palestinian unity agreement forged by Abbas last spring, even though it opened the way for an alternative non-Hamas government. More important, Netanyahu consistently has failed to give Palestinian moderates the concessions that might enhance their power in both the West Bank and Gaza. When Palestinians heard Netanyahu say recently that Israel must maintain military control of the West Bank for decades, they ask: What's the point of negotiating a two-state solution?

Does Netanyahu really want a months-long, house-to-house military campaign in Gaza that could push Israeli casualties above a thousand and effectively mean re-occupation of the territory? If not, he had better figure out a way to empower Palestinian moderates who, with international help, can build something different in Gaza.

Whether Kerry gets a permanent cease-fire or not, the same basic issue will haunt Gaza going forward, which is how to establish the Palestinian Authority as a responsible government that actually controls the territory. Israelis fear that the authority might operate on the Lebanese model — with Hamas maintaining a deadly militia, just as Hezbollah does in Beirut.

That’s the right long-term question to be negotiating — and it’s where Kerry should be spending U.S. diplomatic capital, rather than in another pursuit of the interim deal."

Over the coming days, Egyptian mediators plan to shuttle between Palestinian and Israeli delegations to try to work out an agreement.

U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, speaking in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., urged both sides to take advantage of the Gaza truce to move toward broader negotiations.

Asked whether he supported Palestinian demands for a lifting of Israel’s blockade of Gaza, Kerry said: “What we want to do is support the Palestinians in their desire to improve their lives and to get food in and to open crossings and to reconstruct and have greater freedom.”

But that must come “with a greater responsibility toward Israel, which means giving up rockets,” he said, referring to the barrages unleashed by Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in the Gaza Strip. “No country can live with that condition, and the United States stands squarely behind Israel’s right to defend itself in those circumstances. Period.”

Kerry said all this would come together only with a “bigger, broader approach to the underlying solution of two states” that would provide security for Israel and “a better life and greater freedoms for the Palestinians.”

After nearly a month of grinding war, Gaza and southern Israel were experiencing something new: calm. Since the Egyptian-brokered cease-fire kicked in Tuesday morning at 8 a.m., there have been no rocket attacks or missile strikes. No tunnel infiltrations or shelled schools.

But there have not been any celebrations or declarations of victory, either. Just a single, haunting question: If this war is truly over, how long until the next one begins?

Cars and donkey carts loaded with household goods and mattresses filled the streets of Gaza on Wednesday and people lined up at banks to withdraw money, witnesses said. Hundreds of people went to inspect their flattened homes.

Both Israel and Hamas went into the fight seeking to change the underlying dynamics of a situation that has produced three rounds of combat in less than six years while crippling the Gazan economy. But after 29 days of fighting that claimed nearly 2,000 lives, it is far from clear that either side has succeeded.

That could mean the next round of battle kicks off in the coming few years, months or even days if both sides do not get enough of what they want during the negotiations beginning Wednesday in Cairo.

Hamas leaders have repeatedly said they seek an opening of Gaza’s border crossings, the release of Palestinian prisoners and international assistance in rebuilding the territory’s shattered economy, among other demands. Israel wants a demilitarization of the strip and a promise of an end to the rocket fire.

Israel on Tuesday withdrew its remaining ground forces from Gaza just ahead of the 72-hour truce’s start time as both sides fired their final barrages.

An Israel Defense Forces spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said Israel “would continue to maintain defensive positions from the air, from the coast and from the ground” just outside Gaza and that all would be prepared to return fire if the rocket strikes resume.

By Israel’s own admission, Hamas still has at least several thousand rockets despite firing 3,300 and losing an additional 3,000 to Israeli attacks. Hamas has reserved the right to dip deeper into its arsenal if Israel fails to yield to the group’s demands.

“They are still intact,” Mkhaimer Abusaada, a political-science professor at al-Azhar University in Gaza, said of Hamas. “They are not broken. They did not wave a white flag. It’s still a very strong resistance organization.”

In some ways, Abusaada said, the group is even stronger than it was at the war’s start, despite enduring weeks of Israeli bombardment.

Hamas has used its decades-long fight with Israel to rally support, and when the war began, the group was badly in need of it. Diplomatically isolated from Arab powers and facing a financial crunch from the closure of its smuggling tunnels, the group could not even afford to pay its 44,000 government employees.

Share this article Share

But the four-week war, in which Hamas launched rockets deeper into Israeli territory than ever before and used tunnels to carry out deadly infiltrations, has boosted the group’s image among many Palestinians.

Advertisement

It has also brought the group’s leaders to the negotiating table, where they will be able to make their demands and possibly win economic concessions that are now needed even more desperately.

“Now, Hamas is no longer isolated,” Abusaada said. “The Americans are negotiating with them indirectly. The Israelis are negotiating with them indirectly.”

But the Israelis are deeply reluctant to give Hamas anything that could be perceived as a reward for its militancy, and they hope that Gaza residents will ultimately blame Hamas for a war that has left approximately 1,800 Palestinians dead with little to show for it.

An Israeli military official said Tuesday that Hamas had been badly depleted by some 4,800 Israeli strikes on Gaza over the past month. The attacks destroyed hundreds of Hamas command centers and weapons facilities and killed about 900 militants, Israel’s military says. Troops also dismantled 32 tunnels, 14 of which connected directly to Israel.

By contrast, the official said, Hamas failed to land its punches.

“They can tell a narrative that they did damage to Israel, but really the damage is quite limited,” said the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record.

Still, there was little sense of triumph in Israel on Tuesday, and not only because many are still mourning 64 dead Israeli soldiers and three civilians.

On Israel's political left and right, there were apprehensions that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not use the conflict to try to create a new order in Gaza that does not involve recurring bouts of war.

The cease-fire was greeted with scorn by hard-line members of Israel’s cabinet who want the government to topple Hamas and put Gaza under an international mandate.

“This situation of limbo — no war, no peace — is the worst scenario for Israel,” Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said in an interview. “We can’t survive having another conflict every two or three years.”

On the other side of Israel’s political spectrum, Labor Party leader Isaac Herzog said he, too, fears that the apparent end of this conflict could merely set the stage for the next.

But he said Israel now has an opportunity to use the Cairo talks to empower the relatively moderate government of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and restore him to Gaza, seven years after his forces were routed from the territory by Hamas.

Abbas’s government will lead the Palestinian delegation in Cairo, which will also include representatives of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad group.

“There’s a clear convergence of interests between Egypt, Jordan, the Gulf states, Israel and the Palestinian Authority in recognizing that we need to combat terrorism and move toward peace,” Herzog said.

That’s also a U.S. goal, and Washington has sought ways to shore up Abbas’s credibility as the leader of all Palestinians.

Economic or practical improvements for Gazans are one likely way to do that if Israel agrees and Hamas cedes greater control to its longtime rival. The United States would be expected to be a major donor and facilitator, but large questions remain about how economic development can coexist with security measures to partly demilitarize Gaza and prevent Hamas from re-arming.

Israeli officials expressed skepticism Tuesday that the talks could succeed in delivering much more than a fragile and temporary truce. Hamas remains the de facto power in Gaza, they said, and the group has no interest in changing that.

“A whole different relationship could be built, but the chances of that happening are not all that great,” said an Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record.

The official said the one major difference between these talks and the Cairo-based negotiations that ended the last war between Israel and Hamas is that Egypt has a new government that is much more hostile to the Palestinian group.

While Hamas was able to use tunnels beneath the Egyptian border to smuggle in weapons after the 2012 fight ended, that will be more difficult now that Egypt’s military-backed government has effectively shut the tunnels down.

“That may be the game-changer,” the official said. “If there is one.”"

Speaking from Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., where he is on vacation, President Obama called for national unity following the police shooting Saturday of Michael Brown, 18, in this St. Louis suburb. “Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson,’’ Obama said. “Let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family.’’

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. then announced a series of steps his department is taking, including a meeting held Thursday with civic leaders to calm tensions and an escalating civil rights probe in which federal investigators have already interviewed witnesses to the shooting.

In unusually blunt remarks, Holder said that he was “deeply concerned” about “the deployment of military equipment and vehicles’’ on Ferguson’s streets and that Missouri officials have accepted federal assistance “to conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.’’

Even as dozens of protesters continued their campaign near the shooting scene for a fifth day on Thursday, state officials followed the federal lead. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) announced that the Missouri State Highway Patrol would take over security operations in Ferguson, led by Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, an African American who grew up in the area. “We are going to have a different approach and have the approach that we’re in this together,” Johnson said.

Protests turn tense again in Ferguson, Mo. + 95 Clashes intensified as a curfew went into effect after the governor declared a state of emergency.

As a result, the heavy riot armor, the SWAT trucks with sniper posts and the gas masks were gone from the streets of Ferguson Thursday night, and Johnson marched with the crowd, eliciting cheers from the protesters. Johnson vowed to not blockade the streets, to set up a media staging center, and to ensure that residents’ rights to assemble and protest were not infringed upon.

“I’m not afraid to be in this crowd,” Johnson declared to reporters.

Obama’s remarks were the most visible step in a rapid coalescence among political and community leaders to tamp down the violence, as images of riot police, tear gas and government intervention provoked a national debate about race and justice that recalled civil rights battles of a half-century ago.

In a sudden burst of interest fueled by photos and video of heavily armed police that swirled on social media, politicians from both sides of the aisle rushed on Thursday — five days after the shooting — to condemn the tactics of the nearly all-white police force in the predominantly African American town.

The reactions were remarkably similar across the political spectrum. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), for example, called for authorities to “de-militarize this situation,’’ while Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), a likely Republican presidential candidate, condemned “the militarization of our law enforcement’’ in a Time magazine essay.

But on the ground in Ferguson, the support from politicians at all levels was met with skepticism, and it was unclear how much effect it would have.

Eddie Hasan, a St. Louis resident who helped organize a forum Thursday night at a local Baptist church for young people to voice their concerns, called on elected officials to play a greater role in calming tensions. ""This forum, this chance for the youth to speak out absolutely should have happened sooner,"" he said. ""Hopefully it helps us get some resolution to the issue.""

State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, who has been active in planning recent protests and was tear-gassed Monday, said local and state officials have been woefully absent. “There hasn’t been a single white Democrat down here,” Chappelle-Nadal, who represents Ferguson, said on Wednesday before Nixon’s visit. “Mark my words, the Republicans might start showing up before they do.”

Underlying the dispute was the continuing lack of clarity about just what happened Saturday night in Ferguson.

Share this article Share

According to a friend who says he witnessed the incident, Brown was walking down a Ferguson street when a police officer in a car ordered him to get on the sidewalk. Brown had his hands in the air to show he was unarmed when the officer shot him multiple times, the friend said.

The police version is that Brown attacked the officer in his car and tried to grab his gun. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said during a news conference on Wednesday that the officer was struck in the face during the encounter. The side of the officer’s face was “swollen,” Jackson said, and he was treated at a hospital.

Federal investigators are still trying to sort out the conflicting versions of events but are proceeding cautiously and deferring to state investigators for now, a federal law enforcement official said Thursday. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said the investigation is a high priority for the Justice Department and FBI but it is far too early to determine if any charges will be brought.

The Justice Department’s civil rights division, along with the U.S. attorney’s office in St. Louis and the local FBI field office, are investigating the shooting to determine if anyone’s civil rights were violated. The federal probe is running parallel to the state investigation.

Holder, who met with Obama on Thursday to discuss the case, said: “Our review will take time to conduct, but it will be thorough and fair.”

Another source of frustration for residents is that police, who initially promised to identify the officer involved in the shooting, have backtracked because of what they say are threats to his safety.

The lack of specifics about the shooting, combined with anger over the show of police force, has many protesters vowing to continue their campaign. Dozens of people did so on Thursday near the shooting scene and also outside the Ferguson police station.

On the fourth day of demonstrations, the crowds still rivaled the size at comparable points on previous days, with dozens standing around the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store and half a dozen or so on the center divider — with one man laying face down in the street and the others pointing their fingers like guns at him.

“Hands up, don’t shoot!” they declared, words that have been the soundtrack of Ferguson’s unrest.

Many residents said that they do not care if elected officials ever show up. “I don’t want to see any governors, or any mayors, or even any more cameras,” said Derrick Beavers, 32, a protester who said he knew Brown. “I want justice.”

In Massachusetts, Obama also called on federal officials to ensure “that justice is done.”

“There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,” the president said, adding: “There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.’’

In concluding his remarks, Obama said that while ""emotions are raw right now"" in the suburb and accounts of the tragedy differ, ""Now is the time for healing. Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson. Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done. And I've asked the attorney general and the U.S. attorney on the scene to continue to work with local officials to move that process forward.""

Obama did not take questions from reporters after his remarks.

In Missouri, Nixon said the highway patrol would assume operational control of the law enforcement response to protests but that local officers from Ferguson and the county police would remain involved, as they have been all week.

When Johnson took the podium, it seemed clear that things had changed, at least rhetorically. “I understand the anger and fear that the citizens of Ferguson are feeling, and our officers will respect both of those,” said Johnson, who has been the head of the highway patrol’s troopers in the region since 2002."

CNN —

Yes, Hillary Clinton is running for president, and she is running away from President Barack Obama’s record on foreign policy.

That’s a very clear message from the interview just published in The Atlantic in which she drew sharp distinctions between her view of America’s role in the world and those of the President, while also expressing significant disagreements with him over the right approach to ongoing crises in the Middle East.

Frida Ghitis Tanya Malott

In a dramatic dismissal of the Obama administration’s self-described foreign policy doctrine of “Don’t do stupid stuff,” Clinton declared, “Great nations need organizing principles and ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle.”

Clinton clothed her criticism in respect of her “incredibly intelligent” former boss, but Obama may have clenched his jaw with irritation when he read the polite pummeling from his former secretary of state. Clinton promptly explained that even she didn’t think that Obama really meant that is his foreign policy doctrine. (The name Obama used to describe the policy, incidentally, uses a four-letter word instead of “stuff.”) She claimed that the catchy phrase was an effort to convey to Americans wary of U.S. misadventures in faraway lands that he was not about to do “something crazy.”

Still, Clinton articulated a vision for a much more assertive U.S. role in the world, one that contrasts sharply with Obama’s. In doing so, she brandished a lacerating analysis of the administration’s foreign policy. Most troubling for Obama was her intimation that some of the most difficult, dangerous and deadly problems raging in the Middle East today might have been avoided if Obama had acted more promptly and less hesitantly.

Clinton splits with Obama on foreign policy

The interview with The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg was a landmark moment in her quest for the office. She has made the big break with Obama and filled out an important part of her job application, telling Americans concerned about the country’s place in the world why they should vote for her.

Like any statement made by a political candidate, there were unmistakable political calculations in her well-chosen words. It is clear that she believes her biggest political challenge lies on the right, not on the left, if nothing happens to dissuade her from running, which she evidently wants to do. The strategy is already that of a nominee, safe in the support of her party, seeking to peel away centrist voters and even conservative voters in the general election rather than courting the Democratic base in the primaries.

Many in the base, the hard-core, left-of-center Democrats, will resent her implied denunciation of Obama’s cautious style which, she contended, has swung too far in the opposite direction after the Bush years.

“When you’re down on yourself,” she said, “when you’re hunkering down and pulling back, you’re not going to make any better decisions than when you were aggressively, belligerently putting yourself forward.” The government, she said, has a tendency to swing between those extremes.

She proposes a midcourse. “We’ve learned the limits of America’s power to spread freedom and democracy,” she acknowledged, “but we’ve also learned the importance of our power, our influence, and our values appropriately deployed and explained.” Right now, she argued, “We don’t tell our own story very well.”

When the Soviet Union fell, an ideological vacuum was filled by dangerous ideologies. Clinton appears to view Islamic extremism as the foremost foe facing America. She also is concerned about muscular nationalism of the kind Russian President Vladimir Putin is utilizing to spread Russia’s influence.

America’s main threats are Jihadi groups, now controlling territory in Syria and Iraq and determined to expand; Clinton views them as ideological enemies of the United States. “I’m thinking a lot about containment, deterrence, and defeat,” she said, drawing a parallel with the Cold War era.

She did not push back against the suggestion that the rise of the Islamic extremists of ISIS might have been prevented if Obama had armed Syrian moderates three years ago.

Although he has approved increased support, Obama has rejected the notion that “former farmers or teachers or pharmacists” in the opposition could have succeeded with U.S. help. But Clinton disagrees. By failing to arm a force of carefully vetted moderates, the United States made it possible for extremists to take over the fight. Some of those extremists, who have captured large swaths of Syria, are now in Iraq, where Obama reluctantly agreed last week to intervene in what is a strategic and humanitarian calamity.

Clinton took what appears to be a harder line than the administration on nuclear negotiations with Iran. She laughed in describing Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s position “that they don’t have any intention of having a nuclear weapon but they nevertheless want 190,000 centrifuges.” She rejected Iran’s claim that it has a right to enrichment, and said America’s stance should allow only a minimal number of centrifuges for research purposes.

Regarding Israel and the Palestinians, she spoke in words that Israel’s supporters will find reassuring. “There’s no doubt in my mind that Hamas initiated this conflict.” Israel, she said emphatically, “has the right to defend itself.” That is something Obama has said repeatedly, but Clinton spoke much more forcefully than the Obama administration has.

Regarding civilian casualties, she spoke of the difficulty of fighting an enemy embedded in civilian areas. “The ultimate responsibility,” she said, “rests with Hamas.”

Hamas, she said, is not a group the United States could work with, given its commitment to the destruction of Israel, “married to very nasty tactics and ideologies, including virulent anti-Semitism.” Clinton argued that international criticism of Israel and disproportional attention to what it does is partly the result of anti-Semitism, particularly in Europe.

She listed the many times Israel has made far-reaching peace proposals to Palestinians. “I don’t care about revisionist history,” she said. “I know that (Yasser) Arafat walked away,” and expressed sympathy for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s position on a military withdrawal from the West Bank. “If I were the prime minister of Israel,” she said, “You’re damn right I would expect to have control over security, for a number of years.” “With Syria and Iraq,” she said “it is all one big threat.”

It is no secret that Clinton has advocated a much more internationally engaged, muscular and even ideological foreign policy, aimed at promoting America’s values, which “also happen to be universal values.”

She has now cast herself apart from the Obama administration on key aspects of world affairs, and sent a message to centrist voters, and to international audiences, that a Hillary Clinton administration would not look like its predecessor’s.

Holder Jr. will travel to this battle-scarred St. Louis suburb to oversee the investigation of the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager at the hands of a white police officer, the White House said Monday. Holder’s visit was announced as National Guard troops arrived to back up local and state police. On Monday night in Ferguson, an early evening calm gave way to new confrontations as some demonstrators threw bottles at heavily armed police and officers threw stun grenades and tear gas towards them.

The day was expected to be a crucial test for everybody in charge here, from local police commanders to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) — who had called out the National Guard after chaotic protests Sunday — to President Obama himself. Obama’s decision to dispatch his attorney general was an admission that the teenager’s killing had become a symbol of something enormous: a test of the American justice system and the government’s ability to police the officers who police everyone else.

Monday was a test, too, for community leaders — including ministers — who had hoped to keep the protests peaceful and focused on the death of Michael Brown, 18.

“We’re helping the police. Please move out the street,” they said over bullhorns, urging the crowds to move back from police lines.

Protests turn tense again in Ferguson, Mo. + 95 Clashes intensified as a curfew went into effect after the governor declared a state of emergency.

But despite all their good intentions, darkness fell and Ferguson slipped back toward chaos.

“We feel boxed in,” said Kerry Green, 35, a St. Louis native who has been at the protests every night. As he spoke, he was looking at police lined up at an intersection in front of him, a few minutes before the tear gas began to fly.

Green said the events in Ferguson were about much more than one killing, mentioning other cases, including that of Eric Garner, a New York man who died after police put him in a chokehold last month.

“It’s more than Mike Brown,” Green said. “It’s for the man who got choked out in New York. It’s for Trayvon Martin. It’s for us riding down the street with three friends in the car and we get pulled over.”

Earlier in the day, in Washington, authorities said Holder would arrive in Ferguson on Wednesday and meet with some of the FBI agents and prosecutors investigating the case. They have interviewed more than 200 people, scouring the area where Brown was shot by Darren Wilson, an officer with Ferguson's police department.

Also Monday, a St. Louis radio station reported that a woman had called to tell the officer’s side of the story. The station, KFTK, said the woman called herself Josie and said that the confrontation began when Wilson told Brown and a friend to stop walking in the street. The caller said Wilson then decided that the two fit the description of robbery suspects and sought to stop them.

The caller said the men fought near the car, then Brown went a distance away, turned and charged the officer. “He just started to come at him full speed,” the caller said. “And so he just started shooting, and he just kept coming. . . . The final shot was in the forehead, and he fell about two, three feet in front of the officer.”

CNN reported that this account seemed to match a version of events the officer gave to investigators.

Earlier Monday, Obama addressed the unrest in Ferguson in starkly emotional terms at the White House. ""As Americans, we've got to use this moment to seek out our shared humanity that's been laid bare by this moment,'' he said. ""The potential of a young man and the sorrows of parents, the frustrations of a community, the ideals that we hold as one united American family.''

As he has before, Obama said that while most demonstrators are acting peacefully, “a small minority of individuals are not. While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions.”

One stark illustration that the Brown case has revealed doubts about the government’s ability to police the police: Three separate autopsies have now been conducted on the teenager’s body. One was done at the behest of St. Louis County, another by private pathologists at the behest of Brown’s family and a third by the U.S. military at the behest of Holder.

On Monday, the results of the county autopsy and the family autopsy were revealed.

The county's review, released to state prosecutors late Friday, found that Brown had six gunshot wounds to the head and chest and was shot from the front, people familiar with the autopsy said. It also showed that Brown had marijuana in his system, they said.

Also Monday, two forensic pathologists hired by Brown’s family said their autopsy showed he was hit by at least six shots, one of which struck him at the top of the head and traveled downward through the brain. They said two wounds appeared to be “reentry” wounds. They said that there were no signs on Brown’s body of a struggle and that he did not appear to have been shot at close range because no gunshot residue was found on his body.

An attorney for the Brown family said the autopsy showed that the teenager was “trying to surrender” when he was shot, but the forensic pathologists — Michael Baden and Shawn Parcells — said they could not determine whether that was the case.

Baden, a former longtime medical examiner in New York City, said Brown could have survived all of his gunshot wounds except the one to the top of his head.

The federal government’s autopsy was conducted Monday. Its results have not yet been released.

In Ferguson, the governor canceled the city’s midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew after one chaotic day. The worst night yet had been Sunday, when protesters threw debris at police and officers fired tear gas at the crowd before the curfew even took effect. In Ferguson, Monday night began with a false calm. The side streets off West Florissant had been blocked with fencing, making it harder to reach the scene of earlier confrontations — and harder to leave.

As of 9 p.m. local time, police were standing back, letting protesters move. Some officers, borrowed from the city of St. Louis, handed out water. Somebody in the crowd gave out red roses in Brown’s honor. The crowd was full of white-collared clergy members.

But Ron Robinson, a major with the St. Louis city police, said he could not relax. “It’s not over,” he said before 8 p.m. local time. “It’s gonna get worse before it gets better.”

And it did, again.

A few hours later, a line of police had formed in front of a Family Dollar on West Florissant Avenue, using sirens to try to drive back the crowd. TV cameras showed officers standing up through the roof hatches of armored vehicles, carrying rifles. “If you are standing in the street you are unlawfully assembled and you are subject to arrest,” an officer yelled toward a boarded-up barbecue restaurant.

Members of the crowd pulled a “yield” sign out of the ground and stood in the middle of the street defying the law enforcement officer’s instructions.

Later, just before 11 p.m. local time, a confrontation broke out near the burned-out remains of a Quik Trip convenience store — destroyed in the aftermath of Brown’s death. Dozens of men and women stood at the darkened Quik Trip parking lot. Some held their hands up. A police helicopter flew low overhead.

“If you are on the Quik Trip parking lot, you are unlawfully assembled. You need to continue to move,” an officer said .

The protesters stayed, and set up orange cones. Police responded by throwing out smoke bombs and flares, which engulfed TV reporters in the middle of their liveshots. West Florissant filled with smoke. Demonstrators pulled porta-potties into the middle of the roadways. Around midnight local time, the crowd had thinned down to a few clusters of people — including many members of the media. TV cameras showed a few protesters being arrested after refusing police commands to clear the road.

“Some of the media be like we provoking this. We standing on the sidewalk. They trained automatic weapons on us. [Protesters] threw a water bottle. That’s it,” said Carl Brown, a 26-year-old demonstrator."

Our society expects the police to keep unemployed, poorly educated African American men out of sight and out of mind. When they suddenly take center stage, illuminated by the flash and flicker of Molotov cocktails, we feign surprise. The proximate cause of the rioting in Ferguson, Mo., is the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was stopped, a witness has said, by a white policeman for walking in the street rather than on the sidewalk. Officer Darren Wilson shot Brown at least six times, according to a private autopsy and, reportedly, one conducted by the St. Louis County medical examiner. Two of those bullets struck him in the head.

There we have the familiar narrative: another unarmed black man unjustly killed. Brown thus joins a long, sad list — Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, etc. — that seems to have no end.

This story line is unassailable. Anyone who thinks race is not a factor in these fatal encounters should have to cite examples of unarmed, young, white men being killed by trigger-happy police or self-appointed vigilantes. Names and dates, please.

But the violence in Ferguson tells of a deeper, more fundamental narrative about what African Americans have done, and what has been done to them, in the decades since the urban riots of the 1960s — the fire last time.

Follow this author Eugene Robinson 's opinions Follow

Tempted to conclude that nothing has changed? Please note that the Missouri Highway Patrol commander, brought in to bring proportion and discipline to what had been a provocative local police response, is black. The attorney general who interrupted his Martha's Vineyard vacation to order a Justice Department investigation and a third autopsy is black. And, of course, the president and commander in chief — who also took time from a Vineyard holiday to address the crisis in Ferguson — is black.

Also note that this undeniable evidence of progress on the issue of race — which would have been unimaginable when Harlem exploded in 1964 over the police shooting of a 15-year-old boy — makes no apparent difference to the young men who have been rampaging through the streets of Ferguson.

Why not? Because the tremendous gains achieved by some African Americans have not just left some others behind but made their situation more desperate and hopeless than it was 50 years ago.

When the unrest in Ferguson is over, I predict that there will be a flood of ambitious journalism seeking to assess the status of black America. Most of this analysis will be ignored because it will so contradict what many Americans see every day with their own eyes.

Millions of African Americans took advantage of the opportunities created by the civil rights movement to climb into the middle class — and in some cases far beyond, as exemplified by President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder.

Advertisement

Yet millions of other black Americans did not reach the middle class. This group, mired in poverty and dysfunction, finds the paths others took are blocked. They live in neighborhoods with failing schools that cannot prepare them for today’s economy. Secure, high-paying blue-collar jobs are a thing of the past. Racial bias in policing means African Americans are much more likely to be arrested and jailed for minor nonviolent offenses, such as drug possession, than whites who commit the same crimes.

Increasingly, these African Americans who were left behind are invisible. Their neighborhoods either get gentrified — which means they can no longer afford to stay there — or simply bypassed by development. What happens in poor black neighborhoods has less and less to do with the everyday lives of middle-class Americans, white or black.

Yet in Ferguson and other such pockets across the nation, millions of young black men and women grow up knowing that the deck is stacked against them. Did Michael Brown have a chip on his shoulder? Not according to his friends and family, although the convenience store video suggests otherwise. Would it be understandable if he did? Might he have wondered if white kids, living in more affluent parts of town, routinely got hassled by the police for jaywalking?

Brown had no police record. He had graduated from high school. He was about to enter a technical college. Given where he came from, it’s hard to do a whole lot better — and easy to do a whole lot worse."

The warning came a day after the group overran a major air base in north-central Syria, putting the Islamic State in full control of Raqqah province, where American photojournalist James Foley was held for much of his captivity and where his beheading last week is thought to have occurred.

Raqqah also was the site of a failed rescue attempt this summer in which Delta Force commandos sought to snatch Foley and a group of other Americans held by the Islamic State from a prison east of Raqqah, said U.S. officials and witnesses in the area.

The capture of Tabqa airfield Sunday was the latest in a string of recent military successes for the extremist fighters, who have been consolidating their hold across northern Syria even as U.S. airstrikes launched earlier this month temper the group’s expansion in northern Iraq.

U.S. officials have not ruled out pressing the airstrikes into Syria, telling reporters last week that the United States would not be restricted by ""geographic boundaries"" when confronting the militants.

On Monday, the White House said President Obama has not decided whether to pursue military action in Syria, but it would not say whether he has been presented with any specific options.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said “entire wings” of the Pentagon are “dedicated to making sure the president has a range of plans and options that they can present to him when — if and when necessary.”

As the administration considered possible military action in Syria, Obama last weekend authorized reconnaissance flights with manned and unmanned aircraft over potential Islamic State targets, a senior defense official said.

The authorization was in response to a request by the military’s Central Command. Officials said there has been no strike authorization, but the aerial intelligence-gathering is expected to provide a much better picture inside Syria than current satellite images and projections from outside Syrian airspace from flights near the country’s borders.

Earnest said that the current situation is different from last year’s proposed attacks against the Syrian government that Obama canceled after Congress rejected them. The administration has said that Obama has the constitutional authority to act to protect U.S. citizens such as those held hostage by the Islamic State in Syria.

On Monday, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem signaled that Damascus would not tolerate unilateral U.S. strikes against the extremists even in areas of the country the government no longer controls.

Fighting terrorism, Moualem said, should be done in cooperation with the Syrian government, “not through transgression against countries’ sovereignty.”

“Any breach of Syrian sovereignty by any side constitutes an act of aggression,” he added, speaking at a news conference in Damascus, according to the official Syrian Arab News Agency.

The Syrian government has long sought to use the extremists’ expanding influence as a means to restore U.S. recognition for the discredited regime, promising to act as partners in the fight against terrorism in return for an end to American support for the more-moderate rebels seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad.

Moualem appeared to open the door to a joint effort to fight the extremists, but he said the Syrian government would have to be consulted first. “They are welcome,” he said when asked whether the United States could be viewed as a Syrian partner against terrorists.

“Syria is ready to cooperate and coordinate on the regional and international level in the war on terror,” Moualem said. “But any effort to combat terrorism should be coordinated with the Syrian government.”

The loss of Tabqa represents a significant setback for Damascus, putting an entire province beyond the government’s reach for the first time since the revolt against Assad turned violent three years ago.

It also exposed the government's inability to confront the extremists, undermining a pledge by Assad in an inaugural speech marking his new seven-year term in office that the government would soon recapture Raqqah.

“It’s a blow to the regime’s confidence that it can actually prevail,” said Jeff White of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “It shows that the regime’s strategy of trying to hang on everywhere in Syria is failing. They just don’t have the resources to do that.”

The Assad government had for months refrained from confronting the Islamic State as the group expanded across northern and eastern Syria, carving out a haven that enabled it to recruit, train and grow ahead of its offensive across the border in Iraq in June.

That changed after the militants’ sweep through Iraq put them within striking distance of Baghdad, prompting airstrikes against Islamic State positions in their Raqqah stronghold.

The militants responded with counteroffensives against the three bases the government had retained in the province. With the fall of Tabqa, all the bases in Raqqah are in extremists’ hands.

The Syrian government said it evacuated most of its troops and aircraft from the base before the defeat. Videos posted on YouTube showed Islamic State fighters celebrating their victory.

The Islamic State also is pressing west and north into portions of Aleppo province that it lost this year to more-moderate rebels, threatening to retake key areas along the Turkish border from which it had been ejected.

On Monday, however, activists in northern Aleppo said rebel fighters had stemmed the advance, pushing the Islamic State out of six villages it had captured in recent days."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/26/world/meast/syria-american-killed/index.html?hpt=hp_t1",0,"Douglas McAuthur McCain, tattooed and thin, never stayed in one place long. Born on Jan. 29, 1981, in Illinois, he would spend 33 years hopping from school to school, from business to business, continent to continent — until, finally, he landed in Syria, where he became the first American reported to die fighting for the Islamic State.

Much of the Douglas McAuthur McCain story remains unclear. It’s unclear how he died in a recent Islamic State battle, into which he carried his American passport and $800. It’s unexplained what led him down a path to Islamist radicalization and violence. And it’s unknown whether he traveled alone.

A review of court records, social media accounts and news clippings does little to answer any of those questions, but instead conveys the profound contrast between the McCain who violently died in Syria — and the Midwestern McCain who rapped, worked dead end jobs, picked up a few petty convictions and was “just a regular American kid,” as one friend told the San Diego Union-Tribune.

His early life was one slice of Americana after another: He followed the Chicago Bulls, was a fan of Michael Jordan, watched “The Simpsons” and developed an affinity for Pizza Hut. After moving to the Minneapolis area as a boy, he played basketball in high school, though classmates tell reporters he wasn’t any good. Between 1997 and 2000, he attended two different high schools in the Robbinsdale Area School District, though the New York Times says district records don’t show him graduating from either school.

“He was a goofball in high school,” one classmate told NBC News, which broke the story. “Doug was a fun guy to be around. Played basketball, joked a lot, had a small sense of humor. Got along with most…. Wasn’t the best athlete, but liked to play.”

It was around that time that McCain started getting in trouble. Over the next eight years, he amassed nine misdemeanor convictions, according to Minnesota state court records. Problems began with a 2000 conviction for disorderly conduct. Then, in 2001, he was busted for misdemeanor theft. Two years later came a misdemeanor conviction for marijuana possession — his first of two minor busts for that offense. His driver’s license was eventually revoked, but McCain kept driving and got caught for that, too.

According to the address listed on his Minnesota driver’s license, he lived on a suburban, tree-lined, road called Oregon Avenue in the town of New Hope just outside Minneapolis. It’s unclear when he left Minnesota — or why — but he eventually resettled in San Diego, where a search of court records reveals he had no further run-ins with the law. The move coincided with another tectonic shift in McCain’s life: mounting religious fervor. On May 14 of this year, he tweeted, “I reverted to Islam 10 years ago and I must say In sha Allah I will never look back the best thing that ever happen to me.

Share this article Share

“Ya allah,” he wrote in another tweet, “when it’s my time to go have mercy on my soul have mercy on my bros.”

Though every Western foreign fighter leaves for Syria for different reasons, McCain’s early life carries themes found among other foreign militants. They often operate somewhere on the fringes of society and feel excluded, wrote expert Richard Barrett of the Soufan Group. “The French authorities categorize volunteers from France as disaffected, aimless and lacking a sense of identity or belonging,” Barrett wrote in his report. “This appears to be common across most nationalities and fits with the high number of converts, presumably people who are seeking a greater sense of purpose and meaning in their lives.”

Once settled in San Diego, McCain began working for a now-defunct Somali restaurant called African Spice in City Heights, the Union-Tribune reported. One woman interviewed by the paper recalled McCain was friends with the Somali owners. “They used to stand outside and smoke cigarettes,” she explained, requesting anonymity. “He wasn’t even very religious. He was just a regular American kid.”

But his social media soon suggested otherwise. His tenure on Twitter began innocuously with a late 2012 dispatch: “I’m not feelin this Twitter sh– … wallahi I wants fried chicken. … Watching the Help starting to make me hate white people. … Ok its official f— white people.” He spoke of smoking hookah, watching National Geographic, his Somali friends and his growing religious zeal.

But on Facebook, his imprint was substantially darker. In 2010, McCain, who later traveled to Sweden and Canada, uploaded several images of the black Islamist militant flag. His photo spread became a confounding mixture of family life beside militants clutching swords and images of gold-plated firearms. Then there was this message: The “soldiers of Allah” are “coming back.”

Sometime in the spring of this year, NBC News reported he traveled to Turkey under unknown circumstances. Several people told the news channel they met with McCain — who called himself “Duale” — at an Istanbul Burger King where “they talked about the NBA.” Afterward, on June 9, he sent a tweet to a purported member of the Islamic State: “I will be joining you guys soon.” Later, he wrote, “I’m with brothers now,” and retweeted a message saying, “It takes a warrior to understand a warrior.

""We don't have a strategy yet,"" Obama said, in response to questions about when he is prepared to begin military action in Syria, and, if not, why not?

Rarely has a president spoken so plainly.

“I don’t want to put the cart before the horse,” he said. The suggestion that “we’re about to go full scale on an elaborate strategy for defeating ISIL . . . that we’ll start moving forward imminently and somehow Congress, still out of town, is going to be left in the dark, that’s not what’s going to happen.” ISIL is one of several acronyms referring to the Islamic State.

Instead, the president said in a White House news conference, he has asked the Pentagon to prepare options while he puts together a broad, long-term plan including military, political, economic and diplomatic aspects and continues recruiting partner countries in the region and beyond to help carry it out.

“We’re not going to do that alone,” he said of the still-in-the-works strategy. “We’re going to have to do that with other partners.”

Many of those potential partners said they remain in the dark about what Obama has in mind, and some have expressed impatience about the length of time the administration is taking to figure it out.

""There is definitely more of an attitude [within the administration] to get involved"" in the wake of recent militant advances in Syria and Iraq and last week's execution of an American journalist, said one senior official from the region. But ""no one has had a conversation with us as to what that means.""

""When a superpower, the superpower, is reluctant in developing policy, it's not only about leadership, it's about having a coherent approach to crises,"" said another regional official.

“The ball is in the U.S. court,” said a third.

Senior officials from four Middle Eastern states spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid public indications of disquiet with Obama.

All expressed an eagerness to follow the U.S. lead in Syria, including, in some cases, possible participation in airstrikes against the Islamic State, should that be Obama's decision. All of their governments have repeatedly expressed concern over the past three years of Syria's civil war at what they've seen as administration reluctance to assert strong leadership in support of moderate rebels battling the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Many in the region were dismayed last year when Obama ordered U.S. airstrikes against Assad's chemical weapons program, and then hesitated long enough for Congress to refuse to approve them.

Since then, the war has become a three-way battle among the rebels, Assad and Islamist forces who see an opportunity in the Syrian chaos to establish an Islamic caliphate across the region. The Islamic State group is now the strongest of those forces and this summer extended its reach across northern and eastern Syria and into neighboring Iraq.

Early this month, Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes and other assistance against the Sunni Muslim militants in Iraq. Limited to the protection of U.S. citizens and facilities, they are designed to give the administration time to assess a broader strategy and to give Iraq's Shiite-led government the opportunity to turn its Sunni constituents against Islamic State with less sectarian, more inclusive policies.

Sunni governments in the region say they approve of U.S. actions in Iraq and will move to persuade their co-religionists there to firmly back the new government as soon as it demonstrates it is headed in the right direction.

But they now fear that the action in Iraq is not enough, and see an aggressively enforced U.S. strategy as the only way to overcome their own differences in the face of the larger Islamist threat, based in Syria, that could overwhelm them.

“In Syria, you have many actors, many moving pieces. There is not a coherent U.S. policy” to bring them all in line, an Arab official said. Countries the United States considers counterterrorism partners are broadly divided into two camps, with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan on one side and Qatar and Turkey on the other. The division has led to mixed messages and often divergent actions in support of different rebel factions.

“We’re not inventing the wheel anew here,” the official said. “We’ve all been there. We’ve all tried policies. Some succeeded, some failed. . . . We’re trying to get a coherent policy that not only says Egypt right, Qatar wrong,” or vice versa, “but also tells those countries, okay, we need to agree on three, four or five points.”

“It’s not about who’s right and who’s wrong, it’s about what we need to do.”

But Obama insisted Thursday that he would not be rushed into the broader strategy.

The president spoke before a meeting with his top national security team Thursday that he said would be limited to the discussion of continuing operations in Iraq.

Next week, he said, he will consult NATO allies on larger plans for Syria, Iraq and the Islamic State at an alliance summit in Wales, Obama said. Immediately afterward, he is sending Secretary of State John F. Kerry to the region to meet with Middle Eastern leaders.

Obama, Kerry and military leaders have spoken repeatedly in recent weeks of the need for a coalition, in the context of a partnership strategy the president outlined more than a year ago to combat terrorist threats beyond al-Qaeda, and potentially far more dangerous.

Once the strategy is determined, Obama said, “it’s going to be important for Congress to know what that is, in part because it may cost some money.”

He rejected criticism from some lawmakers for not seeking congressional approval for the limited Iraq operation. “As commander in chief, I have the authorities to engage in the acts that we are conducting currently,” Obama said.

Beyond that, he said, “there is no point in my asking for action on part of Congress before I know exactly what it is that is going to be required for us to get the job done.”

“It is my intention that Congress has to have some buy in as representatives of the American people,” Obama said. “And by the way, the American people need to hear what that strategy is.”

A majority of American public opinion has been resolutely opposed to U.S. military intervention in Syria. As midterm congressional elections approach in November, lawmakers will be watching to see whether that changes in the wake of Islamic State advances, threats to attack the United States and last week’s videotaped beheading of American journalist James Foley.

Unlike the partisan lines along which they have split on other issues, Congress has been divided on Syria, with many Democrats opposed to any return to war in the Middle East. Some Republicans have shared that concern, while others have pressed for more military action."

Obama’s comments, at a news conference in the Estonian capital, appeared to sharpen the U.S. commitment to confront the hard-line Islamist group controlling parts of northern Iraq and Syria.

But Obama gave no clear details on how the United States planned to escalate its pressure on the group beyond the current wave of limited airstrikes and efforts to forge a stronger international coalition against the militants. Obama warned that it could be an extended challenge drifting into the next year.

“We will not be intimidated,” Obama said shortly after U.S. intelligence experts said the videotaped beheading of Steven J. Sotloff appeared to be authentic — the second such killing of an American journalist at the hands of the Islamic State.

“Their horrific acts only unite us as a country and stiffen our resolve to take the fight against these terrorists,” he said. “And those who make the mistake of harming Americans will learn that we will not forget and that our reach is long and that justice will be served.”

The denunciations from Obama and other U.S. officials came as details emerged about Sotloff’s Israeli connections. It was unclear, however, whether such information was known previously by his captors.

In Jerusalem, a tweet by Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Paul Hirschson said Sotloff also had Israeli citizenship but gave no other details about his connections to the country. Sotloff “was Israeli citizen RIP,” Hirschson wrote on his personal Twitter account.

There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials, but Israeli news media — regulated by censors — reported that Sotloff immigrated to Israel in 2005 . He studied at a foreign relations institute and contributed reports, including stories from the Arab world, to outlets such as the Jerusalem Post.

Obama’s tougher tone stood in contrast to last week when he struggled to define U.S. strategy against the Islamic State.

The president said the U.S. objective was to destroy the group that killed Sotloff and fellow U.S. journalist James Foley “so it is no longer a threat not just to Iraq, but to the region and the United States.”

He acknowledged that dismantling the group could be a prolonged effort because of the Islamic State’s ability to funnel supplies and fighters over the Syrian border and because its fighters are “battle hardened” by the long insurgency in Iraq.

“This is not going to be a one-week or one-month or six-month proposition,” Obama said.

The Islamic State holds strategic hubs — including Mosul, the largest city in northern Iraq — and appears to have a formidable arsenal after overrunning Iraqi military bases­ and other sites.

But Obama suggested that the Islamic State’s “sphere of influence” could be eroded with greater international cooperation to dry up its financing and military pipelines. He gave no further details, yet such a move would probably require greater clampdowns from Western allies in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere to monitor the flow of funds and recruits to Islamic State-held territory.

At the news conference, Obama spoke directly about Sotloff and his family, saying the journalist was “taken from us in a horrific act of violence.”

“We cannot even begin to imagine the agony that everyone who loves Steven is feeling right now, especially his mother, his father and his younger sister. So today our country grieves with them,” Obama said. He offered similar condolences after the beheading of Foley late last month.

Oren Kessler, a Middle East research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society think tank in London and a former correspondent for the Jerusalem Post, said he and Sotloff would often discuss the challenges of being a Jewish journalist covering the Arab world.

“I would ask Steven how he felt about being a Jew, and one with connections to Israel, traveling in such dangerous places in the Arab and Muslim worlds,’’ Kessler said.

Sotloff’s response was that he was aware of the perils but believed he could reduce them to a “minor, manageable risk,’’ Kessler said.

“I don’t think Sotloff was naive. I think he was a passionate journalist who decided to brave the risks involved for the sake of his profession,” Kessler said.

Michael Sapir met Sotloff when they played on a rugby team in Ra’anana, in central Israel.

“He had no real journalistic background,” Sapir said. “He told me he was interested in what was happening from a world perspective. He started to write about it, and then his work started to take on a more professional journalistic tone.”

The growing crisis with the Islamic State took center stage in Estonia despite the other critical message Obama carried to the small Baltic states: reassurance to the former Soviet republics that the United States and NATO stand ready to defend them against possible Russian aggression. The meeting came ahead of a NATO summit in Wales that is expected to be dominated by the showdowns in Ukraine between pro-Moscow rebels and the Western-leaning government in Kiev.

Obama arrived in this city on the Baltic Sea as Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko announced an agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin on a cease-fire ""process"" in eastern Ukraine, a surprise decision that came as Russian-backed rebels have made rapid strides to retake territory in the past week.

Putin later said that he and Poroshenko had agreed to the framework of a plan to end the conflict. Putin outlined a seven-point proposal that appeared to entrench the rebels' territorial gains by requiring a large-scale Ukrainian military pullback and the presence of international observers to enforce a cease-fire."

http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/apple-iwatch-privacy-concerns-110763.html?hp=t1_3",0,"Apple released its much-anticipated smartwatch Tuesday, the first new device for the company since its founder Steve Jobs died in 2011. Called Apple Watch, the device, besides telling time, will have broad applications, the company pledged. It will be able to unlock doors to hotel rooms at Starwood hotels next year. Users can check into airlines, get directions as well as accomplish some basic tasks that are familiar to smartphone users, such as send out tweets, reply to messages and answer and make phone calls. The price starts at $349; the watch will be available early next year.

The new watch which sports a flexible screen, a ""digital dial"" that allows users to access apps and a band that can be swapped out. The device, which has to link up to an iPhone to fully work, comes in two different sizes and several different finishes.

Apple also took aim at the increasingly vulnerable credit card system, integrating a mobile payment system called ApplePay into its new iPhones. The effort, which has been tried unsuccessfully by several tech companies in the past, allows a consumer to store their credit card information in their phones and swipe the phone at new payment machines that are expected to be installed in stores across the country.

The company promised a safe and secure system. It said Apple won't monitor anyone's shopping history. And, if the phone is lost, a user can easily cancel all transactions remotely. American Express, Visa and Mastercard in conjunction with nearly a dozen of the nation's largest banks are participating in the effort. Apple also touted 220,000 stores will now accept the new form of payment, including McDonald's, Whole Foods, Disney theme parks and, of course, Apple's own retail stores.

As expected, the company unveiled two new versions of the iPhone Tuesday with bigger screens, as the company tries to catch up to competitors who have won over consumers increasingly using their phones to display videos and photos.

The new phones -- an iPhone 6 with a 4.7 inch screen and a super-sized iPhone 6 Plus with a 5.5 inch screen -- were unveiled at the start of the event by Apple chief executive Tim Cook at the Flint Center, a 2,400 seat auditorium where Jobs launched both the original Mac and the iMac. The new iPhone 6 starts at $199 with a two-year cellular contract, while the larger iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299. Both will be available on Sept. 19.

To get around the tricky design problem of how to use a bigger phone with just one hand, Apple is offering a feature that lets you slide your display down to the bottom of your screen so you can reach everything with your thumbs.

The new phones also have a new A8 chip, which Apple says is 13 percent smaller and has up to 25 percent better performance. Schiller says that it’s up to 84 times faster at processing graphics than the original iPhone. Battery life, an Apple executive said, is the same or better than previous versions of the smartphone.

For the event Apple added a new building — a roughly three-story, white boxy structure next to the Flint Center, which the company is likely to use as a showroom for its new products.

Revolutions, of course, were par for the course for the firm under its late co-founder and chief executive Jobs, who changed the industry forever with the iPhone, the iPad and the Mac. Three years after his death, Jobs still casts a long shadow over the company. Analysts often question whether Apple's culture of innovation can be sustained without Jobs at the helm, or whether the tech giant can deliver a life-changing product yet again. The lower-cost iPhone 5c unveiled exactly a year ago, for instance, underwhelmed consumers.

Still, under Cook, the firm has continued to be wildly profitable -- posting $7.7 billion in profit during its historically ""quiet"" June quarter alone. But Apple has seemed to be more in maintenance mode than on the cutting edge.

In the past year, however, even traditionally tight-lipped Apple executives have talked up their plans for new products. Cook has said repeatedly that Apple has some great products coming down the pike. Eddy Cue, the firm's vice president of iTunes and cloud services, went even further, saying publicly that the company has the best product pipeline he's ""seen in my 25 years at Apple.""

Sifting through Apple's latest moves, the firm seems to be expanding the phone beyond just a communications device into a sort of universal remote for users' lives. Its new operating system, iOS8, is due out this fall and is designed to pull information from a variety of health and fitness applications, as well as from Internet-connected appliances such as Nest's successful smart thermostat. With the new software, for example, users will be able to direct Apple's voice-controlled software Siri to ""lower the temperature"" or ask, ""Is my door locked?""

Collecting all of that data means Apple will have to provide security assurances for its cloud services, which recently got a black eye when hackers stole several sensitive pictures of celebrities from iCloud accounts last week. In response to the attacks, Apple has vowed to offer users more options to protect their own data."

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/09/16/ebola-crisis-us-sending-3000-military-personnel-west-africa/",2,"President Obama will announce Tuesday that the U.S. military will take the lead in overseeing what has been a chaotic and widely criticized response to the worst Ebola outbreak in history, dispatching up to 3,000 military personnel to West Africa in an effort that could cost up to $750 million over the next six months, according to senior administration officials.

By the end of the week, a general sent by U.S. Africa Command will be in place in Monrovia, Liberia — the country where transmission rates are increasing exponentially — to lead the effort called Operation United Assistance. The general will head a regional command based in Liberia that will help oversee and coordinate U.S. and international relief efforts while a new, separate regional staging base will help accelerate transportation of urgently needed equipment, supplies and personnel.

In addition, the Pentagon will send engineers to set up 17 treatment centers in Liberia — each with a 100-bed capacity — as well as medical personnel to train up to 500 health-care workers a week in the region.

The president’s decision to enlist the U.S. military, whose resources are already under strain as it responds to conflicts in the Middle East, reflects the growing concern of U.S. officials that, unless greater force is brought to bear, the epidemic could wreak havoc on the continent.

“It’s this broad range of capabilities together that will turn the tide of this epidemic,” said one senior administration official, who along with others spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss the president’s plan in advance of Obama’s trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Tuesday.

Global health experts and international aid groups who have been urging the White House to dramatically scale up its response praised the plan as described. They have said charities and West African governments alone do not have the capacity to stem the epidemic.

The U.S. military, with its enormous logistical capability, extensive air operations, and highly skilled medical corps, could address gaps in the response quickly.

“This is a really significant response on the military side,” said Laurie Garrett, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of a book about the first Ebola outbreak in 1976 and another on the global public-health system. “This is really beginning to seem like a game-changer.”

But much depends on how quickly personnel and supplies can get there.

“The problem is, for every single thing we’re doing, we’re racing against the virus, and the virus has the high ground right now,” she said. “I would hope this would reduce transmission, but it’s all about how fast people can get there and get the job done. If it takes weeks to mobilize, the strategy won’t even be within reach.”

Although the official death toll is at least 2,400 people in five African countries, officials say it vastly underestimates the true caseload. Garrett, who has been talking to health-care workers in the region, said the cumulative total, including deaths, could reach 250,000 by Christmas.

A senior official cautioned that the efforts “won’t happen overnight.” It will be several weeks before training of health-care workers can be up and running.

At a briefing Monday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama is visiting the CDC to get an update from the experts there “about the success of their efforts so far to try to confront this problem. . . . And that is the strategy that we’re implementing here, is to try to invest early to prevent this from becoming much more serious.”

Washington has come under fire from African officials — especially in the hardest-hit countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea — and on Capitol Hill for not marshaling more of its resources to combat the epidemic.

The United States has already spent $175 million responding to the outbreak and has dispatched 100 CDC experts, among the largest deployments of agency personnel in its history. The administration has sought an additional $88 million and may ask for more, according to a senior administration official. “I don’t want to close the door to potential additional funding,” the official said. Separately, the Pentagon wants to take up to $500 million from existing funds within the Pentagon’s budget that have not yet been spent and use it for the plan to fight Ebola.

The Pentagon announced last week that it would send a 25-bed hospital to Liberia. The hospital is designed to care for health-care workers who become ill, and eventually will be turned over to the Liberian government. It will be at least a month before the hospital is up and running. The United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps is preparing to deploy 65 Commissioned Corps officers to Liberia to manage and staff the hospital.

The United States has already set up one mobile laboratory, and another two are on the way.

In addition to expanding treatment and training facilities, the United States will send enough basic Ebola response kits to supply 400,000 households in Liberia, according to a senior administration official. That is intended to address an increasingly common phenomenon in which sick patients are being denied access to overflowing treatment centers and being sent home.

The packages, which include sanitizers, will help curb transmission of the disease among family members and expand access to ambulances and treatment centers so those infected can be isolated. As part of this effort, the U.S. Agency for International Development this week will airlift 50,000 home health-care kits from Denmark to Liberia to be hand-delivered to distant communities by trained youth volunteers.

The administration’s decision to involve the military in providing equipment and other assistance for international health workers in Africa comes after mounting calls from some unlikely groups — most prominently the international medical organization Doctors Without Borders — pressed the urgency of the issue.

While the world’s largest international health organizations, several governments and many nonprofits have already devoted significant resources to addressing the virus outbreak, administration officials said Monday that they had concluded that the United States would have to lead more aggressively in order to check Ebola’s spread. In Liberia’s capital, patients are dying on the street because there aren’t enough beds in treatment centers.

“Our concern is if we do not arrest that growth, and we don’t arrest that growth now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of cases” in Africa, the official said, noting that it will still take “months” to reduce the numbers of illnesses and deaths from the disease.

The U.S. response drew cautious praise from Doctors Without Borders, which has been the most active group in the region, battling the epidemic for months.

“Although we have not yet seen the official details, we welcome the ambition of the new US Ebola response plan, which appears to match the scope of the disaster unfolding in West Africa,” Brice de le Vigne, the group’s director of operations, said in a statement. “This latest pledge, alongside those from a handful of other countries, needs to be put into action immediately.”

He said that the response to Ebola continues to fall “dangerously behind” and that too many lives are being lost.

“If implemented swiftly, the deployment of new Ebola management centers, qualified staff and health personnel training could begin reversing the trend of the fight we have collectively been losing against Ebola,” he said.

Even as officials emphasized the need for bolder action and said they were bolstering defenses within the United States, they said the chance of an Ebola outbreak here was “a very low probability.”

Public health experts in America “know how to contain this virus,” one official said. “If there is a case that appears in the United States, that person would be isolated [and] the appropriate protocols would be put in place such that it would contain that.”

To some extent, the measures that the president is now adopting have been called for by some of his critics. On Friday, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) called on Obama to appoint a “central coordinator” to oversee the federal government’s response to the disease.

Sen. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), the top Republican on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said in a statement Monday, “This is an instance where we should be running toward the burning flames with our fireproof suits on.”

High-level planning by top officials from the CDC, the Pentagon, the State Department, USAID and the National Institutes of Health has been taking place for some time about options for a U.S. response, according to a senior administration official who spoke on background because planning was underway. The most recent high-level meeting was convened by Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, at the Pentagon last Wednesday.

Speaking on NBC’s “Meet The Press” on Sept. 7, Obama said that if the United States and other countries did not send equipment, health workers and other supplies to the region, the virus could mutate to become more transmissible."

The military side of the widening campaign against the Islamic State is being coordinated by the U.S. Central Command, or Centcom. U.S. officials would not identify which nations made offers of active battlefield participation, or “kinetic action,” in military parlance.

Meanwhile, British Prime Minister David Cameron on Sunday condemned the ""despicable"" killing of British aid worker David Haines by Islamic State extremists and vowed to do everything possible to hunt down his killers and bring them to justice.

“Step by step we will drive back, dismantle and ultimately destroy ISIL and what it stands for. We will do so in a calm, deliberate way but with an iron determination,” Cameron said in a televised statement.

Cameron, who led an emergency government meeting Sunday to discuss the killing, said the country was “sickened” that a Briton could have done this to a fellow Briton.

Islamic State militants on Saturday released a video showing Haines being executed in the same grisly manner as two American journalists in recent weeks, along with a threat to kill another British hostage, Alan Henning.

The video, titled “A Message to Allies of America,” shows Haines, a 44-year-old Scot, clad in an orange jumpsuit and kneeling beside a man who speaks in the same London-accented English as the apparent executioner in videos of two previous killings.

In his address Sunday, Cameron stressed Britain’s support for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq but did not indicate whether the country would join the United States in direct military intervention. Britain has offered humanitarian aid and arms to Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State in northern Iraq.

Although Cameron has come under domestic pressure to join the U.S. military operation in Iraq, it seems unlikely that any decision will be made soon, with the British leader focused on Scotland, which Thursday will vote on whether to break away from the United Kingdom.

Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank, said that Britain will probably join the U.S. effort in some fashion but that any serious signals of that intent at this time would “provide wind in the sails of the nationalists.”

“It brings back painful memories of the Blair period,” he said, referring to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which was deeply unpopular in Scotland. “It would be very easy for nationalists in Scotland to claim that ‘See, this is what happens if you remain part of the U.K.’ ”

Defending strategy

On Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough reiterated the administration's case on airstrikes against the Islamic State as Congress considers a vote on funding forces in the region to help in the fight. In making his case, McDonough was forced to defend the perception that the Obama administration's proposed response was belated or unclear.

“We’ve been from the start very clear this is serious business,” McDonough said on “Fox News Sunday.”

“I think we’ve been pretty clear and we’ll continue to be clear about exactly what we’re going to do and how we’re going to do it.”

On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” McDonough said that the president “was preparing the country” for the effort against the Islamic State and that the administration has underscored that “in as much as we’ve been at war with al-Qaeda since we got here, we’re at war with ISIL.”

McDonough repeated the strategy Obama unveiled last week for winning that war: a coalition that continues airstrikes against the forces of the Islamic State, using the “unique capabilities” of the United States: “air power, intelligence surveillance, reconnaissance and our training ability” to strengthen the opposition to the organization.

Asked by moderator Candy Crowley on CNN’s “State of the Union” whether any of those coalition partners would add ground forces to the conflict, McDonough declined to “front-run” any announcements. But he made it clear that the short-term strategy is to fund the Iraqi army to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and the Syrian opposition to fight in Syria — with the hope that Congress approves.

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), appearing on “Fox News Sunday” after McDonough, lambasted Obama’s pledge not to commit U.S. ground forces to the fight. “ISIL has to be encouraged by what was just said,” Graham said. “When the White House tells the world, ‘We say what we mean and we do what we say,’ nobody believes that anymore.”

Calling the fight against the Islamic State a “turning point in the war on terror,” Graham said that “it’s going to take an army to beat an army. And this idea we’ll never have any boots on the ground to defeat them in Syria is fantasy.”

Arab air power

Thus far, the military effort has involved offers to use Arab military bases and other resources, but the entry of Arab warplanes, especially if contributed by Persian Gulf countries, would be significant. Shiite-led Iraq has feuded with the major Sunni states, especially Saudi Arabia, for nearly a decade.

“The Iraqis would have to be a major participant in that decision,” and that discussion is ongoing, the senior State Department official said. “And secondly, the air campaign would have to be very well organized.”

Iraq was a signatory to a pledge of joint cooperation against the militants issued in Saudi Arabia last week.

“It’s a very complicated situation, militarily,” a second senior State Department official said. “We have a lot of flights in the air at any given moment, and we wanted to be an overall coordinator of this effort.”

There is precedent for Arab participation in international air campaigns.

The United Arab Emirates flew air missions during the 2011 NATO-led assault in Libya, providing some military value but far greater diplomatic cover for the United States and European nations uneasy about being seen as launching a Western war in the Middle East.

Saudi planes flew as part of the U.S.-led coalition that pushed Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi forces back from Kuwait in 1991.

The U.S. officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the evolving diplomatic and military strategy. Secretary of State John F. Kerry is in Paris to attend an international conference Monday on countering the Islamic State threat.

In an interview that aired Sunday, Kerry discussed the possibility of expanded U.S. airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Syria, saying that the United States could “de-conflict” such attacks with the Syrian government but that there would be no formal cooperation or coordination.

President Obama has authorized such strikes but has not yet ordered them to be carried out.

“No, we’re not going to coordinate it with Syria,” Kerry said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “We will certainly want to de-conflict to make certain that they’re not about to do something that they might regret even more seriously, but we’re not going to coordinate.

“It’s not a cooperative effort. We are going to do what they haven’t done, what they had plenty of opportunity to do, which is to take on ISIL and to degrade it and eliminate it as a threat.”

“We will do that with allies,” he added.

Kerry gave the interview Saturday in Egypt, which he visited as part of a week-long tour of Mideast and European nations involved in the emerging coalition against the militants.

“I’ve been extremely encouraged to hear from all of the people that I’ve been meeting with about their readiness and willingness to participate,” he said.

“People should not think about this effort just in terms of strikes,” he added. “In fact, as some have pointed out, that alone is not going to resolve this challenge.”

Addressing Kerry’s comments, a third State Department official stressed that should the current air campaign expand to Syria, as is expected soon, the United States would make its own decisions and would not discuss them with the Syrian government. The United States has called for the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and expanded support for Syrian rebels seeking to defeat Assad is an element of the new campaign.

Kerry's remark about de-

conflicting airstrikes was not meant to signal any change in that policy, the official said.

“There’s ways to communicate, including publicly, what our plans are, in terms of if we’re going to take that additional step, and I think that’s what he was referring to,” the official said. “He wasn’t implying that we’re changing our policy as it relates to coordinating or working with or talking to the regime.”"

In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sketched out scenarios in which U.S. Special Forces might need to embed with Iraqi or Kurdish troops engaged in direct combat with Islamic State fighters.

Under questioning from lawmakers, Dempsey acknowledged that Obama has vowed not to send U.S. ground combat forces back into Iraq, less than three years after the president fulfilled a campaign promise to extricate the military from a long, costly and unpopular war there.

But the general revealed that U.S. commanders have already sought permission, on at least one occasion, to deploy small teams of U.S. advisers into battle with Iraqi troops. Dempsey also suggested that while Obama has held firm, he might be persuaded to change his mind.

“He has told me, as well, to come back to him on a case-by-case basis,” Dempsey said. “If we reach the point where I believe our advisers should accompany Iraqi troops on attacks against specific [Islamic State] targets, I’ll recommend that to the president.”

The uncertainty of exactly what role U.S. troops might play in Iraq and Syria comes as Congress prepares to vote on Obama's request for approval to train and equip about 5,000 moderate Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State.

The House resolution, expected to come to a vote Wednesday, explicitly says it does not support U.S. forces on the ground. The resolution is likely to be approved with bipartisan support and be included in a broader government funding bill that will make it to the president’s desk by the end of the week, lawmakers said.

The question of ground forces, however, will probably become a central focus of a legislative debate about war powers that is expected to begin after the Nov. 4 elections.

Since June, Obama has ordered the deployment of 1,600 U.S. troops to Iraq in an effort to bolster the country’s faltering army and stop the Islamic State’s advance.

Even as the mission has gradually expanded and the U.S. military has launched 167 airstrikes against the Islamic State, Obama and other White House officials have consistently promised that U.S. troops will not engage in ground combat.

As recently as last week, Obama said in a televised address to the nation that ""American forces will not have a combat mission — we will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq.""

Dempsey told lawmakers that U.S. military advisers are helping Iraqi government forces prepare for a major offensive to reclaim territory seized by the Islamic State in recent months. Those advisers are embedded with Iraqi and Kurdish forces at the brigade or headquarters level — away from the front lines.

Despite Obama's firm position, some U.S. military commanders have pressed for more leeway to send small numbers of troops into combat with Iraqi forces.

Dempsey testified that Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, the commander of U.S. troops in the Middle East, wanted to embed U.S. troops with Iraqi and Kurdish security forces last month during a battle to retake control of the Mosul Dam from the Islamic State.

According to Dempsey, Austin wanted the U.S. troops to help call in airstrikes. The Joint Chiefs chairman suggested that Austin was overruled, saying the commander changed his mind after further discussions and “found a way” to organize the operation without U.S. personnel present.

At the same time, Dempsey said he and Austin agreed that more situations will arise when military commanders will want to put U.S. Special Forces or airstrike spotters on the ground. “There will be circumstances when we think that will be necessary, but we haven’t encountered one yet,” Dempsey said.

By openly suggesting that U.S. ground combat forces will be needed, Dempsey was walking a fine line between questioning the judgment of Obama, the commander in chief, and sharing his own professional military opinion with lawmakers and the public.

Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), the committee chairman, asked Dempsey whether he supported Obama’s strategy.

Dempsey said he did. But he added that if the current approach were to falter, he might recommend a different one, possibly including “the use of U.S. military ground forces.”

Later, he also said he might recommend that U.S. troops provide “close combat advising” to Iraqi forces if they were to attempt a complex mission, such as retaking the northern city of Mosul from the Islamic State.

Obama is scheduled to meet with Austin and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Wednesday at the U.S. Central Command headquarters in Tampa. Earlier this month, Obama ordered an expansion of airstrikes, adding that it was time to ""start going on some offense"" against the Islamic State.

After Dempsey finished his testimony, the White House reiterated that Obama remained opposed to sending U.S. ground troops into combat in Iraq or Syria.

Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters that Dempsey’s remarks referred to “a hypothetical scenario” and that it was the military’s responsibility to plan for a wide range of contingencies.

The debate about whether to send U.S. troops back into combat in Iraq — and possibly into Syria — is sensitive politically but in some ways a matter of semantics.

Air Force and Navy pilots already are firing missiles and dropping bombs on Islamic State fighters in Iraq. And although the 1,600 U.S. troops on the ground in Iraq have not engaged in firefights with the Islamic State, they are armed and authorized to defend themselves.

But the issue also cuts to the heart of Obama’s military strategy for fighting the Islamic State — and whether U.S. forces should take a leading and visible role on the ground or leave the fighting to Iraqi and Kurdish troops, as well as proxy forces in Syria.

Dempsey said the Obama administration’s plan to train and equip 5,000 Syrian rebels would take time — up to five months to establish the program and as long as a year to recruit, vet and train the fighters. Much of the training is expected to take place in Saudi Arabia.

Lawmakers questioned how the Pentagon would ensure that weapons provided to the Syrian rebels do not end up in the hands of the Islamic State or other jihadist fighters.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) pressed Dempsey and Hagel on whether the U.S. military would intervene in Syria to aid the rebels if they were pinned down by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The two Pentagon leaders replied that the primary purpose of training the rebels was to help them fight the Islamic State, not Assad.

Earlier in the hearing, Hagel told lawmakers that “we are at war” with the Islamic State and warned that “this will not be an easy or brief effort.”

Some lawmakers urged the Pentagon and White House to act more aggressively. Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) said it was “foolhardy” for Obama to rule out ground troops to advise Iraqi forces in combat and help call in U.S. airstrikes.

“His claim of ‘no boots on the ground’ is an insult to the men and women in Iraq today who are serving in harm’s way,” Inhofe said.

The United States had held off on further military assistance to Baghdad until a new broad-based government is formed, but Iraqi politicians are still wrangling over who should hold the key positions of minister of defense and interior.

Parliament rejected Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's candidates for the posts Tuesday.

Abadi had pledged to fill the defense and interior posts, and four other ministerial positions left open when the government was formed a week ago, by Tuesday. However, there has been fierce debate about who should steer the security posts amid the violence racking the country."

The vote placed Congress one step closer to authorizing the third significant U.S. military operation in Iraq in the past quarter century, and it put lawmakers on record approving U.S. engagement in the years-long Syrian civil war. It delivered Obama much-needed domestic political support as he seeks an international coalition to combat the growing threat of Islamist terrorism in the Middle East.

But the tally — 273 to 156 — also revealed widespread misgivings in both parties about the plan’s chances of success, even among lawmakers who voted in favor of it.

Obama’s proposal was opposed by more than 40 percent of Democrats, many of whom are concerned that new U.S. military operations in the Middle East could fester for several years with no clear strategy or definition of success.

Republicans provided the lion’s share of support, but many are worried that Obama’s plans are too limited. One top GOP leader suggested that Congress could give the president blanket military authority, even if Obama doesn’t want it, when lawmakers hold a much broader debate after the November elections about the fight against Islamist militants.

On Tuesday afternoon, President Obama told troops at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., that ""100 percent of Americans need to support"" them and their families. He told them he would not commit them to ""a ground war"" in Iraq. (Video: WhiteHouse.gov)

Obama on Wednesday repeated his promise not to send ground forces into the military campaign against the Islamic State, telling troops in a speech at Florida's MacDill Air Force Base that he will ""not commit you . . . to fighting another ground war in Iraq.""

In a statement after the House vote, Obama said, “There will be no U.S. military personnel in Syria as part of this program. We’ve learned over the last decade, and through our successful campaign to degrade al-Qaeda, that it is more effective to use America’s unique capabilities to take out terrorist targets in support of our partners’ efforts on the ground to secure their own future.”

The amendment authorizing Obama’s plans was part of a short-term spending bill keeping the federal government operating through mid-December. Supporters included 159 Republicans and 114 Democrats, while 85 Democrats and 71 Republicans voted against the amendment. The Senate is expected to give the bill final approval Thursday.

In more than six hours of debate spread over two days, few House lawmakers stepped forward to give a full-throated endorsement of the Obama plan. Every ideological corner of the House found reason to doubt the mission, portending a lengthy debate in November and December over an expansive use-of-force resolution. Some Democrats are eyeing tighter constraints on military engagement, and some Republicans are trying to expand the battlefield.

Several lawmakers who are military veterans or are still serving in the armed forces voted against the authorization. Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.), a Marine who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, said the authority “does nothing” to destroy the Islamic State. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), a captain in the Hawaii National Guard who served in Iraq, called Obama’s strategy “unrealistic” and worried “it will take way too long” to work.

But some of the earliest opponents of entering Iraq in 2003 found themselves voting yes while offering little assurance of military success. “It’s the best choice of worse options,” said Rep. James P. Moran (D-Va.), a retiring lawmaker who voted against authorizing the Iraq war 12 years ago. “It’s because there are no better alternatives and I don’t think it’s responsible to do nothing.”

Some of Obama’s closest congressional allies also expressed deep skepticism. “I have hesitations and concerns about the blank check we gave George Bush,” said Rep. Steve Israel (N.Y.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, who has worked closely with Obama to raise money for House candidates.

“The one thing I know is that ISIL is a fundamental threat and it needs to be addressed,” he said, using a common acronym for the Islamic State.

House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said most Republicans are ready to ""revisit the broader question"" of U.S. military action in the Middle East. In an interview this week, Scalise said the idea of drafting a new authorization for military action ""has come up a lot,"" including ""if more should be done, should it be authorized by Congress even if the president isn't asking for it?""

Rep. Kristi L. Noem (R-S.D.) said she would welcome a comprehensive debate. She voted for authorization Wednesday, but said in an interview beforehand that “I’m not convinced this is the silver bullet, I think this is going to be a longer, more drawn-out process.”

GOP leaders were helped Wednesday morning when the Club for Growth, an influential conservative group, decided not to include the vote on the government funding bill on its scorecard for GOP lawmakers. The group informed House lawmakers in a memo that while it remains opposed to the underlying spending plans, it doesn't take positions on legislation ""driven by foreign policy.""

The retreat by many conservative groups came a year after they cheered on a budget impasse that led to a partial government shutdown, reflecting the muddled nature of Wednesday’s debate.

After the Club for Growth’s announcement, House GOP leaders sought to bolster support by making calls to several lawmakers. So did House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her lieutenants, although their efforts were “soft touches,” or informal outreach, according to aides.

Senior White House staffers and Obama were credited for engaging House Republicans, especially Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), with direct calls between the principals seen as an expression of good faith, according to aides in both parties.

In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) was preparing to hold a vote on the spending measure Thursday. But he will not earn unified support from Democrats.

Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.) said Wednesday that he opposes granting Obama expanded authorities because he is not convinced new military operations will succeed.

“We have been at war in that part of that world for the past 13 years,” he said. “If money and military might could have made a difference, it would have by now.”

Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.), the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, co-authored the first bill to help train and arm rebels in Syria, but said Wednesday that he is unsure how the new legislation would work. The pro-Western rebels Corker originally envisioned training are still mostly focused on fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad rather than Islamic State forces.

“There’s a major disconnect,” Corker said, smacking his head for emphasis.

Still, Corker said he plans to support the limited operation in anticipation of a longer debate later this year. “They don’t have a plan, they don’t have a strategy,” Corker said of the White House, adding, “They’re doing it to eke by the midterm elections.”

In anticipation of a bigger debate, Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.), who plans to vote for the authorization, unveiled proposed language for a new use-of-force measure. His plan, which would expire after a year, would repeal the current congressional authorization for military force in Iraq and prohibit the deployment of U.S. combat forces in Iraq and Syria. Kaine said his proposal would also define the types of “associated forces” that the U.S. could partner with in the region, including Iraqi and Kurdish military forces.

“If they won’t participate and carry the ground campaign, there’s no amount of U.S. or Western troops that will enable this mission to be successful,” he said."

CNN —

The United States and its allies are steeling themselves for what an American defense official described Thursday as a yearslong fight against the so-called Islamic State, a revelation that came as airstrikes pummeled oil refineries in Syria used by the terror group to help fund its operations

“I think we are in this for a matter of years,” Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told CNN on Thursday. “… We are steeling ourselves for that period of time.”

U.S.-led airstrikes hit locations overnight in a remote area of eastern Syria where ISIS has been using mobile refineries to produce oil that brings in up to $2 million a day for the group.

The U.S. military was still assessing the damage to the refineries by the airstrikes, Kirby said. The attacks are focused on the “infrastructure around the refineries,” meaning the ability of ISIS to produce oil, he said.

Even so, there are questions about just how much impact the destruction of the refineries will have on ISIS, which analysts have said has access to billions of dollars.

“Even if we stop their oil flow today, they still have about a billion dollars in the bank,” retired U.S. Army Col. Peter Mansoor said.

“They seized about a third of a billion dollars from the central bank of Mosul (Iraq).” On top of that, he added, ISIS has garnered millions of dollars in ransoms from European governments for hostages and have traded much of their oil.

For now, the United States is focused on the refineries, according to Kirby. But he acknowledged there are “other economic levers the international community is going to have to pull” to cut off all funding to ISIS.

At least 14 militants and five civilians were killed in the overnight airstrikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a dissident monitoring group.

ISIS targets in Iraq were also hit Thursday morning by France’s military, government spokesman Stephane Le Foll told reporters in Paris. Fighter jets carried out strikes on four ISIS warehouses near Fallujah, which were believed to house military equipment.

Human rights lawyer executed

The news came as reports surfaced that ISIS fighters carried out a public execution of a well-known human rights lawyer, who took to Facebook to criticize the group’s destruction of mosques, churches and shrines in Iraq.

Calling the torture and killing of Sameera Al-Nuiamy savage and cowardly, U.N. special representative for Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, said the Iraqi government and the international community must do all they can to ensure those responsible for her death are brought to justice.

Al-Nuiamy was reportedly abducted from her home in Mosul on September 17 and put on trial before a Sharia court, which Mladenov says found her guilty of apostasy.

“She was then held for a further five days during which she was subjected to torture in an attempt to force her to repent before she was executed in public,” he said.

Since August, ISIS has beheaded American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and British aid worker David Haines, gruesomely showing their killings in videos posted online.

On Thursday, FBI Director James Comey said that the United States believes it has identified the ISIS militant in the video showing Foley’s killing. Officials believe the same masked militant speaks in all three beheading videos. Comey did not identify the man.

ISIS overruns Iraqi base

The reports about the execution came as new details emerged about the killing of up to 300 Iraqi soldiers in Iraq’s western Anbar province after ISIS fighters overran the base near Falluja this week.

A handful of survivors who escaped from Saqlawiyah, which had been under siege for a week, accused the Iraqi government of failing to respond to pleas for help in the days leading up to Monday’s final ISIS assault on the base.

One soldier recounted in a video posted to YouTube how he and his comrades battled the fighters for hours before starting to run out of ammunition and then being shot by a sniper.

“I called the commander … for support, but no one responded,” he said.

While CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the claims in the video, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has ordered an investigation into what happened and why the soldiers were left to fend for themselves.

At least 113 soldiers were killed and another 78 are missing, according to Iraqi security officials.

The report has raised questions about whether the Iraqi military can defeat ISIS on the ground even with help from the United States and its allies in the air.

There are similar questions being asked about Syria’s moderate rebel groups, which have been battling President Bashar al-Assad’s forces and ISIS.

ISIS leadership dispersed?

ISIS has likely dispersed much of its command-and-control capabilities in Syria, and leaders are now “mixed in with the civilian population,” Mansoor said.

“So it’s unlikely these airstrikes have crippled ISIS,” he said. “As the President has said, it’s going to be a long campaign, and it will be months – perhaps years – before ISIS is dealt a serious blow absent any sort of ground force to go in and root them out on the ground.”

In the latest round of strikes targeting ISIS refineries in Syria, fighter jets from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates flew alongside U.S. aircraft, hitting 12 locations, Kirby said.

While ISIS has been the focus of most of the strikes in Syria, other terror targets have been hit.

The U.S. military said the al Qaeda-linked Khorasan Group also was targeted when the strikes in Syria began Tuesday morning.

And the terror group al-Nusra Front says its leader, Abu Yousef al-Turki – also known as “The Turk” – was killed. But the United States has not said whether al-Turki is dead.

“We cannot confirm any particular leadership that might have been killed in any of these strikes,” Kirby said Wednesday.

And as far as how many ISIS militants have been killed, “we don’t know that, either,” Kirby said.

What’s the difference between ISIS, al-Nusra Front and the Khorasan Group?

International support

While the support for the U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria has been tepid, the support for the the international coalition against ISIS in Iraq is growing.

The Dutch foreign ministry announced Wednesday that its military will contribute six F-16 fighter jets and 250 troops to carry out airstrikes and train Iraqi and Kurdish forces. Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said his country’s parliament will weigh a request for six of its fighter jets to take part in the bombing campaign.

Similarly, British Prime Minister David Cameron said he’s recalling Parliament Friday “to secure approval for the United Kingdom to participate in the Iraq air campaign.

“The U.N. Security Council has now received a clear request from the Iraqi government to support it in its military action against ISIL,” Cameron said from U.N. headquarters in New York. “… So it is right that Britain should move to a new phase of action.”"

http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/19/opinion/scotland-no-vote-world-implications/index.html?hpt=op_t1",0,"Liz Quinn's longtime dream of a fully independent Scotland was shattered early Friday after Scots voted overwhelmingly to stay within the United Kingdom. “I am deeply disappointed, but you know, we’re still standing,” said Quinn, 75, a retired school principal who has spent decades campaigning for independence. “We will not get another bite at that cherry, not in my lifetime.”

For his part, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond did not wake up on Friday morning as a prime-minister-in-waiting; instead, in a subdued speech in Edinburgh, he conceded defeat and called on all Scots to respect the results.

He then tweeted: “Let’s not dwell on the distance we’ve fallen short — let us dwell on the distance we have traveled.” Hours later, Salmond announced his resignation.

To come within touching distance of victory was deeply agonizing for nationalists who devoted their lives to a cause that was crushed overnight.

Scotland voted 55 percent to 45 percent in a referendum Thursday to remain part of the United Kingdom. The results were announced early Friday. Polls had shown the vote much closer in the last few weeks.

Glasgow is Scotland’s biggest city, and it voted “yes” to independence. The city center was pulsing with rock music and blasting car horns throughout the night — until shortly before it became clear that the “no” camp would win.

For Quinn, her campaigning journey began three decades ago. She was not particularly political at the time but was involved in the women’s movement in Scotland and “learned about the importance of self-determination,” she said. “And then the idea struck me: If you’re looking for that on a personal level, why not look for it in your country, too?” And so she joined the Scottish Nationalist Party.

Quinn’s first SNP conference was the one in which Salmond was kicked out. It was the early 1980s, and Salmond was part of the 79 Group, a faction within the SNP that was banned for its left-leaning ideas. But the party recognized his talent and brought him back into the fold, where he quickly climbed the ranks.

The SNP was launched in 1934, but it was not until the 1970s when it began to look like a serious player, prying votes away from the left-leaning Labor Party and winning seats in general elections. When giant oil fields were discovered off the coast of Scotland, the party’s appeal was bolstered. Its rallying call became “It’s Scotland’s oil,” and the party argued that the riches from North Sea oil could help fund a more just and prosperous society.

When Salmond became leader of the SNP in 1990, he boosted confidence that Scotland could afford to go it alone. A trained economist, Salmond could talk the language of business and made the idea seem less of a romantic gamble. The party flourished under his helm.

""He has been central to the whole project of independence, strategically, presentationally, and in terms of making it credible,"" said David Torrance, author of several books on Scottish politics. ""He's not an ideologue; his guiding philosophy is: 'Whatever works.' ""

Scottish independence began to feel like a real prospect in 2007 when Salmond’s SNP won enough seats to form a minority government in the devolved Scottish Parliament. In 2011, the SNP defied expectations by winning a majority of seats, and Salmond soon launched a bid for independence.

“That’s when we all cheered; that’s when it began to look real,” Quinn said. Before 2007, she said, the idea of an independent Scotland “had great appeal for me, and I wanted to put my energy there, but it looked like a lost cause.”

An elegant woman with an infectious smile, Quinn spent much of this past year pounding the gritty streets of Glasgow, targeting any house or apartment that had no steps (the years have not been kind to her knees). She saw a nationalist surge etched on the faces of ordinary Glaswegians long before the shocking poll two weeks ago that put the “yes” camp in the lead for the first time.

Quinn said she thinks Salmond is a “tremendous politician and a real statesman,” but she also stressed that over the course of this campaign, the driving force for independence has come not from party politicians, but from young, informed Scots who now have an appetite for separation.

Because Salmond has said there will not be another referendum for a generation, the fight for independence may indeed quiet down.

But Quinn still thinks her dream has been postponed, rather than completely lost."
2046,2046,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/09/26/obama-tells-global-health-officials-after-ebola-we-have-to-do-better/,0,"President Obama addressed health officials from dozens of countries who had gathered Friday at the White House to determine ways the international community can strengthen defenses against future epidemics, such as the Ebola outbreak now raging in West Africa. Administration officials had launched a global health security initiative in February to help other nations develop basic disease detection and monitoring systems to contain the spread of deadly illnesses. The push to develop a long-term strategy gained added impetus in the wake of the Ebola epidemic.

""Now, the good news is today, our nations have begun to answer the call,"" Obama told the group. ""With all the knowledge, all the medical talent, all the advanced technologies at our disposal, it is unacceptable if, because of lack of preparedness and planning and global coordination, people are dying when they don't have to. So we have to do better -- especially when we know that outbreaks are going to keep happening.""

The president also issued a challenge to all entrepreneurs and manufacturers to design better health protective gear that can be sent to contain the spread of the virus in West Africa.

""If you design them, we will make them. We will pay for them,"" he said. ""And our goal is to get them to the field in a matter of months to help the people working in West Africa right now. I’m confident we can do this.""

Before Obama addressed the gathering, top medical officials spoke in unusually frank terms about the missteps that have been made in responding to the spread of the virus in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

""We know that if global health security had been implemented in West Africa… the world would be a completely different place today,"" said Tom Frieden, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, adding that Ebola represented a critical test. ""We, the world, failed that test.""

Obama said the outbreak underscored the urgency of the global community's task. ""This epidemic underscores -- vividly and tragically -- what we already knew, which is, in a world as interconnected as ours, outbreaks anywhere, even in the most remote villages and the remote corners of the world, have the potential to impact everybody, every nation.""

Kenya's health minister, James Macharia, whose country is working with Denmark to establish a new agency focused on bioterrorism and biosecurity, said conflicts both inside and outside his nation pose a challenge.

""We are surrounded by countries with internal problems, internal strife,"" he said. ""We have to be extremely vigilant when dealing with these matters.""

Secretary of State John F. Kerry, said the United States and other nations need to ""help countries in West Africa beat back the epidemic – which we can do if we respond properly – but we also need to look ahead and think about what this means, what this underscores, and think about the long-term imperatives.""

""This epidemic’s severity is just one symptom of uneven global development – inequity in health delivery systems, extreme poverty and crumbling public health systems,"" Kerry said. ""So in the short term, yes, we need emergency containment. But in the long term, we need to help the hardest-hit countries build the kind of health systems and infrastructure that will allow them to prevent, detect and rapidly respond to the next infectious disease, to any other outbreak, to stop those outbreaks in the first place before they become epidemics.""

National security adviser Susan Rice noted at the opening that when the World Health Organization gave its members a June 2012 deadline to adopt its universally-recognized international health regulations, 80 percent of countries either failed to implement them or did not report back on their progress.

""That’s dangerous, and that’s what we’re here to help change,"" she said. ""So, we need leaders around the world—not only health ministers and veterinary experts, but also presidents and prime ministers and national security leaders—to work together to address this threat with the seriousness and urgency it deserves.""

While much of the discussion was sober, one speaker struck a note of optimism: Melvin Korkor, a Liberian doctor who contracted Ebola from a nurse he was working with. Korkor -- who was only given a 1-in-10 chance of survival -- quarantined himself, forced himself to eat and took solace in prayer. ""I said to myself I was going to make it,"" Korkor has said of his experience.

Obama told Korkor that his story reminds the world that ""even now, in the face of unimaginable suffering, there’s still hope."""

Then he boarded the helicopter on his way to New York for a global summit.

Rhetorical shock and awe, this was not.

Before departing, Obama dryly read off a list of actions taken to expand the campaign against radical Sunni militants to include Syria in addition to Iraq. U.S. warplanes had struck, for the first time, Islamic State targets in that country. His administration had done so in partnership with five Arab nations. And the Pentagon had, for good measure, attacked a separate al-Qaeda affiliate to disrupt an alleged terrorist plot against the West.

There was no mention of the word “war” and little of the rally-around-the-flag language one might expect from a commander-in-chief launching the broadest U.S. airstrikes since the Iraq war 11 years ago. Just a warning from Obama that success could come slowly.

“The overall effort will take time,” Obama said in his 531-word address. “There will be challenges ahead. But we’re going to do what’s necessary to take the fight to this terrorist group, for the security of the country and the region and for the entire world.”

The U.S., along with Arab allies, carried out a series of attacks Tuesday on the Islamic State in Syria. Video posted to social media purports to show the aftermath of those airstrikes. (Video: The Washington Post)

Even as he has led the country back into armed conflict in the Middle East, Obama has been careful to employ measured tones about the extent of American engagement and to manage expectations about the duration of the fight.

He has sought to be resolute but not reckless, forceful if not fearsome — none of the ""with us or against us"" declarations of predecessor George W. Bush.

The president and his aides have, over the years, described his foreign policy as “leading from behind,” being sure not to do “stupid stuff,” and hitting singles and doubles rather than swinging for the fences.

Now Obama has had to sell the American public, and a worldwide audience, on a broader war the Nobel Peace Prize recipient never imagined he would pursue. And he has seemed to do so reluctantly, emphasizing more clearly what the United States will not do — such as put combat troops on the ground — than what it will do.

The balancing act has yielded little political benefit so far. Polls show that a solid majority of Americans believe the Islamic State terrorist group represents a threat to vital U.S. interests and back airstrikes against the militants in both Iraq and Syria. Yet the president's approval ratings on his handling of foreign affairs hover near all-time lows, with respondents saying Obama has been too cautious about intervening.

After his remarks on the South Lawn, Obama, accompanied by first lady Michelle Obama, flew to New York for a three-day appearance at the U.N. General Assembly — another chance, aides said, for the president to demonstrate his approach to American leadership in an increasingly unsettled world.

With Russia’s Vladi­mir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping absent, Obama will seek to reaffirm the primacy of the United States on the world stage. In a series of speeches leading up to his appearance here, he said the United States would act to protect its interests and keep its people safe, but not without international support.

“When the world is threatened, when the world needs help, it calls on America,” Obama told 1,300 U.S. troops at MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa last week. “Even the countries that complain about America — when they need help, who do they call? They call us.”

The administration had been criticized ahead of the airstrikes in Syria for failing to bring together a broad coalition to participate in the military campaign. Until Monday night, only France had publicly signaled that it would fly its warplanes alongside the United States, and only in Iraq.

But the first reports emerged of the strikes late Monday included the news that five Arab countries had participated with their own air power: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Jordan. It was a coup for an administration that had worked patiently and secretly amid the criticism to build the alliances.

“It’s a very important moment for the president to put everything that we’re doing in the context of U.S. leadership in the world,” deputy national security adviser Benjamin Rhodes told reporters aboard Air Force One. “We are leading a coalition of countries against [the Islamic State]. We are leading an effort to combat the outbreak of Ebola. We are leading an effort to impose costs on Russia and to support the Ukrainian people.”

The president did not directly mention the campaign against the Islamic State group in his first two stops in New York — a plenary speech on climate change at the U.N. and remarks on civil society at the Clinton Global Initiative.

But Obama did not intend to let the day pass without a little symbolism. The presidential motorcade pulled up to the Waldorf Towers hotel, where Obama took an elevator to the 34th floor to join a meeting with Secretary of State John F. Kerry and representatives of the five Arab nations that helped in the Syrian airstrikes. Also there was new Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, whom the Obama administration helped elevate after pressuring his predecessor to step down this summer.

“Because of the almost unprecedented effort of this coalition, I think we now have an opportunity to now send a very clear message that the world is united,” Obama said, sitting at a conference table with his advisers and their foreign counterparts.

As the president finished his remarks and reporters were ushered out, one reporter yelled: “Are you at ease being seen as a war president, Mr. Obama?”"

The United States is now attacking two sets of enemies in the region: the Islamic State, a growing movement of jihadists seeking to create its own country in the Middle East, and the Khora­san group, a smaller network affiliated with al-Qaeda that officials say is plotting against Europe and the United States.

At the same time, as the U.S. military and its Arab partners prepare more airstrikes in Syria in the coming days, they will have to contend with another adversary: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Although U.S. officials said they were not targeting Assad or his forces, many of the Sunni Muslim allies in President Obama’s coalition would like to see Assad’s government finally collapse after a devastating civil war. Whether the coalition’s intervention in Syria will eventually help or hurt Assad represents one of the greatest unknowns in a military campaign filled with uncertainty.

Army Lt. Gen. William C. Mayville Jr., director of operations for the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, said the objectives set for the U.S.-led war in Iraq and now Syria could take years to complete. The attacks in Syria marked the start of a new phase, coming six weeks after the U.S. military began a similar campaign of airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in neighboring Iraq.

The overarching goal, Mayville said at a news conference, is “to degrade and ultimately destroy” the Islamic State, first by directly attacking the group in both countries, severing its supply lines and disrupting its sources of arms and money.

To succeed over the long term, Mayville added, the United States and its allies will have to train and equip three proxy forces: the Iraqi military, the Kurdish pesh merga fighters and moderate Syrian rebels. All have proved hapless in head-to-head battles with the Islamic State and will require U.S.-military backing to reclaim territory.

“The most important thing is to create some space for the Iraqi security forces to reorganize and replace leadership that needs to be replaced,” Mayville said. “What we have been doing over these last couple of weeks and what last night’s campaign was about was simply buying them some space so that they can get on the offensive.”

In confronting the Khorasan group, a network that had received scant public mention before this month, the Obama administration may find itself acting largely on its own.

The first wave of strikes, which took place on what was late Monday in Washington, primarily consisted of dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles launched by U.S. warships against eight Khorasan group targets in northwestern Syria, near Aleppo. Military officials said they attacked Khorasan training camps, a munitions production center, a communications building and other sites.

Mayville justified the blitz by citing U.S. intelligence reports showing the Khorasan group “was in the final stages of plans to execute major attacks against Western targets and potentially the U.S. homeland.”

He did not elaborate on those reports and declined to comment when asked whether there was evidence that any plots had been set into motion. He also said the military was still assessing the overall damage it inflicted on the Khorasan group and whether its ability to carry out attacks beyond the region had been diminished.

The strikes against the Khora­san group were an exclusively American operation. Mayville did not explain why Arab allies did not participate in that phase, but other U.S. military officials noted that it would have been difficult for Arab warplanes to bypass air defenses and cross deep into Syrian airspace to reach Aleppo.

It is also unclear whether the five Arab partners consider Khorasan — which refers to an ancient Islamic region that covered parts of present-day Iran and Afghanistan — to be as grave a threat to their national interests as the Islamic State.

Warplanes from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain participated in the second and third wave of airstrikes against Islamic State targets in north-central and eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border, according to Pentagon officials. Qatar also sent military aircraft in a supporting role, they said.

U.S. military officials said they conducted two more airstrikes Tuesday against Islamic State targets in Syria.

Mayville was reluctant to describe how substantial a role the Arab countries played, acknowledging only that the U.S. military dropped “a preponderance” of the ordnance.

All told, about 200 missiles, bombs and rockets were launched against 22 separate targets in Syria on Monday, U.S. military officials said.

In comparison, since Aug. 8, the U.S. military has conducted airstrikes against 194 Islamic State targets in Iraq. U.S. officials said that they expected the pace of airstrikes in both countries to ebb and flow in the coming days but that Monday’s attacks on Syria probably represented a high point.

The Pentagon deployed a mix of aircraft, including B-1 bombers, armed Reaper drones and several types of fighter jets Monday. Among them was the F-22 Raptor, an advanced stealth fighter that has been in the Air Force’s fleet for a decade but until Monday had never been used in combat.

The Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched by two warships, the USS Arleigh Burke in the Red Sea and the USS Philippine Sea in the Persian Gulf. Also participating in the airstrikes were Navy F/A-18 Hornet fighters flying from the USS George H.W. Bush, an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf.

In a sign of Arab nations’ sensitivity about their participation, the Pentagon refrained from saying where the other U.S. warplanes and drones that attacked Syria are based. The vast majority are stationed at installations in the Persian Gulf, including several large air bases in Qatar, the UAE and Kuwait. Although the existence of the bases is an open secret, those countries have asked Washington to keep the arrangements quiet.

The allied command center for the complex air operations was at al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, U.S. officials acknowledged.

The U.S. military also has warplanes and drones stationed at a major joint base in Turkey, a NATO ally that shares a long border with Syria and Iraq. But Turkey has balked at allowing its territory to be used for airstrikes in either country.

The Pentagon released before-and-after reconnaissance photographs of a handful of selected targets in Syria to demonstrate how American forces relied on precision-guided munitions to avoid causing unnecessary damage.

Mayville said he was unaware of any credible reports of civilian casualties. He said the strikes had not intentionally targeted individual enemy commanders, but he acknowledged that such leaders had been “routinely” present at some of the targeted sites.

Prior to Monday, the Syrian government had repeatedly warned the United States and other countries not to violate its sovereignty by launching strikes. At the same time, there were clear signs that Assad welcomed the attacks on his foes.

Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said the United States did not coordinate the strikes with Assad’s government, although Washington did inform the Syrian government through its ambassador to the United Nations that the strikes would be carried out at some point.

Mayville said that Syrian military radar was “passive” in the face of the airstrikes and that Assad’s forces made no attempt to defend Syrian airspace.

In brief remarks outside the White House on Tuesday, Obama stressed that “this is not America’s fight alone” and vowed to press the battle against “these terrorists” in concert with U.S. allies.

“The overall effort will take time,” Obama said on the South Lawn. “There will be challenges ahead. But we are going to do what’s necessary to take the fight to this terrorist group.”

After his remarks, Obama boarded his Marine One helicopter for the first leg of a trip to New York to attend the opening of the U.N. General Assembly. He said he would meet there with the new prime minister of Iraq and with other friends and allies opposed to the Islamic State."

An alarm box near the front entrance of the White House designed to alert guards to an intruder had been muted at what officers believed was a request of the usher’s office, said a Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. Officers are trained that, upon learning of an intruder on the grounds — often through the alarm boxes posted around the property — they must immediately lock the front door.

After barreling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first family's living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.

Gonzalez was tackled by a counterassault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.

Secret Service officials had earlier said he was quickly detained at the main entry. Agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said the office is not commenting during the ongoing investigation of the incident.

Breaches of the White House fence have become more common, but most jumpers are tackled by Secret Service officers guarding the complex before they get even a third of the way across the lawn. Gonzalez is the first person known to have jumped the fence and made it inside the executive mansion.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the breach was “unacceptable” to her, and on Friday she briefed President Obama on her plans to shore up security.

Pierson is expected to face tough questions about the Gonzalez incident Tuesday at a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The hearing is likely to cover a number of security lapses by the agency, including new revelations published over the weekend by The Washington Post about the failure to identify and properly investigate a 2011 shooting attack on the White House.

The more detailed account of this month’s security breach comes from people who provided information about the incident to The Post and whistleblowers who contacted Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the oversight panel’s subcommittee on national security.

Chaffetz said he plans to ask Pierson how an alarm meant to alert officers to intruders could be silenced or turned down. The congressman said two people inside the agency told him that boxes were silenced because the White House usher staff, whose office is near the front door, complained that they were noisy. A Secret Service official told The Post that the usher’s office was concerned the boxes were frequently malfunctioning and unnecessarily sounding off.

The alarm boxes, which officers call “crash boxes,” are key pieces of the agency’s first-alert system, according to former agents and officials. If officers spot an intruder, they are trained to hit the large red button on the nearest box — sending an alert to every post on the complex about the location of an incursion and piping sound from that location to other boxes around the property.

There were some heated moments Tuesday when Secret Service Director Julia Pierson testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee about two security breaches at the White House, one in 2011 and one less than two weeks ago. (Video: Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)

“If true, the fact that crash boxes were muted to avoid being ‘disruptive’ is not due to a lack of resources or an insufficient number of checkpoints or barriers,” Chaffetz said.

He called the incident a “failure of leadership” by the Secret Service.

“The agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,” Chaffetz said. “It must examine what message is being sent to the men and women who protect the president when their leader sacrifices security to appease superficial concerns of White House ushers.”

The new revelations follow accounts provided to The Post last week detailing how Gonzalez's ability to enter the White House reflected a failure of multiple levels of security at the compound. The agency relies on these successive layers as a fail-safe for protecting the president and the White House complex.

In this incident, a plainclothes surveillance team was on duty that night outside the fence, meant to spot jumpers and give early warning before they made it over. But that team did not notice Gonzalez. There was an officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn. When that officer could not reach Gonzalez, there was supposed to be an attack dog, a specialized SWAT team and a guard at the front door — all at the ready.

The dog was not released, a decision now under review. Some people familiar with the incident say the handler probably felt he could not release the dog, because so many officers were in pursuit of Gonzalez and the dog may have attacked them instead.

Since the incident, the Secret Service has added an additional layer of temporary fencing while the agency reviews its procedures.

http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/secret-service-111545.html?hp=f1",0,"The resignation of Secret Service Director Julia Pierson and the launch of a top-to-bottom review of the agency Wednesday are an acknowledgment by President Obama of what he has long denied: that the force charged with protecting him is in deep turmoil and struggling to fulfill its sacred mission. The 6,700-member agency, long an elite class of skilled professionals who prized their jobs, now suffers from diminished luster and historically high turnover rates. Officers in charge of protecting the White House say they have grown resentful at being belittled by their bosses and routinely forced to work on off-days. Some agents who have sworn to take a bullet for the president and his family have little faith in the wisdom or direction of their ­senior-most leaders. Those chronic woes have been amplified in recent days by revelations of a string of humiliating security lapses that have raised concerns about the president’s safety and prompted the agency’s biggest crisis since President Ronald Reagan was shot outside the Washington Hilton three decades ago.

Joseph Clancy, a retired agent who served as the head of Obama’s protective detail briefly after the president was first elected, was named to take over on a temporary basis. He will serve as a caretaker while a full review is conducted and until a permanent replacement can be found.

“Replacing the director is a good start in the right direction,” said Dan Emmett, a former ­counterassault team leader and Secret Service agent. But, he added, “replacing the director will not be effective unless the entire upper management is replaced. Otherwise it will just be business as usual.”

Pierson was elevated to the top spot 18 months ago to put an end to business as usual, after a dozen agents were implicated in a night of carousing with prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia, on the eve of an official visit by Obama. But while the administration dubbed Pierson a fresh start and a new direction for the agency, she was a deeply entrenched part of its culture. A 30-year veteran of the agency, Pierson had served as director Mark Sullivan’s chief of staff and then assistant director before taking over.

Under her watch, the agency continued to suffer from systemic problems that went well beyond the embarrassment of the prostitution scandal. For instance, staffing short­ages have grown so severe that the agency has had to fly in field agents from across the country for two-week temporary details, paying their travel, hotel and per-diem costs.

Pierson also rejected an internal study’s recommendations that the White House have a total of about 100 countersurveillance officers to patrol the perimeter of the complex. She suggested cutting the recommended number by a third. And Pierson had agreed to shrink key units in the agency, including the number of officers from the uniformed division who guard the White House complex.

In her 18 months in charge, Pierson also became the subject of derision among some lower-level agents for accommodating the White House staff’s wishes for less-cumbersome security over the warnings of her tactical teams.

In the spring, Pierson was irate at what she considered the excessive security measures her team had planned for the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, which Obama hosted this summer, demanding that it dismantle extra layers of fencing and reopen closed streets, according to two agency supervisors. Supervisors who had mapped out the security plan said they were taken aback when Pierson, who worked during high school at Walt Disney World as a costumed character and park attendant, said: “We need to be more like Disney World. We need to be more friendly, inviting.”

“I respect Pierson’s service, but she hasn’t been on a protective mission in two decades,” said one supervisor who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “She doesn’t know anything about security planning in a post-9/11 world.”

On a presidential trip this past spring to the Netherlands, Pierson told several counterassault team members stationed at posts in the president’s hotel to move to more remote locations and put their weapons in bags, causing the sharpshooters to worry that their reaction time would be hampered in an emergency.

And this week, Pierson personally ordered that a downtown Washington street be left open near a hotel where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was staying. Secret Service teams have insisted on the closure for years because Netanyahu is considered one of the most sought-

after international targets. But the director agreed to changes because of D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray's concern that the street's closure during an earlier visit caused severe gridlock, said a spokesman for Gray (D).

Julia Pierson, director of Secret Service, resigns + 11 Support on Capitol Hill dwindled quickly after a hearing and amid increasing revelations of Secret Service mistakes.

Pierson was called to a Capitol Hill hearing this week to explain how a man carrying a knife was able to jump the White House fence and then run inside the executive mansion and through much of the main floor before being tackled by an off-duty agent.

Lawmakers also grilled Pierson about a botched investigation of a 2011 shooting at the White House, details of which were first reported by The Washington Post on Sunday. Pierson irritated lawmakers when she said she knew little about the incident, despite having been the agency's chief of staff at the time, and learned some of the details from The Post's account.

Some lawmakers on Tuesday read aloud portions of The Post’s story to underscore larger concerns about what they said was a broken culture within the agency. They pointed to a young officer on duty the night of the shooting who heard shots fired and debris falling but was afraid to contradict supervisors who had incorrectly concluded that no shots had been aimed at the White House. Several members said they had been hearing from agents and officers who do not feel they can make their concerns known internally.

“It is very disturbing to know that Secret Service agents, in the most elite protective agency in the world, feel more comfortable, apparently, from what I’m hearing, coming to members of this committee and telling things than coming to you and members in the agency,” Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) said during one sharp exchange with Pierson.

Lawmakers were also annoyed by the administration’s budget request for this year for an agency that has claimed to be chronically underfunded.

Homeland Security requested $1.49 billion in operating funds for the Secret Service, a $60 million dip from last fiscal year. But even spending-conscious Republicans said that was too much. So Congress instead agreed to a rare increase over the administration’s request, giving the agency $1.53 billion.

Shortly after the contentious hearing with lawmakers came another revelation: On a recent trip to Atlanta, a contract security guard with a gun and a criminal record was allowed in an elevator with Obama.

Making matters worse, neither the president nor Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson was told about it. A senior U.S. official said Johnson was “deeply disappointed” when he learned about the incident. White House officials said they first learned about the breakdown minutes before The Post published the story online.

Clancy, who spent much of his career at the Secret Service as a senior agent on the protective detail for President George W. Bush, is not expected to clean house or reform the agency, according to officials briefed on his appointment.

“He’s one of the most genteel guys. It would be very hard to find someone to say something bad about Joe,” said one longtime agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the news media. But, the agent added: “He doesn’t like conflict. They need to clean house. He’s not the guy to do it.”"

But health officials were quick Tuesday to tamp down any hysteria, emphasizing the ways in which the U.S. medical system is well equipped to halt the spread of the disease.

“We’re stopping it in its tracks in this country,” Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a news conference Tuesday afternoon.

The infected man, who was not identified, left Liberia on Sept. 19 and arrived in the United States the next day to visit family members.

Health officials are working to identify everyone who may have been exposed to him since he began showing symptoms last week. Frieden said this covered just a “handful” of people, a group that will be watched for three weeks to see whether any symptoms emerge among them.

The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thomas Frieden, confirmed on Tuesday the diagnoses of the first case of Ebola in the United States. (Video: AP)

“The bottom line here is that I have no doubt that we will control this importation, or this case of Ebola, so that it does not spread widely in this country,” Frieden said. “It is certainly possible that someone who had contact with this individual could develop Ebola in the coming weeks. But there is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here.”

People who traveled on the same planes as this man are not in danger because his temperature was checked before the flights and he was not symptomatic at the time, Frieden said. Ebola is contagious only if the infected person has symptoms. The virus can be spread through bodily fluids or infected animals but not through the air.

“There is zero risk of transmission on the flight,” Frieden said.

There were more than 6,500 reported cases of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone as of Tuesday, and the illness has been blamed for more than 3,000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Ebola was first identified in 1976, and the current outbreak in West Africa is considered the largest and most complex in the known history of the virus, with more cases and deaths than every other outbreak combined.

Until now, the only known cases of Ebola in the United States involved American doctors and aid workers who were infected overseas and returned to the country for treatment. All have survived.

One of them, Richard Sacra, was discharged last week from a Nebraska hospital. Days later, the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., admitted an American physician who was exposed to the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone. There were reports of possible Ebola patients in New York, California, New Mexico and Miami, but all of them tested negative for the virus.

The unidentified person with Ebola is being treated in intensive care at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, according to Edward Goodman, the hospital’s epidemiologist.

Three Dallas Fire/EMS crew members — two paramedics and one paramedic intern — are being monitored after transporting the patient to the hospital, a Dallas official confirmed. They will remain at home during a 21-day period and checked often for symptoms of the deadly virus, Lt. Joel Lavender of the Dallas Fire Rescue said. The ambulance was also decontaminated later, he said.

From television to Twitter, Tuesday’s news made the distant health crisis seem like something that could appear almost anywhere. But experts said it was hard to imagine that Ebola would not find its way across other borders — a CDC estimate recently projected that more than a million people in West Africa could be infected by the end of January if the epidemic is left unchecked.

Share this article Share

“It was inevitable once the outbreak exploded,” said Thomas Geisbert, a professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, who has researched Ebola for decades. “Unless you were going to shut down airports and keep people from leaving [West Africa], it’s hard to stop somebody from getting on a plane.”

But Geisbert quickly underscored how unlikely the virus is to spread in the United States. For starters, he said, officials placed the sick man in quarantine quickly to prevent him from potentially infecting others. In addition, health workers are already contacting and monitoring any others with whom he might have had contact in recent days.

“The system that was put in place worked the way it was supposed to work,” Geisbert said.

That doesn’t guarantee that no one else will be infected, because the sick person could have transmitted the virus to someone else before being isolated. But that approach almost certainly ensures that the United States will quickly contain the disease. In addition, while there is no approved treatment for Ebola, hydration and other basic medical care is far better in the United States than in West Africa, making it more likely that Ebola patients will survive here.

President Obama spoke with Frieden on Tuesday afternoon about the patient and the efforts to seek out any other potential cases, the White House said.

At a news briefing later in the day, Frieden said that the infected man did not develop symptoms until about four days after arriving in the country. He sought medical care on Sept. 26 but was sent home. He was admitted to the hospital two days later and placed in isolation, but it remained unclear Tuesday how many people he might have encountered since he became contagious. Frieden, who would not say whether the patient is a U.S. citizen, said the man is not believed to have been working as part of the response to the Ebola outbreak.

David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of Health Services, said the state’s laboratory in Austin received a sample of the patient’s blood Tuesday morning and confirmed the presence of Ebola several hours later. The laboratory was certified to do Ebola testing last month.

The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history is centered in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, although there is a separate outbreak in Congo. The affected countries have fragile or barely existent health-care systems, people are being turned away from treatment centers, and family members are caring directly for those sick and dying from Ebola.

For months, the CDC has been conducting briefings for hospital workers and clinicians about the proper protocol for diagnosing the infection in patients suspected of carrying the virus, as well as the kinds of infection control measures to manage hospitalized patients known or suspected to have the disease. Many procedures involve the same types of infection control that major hospitals are already supposed to have in place.

Early recognition is a critical element of infection control. Symptoms include fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, severe headache, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea and contact within 21 days before onset of symptoms with the blood or other bodily fluids or human remains of someone known or suspected to have the disease, or travel to an area where transmission is active.

The CDC also has scheduled more training for U.S. workers who plan on volunteering in West Africa or want to be prepared if cases surface at their own hospitals.

The two are competing to become the next governor of Texas. Abbott's campaign slammed the ad and put out its own video on Monday.

CNN —

Texas state senator Wendy Davis defended her campaign’s political ad that features an empty wheelchair and attacks Greg Abbott, saying “the intent was to demonstrate (his) hypocrisy.”

Davis, a Democrat who’s running against Abbott for governor this fall, told CNN affiliate KSAT in San Antonio on Saturday that Abbott has unfairly tried to block cases as attorney general that have similarities his own history.

“He rightfully had an opportunity to access the justice system when he was at the receiving end of a tragic accident,” Davis said. “But ever since he’s been actively fighting to close that door and deny access to others who have been wronged and who deserve to have their day in court.”

Abbott, who was elected attorney general in 2002, was partially paralyzed after a tree fell on him while he was jogging at the age of 26. He has remained in a wheelchair ever since and won what’s believed to be at least $10 million in a settlement related to his injury, according to the Dallas Morning News.

Davis’ campaign ad, which was released Friday, opens with an empty wheelchair and mentions the money Abbott received after his freak accident. It goes on to cite two other cases — one related to a disability, the other related to a rape — and argues that Abbott sided with the defendants.

Abbott’s campaign called the ad “disgusting” and put out a web video Monday highlighting statements from the media decrying the spot. The video blasts Davis as being “unfit for governor.”

But Davis, who trails Abbott in recent polls, argued this weekend that he “has shown that he cares only about advancing his own interests, and often to the exclusion of other people.”"

An unpaid White House intern was working as advance staff during the trip. A person close to the White House investigation says the administration did not try to cover up the link.

CNN —

Echoes of the 2012 prostitution scandal in Cartagena, Colombia, lie at the root of the turmoil that has upended the Secret Service, prompting the ouster of its director in the wake of security lapses.

One link to the White House, involving a former unpaid intern, the son of an Obama donor, who was investigated for possible involvement in the scandal, has caused internal complaints about the fairness of the 2012 probe.

The scandal eventually led to the ouster of eight employees, and discipline against a handful of others at the Secret Service. However, in the years since, current and former employees, as well as congressional investigators, have complained that White House links to the episode weren’t properly investigated, perhaps for political reasons, and that the punishment against Secret Service was too severe.

How to make a President safe again

The internal dissension over Cartagena is one reason why, according to current and former employees, a series of recent security lapses prompted whistleblowers to go to Congress to report the Secret Service’s incomplete accounting of security lapses that have further embarrassed the agency.

In the wake of the Cartagena scandal, the White House counsel’s office conducted a probe, interviewing more than a dozen staffers who worked on advance preparation for the presidential trip to Colombia, according to a person close to the probe. It also reviewed a single document purporting to show that a woman had signed her name and a room number on a hotel a piece of paper that appeared to be a sign-in sheet; the room number corresponded to the volunteer’s room. The paper didn’t bear a logo, or any indication of being hotel stationery or official business record, according to the person close to the probe.

Richard Sauber, an attorney for the former intern, says his client “categorically denies having a prostitute in his room and neither he nor his father contacted anyone at DHS or the [White House] to seek special treatment - the allegations are false and everyone involved knows they are false.”

The White House determined that the paper, which didn’t include any official logos or stationery marks, couldn’t be relied on as proof of wrongdoing. The White House investigators deemed his denial credible.

The Washington Post published a story Wednesday night alleging that the incident was covered up, and citing complaints from a former investigator with the Homeland Security Department’s inspector general who claimed that political interference from the White House prompted changes to be made to the DHS inspector general’s report on the Cartagena incident.

The Post also cited multiple government officials who argue the White House investigation into the volunteer was nowhere near as extensive as the weeks long probe into the Secret Service agents and Pentagon personnel.

Can the Secret Service actually change?

The person close to the internal probe disputed that there was a coverup, citing multiple media accounts of the possible White House link that have been published in the past two years.

An administration official said the White House’s review was thorough and that purported hotel records wrongly implicated at least two people: one, the White House intern, and the other, a Secret Service employee. The White House concluded that there was no inappropriate conduct by the intern, the official said.

“We took this very seriously,” the person close to the probe said. “The idea that this [investigation] was done flimsily is just not true.”

Complaints that Secret Service employees were treated more harshly than a White House intern overlook one fact, the person close to the probe said. The Secret Service agents implicated are armed U.S. government employees charged with protecting the life of the president and should be held to a higher standard than an unpaid White House volunteer who technically wasn’t a government employee, the source argued.

Despite the White House denials, inside the Secret Service, the handling of the Cartagena incident has led to dissension.

Some of the Secret Service employees who were implicated were required to sign non-disclosure agreements as part of the disciplinary process, which has further aroused suspicion about the handling of the matter.

According to current and former employees, low morale among some Secret Service employees is behind some of the recent lapses. And it has prompted employees to report their complaints to Congress, instead of using internal channels to report problems. Julia Pierson, the agency’s director appointed to help clean up the aftermath of Cartagena, was ousted last week.

Her predecessor, Mark Sullivan, under whose watch Cartagena and other lapses occurred, is now a Washington consultant.

Sullivan was the subject of probes by the Justice Department’s public integrity section and the Homeland Security inspector general’s special investigations unit. They investigated allegations he lied to Congress when he testified that the prostitutes involved in the scandal posed no issues for U.S. intelligence agencies. Investigators determined that U.S. intelligence community had information about at least one of the women involved because of possible links to drug cartels, according to people close to the probe.

The Justice Department and DHS inspector general each separately cleared Sullivan of wrongdoing.

Joshua Hochberg, Sullivan’s attorney, said “Questions that arose concerning Mr. Sullivan were looked at and determined to be unfounded.”

Sullivan recently was appointed to help the government come up with best practices in the aftermath of the Benghazi terrorist attacks.

Last year, supporters of Malala Yousafzai in her native Swat Valley defied possible backlash from Taliban-backed militants and organized events to await word on the Nobel Peace Prize, which went to an organization seeking a ban on chemical weapons.

On Friday — just after the second anniversary of the gunshots by Taliban militants that changed her life — word raced through Mingora: The 17-year-old Yousafzai was a co-winner of the prize for her global advocacy of education for women and girls.

""I am speechless on awarding Malala with the Nobel,"" said Ahmad Shah, 45, an educator and close aide of her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, who ran a public school. ""I am happy that now our Swat will be known by Malala's Nobel Peace Prize, and that is more than everything.""

But there is still the shadow of the Pakistani Taliban and its backers in the Swat Valley, a region of stunning beauty and bloody ideological struggles in the tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan.

Years of offensives by the Pakistani military have significantly loosened the once-tight grip of the Taliban, but militants have shown some signs of resilience with attacks on political figures and other opponents.

Such retaliation was carried out in October 2012 when masked gunmen shot Yousafzai in the head in apparent reprisal for her calls to keep girls' schools open. Two other girls were wounded in the attack in Mingora.

“Before militancy, Swat was known for its beauty and education,” said Shah, who runs a private school in Mingora. “And, thank God, this award will help the revival of education in Swat. This is a huge victory for not only Swat, but Pakistan.”

Shah recalled the comment by a girl student when asked what she wanted to become in the future. Her reply: “I want to become Malala Yousafzai to work for education and peace,” said Shah.

“This is great news for Swat,” added Ayub Hilal, a 35-year-old merchant.

“I have been through the militancy and never fled Swat even during the military operation in May 2009,” he said. “But I see this award as a sign of smile on our faces.”

Not all agree. In the past, some in Mingora have criticized Yousafzai’s worldwide fame, denouncing events such as a 2013 address at the United Nations as ma­nipu­la­tion by the West. Threats have prevented Yousafzai from returning home since her recovery.

One girls' college in Mingora was named after Yousafzai shortly after the attack, but the students protested that they could be vulnerable to violence. The name was removed.

“Some people are silent, as they don’t like her and her father, but others are quiet due to the possible threat from the militants,” said Aftab Ali, a 41-year-old businessman.

Yousafzai’s first cousin, Mahmood ul Hassan, 34, said he received a call from the girl’s mother, Toor Pekai, moments after the Nobel was announced.

“Malala’s Noble award is a clear message from Swat that we are peaceful and peace-loving people,’’ he said. “Once Swat was notorious for the terrorism and militancy, but now the world will call Swat as the hometown of Noble peace award winner.”

He dismissed the possible threats from militants, saying the uplifting message was far greater than the fears. “Death and life is in the hands of God,” he said, “but the pride Malala won is unforgettable.”

In the rest of Pakistan, the reaction to the prize appeared relatively muted. In an eastern part of the country — far from Yousafzai’s home region — many people said they did not even recognize her name.

But the country’s president, prime minister and powerful military congratulated her as Pakistan’s second Nobel winner. Abdus Salam, a researcher in theoretical physics, won the Nobel physics prize in 1979.

“Except for terrorists, all Pakistanis want their children in school,” wrote Maj. Gen. Asim Bajwa, the chief military spokesman, on his Twitter account.

A seventh-grade girl at a private school in Mingora, Hadeeqa Bashir, recalled meeting Yousafzai — then a young teenager — during a peace rally. The 13-year-old Bashir called the Nobel a reward for her “sacrifices and struggle.”

A social activist, Fazal Maula Zahid, 47, envisions a time when Yousafzai can return.

“We want Malala to establish the first Swat women’s university,’’ he said, “and change Swat into the valley of education.’"

http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/17/politics/ebola-czar-ron-klain/index.html?hpt=hp_t1",0,"President Obama has asked Ron Klain, who served as chief of staff to both Vice President Biden and former vice president Al Gore, as his Ebola response coordinator, according to a White House official. ""He will report directly to the president’s homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, and the president's national security adviser, Susan Rice, as he ensures that efforts to protect the American people by detecting, isolating and treating Ebola patients in this country are properly integrated but don’t distract from the aggressive commitment to stopping Ebola at the source in West Africa,"" a White House official wrote in an e-mail.

Klain, 53, is a longtime Democratic operative who served as Biden's chief of staff from 2009 to 2011 and as Gore's from 1995 to 1999. He helped oversee the Democratic side in the 2000 presidential election recount as its lead lawyer, a role that Kevin Spacey portrayed in the HBO film ""Recount.""

CNN first reported the news Friday morning.

Obama has been under pressure from Republicans for weeks to appoint an ""Ebola czar"" to oversee the federal government's overall effort to contain the disease. Thursday night, the president told reporters: ""It may make sense for us to have one person, in part just so that after this initial surge of activity, we can have a more regular process, just to make sure that we're crossing all the t's and dotting all the i's going forward. ""

""Klain’s role is consistent with the view the president articulated in the Oval Office last night that Monaco, Rice and others have done outstanding work in confronting this challenge so far — but given their management of other national and homeland security priorities, additional bandwidth will further enhance the government’s Ebola response,"" the White House official added in the e-mailed statement.

The move did not satisfy conservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who said the staff change fell short of what is needed to contain the spread of the lethal virus on U.S. soil.

“We don't need another so-called 'czar'; we need presidential leadership. This is a public health crisis, and the answer isn't another White House political operative,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""The answer is a commander in chief who stands up and leads, banning flights from Ebola-afflicted nations and acting decisively to secure our southern border.""

But Klain's Democratic colleagues said he was well-suited for the assignment. Robert Bauer, who served as White House counsel under Obama and worked on the 2000 recount, said Klain has developed a reputation of having ""taken on highly charged assignments where there were significant complexities, and managed them very well.""

Klain is not known for his health-care expertise, though he would get briefings on those policies in his capacity as a campaign strategist for Gore and the Democrats' 2004 presidential candidate, John F. Kerry.

""I wouldn't call him a policy wonk by any means, but he was someone who got [that] you couldn’t formulate good strategy without understanding the policy,"" said Chris Jennings, who served as a top White House health policy adviser under President Bill Clinton and Obama.

Klain navigated the legal and political worlds with ease, Jennings added. ""He wasn’t just an analyst. He was a strategist.""

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Edward R. Royce (R-Calif.) questioned Klain's lack of medical credentials, saying in a statement: “Given the mounting failings in the Obama administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak, it is right that the President has sought to task a single individual to coordinate its response. But I have to ask why the President didn’t pick an individual with a noteworthy infectious disease or public health background?""

Known for a mordant sense of humor, Klain is also an enthusiastic Facebook user who frequently posts about his family. He is married to Monica Medina, who served as a top National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration official during Obama's first term and is now the National Geographic Society's senior director for international ocean policy.

Klain became close with Biden while serving as a staffer for the Senate Judiciary Committee when Biden served as chairman. He helped advise Biden during the 2008 campaign, and his bona fides inside the West Wing date back to shortly after Obama won that historic election.

During the transition, the newly elected president wanted to find a role for Klain in the West Wing, and his name was mentioned as a potential White House communications director, according to a person familiar with the internal deliberations. But Biden also wanted him and convinced Klain to join the vice president’s office as chief of staff, a role he had also served for Vice President Gore in the late 1990s.

Mark Gitenstein, a former Obama administration ambassador to Romania, said Klain developed a strong relationship with Obama while helping prepare the then-senator from Illinois for the presidential debates against Republican nominee John McCain in 2008. Klain had served in a similar role for Kerry’s 2004 campaign.

“Debate prep requires getting in someone’s face and saying, ‘No, you're not doing this right,’ ” said Gitenstein, who had personally recommended that Klain replace him as general counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1989, when Klain was 28 and then serving as a clerk on the Supreme Court.

Gitenstein said Klain’s management of the economic stimulus push in the first year of the Obama administration helped him prepare for the challenges that he'll face managing the Ebola response. “It was a very difficult job -- a management problem and a problem of getting the money to the right places, which required coordination with other Cabinet secretaries.... Ron really got his arms around the problem as fast as anyone I’ve seen.”

Former senator Ted Kaufman (D-Del.), who was a longtime political adviser to Biden, called Klain well-suited for the role based on his varied experience dealing with Congress, the White House and the media.

“He’s like your Renaissance man; the more difficult the problem, the better he is,” Kaufman said.

Jon Wolfsthal, who served on Biden’s national security staff, said Klain managed both Biden’s domestic operations and the national security division.

“I would not say he’s a light touch. You know he’s in the room,” Wolfsthal said. “But he’s not trying to push anybody around or boss them around. He’s very serious, and he makes sure the work gets done.... Even though he doesn’t have a background in disease, it doesn’t matter -- he will master anything.”

Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) immediately praised the news.

""I've known Ron Klain for over twenty years,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""He is smart, aggressive, and levelheaded; exactly the qualities we need in a czar to steer our response to Ebola. He is an excellent choice.""

Klain left the White House in 2011 to become president of Case Holdings, the holding company for the business and philanthropic interests of former AOL chairman Steve Case, and general counsel of Revolution LLC, a Washington-based venture capital firm founded by Case.

Driving attitudes is a pervasive sense of a nation in trouble. Overwhelming majorities say the country is badly off track and give the economy negative ratings. Economic expectations are little better today than they were at this time four years ago.

Six in 10 say they cannot trust the government in Washington to do what is right — the same as a year ago in the aftermath of the government shutdown and the botched rollout of the federal Web site for the Affordable Care Act.

With multiple crises confronting the country — including the spread of Ebola in West Africa and cases here at home, as well as threats from Islamic State militants — a majority now says the government’s ability to deal with big problems has declined in the past few years. Among those who say this, more — by 3 to 1 — blame Obama and the Democrats than fault Republicans in Congress.

The disgruntlement appears to be coloring public interest in the 2014 campaign, which has been marked by an unprecedented amount of money spent by candidates and, especially, outside groups. Voters in states with competitive Senate races have been barraged with negative ads that began running early this year and now clog local newscasts.

View Graphic National political landscape favors Republicans ahead of midterms

The survey highlights that there is less interest in this midterm campaign than there was in the 2010 and 2006 elections — 2 in 3 people say they are closely following the election this year, compared with 3 in 4 who were doing the same in 2010. Just 22 percent of voters say they have been contacted by an individual or organization regarding the congressional campaign, 12 percentage points lower than at this time four years ago.

Republicans appear to have more enthusiasm about voting, based on those who say they are certain to vote. And more people who voted for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 say they are closely following the midterms, compared with those who say they voted for Obama. Democrats are hoping to counter that enthusiasm gap with a get-out-the-vote operation that is aimed at persuading sporadic voters to cast ballots.

When asked whether they will vote for the Democrat or the Republican in their House districts, 50 percent of likely voters say the Republican and 44 percent say the Democrat. Among the larger universe of registered voters, Democrats have an edge — 47 percent to 44 percent. That swing of nine points between registered and likely voters is identical to the difference recorded at this point in 2010.

The Republican advantage among likely voters translated into a gain of 63 House seats for the party in 2010. This year, expectations for GOP pickups are more modest, largely because there are far fewer competitive districts and fewer opportunities for the GOP.

Still, in many respects the potential 2014 electorate looks much like that of 2010, based on a comparison with exit polls from four years ago. Among Democrats and Republicans, more than 9 in 10 again say they plan to vote for the House candidate of their party next week. Among independents, Republicans hold a sizable advantage, as they did four years ago. Men favor Republicans by double digits, while women favor Democrats by mid-single digits.

The real battle is over control of the Senate. Republicans need a net gain of six seats to become the majority party in the upper chamber. At this point, they are heavily favored to pick up three of those six, with good opportunities to win seven Democratic-held seats — in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, New Hampshire and North Carolina. But Republicans are fighting to hold on to three seats of their own, in Georgia, Kansas and possibly Kentucky.

The new Post-ABC News poll offers only general clues about the Senate races in those states, many of which tilt toward Republicans in presidential elections. In nine states with competitive Senate races, 57 percent of voters express a preference for Republicans in the House elections, compared with 39 percent for Democrats.

There is more confidence today than in September that Republicans will win enough seats to claim the Senate majority, although this is not predictive of the outcome. Nearly 7 in 10 Republicans say a GOP majority would be a good thing, while half of Democrats say it would be a bad thing.

In many of the states with competitive Senate races, other public polls have found that Obama’s approval is below his national numbers, creating a drag on Democratic candidates.

The new Post-ABC survey puts Obama’s overall national approval rating at 43 percent, up a statistically insignificant three points from two weeks ago. His disapproval remains unchanged, at 51 percent. The view of his handling of the economy is 42 percent positive, 52 percent negative, roughly the same as it has been this fall.

Obama has begun to campaign on behalf of gubernatorial candidates, but he has avoided appearances in states with genuinely competitive Senate races. In those states, the candidates are seeking to put distance between themselves and the president, despite voting records strongly supporting the White House.

More than half of voters say that the president will not be a factor in their vote. But among those who say he will be, the percentage who say they will use their vote to express opposition to the president is 10 points higher than the share who say they want to send a message of support for him.

The Post-ABC poll was conducted by telephone Thursday through Sunday among a random national sample of 1,204 adults, including interviews on conventional and cellular phones. The overall margin of sampling error is three percentage points. The error margin is 3.5 points for the sample of 968 registered voters and four points for the sample of 758 likely voters."

The problem is that it rarely works. That is even truer than usual for the current crop of endangered Senate Democrats. Their efforts to distance themselves from President Obama’s record — rather than defend it — has become a source of friction with the White House.

“I’ve always believed that it’s not an effective strategy to run against a president of your own party, unless you’ve been actively opposed to that president,” said David Axelrod, who was Obama’s top political strategist in his two presidential campaigns and a senior adviser in his White House. “You’re going to get tagged with it anyway.”

With so many Democrats trying to suggest a distance from Obama that doesn’t exist, Axelrod added, it’s natural for the president and his team “to be a little frustrated.”

Another senior Democrat who advises the White House, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the current feeling among Obama and his aides is “exasperation.”

View Graphic Election Lab: See our current forecast for every congressional race in 2014

“He doesn’t think they have any reason to run away from him,” the adviser said. “He thinks there is a strong message there.”

The president has hinted at the tension in recent remarks. “Make no mistake, these policies are on the ballot, every single one of them,” Obama said earlier this month. He restated the obvious a few weeks later in a radio interview when he said of the Democratic senators who are struggling this year: “The bottom line is . . . these are all folks who vote with me; they have supported my agenda in Congress.”

Those comments spawned a barrage of Republican attack ads and a bout of frustration with Obama among Democrats at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Even Axelrod deemed the first one “a mistake,” telling NBC’s “Meet the Press,” “I wouldn’t put that line in there.”

But a new issue of Congressional Quarterly brings fresh evidence that Senate Democrats have maintained a tight formation behind the president, even as his approval ratings have sunk. It analyzed the 120 Senate votes on which Obama has urged a ""yes"" or ""no"" this year, and found that the most vulnerable Democrats stood behind him a minimum of 96 percent of the time.

Those kinds of numbers have become standard fare in Republican ads and speeches, but they stand in contrast to the Democrats' own campaign rhetoric. Colorado's Mark Udall (99 percent support, by CQ's count) has said that he is the ""last person they want to see coming"" at the White House, while Alaska's Mark Begich (98 percent) has described himself as ""a thorn in [Obama's posterior]. There's times when I'm a total thorn, you know, and he doesn't appreciate it.""

The most glaring example is Kentucky Democratic nominee Alison Lundergan Grimes's continued refusal to say whether she voted for Obama — even though she was a delegate to the Democratic conventions that nominated him in 2008 and 2012.

These candidates are far from the first to try to put daylight between themselves and their president. In 1994, President Bill Clinton's pollster Stanley Greenberg went so far as to tacitly advise them to do so, writing in a memo: ""Voters want to know that you are fighting to get things done for them, not that you are advancing some national agenda."" The same was true for Republican candidates in 2006.

The two elections saw the president’s party lose control of both houses of Congress.

The impulse to try that strategy again is understandable in 2014, where so many of the Senate battles are being fought in states where Obama lost to GOP nominee Mitt Romney by double-digit margins in 2012.

But some Democrats argue that doing so forfeits the opportunity to make the case for their party’s policies and to draw a contrast with those of the Republicans. “By default, we lose a lot of these arguments, because nobody is willing to take them on,” said former Senate majority leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.).

There is an additional danger this year given the importance of turning out African Americans, most of whom support Obama but do not usually turn out to vote in midterms.

“There’s a real trap for some of these candidates,” Axelrod said. “If you’re seen as being openly disdainful, you run the risk of diminishing enthusiasm.”

That is not the dynamic in the House, because of the way the districts have been drawn.

“We don’t have any competitive Democrats in deep red districts. And in deep blue districts, the question isn’t whether you supported the president, it’s have you supported him 100 percent of the time,” said Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Earlier this year, the White House and congressional Democrats appeared to be in harmony on a strategy, with an agreed-upon issue agenda. They would attempt to overcome a toxic political environment — and encourage minorities, women and young people to vote — by touting proposals such as expanding the federal minimum wage and passing equal-pay legislation.

But none of those issues has loomed as large as Obama’s unpopularity. Earlier this month, a Gallup poll found that more than half of registered voters see this election as a means of expressing their opposition to (32 percent) or support for (20 percent) the president.

The fact that Senate Democrats can point to little in their records showing independence from Obama reflects, in part, the continuing increase in partisanship on Capitol Hill.

The governing style of Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) is also a factor. Republicans have long complained that he allows relatively few opportunities to amend legislation; for Democrats, that means that their chances to distance themselves from the president are rare.

Congressional Quarterly pointed to Reid’s biggest power play — the so-called nuclear option, which made it easier to overcome filibusters against judicial and executive branch nominees. But it also meant Democrats are casting more votes that put them on record as siding with the president.

“Of the 120 Senate votes on which Obama has expressed a view so far this year, 102 were confirmation votes. Only 18 were legislative,” CQ wrote. “That is the most skewed tally since CQ began drawing a distinction between policy and confirmation votes in 1988.”"

With a heavy emphasis on the cautious part. In an interview with me, Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, sounded realistic about the challenges Democrats face, seeming to suggest at one point that keeping the majority might not be the most likely outcome. However, he continued to project confidence, insisting that internal polling had enough races within the margin of error to position Democrats to hold the majority if things go right.

If Democrats do manage to keep the Senate, it will be in no small part due to Cecil’s efforts. He has spent two years putting in place a strategy based on the overriding premise that the only way Democrats can possibly hang on, given the formidable fundamentals they face, is with a serious, sustained, and very expensive effort to change the composition of the midterm electorate.

To that end, Cecil told me that at the end of the day, at least $60 million will have been invested in voter mobilization alone. He also responded to reports that President Obama’s advisers are angry with Democrats for distancing themselves from him. A lightly edited and trimmed down version of our conversation follows.

THE PLUM LINE: In an interview with Bloomberg TV, you seemed to predict Democrats would win Arkansas Alaska, Louisiana, Iowa, North Carolina, and Colorado. The polls have slipped since then. Do you still stand by that?

GUY CECIL: Clearly when you have as many races as we do that are within the margin of error you’re not going to win every race. But our approach has been to keep as many states competitive as possible, and keep it that way until the very end, in the hopes that the right combination of states actually leads to a majority. But no, I’m not predicting wins in every single targeted state. But there’s a path to victory.

TPL: In the polling averages right now, Republicans lead by more than three points in enough states to take the majority, including Arkansas, Alaska and Louisiana. They lead by two-ish in Colorado and Iowa. And they lead in places where you’re hoping to make surprise pickups. Is the polling wrong?

CECIL: There is a history of polling averages getting enough races wrong that it might make a difference when the majority is this close. In Colorado in 2010, 17 of the last 18 polls showed Michael Bennet losing. Our internal polling always showed it a one point race.

For us the focus is more on our own internal modeling and analytics. When we put out a poll from Paul Harstad showing us up one in Colorado, it’s because we believe that is the case. We think with the right formula for what the election looks like in a vote by mail state, with the right percentage Latino turnout and of our vote among Latinos, that we have a margin of error lead that is different from most of the polling averages.

TPL: But the trouble with released internal polls is that nobody knows what the non-released ones say. What is the big picture from all of your internal polling?

CECIL: The aggregate overview is we still have 10 races that are within three points. When we look at Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina, we’re in margin of error races. Statistically these races are even. The bottom line is there are enough races within the margin of error for us to hold the majority.

TPL: A number of these Southern Democrats are clearly under-performing among Southern whites. What are the long term implications if people like Mark Pryor and Mary Landrieu can’t hold on in red states? What does that mean for the Democratic Party?

CECIL: I don’t think they are necessarily under-performing. Most are performing at margins that are above the president’s favorable rating. And most are out-performing what most Democrats would get in those races. We clearly have a challenge in the South. But that’s why we have candidates who have shown an enormous amount of independence. There’s no mistaking that to be successful we have to maximize our vote among younger voters, unmarried women and African Americans.

TPL: What would it mean if Pryor and Landrieu — who are deeply rooted in their states with powerful brands — can’t hold on?

CECIL: I try not to draw too many conclusions from one election. The country demographically is changing rapidly. Throughout the south, the Hispanic population is growing. In Atlanta, the African American and Hispanic populations are growing. There are significant demographic changes in North Carolina. This is a particularly challenging map. Of the three Senate classes, this is the only one whose states the president lost. The other two classes are in classes that as an aggregate the president won.

TPL: In North Carolina, I’m hearing there’s serious slippage for Senator Kay Hagan among conservative Democrats from the east, which is to say, white voters on the fence who dislike the president.

We haven’t shown any sort of significant decline in North Carolina. We’ve had it at a 1-3 or 1-4 point race. It moves around in there. It’s not a particular area of concern.

TPL: In Colorado and Iowa, the common thread is that Democrats have cast both these Republicans as extremists on women’s health, yet both are at a minimum tied or at a maximum ahead.

CECIL: If you look at the trend in Iowa, it’s since Bruce Braley and his allies have put up the attacks on women’s health that the race started to close. It’s actually a relatively new argument.

TPL: But in Colorado it’s been a longtime thing.

CECIL: The number one indicator [in our numbers] for voting for Mark Udall or against Cory Gardner, is their position on choice. There’s a mis-perception that Mark Udall has only run on choice. He has run ads on flood relief, the government shutdown, the NSA, the economy. But it’s important to note that abortion isn’t just about abortion. It is a reflection of a person’s ideological views and how they view the world.

Advertisement

TPL: Republicans argue that the fact that Udall is still barely tied or a couple of points behind shows that the Michael Bennet playbook [attacks on Personhood and women’s health, which were central in the 2010 Colorado race] has run its course.

CECIL: That’s the same argument Republicans were making in October 29, 2010. Everybody thought Michael Bennet was going to lose. During that period there were op-eds and editorials written claiming he was a one-note candidate.

TPL: The Post reported that some Obama advisers are “exasperated” with Democrats for running away from his record. Couldn’t Democratic candidates have leaned a little harder into making the case that the economy is getting better and that Obamacare is working?

CECIL: The president has done everything we have asked him to do. But this is not about the president. It is about the map. It is our job to make Senate races about the two people on the ballot. Our advice to candidates is that when somebody disagrees with the president, they should say so, and that when somebody agrees with the president, they should say so…For us to nationalize the election in a series of red states would play into the terrain that Republicans want us to play on.

Advertisement

TPL: But the Republican strategy has been about layering Ebola on top of ISIS and the child migrant crisis to nationalize these races and make them not about a choice between two candidates. Hasn’t the President’s handling of some of these things made it easier for Republicans to do that?

CECIL: The Republicans’ goal is to nationalize the election. Whether they were going to use Obamacare or Ebola or something else, this is the strategy they have laid out. Our strategy is not counter to the president. It’s making the race about education in North Carolina. In Georgia, it’s talking about Michelle Nunn’s long record of encouraging people to engage in volunteer service and comparing that to David Perdue’s record of outsourcing jobs.

Our job for the next six days is to win this election. It is not to figure out whether somebody should have been more or less involved. I believe that if the DSCC and our candidates and our allies stay focused on that, we have a shot. Despite the map, despite turnout, despite the midterms, we are in a position — doesn’t mean it’s guaranteed; doesn’t even mean it’s the most likely — to hold the majority.

Advertisement

TPL: At the end of the day, how much will have gone into field and voter mobilization?

We will end up somewhere between $60 and $65 million in our targeted states that is either transfered or raised by the DSCC or our candidates. Last week we knocked on 143,000 doors in Colorado. We have registered tens of thousands of voters in a number of states.

Turnout is required but not sufficient. We must engage in trying to change the electorate. But this is not just a turnout election. If it were just turnout election we would always win these tough states. But we still have persuadable voters out there that we have to also stay focused on. So [turnout] is not the only thing that’s going to lead to a victory. But that investment hopefully will pay off.

The opening of a land corridor would be another potential boost for the Kobane defenders following U.S. airdrops of weapons, ammunition and medical supplies to them late Sunday.

But the deal, the subject of intensive U.S. diplomatic talks over the past week, also depends on whether the separate Kurdish groups can resolve their deep differences in the interest of confronting a common enemy.

The tentative nature of the agreement reflected the convoluted history and political calculations of all parties, particularly the Kurds, whose ethnic homeland spreads across Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran.

Turkey had opposed delivering weapons to Kobane's Syrian Kurds because of their affiliations with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group based in southeastern Turkey that has fought Turkish forces since the mid-1980s, seeking greater autonomy. Its leaders have threatened to tear up a recent peace accord with Turkey if Kobane falls.

Turkey and the United States have declared the PKK a terrorist organization, raising additional complications for American policy­makers.

While the United States understands Turkey’s concerns, Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday during a visit to Indonesia, “We cannot take our eyes off the prize here. It would be irresponsible of us, as well as morally very difficult, to turn your back on a community fighting ISIL, as hard as it is, at this particular moment.” ISIL is one of several acronyms for the Islamic State.

For its part, the main Syrian Kurdish party, the Kurdish Democratic Union (PYD), is wary that its power could be undermined by allowing the more politically connected Iraqi Kurds, who maintain close ties with the West and relatively good relations with Turkey, to join their fight.

Idriss Nasaan, a spokesman for the Kobane Kurds, said the Iraqi Kurdish fighters will be welcome only if they “agree to fight under the command” of the local leadership.

Kerry acknowledged that the fighters in Kobane “are an offshoot group of the folks that our friends, the Turks, oppose.” But, he said, “they are valiantly fighting ISIL.”

As recently as last week, the Obama administration said that control of Kobane was not a “strategic” objective for U.S.-led forces conducting airstrikes against the Islamic State and that operations there were humanitarian in nature. But with militant forces surging toward the town, U.S. commanders have also stepped up airstrikes.

American warplanes have now struck the area around Kobane more than 135 times, far more than any other location since strikes began in Syria at the beginning of this month. Those strikes continued Monday, including one that the U.S. Central Command said blasted a “stray” shipment from the American airdrop to prevent “these supplies from falling into enemy hands.”

The administration has said repeatedly that airstrikes are not enough and that defeating the Islamic State will depend on local ground forces in Syria and Iraq.

Turkey had tentatively agreed late last week to allow the Iraqi Kurdish fighters, called pesh merga, to travel to Kobane. The deal was nearly upset, however, when U.S. officials publicly acknowledged that they had held direct talks with representatives of the Syrian Kurds.

Share this article Share

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters Saturday that he considered the Syrian PYD ""the same as the PKK, and that is a terrorist organization."" Referring to reports that the United States was considering sending arms directly to the Syrian Kurdish fighters, Erdogan said that ""it would be wrong"" to expect full Turkish participation in the coalition against the Islamic State ""if a friendly country and a NATO ally like the U.S. openly admits such support for a terrorist organization.""

But when the situation in Kobane worsened, the administration feared that the town would be lost to the militants before any deal could be implemented.

Under a barrage of Islamic State mortar fire over the weekend, the Kobane defenders warned that they were nearly out of ammunition, according to senior administration officials. The Pentagon told the White House it could drop emergency supplies into the town, amid administration concern that the Turks would back out.

Turkey’s agreement stood, however, after Obama called Erdogan late Saturday to tell him that the planned airdrop was an emergency measure only and did not constitute a change in U.S. policy. Officials said the arms themselves had come from the Iraqi Kurds and were not “U.S.-produced” weapons.

The primary weapon used by the pesh merga is the Russian-made AK-47 assault rifle, and the United States previously arranged for Albania and other former

Soviet-bloc countries that are now part of NATO to provide those fighters with additional supplies. The airdrops to the Syrian Kurds, who also use AK-47s, came from those Albanian shipments, said a senior U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide information beyond that included in official statements.

Early Monday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the pesh merga would be allowed to cross into Kobane. “We never wanted Kobane to fall,” Cavusoglu told reporters in the Turkish capital, Ankara.

Although Turkish media reported that the movement of the Iraqi forces into Kobane had already begun, U.S. officials said they expected the next 24 hours to be decisive in reaching a firm agreement among all parties, including the Syrian Kurds.

The president of Iraq's Kurdish region, Massoud Barzani, ordered pesh merga units ""to be deployed in Kobane in the next 48 hours via Turkey,"" according to a Monday statement sent via Twitter by Hemin Hawrami, the foreign relations chief of Barzani's ruling political party.

Turkey also has tried to leverage its support for the coalition effort to secure a U.S. pledge to expand its military campaign against the Islamic State into a fight against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Cavusoglu said Turkey also wants Syrian Kurds to unite against Assad and give up demands for autonomy over their region in order to receive Turkish aid.

But those longer-term concerns have clearly been overridden in recent days by events in Kobane. ""It is a crisis moment,"" Kerry said, ""an emergency where we clearly do not want to see Kobane become a horrible example of the unwillingness of people to be able to help those who are fighting ISIL."""

http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/04/opinion/castellanos-10-things-election-night/index.html?hpt=op_t1",0,"If, as widely predicted, the GOP captures the Senate in today’s elections, what difference will it make for Congress’s legislative performance in the coming two years? Gerald Seib argues that legislative agreements will become more likely since, “When power is evenly split in Washington, both parties have to temper their policies.” Jonathan Chait suggests that “the race to control the Senate is not about … passing legislation of any kind. … It is possible, though highly unlikely, that some bills will pass in the next Congress.”

How likely are such outcomes? Based on past patterns of party control and legislative performance, both of these predictions are likely wide of the mark. Still, as I explore below, it is worth probing past patterns and considering whether “this time” might be different in any notable ways.

First, there is little reason to believe that the coming Congress will be markedly more productive than recent Congresses. Using a measure from Stalemate that taps the frequency of legislative deadlock on the more salient issues of the day, the figure below compares legislative performance by party control over the postwar period. Periods of divided governments are on average more deadlocked than periods of unified control (although not measurably so of late).

Party control has mattered less over the past decade in shaping the frequency of deadlock as congressional politics has become more partisan and more ideologically charged. Still, only twice over the last quarter century has a divided Washington proven more productive than the most recent bout of unified control in 2009-10. In short, there’s little reason to expect, as Seib suggests, that the two parties will regularly put aside their differences to legislate together in the coming two years.

Second, I suspect that predictions that a GOP Senate will completely refuse to seek common ground with Democrats overestimate Republican incentives to shut down the legislative process. Even in the most recently completed Congress (2011-12), Congress and the president reached agreement on roughly a quarter of salient issues. That’s hardly a record to trumpet, but it does suggest that both parties retain some incentive to come to the bargaining table.

Advertisement

On most issues, Republicans and their party leaders are unlikely to pay a cost for refusing to negotiate. But given the need to defend Republican seats in blue states in 2016, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Republicans meet at the table over small but electorally useful issues, say on student loans or a small increase in the minimum wage.

Third, is it possible that the presidential election in 2016 will nudge the GOP to become a more constructive opposition? After four years of deadlock, will House and Senate Republicans feel compelled to show voters that they can govern? (And if compelled, will they be capable of getting senators from Susan Collins to Ted Cruz to sing from the same song sheet?) As the chart above suggests, divided governments in the run-up to a presidential election are typically more deadlocked than unified governments — but not especially so. Sometimes an approaching election raises the costs to the opposition party for refusing to negotiate over policy.

The push to legislate in 1996 after the GOP was blamed for government shutdowns that previous winter is a case in point. But other times, approaching presidential elections simply encourage the parties to bring issues, not laws, to the voters — as happened most recently in 2012. In the coming Congress, it seems doubtful that ideologically charged parties in a highly competitive electoral environment will want to share credit for big-ticket items or to share blame for unpopular legislative moves in the run-up to a contested presidential campaign.

The Fix’s Chris Cillizza breaks down how close the battle for the Senate really is. (Video: The Washington Post)

Fourth, predictions abound that “a Republican Senate would shut the door on confirmations.” The prospects of complete deadlock on executive and judicial nominations bear more careful consideration (for starters, see @Mansfield2016 here). But for now, consider again past patterns. Over the postwar period, confirmation rates for periods of unified control outpaced rates for divided control 87 to 79 percent — both high rates. Granted, a more apt analogy might be the past decade or so (before the nuclear option): 57 percent of appellate court nominees were confirmed during unified control, just 46 percent during divided governments.

My point is that even in recent periods of divided control, the opposition party has been willing to confirm roughly half of a president’s appointees to the bench — not least because such nominees are often favored candidates of opposition party senators. (And as I noted here, even after Democrats banned judicial and executive filibusters, Republican senators voted to confirm most judges even after opposing them on cloture.) This fall, for example, Obama nominated a Utah judge to a federal district court bench with the glowing support of Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.

Perhaps a Republican Senate will leave advice and consent in tatters, seeing little gain to filling seats better left open for a Republican president. Still, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Republicans leverage their majority power to continue to secure lifetime spots on the bench for judicial candidates well known back home.

Ultimately, most predictions about how Republicans will behave if they capture control of the Senate assume that Republicans’ disciplined opposition in the minority will continue to guide their party in the majority. But it’s easier to rally behind a leader when the job is solely to oppose."

But he’s as active as ever. On Tuesday, shortly after he served as grand marshal in Austin’s Veteran’s Day Parade, Overton was relaxing on the porch of his Texas home — the same house he bought when he returned from World War II (he paid $4,000 for the house, Austin Fox affiliate KTBC reported in May).

This year’s parade, Overton told The Post, was “fine, lovely beautiful. The best one I’ve seen yet.”

“It made me feel good. I appreciate everything they’re doing,” Overton said. “I had my name and age on the side of the car, and they couldn’t believe it. I was still walking and talking and riding along and everything.”

Overton used to start his days with some whiskey in his coffee, and he still adds a teaspoon from time-to-time. “It’s just like medicine,” he said. Overton smokes cigars daily, too. “I’m smoking one now,” he said from Austin.

Indeed, Overton hasn’t slowed down much and remains sharp. He still drives his old Ford pickup truck, attends church every Sunday and has been known to help to transport widows to church, according to the Austin American Statesman. And he still does yard work.

Reminder: He is 108 years old.

One. Hundred. And. Eight.

When asked the key to a long life, he said, “You have to ask God about that. He brought me here and he’s taking care of me, and nothing I can do about it.” He added: “I can talk about what he’s doing for me.”

Overton, born in 1906 in Texas, served in the Pacific Theater from 1942 to 1945 as part of the all-black 1887th Engineer Aviation Battalion.

“War’s nothing to be into,” Overton told USA Today in 2013. “You don’t want to go into the war if you don’t have to. But I had to go. I enjoyed it after I’d went and come back, but I didn’t enjoy it when I was over there. I had to do things I didn’t want to do.”

Upon returning from the war, he worked at an Austin furniture store. He told the Statesman that he first retired at age 65, but that he kept being asked to come back and was hired four more times. “I got near 100 and finally quit,” he said. “They still wanted me back.”

Last year, he traveled to Washington and got to meet President Obama, who spoke about him at an event at Arlington National Cemetery.

“When the war ended, Richard headed home to Texas to a nation bitterly divided by race,” Obama said in 2013. “And his service on the battlefield was not always matched by the respect that he deserved at home. But this veteran held his head high. He carried on and lived his life with honor and dignity.”

Overton told CNN last year: “I didn’t think there [was] gonna ever be a black president. But it finally did happen.”

The visit with Obama wasn’t Overton’s first trip to D.C.; in May 2013, he came to the nation’s capital with Honor Flight Austin, a group that brings Texas veterans to Washington. Part of that trip included a stop at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, where Richard wept.

“And the crowd that gathered around him wept, too,” Obama said last year, “to see one of the oldest living veterans of World War II bear witness to a day — to the progress of a nation — he thought might never come.’”

Overton is the cousin of the late Austin civil rights leader Volma Overton, who also served in World War II as a Marine and went on to become the longtime president of the Austin NAACP.

Although Overton may be the oldest living vet, it’s not by much: He’s only three days older than Lucy Coffey, the oldest living female vet, who joined the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps in 1943.

2162,2162,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/11/14/house-passes-keystone-xl-construction-bill/,0,"This item has been updated. The House easily passed a measure Friday authorizing construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, sending it on to the Senate where the issue is expected to come up for a vote on Tuesday. Lawmakers voted 252 to 161 to approve the project. Thirty-one Democrats, including a handful who lost reelection last week, joined with all but one Republican who voted for the bill. Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.), a renegade Republican who frequently bucks his party and top leaders, voted present.

For six years, the pipeline has been under review by the State Department, which has jurisdiction because the project crosses international borders. Democrats from energy-producing states have joined Republicans in calling for its approval. But the White House has said that President Obama will not formally weigh in until the end of an ongoing State Department review and hinted on Friday that he would veto legislation approving the project if it passes.

With Obama leaning against the project, the issue has divided Democrats, who are still reeling from elections last week that diminished their ranks on Capitol Hill.

Rep. Marc Veasey was among a bloc of Texas Democrats who voted for the project. He said in a statement that while he is conscious of environmental concerns with the project, ""creating and sustaining good paying jobs should be our highest priority in Congress.""

But other Democrats disagreed: ""The negligible economic benefit from the Keystone XL Pipeline does not justify risking America's drinking water, farmlands and tribal grounds,"" said Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.).

The issue has become a flashpoint in the closely-watched, hotly contested Louisiana Senate runoff election that will pit Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) against Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) on Dec. 6. Cassidy, a four-term congressman, placed second to Landrieu on Election Day in a multi-candidate primary, but recent polling shows him with a comfortable lead.

After clearing the House on Friday, an identical bill is set for debate and a vote as early as Tuesday in the Senate after Landrieu forced leaders this week to permit an up-or-down vote. She spent several hours on Thursday controlling Senate floor debate on the bill.

Share this article Share

The bill will require at least 60 senators in order to clear proceeding to a final vote.

Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), who wrote the original bill authorizing construction that's been debated this week in the House and Senate, said Friday that his bill has at least 57 votes -- all 45 Republicans and at least 12 Democrats.

""To build the kind of energy plan we want for this country for energy security, we’ve got to have the infrastructure to go with it,"" Hoeven said in an interview. ""We’ve got to be able to move that energy around the country. And to be able to move it around efficiently and safely, we’ve got to have pipelines -- as well as rail and trucks.""

On Friday just off the House floor, Cassidy, Landrieu opponent, nearly choked up as he described his relief that Congress is on the verge of approving the project.

""If this is what it took for us to get Keystone XL voted on in the Senate, so be it,"" he said. ""It’s a good thing – 40,000 families will have a better job, better wages, better benefits, with a ripple effect through the economy. It’s good.""

Cassidy dismissed Obama's threats to veto the legislation or to not permit its construction after the State Department review, noting that once Republicans take full control of Congress next year, ""there might be enough to override a veto.""

""But if there’s one party that’s working hard for working families, it is the Republican Party,"" he added. ""If there’s another party that thinks that climate change is a winning campaign issue and they’re going to double down on moving jobs to China, it’s their party.""

By next Tuesday, Keystone -- and all that it represents from an environmental, economic and political perspective -- might no longer be an issue in the Senate race in Louisiana. But Cassidy said there are plenty of other things to discuss."

Signing such an order would have explosive political consequences — it would not only reshape the near-term fights in Congress but also have a potentially profound effect on the two parties' national coalitions heading into the 2016 election and beyond.

Republicans have made it clear that if Obama goes forward, it would be the equivalent of giving the middle finger to their incoming majority — and, by extension, the American public, which helped the GOP gain seats in the House and Senate on Nov. 4.

At a news conference held the day after the midterm elections, Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the incoming Senate majority leader, compared Obama’s signing of an executive order on immigration to “waving a red flag in front of a bull.” House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said Obama will “burn himself” if he moves forward.

You get the idea. Republicans ain't happy — and they are likely to get a lot less happy over the next week or so. No matter what congressional response McConnell and Boehner craft — and they are undoubtedly looking at their options — the most obvious and predictable outcome of Obama's expected move on immigration is that any hope of bipartisanship on much of anything in the 114th Congress, set to convene in January, would probably be out of the question.

Obama knows that. And it would seem he doesn’t care. Or rather, he has made the calculation that the chances of genuine bipartisanship on virtually anything was so low in the first place that it didn’t make sense not to do what he believes is the right thing. The post-grand-bargain-collapse version of Obama is far less willing to extend his hand to Republicans — having, in his estimation, had it bitten so many times before. He views the “now the well is poisoned” point being made by Republicans as laughable.

Twenty-eight years ago the United States implemented a plan that offered amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. Hear from one of the architects of the bill and key players as they discuss where it went wrong. (Video: The Washington Post)

Then there is the political calculus Obama is making as it relates to his own party. His decision to postpone the signing of the executive order until after the 2014 elections was a clear bow to Democratic senators seeking reelection in Republican (or at least Republican-leaning) states, who fretted that such a move would doom their chances.

Turns out, they were doomed anyway. With Sens. Mark Pryor (Ark.), Mark Udall (Colo.) and Mark Begich (Alaska) all having lost — and Sen. Mary Landrieu (La.) headed in that direction — Obama is done waiting around. (And, yes, the fact that none of those people wanted him to campaign for them in the fall miffed him.)

With a Republican Party with which he believes he cannot deal in any meaningful way and a timid congressional Democratic Party (in his estimation), Obama’s decision is a simple one: This is good policy and, in the long term — maybe in the short term, too — good politics.

For Obama, signing an executive order such as this one — in addition to his move on Dreamers during the 2012 campaign — would cement him as the first president who succeeded in bringing the millions of people living in the shadows into the light. For someone who, rightly, sees the possibility of major legislative action on any of his priorities in the final two years of his presidency as a pipe dream, making such a move on immigration is his best/only way to build out a pillar of his second-term legacy.

This decision, given the Republicans’ strongly stated opposition to it, would also be a bit of an act of purposeful provocation on his part. And, many Democratic strategists hope/believe that conservatives in the House and Senate would react vociferously to it — and, in so doing, damage the already-not-so-great Republican brand among Hispanics (and voters more generally). Democrats — and Obama in particular — remain convinced that the 2014 elections proved nothing about how the country feels about Republicans, and that by exposing some of the elements within the Republican Party that its leaders have worked to keep quiet in recent months, they can regain the political momentum lost this month.

Longer term, the hope in Obama world is that an executive order would further cement the Democratic Party as the exclusive (or close to it) home for Hispanic voters. (An aggressive response to the Obama executive order by Republicans — particularly if it veers from talking about Obama to talking about the Latino community in a negative way — could well help that process along, too.) Democratic House candidates won the Hispanic vote 62 percent to 38 percent in 2014, according to national exit polls. That's a considerable improvement for Republicans from the 29 percent of the Latino vote that Mitt Romney got in 2012.

There is real long-term political danger here for Republicans. Remember that in the wake of Romney’s defeat, the Republican National Committee commissioned an autopsy to diagnose what went wrong — and what it needed to do to fix it. One of the central conclusions of that document was that Republicans had to be for some sort of comprehensive immigration reform to take that issue off the table for Hispanics and allow the GOP to talk to that community about other things. Here’s the relevant section of that report:

“We are not a policy committee, but among the steps Republicans take in the Hispanic community and beyond, we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party’s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only. We also believe that comprehensive immigration reform is consistent with Republican economic policies that promote job growth and opportunity for all.”"

But nobody predicted that the first legislation Congress would take up would be the Mary Landrieu Preservation Act of 2014. Landrieu, a Democratic senator from Louisiana, is struggling to keep her seat in a runoff next month, and it doesn’t look good: Republican candidates got a combined 56 percent in last week’s election.

So in a last-gasp effort — a Hail Mary, as Capitol Hill reporters were calling it — Landrieu took to the Senate floor as soon as it opened Wednesday after the long fall recess and demanded passage of one of her home state’s pet causes: the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a Republican priority that Democrats have blocked for the last several years because of environmental objections. After taking the floor, she didn’t let it go for most of the next three hours.

“I want to say yes to new majority leader Mitch McConnell,” she proclaimed. “The time to start is now.”

Landrieu made no attempt to hide her motive. “I’m going to do everything in my power here and at home on the campaign trail, where I’m still in a runoff, as you know, to get this project moving forward,” she said.

Republicans were thrilled. Just 40 minutes after Landrieu went to the Senate floor, House GOP leaders announced that they would pass the very same bill on Tuesday — and little surprise. The lead sponsor of the House version of the bill, Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), is Landrieu’s opponent in the runoff, and the move would guarantee that he would share credit (and perhaps get his name on the final bill instead of hers).

Suddenly, the full legislative force of the government has been marshaled to try to tilt the results of the Senate runoff in Louisiana. And voters thought lawmakers couldn’t get together to do what’s best for the nation?

Landrieu, upon hearing of the House’s move, exulted on the Senate floor. “They plan to pass it tomorrow! Let me just say, hallelujah! I’ll say it again: Hallelujah!”

But the exultant Landrieu had put her fellow Democrats in an awkward spot. Approval of the pipeline was likely to happen eventually, but Obama could have extracted significant concessions from the Republicans for it. Now they may be giving away that chit for nothing, to aide a colleague in a race she’s unlikely to win anyway. Even if she does, it’s the difference between a 54-to-46 Republican Senate majority and a 53-to-47 Republican Senate majority.

Republicans were ebullient, even before Landrieu's unilateral concession. McConnell rarely smiles, and when he does it often comes out a grimace, but he was beaming when he posed in his office with 10 newly elected Senate Republicans for a photo op. He used the occasion to condemn President Obama for the climate-change agreement Obama struck with China, and he continued to lecture the president when he appeared a couple of hours later on the Senate floor.

Harry Reid (D-Nev.), just dethroned as majority leader, made a resentful pledge to cooperate with the new majority. “I saw firsthand how a strategy of destruction is debilitating to our system,” he said, clearly referring to McConnell’s time in the minority. “I have no desire to engage in that manner.”

But if Reid was grudging, Landrieu was throwing herself at the Republicans, trying to save herself by pushing through the “Hoeven-Landrieu” bill she sponsored with Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.).

“It needs to get done right now. Not in January. Not in February. Not in March,” she said with the urgency of a woman facing a December runoff.

She scheduled a news conference in the Capitol basement, and three dozen reporters and cameramen came to capture the spectacle. “We will pass this in the lame duck,” she predicted.

NBC’s Kasie Hunt was skeptical. “Are you a lost cause?” she asked.

“I don’t believe I am,” Landrieu replied.

David Espo of the Associated Press asked if there’s any indication Obama would sign the bill.

“I do not have a commitment,” she acknowledged with a chuckle.

Because of Senate rules, any senator could have blocked a vote on the Keystone measure when Landrieu finally made her “unanimous consent” request Wednesday evening that the Senate vote on the bill Tuesday. Republicans, naturally, didn’t object.

What was more interesting was that Reid and leading liberals, including Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), were on the floor, but not a single Democrat objected. Apparently, if it takes a pipeline to transport Mary Landrieu back to the Senate, Democrats were willing to build it.

President Obama said in a video that he will lay out his proposal to overhaul the nation's immigration system Thursday and will travel to Las Vegas on the heels of that announcement to rally support for his initiative on Friday. ""Tomorrow night I'm going to be announcing here from the White House some steps I can take to start fixing our broken immigration system,"" Obama said in a video posted on Facebook Wednesday afternoon.

""Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken. Unfortunately Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long,"" Obama said. ""So what' I'm going to be laying out is the things I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.

According to a senior Democrat familiar with the plans, Obama will announce on Thursday that he is providing temporary protections to up to 5 million undocumented immigrants. His orders will make up to 4 million undocumented immigrants eligible for temporary protective status and provide relief to another 1 million through other means.

In a blow to activists advocating on behalf of young immigrant families, there will be no guaranteed protections for the parents of so-called “Dreamers,” -- children protected by Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program – nor for immigrant agricultural workers, said the Democrat, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

Congress will receive official details on the move Thursday, according to a senior Democratic Party official.

Obama said he will travel to Del Sol High School in Las Vegas Friday, where he will discuss and rally support for his plan.

Advocates began readying events to promote the administration’s immigration policy.

“We hear there will be a prime time Thursday evening announcement (to preview) and full unveiling in Vegas on Friday,” immigration advocate Dawn Le told other activists in an e-mail, which was later inadvertently sent to a group of reporters Wednesday morning. “Can folks begin to work and plan watch parties for Thursday and/or Friday? Unclear whether Thursday night content will be what is ""celebratory,"" but Friday will be where we need a lot of energy guaranteed.”

Obama launched his push for immigration reform in January 2013 in Las Vegas, outlining a plan that would allow many of the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants to earn citizenship.

The president's decision to speak at the city's Del Sol High School highlights the administration's intensified push to convince Latinos that the Democratic Party is committed to addressing the dilemma of millions of undocumented immigrants. Obama is preparing to use his executive authority to expand temporary protections to millions of these individuals, as well as to broaden visa programs for highly skilled technology workers and perhaps also stiffen security along the U.S.-Mexico border.

During an appearance at the National Press Club Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Obama will announce ""in the coming days ... [a] set of comprehensive reforms, within our existing legal authorities, to fix our broken immigration system.""

He did not specify the actions Obama will take but did say they will include steps to further secure the southwestern border of the United States. Administration lawyers have concluded that executive action on the issue is legal and within the president's authority, he said, despite intense opposition from Republicans.

""Legislative action is always preferable,"" Johnson said. ""But we have waited for Congress to act, and the Congress has not acted. The president has waited.""

Share this article Share

Johnson said the administration has concluded it has ""wide latitude"" to take action. ""It can't be that we're not allowed to lift a finger to fix our broken immigration system,"" he said. ""And we will.""

Congressional Republicans have warned Obama that he risks undermining the prospects for cooperation on legislation in the final two years of his presidency if he takes action on immigration.

The decision to speak in Las Vegas could also bolster the political standing of Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who said in an interview with Univision on Tuesday that when it came to expanding protections for undocumented immigrants, ""I think it should be done now.""

Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, wrote in an e-mail that even as Obama acted on his own to break the stalemate on the issue, Republicans would still have a chance to legislate.

“While executive action is not ideal, it accomplishes four things: Stabilizes our workforce, prioritizes law enforcement, protects families and puts congressional Republicans in the driver’s seat going into 2015,"" Noorani wrote. ""They have an incredible opportunity to get credit for fixing America’s immigration system.”

With Obama likely on the verge of making an announcement, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the soon-to-be majority leader, expressed confidence Wednesday that congressional Republicans will extend funding for the federal government, which is set to expire next month, even if the president moves to overhaul the immigration system and some conservatives call for a spending showdown.

But in a sign that GOP strategy is still being formulated, McConnell did not specify the framework and length of possible funding legislation. Republican leaders in the House and Senate are still mulling a variety of options, all while hoping to avoid a politically damaging shutdown.

“We have two goals here at the end of the session: fund the government and avoid retroactive tax increases. I’m confident that we’ll do both,” McConnell said in a brief exchange at the U.S. Capitol.

Other congressional Republicans warned again that Obama risks his relationship with a GOP-controlled Capitol Hill if he acts.

“If ‘Emperor Obama’ ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his Constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for Congressional action on this issue -- and many others,” Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), said in an e-mail.

In an effort to cast doubts on the legality of Obama’s decision, GOP aides have been circulating a list of 22 times the president has said publicly that he doesn’t believe he has the authority to act through executive action to change immigration laws.

At least three students were wounded, one critically.

Tallahassee police identified the gunman as Myron May, an FSU graduate who later attended law school at Texas Tech University.

*FSU ALERT!* Dangerous Situation! Main Campus – Tallahassee,” read a message about 12:30 a.m. posted by FSU’s emergency alert system. “Seek shelter immediately, away from doors and windows.”

Students huddled in the rows of books. Others barricaded themselves in rooms — some leaving their cell phone video running along the way to record the scene of the latest shooting at a U.S. university.

One wounded student was seen crying out — “I’ve been shot” — and clutching his leg as blood spread over his pants.

‘Chaos’ at Florida State University + 15 A Tallahassee community works to come to terms with the shooting on campus.

The gunman was killed by Tallahassee police after he opened fire on officers fr0m an access ramp outside the Strozier Library, filled with at least 300 students studying for end-of-semester exams.

“He was challenged by the officers and given commands to drop his weapon, but the male fired at the officers,” said a police statement. “The officers returned fire, killing the gunman.”

One of those wounded was grazed by a bullet and treated at the scene. The others were taken to Tallahassee Memorial HeathCare hospital. One was listed in critical condition and the other was stable, the AP reported.

By 4:15 a.m., the all clear message was issued for the school, where classes were canceled Thursday and police continued with interviews and investigations. The gunman was slumped face down. A gray baseball cap lay near his head.

Tallahassee’s police chief, Michael DeLeo, described it as an “isolated incident and one person acting alone.” But he offered no additional details of the gunman or possible motives during a predawn news conference.

“This person for whatever reason produced a handgun and then began shooting students in the library,” Florida State University Police Chief David Perry told reporters at a morning news conference.

Beyond the identity of the assailant, other major questions loom including how did he enter the library with a weapon and were campus security measures sufficient.

“It was a consecutive bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,” said FSU freshman Nikolai Hernandez, who was in his dorm room across from the library.

The school’s newspaper, FS View, reported the gunman opened fire around 12:30 a.m. Student Alexandra Magoulas was about 50 feet from the lobby of the library when she heard the shots, she told the paper.

“People immediately started running and screaming and running to the stairwells and to the edges of the room against walls,” she said. “It was chaos.”

“It seemed to take students and faculty at least that I’ve heard by complete surprise,” Matthew Paskert, photo editor of the student paper, told The Washington Post. “No one expected this to ever happen here. You see it happen at other schools.”

“We are too frequently and too often waking up to incidences like this around the country,” said Tallahassee’s mayor-elect, Andrew Gillum. Similar comments were made by officials last month on the other side of the country after a 15-year-old student opened fire in the cafeteria of a high school near Seattle. Three students were killed and a fourth later died from injuries. The teen gunman killed himself at the scene. Strozier is the university’s largest library, Perry Kostidakis, editor of the student newspaper, told CNN. “It’s not unusual for 100 students to be there this time of year,” he said, as finals are fast approaching. The shooting was described on Twitter."

Obama went to Nevada on Friday to begin what the White House described as a “very aggressive” effort to promote the changes but also to chide his Republican critics for opposing immigration reform.

“We’re not a nation that kicks out strivers and dreamers who want to earn their piece of the American dream,” Obama said. “We didn’t raise the Statue of Liberty with her back to the world. We did it with her light shining.”

Back in Washington, Republicans were launching their own assaults, announcing that the House GOP had filed a lawsuit challenging the implementation of the 2010 health-care law and promising to turn back the immigration effort.

“We’re working with our members and looking at the options available to us,” said House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), “but I will say to you the House will, in fact, act.”

In what was clearly a coordinated campaign against what Republicans have labeled as Obama's ""imperial presidency,"" Boehner announced the filing of the lawsuit minutes after he denounced Obama's executive action on immigration.

The suit, which was approved by House Republicans four months ago, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. It will be led by Jonathan Turley, a law professor at the George Washington University Law School, who is the third legal adviser to handle the case. In recent weeks, some Republicans have pushed for including the immigration order in the lawsuit against the president. Instead, Boehner promised action in the House to counter Obama's plans.

“The House has an obligation to stand up for the Constitution, and that is exactly why we are pursuing this course of action.”

Obama launched his own persuasion campaign at a high school in Las Vegas where he had issued a call for immigration reform shortly after the start of his second term.

""Nearly two years ago, I came here, Del Sol High School, right in this gymnasium . . . and I said that the time had come for Congress to fix our broken immigration system,"" he said. Obama argued that lack of action by the GOP House is what forced his hand on taking unilateral action.

“The fact that a year and a half has gone by means that time has been wasted,” Obama said. “And during that time, families have been separated. And during that time, businesses have been harmed. And we can’t afford it anymore.”

Earlier on Friday, White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said that the president’s Las Vegas appearance should be read as the start of a “very aggressive sales job” on behalf of his policy changes.

Speaker of the House John Boehner criticized the president's plan for immigration reform the day after he announced it, saying that President Obama is making it ""virtually impossible"" to work in a bipartisan fashion. (Video: AP)

The president will also make his case on weekend television in an interview on ABC'S ""This Week"" and in a Chicago address on Tuesday. The White House's sales job will include presidential speeches, interviews and appearances by Cabinet officials. Pfeiffer also said the White House's efforts would be built around a heavy digital effort, previewed before Obama's Thursday night speech in a video on Facebook, which drew more than 3.5 million views, according to Pfeiffer. ""Our big focus [initially] was the digital audience,"" he said. ""We are going to use all the tools at our disposal.""

Pfeiffer said Obama would challenge critics of his executive action to pass legislation permanently reforming the immigration system, while at the same time making the moral case of deferring the deportations of millions of undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.

“There’s no reward for the meek here,” Pfeiffer said.

Share this article Share

The Republican response to Obama was anything but meek.

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a leading opponent of the president’s action and the likely incoming chairman of the budget committee, accused Obama of refusing to enforce the law and promised to use budgetary measures to prevent funding for the implementation of the new immigration rules.

Speaking Friday at the Heritage Foundation, Sessions said such action was necessary because Obama “granted amnesty to 5 million people, and he did it by basically saying, ‘I’m not going to enforce the laws of the United States of America.’

“He ignored the interests of the American people, the American workers, recent immigrants who have been here and are looking for jobs in a time of unemployment. He undermined, in my view, the moral integrity of immigration law. And even the constitutional separation of powers. You have to have integrity and consistency in law enforcement if you want to be able to defend what you have done.”

Sessions is leading the effort to keep government funding on a short leash in the new year, when Republicans take over the Senate and control both chambers of Congress, making it easier to get clear majorities for his preferred line of attack.

Sessions dismissed the immigration reform bill the Senate passed last year, saying: “Politicians will pass anything that sounds good about immigration as long as it doesn’t change anything, as long as it won’t work.”

But there are those in the GOP who worry that the anger may be playing into the president’s hands.

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said in an interview Friday that a growing group of Senate Republicans is coalescing around a more tempered rebuttal to the president: passing a series of standalone immigration bills in the coming months and demonstrating to voters that the party can govern.

“Put legislation on the president’s desk,” Flake said. “We could do bills on border security, interior enforcement, mandatory E-Verify, and address high-tech workers and guest workers.”

Flake said that there are limits to the idea of using appropriations legislation as a vehicle for GOP ultimatums or blocking the president’s federal nominees.

“It’d be a political disaster to flirt with a government shutdown,” Flake said. “In the Senate, I don’t think we’ll go there, and I hope the House does not go there. There are always temptations, but I know the leadership doesn’t want that.” On blocking nominees, “That’s not the way to go, either. You play into the Democrats’ hands.”

Limiting funding would require a 60-vote supermajority in the Senate, and it would almost certainly draw a veto from Obama, which, critics say, would lead to a possible shutdown of some federal agencies.

Boehner declined to spell out exactly how Republicans would counter the immigration executive action, which extends protections to roughly 4 million undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, as well as young immigrants brought here illegally when they were children.

Later in the day, the House Homeland Security Committee announced plans to hold a hearing in response to Obama’s executive action. The panel said it will meet Dec. 3 to hear testimony from Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, who helped formulate Obama’s plans and deeply explored the legal justifications for the president’s actions.

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), who chairs the panel and has worked for several years on

border-security matters, said he plans to use ""every tool at my disposal to stop the president's unconstitutional actions from being implemented, starting with this oversight hearing.""

Obama essentially blamed Boehner for not allowing an immigration bill to come to the House floor.

“I cajoled and I called and I met. I told John Boehner, I’ll wash your car, I’ll walk your dog — whatever you need to do, just call the bill. That’s how democracy is supposed to work. And if the votes hadn’t been there, then we would have had to start over. But at least give it a shot — and he didn’t do it.”

A Boehner spokesman said that the speaker does not have a dog."

Landrieu, reduced to a relatively pointless gambit to demonstrate her clout in Washington, failed to secure the 60 votes required to move forward with the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. She came up one vote shy.

This was basically Landrieu's final play. With no party funding for her campaign, she has been drubbed on the airwaves -- as in, exponentially so. And even before that, few gave her much hope in her runoff with Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.).

So in a last-ditch effort to move the needle, she launched the Keystone campaign. Nevermind that the very same bill will probably pass with ease once Republicans take control of the Senate in January. She wanted to prove she could make it happen two months earlier -- because why not.

And Senate Democrats -- who, again, have abandoned her financially -- have now abandoned her in spirit too. The vote wasn't just meaningless because Republicans will pass the bill come next year; it was also meaningless because the White House has basically said it would veto the bill, as the State Department is still reviewing the project.

And despite all of it -- despite the whole dog-and-pony show of the past week -- Democrats couldn't even give Landrieu enough votes to breathe a little life (hypothetically, at least) into her long-shot campaign.

Bloomberg declared last week that Democrats had left ""a body on the campaign trail.""

On Tuesday, with Landrieu's assistance, they metaphorically ran over the body with a truck."

http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/conservatives-scoff-at-boehner-deal-113280.html?hp=l1_3",0,"Recent success at the polls has done little to calm the internal rancor among congressional Republicans, who remain deeply divided over how to respond to President Obama's overhaul of the nation's immigration system. The latest evidence came Tuesday as House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) unveiled plans to avoid another government shutdown while also allowing furious Republicans a chance to publicly repudiate Obama for acting on his own.

The hybrid approach is a telling example of how Republicans are likely to lead Congress next year: with anger toward Obama, who they believe has abused the powers of his office, while remaining wary of their own potential for overreach.

Boehner’s approach would first allow a vote this week on a bill to ban Obama from changing immigration laws. The largely symbolic legislation would be quickly discarded by the Democratic-controlled Senate, but the vote would be seen as a victory by some tea party conservatives, including the bill’s lead sponsor, Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.).

Advertisement

The speaker’s decision to embrace Yoho’s bill is a signal to conservatives that he is looking to one of their own as he plots his immigration gambit. Even though Boehner faces no serious challenge for the speaker’s gavel when the new Congress convenes next year, he is aware of the need to keep conservatives aligned with him on immigration or risk another revolt within his ranks.

Yoho has been promoting the idea of impeaching Obama more than almost any other House Republican, and he voted against Boehner in the election for speaker two years ago. But Tuesday he discounted suggestions that Boehner’s decision to bring him into the mix was a symbolic gesture designed to reassure conservatives.

“I don’t think so,” Yoho told reporters. “[Boehner] said this was a good bill, and they’re going to bring it up.”

Advertisement

Once Yoho’s bill is approved, the House would vote by next week to fund most government agencies through the end of the fiscal year next September. The one exception would be the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for the enforcement of immigration laws. DHS would be funded for a shorter period, but that time frame had not been determined as of Tuesday, aides said. The approach was introduced by Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), the incoming Budget Committee chairman, who is well regarded by fellow conservatives. He and other Republicans believe that the shorter timetable would give GOP lawmakers time to find ways to chip away at Obama’s executive actions.

But Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson warned Republicans on Tuesday that incrementally funding his department would risk the nation’s security and his ability to enforce current immigration laws. Johnson clashed with GOP lawmakers Tuesday over Obama’s actions during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing in which he asserted the president’s right to defer deportations.

“The reality is that, for decades, presidents have used executive authority to enhance immigration policy,” Johnson told the committee.

Whether Congress can escape the lame-duck session without a government shutdown is the first major test for Boehner and incoming Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). As they have several times in the past, the leaders will need to grapple with the many competing blocs in their conferences and build a cross-chamber consensus in order to get the government funded, even for a short time. They will also need to be alert for any potential cracks in GOP support for a funding bill; the deadline is just over a week away, and they can expect no help from Democrats.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) warned Tuesday that Republicans should not expect Democratic votes for bills that provide only short-term funding for immigration programs, leaving Boehner little room for error as he counts votes.

But Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) seemed open to the House plan.

“That would be a big accomplishment if we could get a bill over here that would fund all the appropriations subcommittees except for one,” he said. “I think it’s kind of unfortunate that they’re talking about not doing Homeland Security, but that’s the way it is.”

Some other conservatives want Boehner to be more aggressive.

Late Tuesday, Rep. Paul C. Broun (R-Ga.) called for Boehner to not invite Obama to deliver the State of the Union address next year. Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) suggested that the budgets for White House operations, including for Air Force One, should be decreased. Other conservatives have mentioned censuring the president, impeaching him or suing the administration over its immigration actions.

“I’d rather defund Air Force One,” Huelskamp said. “Congress took a 19 percent cut on its budgets — we should do the same for the White House.” On the State of the Union, he added: “In the spirit of George Washington, he could send it to us in writing. It’d save some time.”

Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) warned his colleagues during a closed-door meeting Tuesday that they could be “accessories” to the president if they fund federal immigration agencies, according to several lawmakers present.

King told reporters that any funding for immigration makes Republicans part of the problem. “If we go forward, they’re asking members to vote to fund that in the short term, and then promising that we will fight in the longer term when we have a majority in the United States Senate,” he said. “I don’t want that red herring to be dragged across in front of us. We have to fight.”

King's argument has been echoed in the Senate by Sen Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who has pitched cutting funds for immigration programs unless the president relents and using spending bills as leverage in winning Democratic concessions.

But potential Republican presidential candidates, concerned about the political consequences of another showdown between the White House and Capitol Hill, are also keeping close watch and asking their congressional brethren to move forward prudently.

At a luncheon Monday on Capitol Hill, former Florida governor Jeb Bush told a group of GOP officials and donors, including McConnell and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), that the party should avoid a funding standoff.

Instead, Bush said in brief remarks, Republicans should pass a series of “sensible” immigration bills next year to underscore their commitment to governing and reforming the immigration system.

Bush also argued that this post-election moment was an ideal setting for Republicans to better promote their ideas on energy, education and the economy, and he said he hoped that those issues would not be overshadowed.

""It was a mature pitch,"" said Bush ally Dan Meyer, a former legislative-affairs adviser in the George W. Bush White House. ""He was serious about the importance of leading responsibly.""

The meeting at the National Republican Senatorial Committee's headquarters was a fundraiser for Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who is campaigning against Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) in a runoff scheduled for Saturday.

Separately, Heritage Action chief executive Mike Needham warned that conservative activists — especially “our 10,000 sentinels” who follow Congress closely — will rally to defund immigration programs in the coming days, shrugging off the advice coming from the party’s establishment."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/16/world/asia/pakistan-peshawar-school-attack/index.html?hpt=hp_t1",0,"The bloody siege of an elite army high school Tuesday by Taliban gunmen, which killed at least 141 students and teachers, was an apparent retaliation for a major recent army operation after years of ambivalent policies toward the homegrown Islamist militants. The mass targeting of children, in a military zone in the northwestern city of Peshawar, drew condemnation from around the world, as well as from across Pakistan’s political and religious spectrums — a rare display of unity in a country where Islamist violence is often quietly accepted and sometimes defended. The attack was also condemned by Taliban leaders in Afghanistan.

Some analysts suggested that after years of suicide bombings and attacks on markets, mosques, hotels and military bases, the insurgents had finally gone too far, and that widespread public outrage over this attack might signal a decisive turn in the nation’s — and the government’s — reluctance to fully take on the Taliban.

The massacre was the most intimate assault ever against Pakistan's military, the nation's most respected and powerful institution. The only comparable incident was in December 2009, when a small group of assailants penetrated army headquarters in the garrison city of Rawalpindi and killed more than 30 people praying at an army mosque.

The death toll Tuesday also rivaled one of the highest in Pakistan in recent years, when suicide bombings in 2007 killed about 150 people in Karachi during celebrations to welcome former prime minister Benazir Bhutto back to Pakistan after years in self-exile. Bhutto was assassinated soon after.

Yet even when previous attacks have drawn strong condemnation and vows of action from military officials, Pakistan’s military and intelligence establishment has remained deeply ambivalent about taking on the domestic Islamist forces and has often been accused of playing a double game in its partnership with the West in the war on terrorism.

One chief reason is that such extremist groups have long acted as proxies in Pakistan’s rivalry with India, an issue that trumps all others for Pakistan’s security leaders and that has long been seen as a far greater threat than Islamist militants. Terrorist attacks are routinely decried as the work of unknown foreign hands.

Pakistan’s civilian leaders, for their part, have long deferred to the army in security and foreign policy, and they have also been reluctant to act against Islamist violence, for fear of alienating the nation’s deeply religious Muslim masses and organized groups.

“Despite this national tragedy, I don’t see any chance of the nation as a whole building an anti-terrorism narrative,” said Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao, a veteran Pakistani legislator from the northwest.

He noted that a variety of religious and political leaders have “deep sympathy” for the militants.

“For now they may tone down their support,” he said, but in time they will “start showing their true colors again.”

The army, however, has always been carefully attuned to public opinion, and Tuesday’s attack provoked a remarkably swift, broad and emphatic outpouring of revulsion and anger. News channels showed grim scenes of dead children in hospital beds, many still wearing green school uniforms, and of weeping mourners carrying hastily made pine coffins out of hospitals in Peshawar.

“Today is the saddest day of the history of our nation,” said Haniyah Siddiqui, 18, who was shopping in the port city of Karachi. “It is high time to make up our mind to fight terrorists and eliminate them in toto, not just mourning or condemning the tragic incident.”

‘Cowardly act’

Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who rushed to Peshawar, denounced the assault as a “cowardly act” and vowed to maintain military action “until the menace of terrorism is eliminated” from Pakistan. “The nation needs to get united and face terrorism,” he added. “We need unflinching resolve against this plague.”

Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager and Taliban attack survivor who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize for promoting girls' education, said from England that she was ""heartbroken"" by ""these atrocious and cowardly acts"" but vowed that even as she and millions mourn the students' deaths, ""we will never be defeated.""

Her denunciation was echoed by Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, the leader of Pakistan's Jamaat-ud-Dawa Islamist movement, whose followers were blamed for a 2008 terrorist siege on the Indian city of Mumbai. Saeed said the attack was ""carried out by the enemies of Islam. It is open terrorism. . . . These are barbarians operating under the name of jihad.""

Even the Afghan Taliban, which operates separately from the Pakistani group but shares a religious agenda, took the unusual step of indirectly condemning the attack. A statement from spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said, “The intentional killing of innocent people, women and children are against the basics of Islam, and this criterion must be considered by every Islamic party and government.”

The Pakistani Taliban quickly asserted responsibility for the attack, saying it was to avenge Pakistan's sweeping military operation in June in North Waziristan, part of a tribal region that straddles the Pakistan-

Afghanistan border. The group had been warning for months that it would take revenge.

Hasan Askari Rizvi, a military analyst, said the attack was “unprecedented,” even in a country that has experienced thousands of terrorist attacks over the past decade. He said the Taliban appears to be growing more desperate as the military operations continue.

“Now they are attacking the soft targets,” Rizvi said.

But Mohammad Khorasani, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, said the attack was “a gift for those who thought they have crushed us in their so-called military operation in North Waziristan.” He said such opponents were “always wrong about our capabilities. We are still able to carry out major attacks, and today was just the trailer.”

In a statement, the group said six militants, including three suicide bombers, carried out the assault. After a gun battle that lasted nearly nine hours, Pakistani police officials said a total of seven militants had been killed.

An army spokesman, Maj. Gen. Asim Bajwa, said the attackers sought “to inflict maximum harm” and took no hostages. Hundreds of people were also wounded as classrooms erupted in chaos and carnage, with students and teachers shot point-blank.

‘My dream has been killed’

The school, while open to the public, is funded by Pakistan’s army, and many students are children of military personnel based in Peshawar.

“My son was in uniform in the morning. He is in a casket now,” wailed one father, Tahir Ali, as he collected the body of his 14-year-old son, Abdullah, according to the Associated Press. “My son was my dream. My dream has been killed.”

Pervaiz Khattak, chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said the Taliban attackers started “indiscriminate firing” after entering the school through a back door. The first students targeted were gathered in the auditorium to receive first-aid training, police said.

Muhammad Harris, 16, said he was in a room with 30 students and four teachers when they heard a commotion in the hall. The students said some of the attackers appeared to be speaking Arabic.

“Our female teacher went outside when we heard the firing and was shot dead,” Harris said. “One attacker was crying, ‘Help me, I am injured.’ But he was not and was trying to trap us and shoot us.”

Dozens of relatives, desperate for information about missing students, tried to reach the school on foot but were pushed back by a cordon of military guards as emergency and security vehicles rushed by. Some relatives shouted angrily; others milled about in distress.

One man looking for his nephew, an eighth-grader named Walid, said he had searched through the emergency wards and the morgue at Lady Reading Hospital, where many victims of the attack were taken.

“I saw all of the patients and all of the dead,” said Hameed Mohammed, 38. “There was no sign of him.”

As darkness fell, families were still waiting at the roadblock and the military school compound was shrouded in fog. From a distance, men with flashlights could be seen, searching slowly from room to room."

http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/congress-cuba-reaction-113654.html?hp=t1_r",0,"President Obama’s surprising move toward normalizing relations with Cuba amounts to a big bet that the nation — and, particularly, the crucial swing state of Florida — has turned a political corner from the Cold War era. Obama's decision aligns with a growing sentiment that current Cuba policy has become counterproductive. Among those making that argument has been former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumed front-

runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, who said the new stance has the potential to ""encourage real and lasting reforms for the Cuban people.""

But the new stance immediately came under challenge. Many leading Republicans — and one Democratic senator — denounced the president as feckless, overreaching and naive in his negotiations with the government of Presi­dent Raúl Castro, the brother of longtime Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

“This entire policy shift announced today is based on an illusion, on a lie, the lie and the illusion that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for the Cuban people,” said Sen. ­Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is considering a presidential bid and whose parents emigrated from Cuba in the 1950s. “All this is going to do is give the Castro regime, which controls every aspect of Cuban life, the opportunity to manipulate these changes to perpetuate itself in power.”

Former Florida governor Jeb Bush — considered the GOP’s 2016 front-runner after announcing an exploratory bid Tuesday — had called for strengthening the embargo against Cuba as recently as two weeks ago.

In less than two minutes, here are the key moments from President Obama's speech about changes to relations with Cuba on Wednesday. (Video: Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)

On his Facebook page Wednesday, Bush wrote that the administration’s decision to restore diplomatic ties with Cuba is “the latest foreign policy misstep by this President, and another dramatic overreach of his executive authority. It undermines America’s credibility and undermines the quest for a free and democratic Cuba.”

Among other possible Republican 2016 presidential candidates, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin criticized Obama on Cuba, while Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and several others were ­quiet.

The bulk of the GOP comments suggested that, for now at least, the conservative base remains firmly committed to keeping relations with Cuba in the deep-freeze where they have been for half a century. That position, however, is increasingly at odds with the view of the electorate at large.

More than a decade ago, polls began showing a tilt in public sentiment toward normalizing ties with the island 90 miles from the tip of Key West, Fla. In 2009, a Washington Post-ABC News survey found that two-thirds of Americans supported restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba, while only 27 percent opposed doing so.

The old ideological and economic battle lines have also been fading on the ground. Even as a trade embargo has remained in place, nearly 600,000 U.S. travelers went to Cuba last year — the majority of them Cuban Americans. Business interests have pushed for more openness, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce pledged its support for Obama's decision.

“Public opinion in Florida and in the country is moving to moderation on Cuba, and Obama is effectively using his political capital to make a long-anticipated shift that history and the U.S. public will support,” Ted Piccone, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution’s Latin America Initiative, wrote in an e-mail from Havana.

Although the Cuban American population has long been identified with the Republican Party, that allegiance also has shifted. The change is largely generational, with those two or three generations removed from the ones who fled Castro's regime in the 1950s and 1960s more open to voting Democratic.

View Graphic More than 50 years after the U.S.-imposed embargo, President Obama has announced an effort to normalize ties with Cuba.

In 2012, Obama won the vote of Cuban Americans nationally by two percentage points and took a majority of their votes in Miami. He also won Florida twice — the second time after loosening some travel and other restrictions involving Cuba in his first term.

But Republican political consultant Alex Castellanos said Obama’s latest initiative will add fuel to arguments that he has lacked steadiness and strength in international relations, potentially elevating foreign policy as an issue in 2016.

“Weakness invites the wolves,” Castellanos said. “This is a president whose naivete is dangerous, who sees the world as he wishes it were and not as it is.”

As recently as the mid-1990s, the conventional wisdom was that no presidential candidate could hope to carry Florida unless he took a hard line on Cuba.

Former president Bill Clinton recalled in his memoir, “My Life,” that after Cuba shot down two civilian planes flown by an anti-Castro group, he signed the 1996 Helms-Burton Act stiffening the embargo, even though he had misgivings about the effect it would have on his ability to press the Cuban government for reform.

Now his wife, Hillary, is considered the leading contender for the 2016 Democratic nomination if she decides to run.

Cuba’s release of Alan Gross, a U.S. Agency for International Development contractor who was imprisoned for five years, was the achievement of a goal that Clinton had sought in public and in private during her tenure at the State Department.

In a statement Wednesday, Clinton said, ""I am deeply relieved by Alan Gross's safe return to the United States. . . . It is great news that Alan is finally home with his family, where he belongs.""

In her memoir, ""Hard Choices,"" released in June, Clinton blamed the Cuban government for making the case so difficult to resolve.

""It is possible that hard liners within the regime exploited the Gross case as an opportunity to put the brakes on any possible rapprochement with the United States and the domestic reforms that would require,"" she wrote.

Clinton's statement Wednesday also said, ""I support President Obama's decision to change course on Cuba policy, while keeping the focus on our principal objective — supporting the aspirations of the Cuban people for freedom.""

She said: “Despite good intentions, our decades-long policy of isolation has only strengthened the Castro regime’s grip on power. As I have said, the best way to bring change to Cuba is to expose its people to the values, information, and material comforts of the outside world.”

In ""Hard Choices,"" Clinton wrote that she had recommended to Obama that he review the embargo.

""It wasn't achieving its goals and it was holding back our broader agenda across Latin America,"" Clinton wrote. ""After twenty years of observing and dealing with the U.S.-Cuba relationship, I thought we should shift the onus onto the Castros to explain why they remained undemocratic and abusive.""

The work of opening diplomatic and economic ties severed for more than 53 years will probably carry into the next presidency, particularly if the Republican-led Congress ties up the most meaningful ele­ments of an embargo repeal.

Only a few Democrats signaled disagreement with Obama’s decision. Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a longtime hawk on Cuba policy, said the president’s move was “misguided and fails to understand the nature of the ­regime in Cuba that has exerted its authoritarian control over the Cuban people for 55 years.”

Former Florida governor and senator Bob Graham, a revered elder in state Democratic politics, also expressed misgivings. He said in an interview that he would have preferred moving toward normalizing relations “on a more incremental basis.” The administration “went for the long play” instead, he said."

The legislation is expected to pass in the coming days and will allow the incoming Republican-controlled Congress to clear the decks of lingering spending issues while setting the stage for a prolonged fight with President Obama over immigration policy.

At 1,603 pages, the bill includes at least $1.2 billion for agencies to deal with the influx of unaccompanied immigrant children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. There’s also money to fight the rise of the Islamic State and $5.4 billion to fight the threat of Ebola. But there are also significant changes to campaign finance laws and potential cuts to retiree pension plans. Democrats were cheering bigger budgets for enforcement at agencies created after the 2008 economic collapse.

House leaders are planning to introduce a stopgap bill to give the House and Senate a few more days to pass the final measure and avoid a government shutdown Thursday night. Extending current funding for a short period has happened before, but doing so this year will provide an embarrassing climax to one of the most fruitless congressional sessions in history.

“There’s no reason the government should shut down,” said Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). “And we’re ready to pass a year-long spending bill to take care of this.”

John Thune (S.D.), the third-ranking Republican senator, joked that last-minute drama with the spending plan “is a Christmas tradition.” But, he added, “I don’t see it getting derailed. I think it could get slowed down, but I think it will ultimately get across the finish line.”

The White House had not indicated by late Tuesday whether it supported the bill.

The agreement hews to spending caps that lawmakers and the White House agreed to last year. It includes $521 billion in military spending and $492 billion for other federal agencies. An additional $64 billion would be set aside for overseas military operations, including the fight against the Islamic State and to assist European countries facing Russian aggression.

The legislation would provide full funding for 11 of the 12 appropriations bills Congress is supposed to pass each year. But Republicans insisted on a shorter funding schedule for the Department of Homeland Security, which has jurisdiction over immigration enforcement. The sprawling department will get money only through February, giving Republicans more time to craft a legislative response to Obama's decision to use his executive authority to change immigration policy.

But federal dollars also would be spread to other agencies to help address the rise in immigration, which is likely to infuriate conservative lawmakers seeking to cut funding for immigration programs.

The Department of Health and Human Services would receive $948 million to provide health and education services to the unaccompanied children — an $80 million increase. An additional $14 million would be provided to help school districts dealing with an influx of immigrant students. And the State Department would receive $260 million to aid the Central American countries where most of the young migrants are coming from.

Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) and Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), who led the talks as leaders of the Senate and House appropriations committees, called the bill a fair deal.

“While not everyone got everything they wanted, such compromises must be made in a divided government,” they said in a statement.

The bill is packed with policy instructions, called “riders,” that were the subject of months of discussions between Democrats and Republicans.

One of the most notable changes includes dramatically expanding the amount of money that wealthy political donors could give the national parties, drastically undercutting the 2002 landmark McCain-Feingold campaign finance overhaul. Top donors would be allowed to give three times the annual cap on national party donations to three additional party committees set up for the purposes of the presidential conventions, building expenses and election recounts.

For the first time, Congress also would allow the benefits of current retirees to be severely cut, part of an effort to save some of the nation's most distressed pension plans.

The bill authorizes a 1 percent pay raise for military service members and allows a 1 percent pay raise for federal employees, ordered by Obama, to begin in January. Lawmakers again banned or limited certain federal agency conferences and employee awards. The bill also ends a 5 percent discount on tobacco products sold at military exchanges.

At domestic agencies, the EPA’s budget would be cut by $60 million, and the IRS would lose $345.6 million. The nation’s tax agency also would be banned from targeting organizations seeking tax-exempt status based on their ideological beliefs."

CNN —

North Koreans’ ability to surf the Internet – for the few in the isolated nation who could ever really go online anyway – is rockier than ever.

Dyn Research reported on Monday that the country’s Internet was down, after 24 hours of “increasing instability.” It stayed dead for more than nine hours, then came back to life – but not for long. Half a day later Dyn said it was down again. Then it was back up, at about 1 a.m. Wednesday Pyongyang time (11 a.m. Tuesday ET), the company said.

But the assessment of Dyn, a company that monitors Internet performance worldwide, made earlier Tuesday, did not change: “North Korea continues its struggles to stay online.”

The timing of North Korea’s latest Internet issues makes them significant. They come days after the U.S. government blamed Pyongyang for being behind the hacking of Sony Pictures over that company’s production of “The Interview” – a comedy depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un – as well as threats against anyone who dared watch the movie.

North Korea denied any responsibility, even as it blamed the U.S. government for being behind the making of the Seth Rogen-James Franco film. Its totalitarian government went on to officially make its own threat, warning the United States that its “citadels” will be attacked, dwarfing the hacking attack on Sony.

Pyongyang hasn’t leveled any blame or threats about its latest Internet outage. But experts are skeptical that the American government had any involvement.

That’s almost irrelevant, said Mike Chinoy, a frequent traveler to North Korea and former CNN correspondent.

“The issue … is not whether it was or it wasn’t (the United States that knocked out North Korea’s Internet). The issue is what the North Koreans think it was,” said Chinoy, a U.S.-China Institute senior fellow.

“And I think it’s safe to assume – unless they themselves took their system offline for their own security, which is not impossible – they’ll be looking to respond.”

Cyber conflict with North Korea is ‘dangerous uncharted territory’

Expert: Could be ‘a 15-year-old in a Guy Fawkes mask’

So who is behind North Korea’s Internet problems?

Unlike the Sony cyberattack and threats, which were linked to a group called “Guardians of Peace,” the latest issues haven’t been tied to any group or government.

It’s possible they have nothing to do with the Sony dust-up and are simply an internal matter. Another possibility: North Korea’s Internet traffic is routed through China, so issues or officials there may be to blame.

Another option: it could be a deliberate move by the country’s own government.

“North Korea may have disconnected themselves, either preemptively to prevent that movie from being distributed, but also, probably more likely, in a defensive posture,” said Shawn Henry, a cybersecurity expert and former executive assistant director of the FBI.

Talking when North Korea’s Internet was totally down, Dyn Research’s Doug Madory said “usually there are isolated blips” anyway in the country’s service. But he thinks what happened here was different.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if they are absorbing some sort of attack,” Madory said.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf deflected a question about the disruption. “We aren’t going to discuss – you know – publicly, operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way, except to say that as we implement our responses, some will be seen, some may not be seen,” she said.

No one is saying the U.S. government couldn’t have carried out such an attack. But tech experts say it might not have needed to, given the ability of anyone, anywhere to do something like this.

What happened with Sony, especially the studio’s decision to shelve – at least temporarily – the release of “The Interview,” got a lot of people upset.

Matthew Prince, president of the performance and security company CloudFlare, told CNN he couldn’t say definitively that there was an attack at all. But if there was, he said it’s possible a lone individual, not an entire government, was behind it.

“If it is an attack, it’s highly unlikely it’s the United States. More likely it’s a 15-year-old in a Guy Fawkes mask,” said Prince, tying the prospective attackers to those connected to or inspired by the hacktivist movement Anonymous.

Limited technology, but not when it comes to hacking

Do these outages equal outrage, leaving North Koreans unable to view “Gangnam Style” for the 2-billionth-plus time? Have they been frustrated when they tried to check on the latest NBA results for their fantasy teams or engage in heated debates about local, national and international politics?

No. There’s a reason the Committee to Protect Journalists ranks North Korea second on its list of “Most Censored Countries.” Only a smattering of “ruling elites” can go online freely, leaving the public limited to a “heavily monitored and censored (intranet) network with no connections to the outside world,” according to the advocacy group.

Widespread computer technology overall isn’t a reality in one of the world’s poorest and, according to many outsiders, most antiquated countries.

A 2012 report from KISA, South Korea’s Internet development agency, noted North Korea then had only 1,024 IP addresses – unique numbers assigned to every device that logs on to the Internet – in a country of about 25 million people. That figure may not exactly reflect the current usage since, for example, people can use one IP address for several items, but it’s still paltry by any modern measure. The United States has more than 1.5 billion IP addresses.

Still, even if most North Koreans aren’t Web-savvy by design, a dangerous handful of them may be.

Jang Se-yul, who claims he worked as a computer expert for North Korea’s government before defecting seven years ago, told CNN he thinks that Pyongyang has 1,800 cyberwarriors stationed around the world. He says even the agents themselves don’t know how many others work for the secretive group – called Bureau 121 – whose mission is to “conduct cyberattacks against overseas and enemy states.”

An FBI investigation linked the malware, infrastructure and techniques used by the Guardians of Peace in the Sony attack to previous North Korean cyberattacks.

After that, U.S. President Barack Obama called the hack “an act of cybervandalism that was very costly, very expensive,” though he stopped sort of calling it an act of war.

The next question is: Will Kim, in Pyongyang, say the same about his country’s Internet issues?"

""I am not basing this on some figment of my imagination,"" Reid told Nevada reporters Wednesday. ""I have had a number of people tell me that."" But he would not expand on his sources. ""I don't think the burden should be on me,"" he said. ""The burden should be on him. He's the one I've alleged has not paid any taxes.""

And on the Senate floor Thursday, Reid said, “The word is out he hasn’t paid taxes for 10 years.”

""I'm telling you authoritatively speaking on the behalf of the Governor that those charges are untrue, they are baseless, and there is nothing to back them up,"" said Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom on Fox News Thursday. Invoking Army lawyer Joseph Welch's famous exchange with Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.), Fehrnstrom asked, ""Have you no sense of decency, sir?""

But the campaign will not release more past returns or information about Romney's past tax rates.

Reid has a history of saying controversial things. Republicans (and some Democrats) see the tax charge as yet another example of the soft-spoken senator sticking his foot in his mouth. Jon Stewart made fun of him. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus asked if Reid had ""no shame"" and that it was the Democrat who had some explaining to do. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called the charge ""beneath the dignity of his office."""

The stampede occurred shortly before midnight, at 11:35 p.m., at the Bund — a waterfront area that is one of Shanghai’s most popular tourist landmarks. Emergency crews were dispatched and the wounded sent to four hospitals in the city, officials said in a short statement posted on the city government’s social media account.

A third-floor store on the Bund threw down what looked like U.S. bills and people rushing to pick them up contributed to the panic, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. But the bills were actually a coupons printed to look like currency.

But witnesses at the New Year’s celebration said the hordes had swollen to unsafe proportions even before the coupon incident.

“They just kept letting more and more people onto the Bund,” said Scott Moskowitz, 31, a Princeton University graduate student visiting Shanghai. “At first people were just bumping into each other, no big deal, but it got tighter and tighter to where you couldn’t even move left or right.”

Moskowitz said the crowd was so packed that at times his feet were lifted off the ground. He and friends eventually jumped over a retaining wall to escape the surge.

Pictures circulating widely on Chinese social media showed packed crowds along the waterfront, people lying on the ground and others trying to revive them.

Among the 35 killed, most were students. The youngest was 16 and the oldest was 36, Xinhua reported.

Ironically, the annual celebration was supposed to be a dramatically scaled-down affair this year.

A few days earlier, authorities had announced the cancellation of a popular countdown using a 3-D laser display, the Shanghai Daily reported. Instead, several other activities were planned throughout the city.

The countdown event had grown too unwieldy, authorities said. Since it began three years ago, the numbers attending have swelled steadily, from 100,000 to 300,000 last year, according to state media.

In a piece published on Breitbart.com, Rep. Steve King (Iowa) indicated he “can’t vote for John Boehner again.” “When a president does violence to our Constitution, those who also take an oath to our Constitution have an absolute duty to defend it,” King wrote. “We need a Speaker of the House who carries in his bones the conviction of our oath.”

At least two other Republicans have indicated they may challenge Boehner for the speakership: Rep. Louie Gohmert (Tex.) and Rep. Ted Yoho (Fla.).

“At this point, the Speaker’s election is not about a particular candidate,” Gohmert said in a statement, as The Washington Post’s Sean Sullivan reported. “It is about whether we keep the status quo or make the change the country demands. I am putting forward my name for consideration as Speaker and hope that with a new Speaker, be that me or someone else, we can fight for the ideals and principles that the voters wanted when they elected us in November.”

In a recent poll, 60 percent of Republicans would prefer “someone new” to Boehner, as The Post’s Aaron Blake reported last week.

This, of course, doesn’t mean fellow legislators will support another representative’s bid for the top spot.

“Boehner not only won’t be ousted as speaker in the 114th Congress but has, inarguably, a stronger hand heading into the new session in January than he did for the past two years,” The Post’s Chris Cillizza predicted.

King’s beef with Boehner: allowing the passage of Obamacare and what King called the White House’s “executive amnesty” on immigration.

“It takes a Speaker who both understands and believes his sworn duty is to use all the powers of his office to defend and restore the proper constitutional balance of powers,” King wrote. “Instead, our Speaker has placed Obama’s executive amnesty on the path to permanent full funding.”"

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/romney-and-bush-ready-to-rumble-114153.html?hp=t2_r",0,"Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney have much in common. Both were pragmatic as governors, mild-mannered as candidates and more comfortable balancing budgets at their desks than clinking glasses at a political dinner. The two Republican leaders’ personal rapport is cordial. But they are hardly chummy — and at moments their relationship has been strained, with each man’s intertwined political network carrying some grievances with the other’s.

As Bush, 61, and Romney, 67, explore presidential campaigns in 2016, they are like boxers warming up for what could become a brutal bout, sizing each other up and mulling whether or when to step into the ring.

Their early maneuvering reveals a level of competitiveness and snippiness that stems from a long history following similar career paths in business and politics prescribed by their dynastic families.

“We’re seeing the first shots of the war between clan Romney and clan Bush,” said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist who has worked for both men. “Both bring to the battle incredibly powerful fan clubs as well as wounds they have to heal. How ugly could it get? You’re only competing to lead the free world.”

Could the third time be a charm for Mitt Romney? The former Republican presidential candidate is making moves to explore another possible White House bid, according to sources.

Bush has been trying to consolidate support among establishment donors, leaders and operatives since announcing in December that he would begin laying the groundwork for a likely campaign.

“The Bush connection is a centrifugal force, and it’s drawing back a whole generation of public servants and politicos,” said former Utah governor Jon Huntsman, one of Romney’s 2012 opponents.

But on Friday, Romney sought to slam the brakes on Bush, telling about 30 powerful donors that he, too, was seriously considering a 2016 bid. ""I want to be president,"" he said, adding that his wife, Ann, was supportive.

Romney has begun methodically calling donors, staff members and endorsers from his two prior campaigns to measure how deep his reservoir of support would be if he runs for a third time, his advisers said. He also has scheduled a series of public speeches, including a Jan. 28 address at Mississippi State University.

The entry of both Bush and Romney is far from certain, and Romney’s dalliance is preliminary. But the prospect of two center-right heavyweights entering a 2016 field likely to be fluid, crowded and diverse forces other contenders and the party’s stable of donors to adjust their thinking.

“Awkward,” was the reaction from several past Romney supporters when they learned he was weighing a 2016 campaign. If both he and Bush run, they would occupy similar space as favorites of the party brass and business community.

“The abundance of great candidates developing on the Republican side is making life very tough for me because I’m going to have to choose amongst friends,” said former New Hampshire governor John H. Sununu, who was White House chief of staff under Bush’s father but a top campaign surrogate for Romney.

But, Sununu added, “it’s applesauce right now. Let’s not try to pick up applesauce and move it to the other side of the plate.”

More personal race

The two candidates would invite comparisons to each other, which could be tense for Bush, who was sharply critical of Romney’s 2012 campaign — in particular, his lack of outreach to minorities — and has pledged to run a more inclusive and transparent campaign.

“A Romney-Bush race could end up being nastier than Jeb against someone like Ted Cruz or Rand Paul,” Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, said of the Texas and Kentucky senators. “A Cruz-Bush race is pretty straightforward and ideological. A Romney-Bush race would be more personal — about whose turn it is and who is owed it.”

Associates of both men insist there is no animosity between them and that each will make his decision about a 2016 run irrespective of the other.

“Governor Bush respects Governor Romney,” said Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell, who worked on Romney’s 2012 campaign. “His process moving forward won’t be impacted by Governor Romney’s decision to explore a run — and I would assume it is the same on the reverse side.”

Beth Myers, a longtime adviser to Romney, said he and Bush have been friends since 2002, when Romney was elected to his first term as Massachusetts governor and Bush to his second as Florida governor.

“Mitt has great respect for Jeb’s ability and integrity, and they’ve worked together many times over the years to promote conservative principles,” Myers said. “At the end of the day, whatever decision Mitt makes about running for president, I’m 100 percent certain he will still value and maintain his friendship with Jeb.”

Mitt and Ann Romney also have nurtured a friendship with Bush's parents, former president George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara. In 2007, when Romney gave a personal speech on his Mormon faith, which had become a touchy issue with evangelical Christian voters, he did so at the George Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Tex., where he was warmly introduced by the 41st president.

Working on Romney's 2008 primary campaign were several Jeb Bush lieutenants: Sally Bradshaw, Bush's longtime political adviser; Ann Herberger, a Miami-based fundraiser; and Al Cardenas, a fixture in Florida Republican politics. All three stayed out of Romney's 2012 campaign, although Cardenas, then the chairman of the American Conservative Union, endorsed him as the primaries were ending.

The Bush-Romney family dynamic has been one of intrigue and ambition, dating at least to the 1950s, when Romney’s father, George Romney, then president of American Motors, was striving to make political connections as he eyed a run for office.

In 1957, Romney wrote a letter to Prescott Bush, Jeb's grandfather then serving in the Senate from Connecticut, urging him to test-drive a Rambler or a Metropolitan. Both were popular AMC models, and Romney told Bush the latter got 40 miles to the gallon, according to car-industry historian Patrick R. Foster's book ""The Metropolitan Story."" But, Foster writes, it remains unknown whether the efforts resulted in a sale — or even if Romney's solicitation drew any notice in Bush's office.

Eyeing one another

In recent weeks, Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush have been quietly trying to ascertain the other’s motives and playbook. Bush has asked Romney’s former donors about what Romney is up to, while Romney met shortly before Christmas with Bush strategist Mike Murphy and inquired about Bush’s preparations, according to political consultants who know Romney and Bush.

Romney has said little publicly about Bush, but in exchanges with intimates, he has focused on Bush’s past advisory work for Lehman Brothers and Barclays, two major financial institutions. He argued that it makes Bush vulnerable to the same kind of Democratic attacks that he faced in 2012 over his career as Bain Capital co-founder and chief executive. He also has voiced doubts about Bush’s political skills and ability to beat likely Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Ana Navarro, a GOP operative and Bush confidant, said: “I’m not going to get worked up over comments Romney has allegedly made to donors behind closed doors — yet. We all know he sometimes misspeaks.”

Bush has vowed to more vigorously defend his business record than Romney did. Comparing their careers is like ""comparing an apple to a peanut,"" Bush said in a December interview with a Miami television station.

Those comments irritated Romney’s family and loyalists, who took them as a slight against his career managing a complicated enterprise on a scale far larger than Bush’s business dealings, according to Romney associates.

Bush also is considering releasing a decade or more of his tax returns after Romney faced heat for only reluctantly releasing two years of his returns. And Bush has advocated a more welcoming message on immigration reform than Romney’s hard-right position, which he criticized in 2012.

“He got sucked into other people’s agendas, and I think it hurt him a little bit,” Bush said in the TV interview. He added, “Winning with purpose, winning with meaning, winning with your integrity is what I’m trying to talk about.”

Before announcing his 2012 campaign, Romney, sensing that immigration policy would be a contentious issue in the primaries, sought Bush’s advice.

""I went to see Jeb, I flew down to see him, and said: 'I'd like to take immigration off the issue list for the primaries. And wouldn't it be great if Republicans could come up with an immigration plan that all of the contenders could say, yeah, I agree. And then we could sweep that aside,' "" Romney told The Washington Post's Dan Balz in an interview for his book ""Collision 2012.""

“We were unable to get there,” Romney continued. “I mean, there just wasn’t enough consensus among Republicans generally.”

Rival strategists

As Bush and Romney explore a run, whispering into their ears are two political professionals with big egos, eccentric personalities and a long-simmering rivalry: Romney’s Stuart Stevens and Bush’s Murphy. They are fierce competitors with roots in each other’s turf. Stevens worked on George W. Bush’s presidential campaigns, while Murphy worked on Romney’s 2002 gubernatorial campaign.

Members of Bush’s team have not forgotten Stevens’s role in Bush’s 1994 gubernatorial race, which became Bush’s lowest point politically. Stevens advised one of Bush’s primary opponents, Jim Smith, who waged a bruising TV ad assault against Bush over his business experience and character.

""This begins the destruction of Jeb Bush,"" Stevens told the New York Times as the ads began. Bush won the primary, but he didn't win the governorship until four years later.

During the 2012 campaign, Murphy mocked Stevens on Twitter as Romney struggled in the primaries against relatively weak opponents. More recently, Romney backers have been murmuring fresh questions about Murphy’s work for the political action committee of former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I), who is anathema to the conservative base.

Some Romney allies are bitter that Bush was slow to endorse Romney in 2012. In the run-up to the Florida primary, with Romney fighting to beat back a surge from Newt Gingrich, Bush sat on the sidelines when Romney's team thought he could have made a difference. Romney called, e-mailed and met privately with Bush to try to win him over, but he could not be convinced.

""I voted absentee,"" Bush said on CNN. ""And thank God it's a secret ballot.""

Romney won Florida nevertheless, and by the time Bush announced his endorsement, on March 21, the day after Romney’s decisive victory in the Illinois primary, the nomination was all but officially his.

Bush called Romney on his cellphone, with no tip-off from an emissary, and their talk was brief, according to aides. Back at headquarters, advisers were pleased by the news, but grumbling still, wondering why it had taken so long."
2289,2289,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/01/14/house-votes-to-block-obamas-immigration-actions-but-exposes-new-gop-divisions/,0,"This item has been updated. House Republicans voted Wednesday to undo years of President Obama's immigration policies, launching a fresh attack on his executive actions as part of a plan to renew funding for the Department of Homeland Security. But in doing so, Republicans exposed fresh rifts in their expanded ranks as more than two dozen members, mostly from suburban districts in swing states, voted against plans to end a program granting temporary legal status to hundreds of thousands of “dreamers” — or children brought to the country illegally by their parents who have served as the emotional centerpiece of the years-long debate.

House approval of the spending bill is just the opening act in a debate expected to stretch into late February, when homeland security expires. Legal challenges to Obama’s immigration orders, led by Republican state attorneys general, are underway. A senior GOP lawmaker suggested Wednesday that House and Senate leaders might also file suit.

The bill passed 236 to 191 with the support of two moderate Democrats. But 10 Republicans voted against the final bill. Earlier, 26 Republicans — including several new members from suburban districts around Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami and Philadelphia — joined Democrats in voting against a proposal to end Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), a veteran Miami Republican who was among those to vote against the bill and the DACA amendment, said that his party won't be able to settle the immigration fight until it negotiates a bipartisan compromise with Obama.

“Regardless of what happens this week, this month, on this issue, it will not make the issue itself go away,” he said.

But Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.) said he was encouraged by the strong support the bill received from fellow Republicans. He was lead author of an amendment that would effectively invalidate the executive actions taken by Obama in November and his policy instructing federal immigration officers to focus their efforts on deporting illegal immigrants with criminal backgrounds. The amendment passed with GOP support.

“It was a strong vote. I think it sends a message to the Senate as it goes forward. And we're optimistic about it,” he said.

In the wake of terrorist attacks in France last week, Republicans have faced criticism from Obama and congressional Democrats for delaying swift passage of new security funding. Some party leaders and operatives also worry that the aggressive nature of the bill will once again spoil GOP attempts to appeal to Hispanic and Asian voters in the 2016 president election. But GOP congressional leaders have said that the legislation is designed only to respond to Obama's ""executive overreach.""

""We do not take this action lightly, but there is simply no alternative,"" Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said ahead of the vote as he recounted the 22 times he said Obama has raised doubts about his ability to change immigration policy through presidential powers. ""Enough is enough,"" he added later.

The White House denounced the House vote, saying Republicans were putting homeland security funding, training and long-range planning at risk. Obama’s top domestic policy adviser, Cecilia Muñoz, reiterated Obama’s threatened veto.

The House GOP “is interested in debating immigration but only interested in debating it if they undo the most significant and constructive actions that have taken place in many years,” she said in a conference call with reporters. Republicans are doing nothing on immigration that would “move the country forward.”

Gil Kerlikowske, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said Obama’s executive actions are aimed at allowing the department to focus resources on deporting illegal immigrants who have committed felonies or have terrorist ties, rather than those who are living in the country illegally but do not break other laws.

“Prioritization is critical for any law enforcement agency,” he said.

While 218 Republicans voted for the amendment ending DACA, the ""no"" votes came from newly-elected Reps. Bob Dold (R-Ill.) from the Chicago suburbs; Cresent Hardy (R-Nev.) from the Las Vegas suburbs; Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) and Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) from the Philadelphia suburbs; Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), who represents a Miami-area district; Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), who won her election by fewer than 200 votes; and Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.) from an Upstate New York district that has switched parties several times in recent years.

They were joined by senior Republicans in their state delegations, including Florida's Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen; Adam Kinzinger of Illinois; New Jersey's Chris Smith and Frank LoBiondo; New York's Chris Gibson, Richard Hanna and Peter King; Pennsylvania's Patrick Meehan and Charlie Dent; and Nevada's Mark Amodei and Joe Heck. Other members, including Reps. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), David Valadao (R-Calif.), Fred Upton (R-Mich.) and Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), also voted no.

In the Senate, Republicans control 54 seats, but 60 votes will be needed to advance the bill, and no Democratic senator has expressed support for it. The impasse means Republican leaders will need to negotiate a watered-down bill that can earn Democrat support, pass the Senate and be sent back to the House before current homeland security funding expires on Feb. 27.

If Republicans fail to block Obama's immigration policies through legislation, House and Senate leaders may team up on a new federal lawsuit challenging him, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said Wednesday. Noting that several states are now challenging Obama's immigration actions in court, he said a similar suit might be brought by GOP lawmakers in the House and Senate.

""No decision has been made about that,"" he said, at a reporter breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, adding that it's likely to be the subject of talks at a two-day GOP policy retreat that begins Thursday at a conference center in Hershey, Pa.

""Congress has the right to write the laws and appropriate funds to programs under Article I of the Constitution, and if we are successful in using that legislation and make it clear that there is no legal authority for the president’s actions, then we don’t need to get to litigation,"" he added."

In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Obama will propose raising the capital gains and dividend tax rates to 28 percent for high earners; imposing a fee on the liabilities of about 100 big financial institutions; and greatly broadening the amount of inherited money subject to taxes.

Obama will also seek to boost private retirement savings by requiring employers without 401(k) plans to make it easier for full-time and part-time workers to save in individual retirement accounts, which could assist as many as 30 million people. The administration would provide small employers tax credits to cover costs.

Senior administration officials said that the package would highlight the president’s desire to boost taxes on the nation’s wealthy households and help lower- and middle-class families. New tax credits would help those in need of child care and households with two earners, they said, while other proposals — such as covering community college tuition — would help students.

The moves would “eliminate the biggest tax loopholes and use the savings to let the middle class get ahead,” said one of the senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity during a conference call with reporters to describe the plan before the president’s speech. This person also said that 99 percent of the impact of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent of earners.

The ambitious — and controversial — proposals demonstrate the White House’s increasing confidence about the trajectory of the U.S. economy. For the past year and a half, it has debated how much it could trumpet the recovery when so many Americans have not felt any change in their own economic outlook.

But the plan drew immediate fire from Republican — and could face criticism from some Democrats — who have in the past increased the amount of money exempt from inheritance taxes they branded “death taxes.” Most Republicans have long opposed increases in capital gains rates, and many favor eliminating the tax altogether.

“This is not a serious proposal,” wrote Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in an e-mail late Saturday. “We lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler, flatter tax code, not big tax increases to pay for more Washington spending.”

“Slapping American small businesses, savers, and investors with more tax hikes only negates the benefits of the tax policies that have been successful in helping to expand the economy, promote savings, and create jobs,” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said in a statement Saturday night.

“The president needs to stop listening to his liberal allies who want to raise taxes at all costs and start working with Congress to fix our broken tax code.”

The administration tried to head off some of that attack by asserting that elements of the package resembled proposals endorsed by Republicans. Officials also said that the capital gains tax rate was 28 percent during President Ronald Reagan's terms in office. The Obama administration would also seek to limit the impact of the tax increases by saying the higher capital gains and dividend rates would apply only to couples earning more than $500,000 a year.

Officials said that the relatively low capital gains tax rate with a top rate of 20 percent has enabled the 400 highest-earning taxpayers — with $139 million or more of income — to pay an average rate of 17 percent when the top income tax rate is 35 percent.

The proposal to impose a 7 basis point fee on financial institutions with assets of more than $50 billion will also run smack into opposition from big banks and insurance companies. The administration compared the fee with a proposal by former House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) for an excise tax on large financial institutions. And last week, the House Budget Committee’s ranking Democrat, Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), proposed a 0.1 percent surcharge on financial market transactions.

Share this article Share

One of the senior administration officials Saturday said that the goal of the proposed fee from the White House was to discourage big financial institutions from excessive borrowing. He said that despite banking revisions after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, highly leveraged financial institutions “still pose risks to the broader economy,” adding that “this fee is designed to make that activity more costly.”

The economic recovery has freed the president to push for more ambitious domestic policies, many designed to help those in the poor and middle class who are still lagging behind. In the past week alone, Obama has announced new proposals on paid sick leave, free community college tuition and expanded broadband access. And while he might have trouble pushing those through the GOP-controlled Congress, Obama could still end up defining key issues for the elections in 2016.

""The battle for the next American agenda is already on,"" said Donald A. Baer, chief executive of Burson-Marsteller and formerly chief speechwriter for President Bill Clinton. ""There's this effort to define a new growth and share agenda — growth but not only growth alone, and sharing the growth but not just sharing the wealth."" He said Obama's college and broadband access are examples of proposals that could add to growth and give poor and middle-class people the tools to increase their share in it.

But Obama has to balance his rhetoric — between optimism and caution — by talking up the strong recovery while acknowledging that wage growth remains weak.

""There's always been a tension between things are in fact getting better and people are not feeling great,"" said Wade Randlett, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and major Democratic donor. ""One is economic fact, and the other is polling, which always catches up over time.""

Now the president is so comfortable with the idea of talking up the economic recovery that his advisers have branded it — “America’s resurgence” — and made it a regular talking point in Obama’s stump speeches and weekly radio addresses. And it is likely to be a centerpiece of the State of the Union address.

In bragging about performance, Obama administration officials point to factors including the best streak of job growth since the 1990s, a recovery in the housing market and healthier balance sheets for households, companies and the federal government. And they have contrasted that performance with the anemic economies of Europe and Japan as evidence that the United States has regained its global economic dominance in what Obama has called a “breakthrough year for America.”

But wages have been a stubborn reminder of the recovery’s shortcomings. In November, average hourly private-sector nominal wages inched up 6 cents, but in December, they fell 5 cents. After adjusting for inflation, wages for the entire year crawled up 0.7 percent, a modest amount in an economic recovery. It is a point that has been featured prominently in comments by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has emerged as a leader of the Democratic Party’s liberal wing.

“I’m feeling better about the economy, but I don’t think we have in place a set of policies that will assure that this recovery will be either sustained or fully inclusive,” said Lawrence H. Summers, a former top adviser to Obama, former Treasury secretary and now a professor at Harvard University. “That’s why I think more needs to be done.”

The White House typically aims its messages directly at the middle class, but, partly in response to Warren, Obama administration officials are more comfortable talking about how some of its proposals benefit poorer Americans."

The president will enter the House chamber Tuesday night for his sixth State of the Union address riding a wave of confidence driven by an improving economy and brightening public approval ratings. And he seems as defiant as ever.

Although Obama has vetoed just two bills in his six years, the White House has threatened to veto five measures from Congress this month alone — including legislation that would authorize the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline, tie funding of the Department of Homeland Security to a rollback of Obama's executive actions on immigration, and impose new economic sanctions on Iran.

Obama vowed in a private meeting with Democrats last week that he will play ""offense"" during the final two years of his presidency, building on the aggressive executive actions he laid out over the past two months. The legislative proposals he has previewed — including a plan for free community college and a revamping of the tax code — have been based firmly on his terms, drawing objections from Republicans.

In the weeks leading up to the speech, Obama has toured the country trying to build momentum, putting Republicans on the defensive. Twenty-three guests will join first lady Michelle Obama in her box during the prime-time address, as the president seeks to illustrate his priorities for improving the lives of middle-class Americans. And the White House announced that Obama will travel to Boise, Idaho, and Lawrence, Kan., this week to follow up on his speech in a pair of deep-red states — including one, Idaho, that he has never visited as president.

View Graphic The Washington Post looks back at some of the top issues of 2014.

“America’s resurgence is real,” Obama said in his weekly radio address. “Our job now is to make sure that every American feels that they’re a part of our country’s comeback. That’s what I’ll focus on in my State of the Union — how to build on our momentum, with rising wages, growing incomes and a stronger middle class. And I’ll call on this new Congress to join me in putting aside the political games and finding areas where we agree so we can deliver for the American people.”

White House aides said they see no contradiction in Obama's approach to dealing with the GOP-controlled Congress this year, and they point out that some of his proposals received Republican support in the past. They say Obama is eager to work with the GOP in areas where there is common ground, such as free trade and infrastructure. Republicans — including Obama's 2012 opponent, Mitt Romney — have been adopting a more populist message on the economy, emphasizing mobility and wage growth, ahead of the 2016 presidential race.

Yet as Obama takes his case to the American public in his address, he has made clear that he doesn’t intend to cede much ground to his rivals.

“Some of them are going to be legislative proposals Republicans may not love, but we’ll push them,” White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” He emphasized that the administration will use “every lever we can — whether it’s with Congress, on our own or using the bully pulpit.”

The president's proposal to raise $320 billion in new revenue over 10 years by increasing taxes and fees for wealthy Americans and big financial institutions angered Republicans, who had cited tax reform as a potential area of compromise.

“I would guess the president would love for Republicans in Congress to take the bait or to somehow have our heads turned away from working toward constructive solutions in some cases,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said in an interview, when asked about Obama’s strategy. “Our goal should be to perform, to show we can legislate responsibly, to show that we are steady, to show that we look out in advance for oncoming issues that need to be dealt with, and that we don’t have the herky-jerky, stop-start, government-on and government-off method that’s been occurring in recent times.”

Corker was one of three congressional Republicans who flew aboard Air Force One with Obama to Knoxville, Tenn., two weeks ago for the president's announcement of his community college plan — which the White House said would cost the federal government at least $60 billion over 10 years. Their presence on the presidential jet suggested, at least symbolically, that Obama intended new outreach across the aisle. But Corker said that he doesn't agree with the community college plan — and that he and Obama did not discuss it during their flight or subsequent ride together in the presidential limousine. Rather, he said, they focused on foreign policy. Corker is the new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Inside the West Wing, presidential advisers said they don't think Obama's aggressive rollout of executive actions and new proposals would further poison the political environment or diminish his chances of working with Republicans on what could be lasting achievements. Rather, aides said, the GOP will pursue bipartisan legislation when it is in their best interest, pointing to Republican support for a $1 trillion spending plan last month to keep the government open.

White House allies have been buoyed by the president’s newly vigorous posture. After two years in which the White House often found itself on the defensive amid a series of domestic and international crises, the president and his advisers have made “a tactical change,” said Simon Rosenberg, founder of the New Democrat Network, a liberal think tank. “They’re doing a better job at creating attention around the fact that they actually have a plan, a series of things they want to do.”

But Republicans insist that won’t be enough. The GOP-controlled Congress is unlikely to pursue the proposals he has put forward and instead will begin to put bills on Obama’s desk and dare him to stop them."

The speech is a product of many hands and is carefully vetted, so major errors of fact are relatively rare. But State of the Union addresses often are very political speeches, an argument for the president’s policies, so context is sometimes missing.

Here is a guide through some of President Obama’s most interesting claims, in the order in which he made them. There are some statements we are still checking and so will publish additional information in the coming days. As is our practice with live events, we do not award Pinocchio rankings, which are reserved for complete columns.

“Over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs.”

The low point in jobs was reached in February 2010, and there has indeed been a gain of more than 11 million private-sector jobs since then, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

Note that the president carefully referred to “businesses,” as in the same period the number of federal, state and local government jobs has actually declined by more than 500,000. So adding in government jobs slightly reduces the total number of new nonfarm jobs to 10.7 million jobs.

While Obama has touted what he often calls the “longest stretch of uninterrupted private sector job growth” in U.S. history, the average number of jobs created in this period is significantly lower than under either Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan. (When you exclude a single month of decline, in fact, Clinton and Reagan had streaks of 85 and 71 months, respectively.)

Still, the president finally has some bragging rights about the state of the economy. With the rate of job creation averaging almost 250,000 jobs a month in 2014, this is the first State of the Union address given by Obama in which the number of jobs in the United States is actually higher than when the recession began in December 2007. Even with the massive jobs losses at the start of his presidency, Obama can claim that nearly 6.4 million jobs were added since he took office. At this point in George W. Bush’s presidency, the comparable number was 4.5 million – and for Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, the figure was 18 million and 9.4 million, respectively.

“Thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump.”

This looks like a big number, but it comes out of the Short-Term Energy Outlook published this month by the Energy Information Administration: “The average household is now expected to spend about $750 less for gasoline in 2015 compared with last year because of lower prices.”

Although that report did not specifically cite Obama’s fuel-efficiency standards, a December EIA report (predicting an annual savings of $550) said “lower fuel expenditures are attributable to a combination of falling retail gasoline prices and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks that reduce the number of gallons used to travel a given distance.”

“Today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high. And more Americans finish college than ever before.”

In his statement on “younger students,” Obama likely is referring to the National Assessment of Educational Progress report on fourth- and eighth-grade reading and math scores.

The Nation’s Report Card, released in 2013, showed improvement in national math and reading tests administered by the federal government every two years. The 2013 reading score was the highest among all previous assessments for students in eighth grade. For fourth-graders, the 2013 reading score was the highest out of all previous years except for 2011. Still, the biennial increases in fourth- and eighth-grade students’ reading and math scores during Obama’s administration have been incremental.

For high school graduation rates, Obama’s claim is on point. The data on average public high school graduation and dropout rates are collected by the Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics. For the class of 2011-2012, 81 percent of public high school students graduated. It was the highest percentage of high school graduates since 1995. The geographical breakdown shows 22 states had a graduation rate of 80 percent or higher, and another 22 states had a graduation rate of 70 to 79.9 percent. Seven states had a graduation rate of less than 70 percent. U.S. high school dropout rates reached record lows, according to the Pew Research Center.

As our colleague Lyndsey Layton pointed out, the high school graduation rate is just one measure of success. Despite the high percentages in the report, there were disparities in graduation rates based on socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity.

When it comes to college graduation rates, however, there is some context missing in his statement. Obama said “more Americans finish college than ever before.” Education Department data show a steady increase in graduation rates for first-time, full-time bachelor’s-degree-seeking students at four-year colleges, from the class of 1996 to the class of 2006.

However, recent studies show an increase in the number of students graduating in six years rather than four. Graduating in six years is more expensive for students and adds to their debt. In addition, the Education Department records do not take into consideration a separate category of students: transfer students. — Michelle Ye Hee Lee

“Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave — 43 million.”

This statistic comes from Labor Department survey released in September, which found that 39 percent of 109 million private sector workers were not given paid sick leave. That adds up to 43 million workers.

“Our deficits cut by two-thirds”

The improvement in the economy, coupled with the spending cuts in the sequester, has yielded a significantly lower deficit than just a few years ago. The deficit for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 was $483 billion, a decline of nearly $200 billion from the year before.

Share this article Share

For economists, raw numbers mean less than the percentage of the gross domestic product, and here, too, there has been an improvement. As a percentage of the GDP, the deficit in fiscal year 2014 was 2.8 percent, the lowest level since 2007. For fiscal year 2009, when Obama took office, the deficit was 9.8 percent, so that’s a 71 percent reduction.

Interestingly, Obama’s 2010 budget, introduced in 2009 when deficits were soaring, predicted that the deficit in 2014 would be $535 billion and 2.9 percent of GDP — meaning the administration beat its five-year deficit target.

“Thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small-business owners plan to raise their employees’ pay than at any time since 2007.”

A December 2014 survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses reported the highest Small Business Optimism Index since October 2006. The survey found a seasonally adjusted net 17 percent of businesses planned to raise wages in coming months – a two-percentage-point increase from the previous month. Three percent of businesses reported reductions in worker compensation, compared with 24 percent that reported a boost in compensation. The net 25 percent of businesses reporting higher wages was up four percentage points from the previous month.

But it is too early to say that this positive response from small businesses means “wages are finally starting to rise again.” According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the seasonally adjusted average hourly earnings in December 2014 for all businesses was $24.57 – just 40 cents higher than December 2013. Average weekly earnings between December 2013 and December 2014 increased by 2.5 percent. However, the median weekly earnings between third-quarter 2013 and third-quarter 2014 remained flat. — Michelle Ye Hee Lee

“Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan and all advanced economies combined.”

Once again, the president relies on a data point from 2010; after all, in 2009, the United States was shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs a month in the early days of his presidency. He also uses a somewhat unusual phrase — “advanced economies” — because he is relying on an International Monetary Fund listing of “advanced economies” that includes some entities, such as Hong Kong, that are not considered independent countries. But it does not include such fast-growing nations as China.

But under that specific data set, Obama is right. From the first quarter of 2010 through the second quarter of 2014, the United States created 7.5 million new jobs — compared with 7.4 million in the other advanced economies.

“Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs.”

The low point for manufacturing jobs was reached in January 2010, and there has been a gain of 786,000 jobs since then. But Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that the number of manufacturing jobs is still more than 300,000 fewer than when Obama took office in the depths of the recession — and 1.5 million fewer than when the recession began in December 2007.

“In Iraq and Syria, American leadership — including our military power — is stopping ISIL’s advance.”

The president can certainly make a case that progress is being made in Iraq against militants of the Islamic State (which is also known as ISIS or ISIL), but he goes too far when he lumps Syria into the same sentence. Just last week, the Wall Street Journal documented that three months of U.S. airstrikes in Syria had failed to prevent the group from expanding its territory in the country. The article quoted a senior defense office as saying that “certainly ISIS has been able to expand in Syria, but that’s not our main objective.”

Col. Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, told the newspaper that airstrikes weren’t intended to prevent Islamic State fighters from gaining ground in most of Syria. “Gaining territorial control in Syria has never been our mission,” he said. “That wasn’t the objective of our airstrikes.”

U.S. military officials have been more forthright about saying they have made progress against Islamic State in Iraq. “We’re starting to see what they’re doing is they’re trying to protect the areas they are in control of now, which I might add is some 700 square kilometers less than it was about six months ago,” Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters in January. He said he was not able to provide a breakdown as to how much was in Iraq and how much was in Syria. In another news briefing, Kirby said that Syria opposition fighters would be trained “to eventually go on the offensive against ISIL inside Syria.”

“It makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit.”

In fiscal 2014, the total cost of the Guantanamo Bay facility was $397 million, according to a Defense Department report. With about 155 detainees during the year, that averages out to about $2.6 million per detainee. Over the course of the past decade, the prison has cost a total of $8.2 billion, the report says.

“2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record. Now, one year doesn’t make a trend, but this does – 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.”

Obama correctly cited research from U.S. government scientists.

As President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi succumbed to an apparent coup attempt by the rebels, a government official confirmed that Hadi had lost control over the military and intelligence agencies that coordinate with the United States in operations against al-Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate.

The crisis threatens to weaken Washington’s campaign against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which is based in Yemen and has actively targeted the United States and Europe. The government’s collapse could also plunge Yemen into full-scale civil war. The Houthi rebels are widely ­considered to be backed by ­Shiite-majority Iran, although they deny it. Yemen’s population is majority Sunni, and there is a strong separatist movement in the Sunni-dominated south.

The resignations in Yemen are likely to set off alarms not just in Washington but in Sunni Arab capitals, especially in neighboring Saudi Arabia, which has backed Hadi’s government with billions of dollars and views Iran as its foremost regional rival.

Hadi and his government resigned just a day after agreeing to a power-sharing deal that extended the Houthis' control over Yemen. The 69-year-old president, a former major general, initially appeared ready to ride out the chaos under the arrangement with the rebels.

But government officials accused the insurgents, led by Abdulmalik al-Houthi, of failing to uphold their side of the agreement, refusing to pull back from positions they had taken around the presidential palace and residence, and continuing to hold a Hadi aide who was kidnapped by the group Saturday.

“They have been applying too much pressure on him,” presidential adviser Yaseen Makawi said by telephone. Hadi “had no choice but to resign,” Makawi said.

In a letter to the chairman of parliament, the president alluded to the Houthi offensive, which began in September, as the reason for his resignation, although he did not mention the insurgent group by name.

“I would like to apologize personally to you and to the parliament and to the Yemeni people now that we have reached a dead end,” he said in the statement, which was reported widely in Yemeni media.

Prime Minister Khaled Bahah, who was besieged by the Houthis at his palace this week, said in a Facebook posting that he stepped down to avoid being drawn “into an abyss” in which the country had policies “based on no law.”

“We don’t want to be a party to what is happening or will happen,” he added.

One of Hadi's advisers, Sultan al-Atwani, said the mass resignations resulted from frustration over the Houthis' stripping the president of all powers — including over the military and intelligence agencies — even though they had signed the power-sharing deal. The president was stripped of his authority to coordinate on U.S. drone strikes aimed at al-Qaeda targets, he said. Atwani added that he no longer had the authority to coordinate with a U.S. drone program that attacks AQAP militants.

Yemen rebels attack presidential compound + 46 Shiite insurgents overran the palace and shelled the residence in an offensive against the Western-allied government.

Hadi took power in 2012 after an Arab Spring uprising led to the ouster of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Many Yemenis suspect Saleh aided the Houthi advance and plotted against the president. The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Saleh and two Houthi leaders in November for threatening Yemen's stability.

“Hadi has lost control of the military. He doesn’t have the power to give orders to the military,” Atwani said by telephone.

There was no immediate response from officials in Washington.

The Yemeni government was formed in November as part of a peace deal brokered after the Houthis overran the capital in September and captured large swaths of territory, including nine provincial capitals.

It was not immediately clear whether the rebels now have full control over the intelligence branches, but analysts said the developments spelled trouble for continued Yemeni counterterrorism coordination with the United States — notably on the drone program.

""It's expected that the Houthis are going to change the composition and focus of the intelligence services to gear them toward maintaining Houthi influence, primarily,"" said Lina Khatib, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center. ""This would divert attention away from counterterrorism operations.""

Houthi officials have said they oppose the U.S. drone program, calling it a violation of Yemen’s sovereignty. Houthis are Zaydis, a branch of Shiite Islam whose followers form roughly a third of Yemen’s population of 24 million. Although natural enemies of Sunni al-Qaeda, the Houthis would probably suspend their country’s participation in the drone program because it is highly unpopular among Yemenis because of civilian casualties from the airstrikes, said Ali Shantoor, a retired Yemeni brigadier general.

""Abdulmalik al-Houthi and the Houthis will refuse to cooperate with the United States in carrying out drone attacks,"" he said. ""They've always said that they reject the United States' control and its violation of the sovereignty of the country.""

Houthis have been battling AQAP during their assaults. The al-Qaeda group claimed responsibility for a Jan. 7 attack in Paris on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo that left 12 people dead and set off three days of violence.

The Houthi rebels, meanwhile, appeared to be preparing an advance on central Marib province, the country’s main oil and gas region. Yemen’s exports are tiny compared with those of its energy-rich neighbors, but the revenue is critical in the Arab world’s most impoverished nation.

The Houthis tried to seize an army base about 90 miles from Marib in preparation for a likely assault on the province, said Ali al-Ghulaisi, a spokesman for Marib’s governor. He said military officials, tribal leaders and party chiefs gathered in the province’s main city Wednesday to discuss preparations in the event of a Houthi assault.

The Houthi attack on the military base “is an attempt to increase the areas they control, in addition to securing supply lines for them, so that they can attack Marib,” Ghulaisi said by telephone.

For Saudi Arabia, in particular, the ascendance of a Shiite-dominated state on its doorstep represents a strategic threat. It sees Iranian proxies consolidating power on its southern border with Yemen and on the northern one with Iraq, which is led by a Shiite government that has growing political, military and economic ties with Tehran, said Mustafa Alani, director of security and terrorism at the Geneva-based Gulf Research Center.

""This is becoming a strategic nightmare"" for Saudi Arabia, he said. The collapse of Yemen's government came as Saudi Arabia's leadership was in flux, with official media reporting early Friday that King Abdullah had died.

The Houthis reject accusations that they are Iranian proxies. They have defended their offensive as an attempt to root out corruption."
2317,2317,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/01/22/saudi-arabias-coming-struggle/?hpid=z3,0,"This post has been updated. Saudi watchers have been talking about the transition from King Abdullah for a decade, but now that it has arrived, it’s as mysterious as ever. The death of King Abdullah begins a period of generational change in the oil kingdom that may last for several years. Crown Prince Salman, the nominal successor the new king, is elderly and infirm, as is the next in line, Prince Muqrin. The Saudi royal family, which has proven itself adept at survival, will be struggling in the next days and months to decide who in the next generation should be positioned for eventual power. UPDATE (1:00 p.m., Jan. 23): King Salman took a big step in an orderly transition Friday, announcing that the next in line after Muqrin will be Prince Mohammad bin Nayef, the interior minister and the Saudi official with whom the U.S. has the most trust. At 55, he is part of the next generation in the royal family. His elevation is a crucial step toward empowering a younger team of Saudi leaders.

Saudi Arabia’s opaque and often repressive political system mystifies outsiders, especially at times like this, when the leadership of the kingdom is a critical factor in the regional balance of power. Saudi Arabia is the heart, and the pocketbook, of the Sunni Arab world. A leadership vacuum in Riyadh echoes from Yemen to Syria, and all the places in between.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/world/middle_east/funeral-held-for-saudi-king/2015/01/23/8c1f9e30-d968-432b-9f8a-874c1c8ae3cc_video.html

Abdullah’s death comes as Saudi Arabia, and the Sunni world it leads, are vexed as never before by the power of Iran and its Shiite Muslim proxies. Iran’s allies control four key Arab capitals: Damascus, Baghdad, Beirut and Sanaa. The Saudis have raged against Iranian power, and tried to finance covert operations to counter it, but they have failed everywhere they have tried. Many in the kingdom blame the United States for these reversals, but they should be more self-critical: This has fundamentally been a failure of Sunni, and especially Saudi, leadership.

Abdullah was a reticent monarch, with none of the flamboyant outreach of his predecessor, King Fahd. But within the kingdom, he was deeply respected. He was seen by many Saudi women as their secret champion in a society that rigidly suppresses the rights of women. He was also seen as a modest and pious man who lived by Muslim ideals better than many of his predecessors. He didn’t reform Saudi Arabia, but he was able to maintain a measure of stability.

The nightmare for moderate Saudis is that the extremists of the Islamic State have a significant following among young Saudis, say analysts who follow the Arabic Twitter and Facebook platforms. Young Saudis are among the world’s most active users of these social media, which indicates the pent-up desire in the kingdom for political and social involvement. Attempts to suppress this activism, in the uncertainty of the leadership transition, could be very dangerous.

The next generation of Saudi leaders, symbolized for American officials by Prince Mohammad, is talented and modern. But the paradox of Saudi Arabia is that the Western-facing kingdom has depended for its legitimacy on a pact with conservative Muslim religious leaders. Frightened now by the power of the Islamic State’s extremism, Saudi leaders may be tempted to repeat that bargain — and govern through the repressive power of the Muslim conservatives."

The man later called the Secret Service and explained that he never intended for his two-foot-wide “quadcopter” to breach White House security, the investigators said. They said the agency was working to corroborate his account.

The Secret Service said the drone operator contacted the agency voluntarily at 9:30 a.m. Monday, more than six hours after the device crashed, and was being cooperative. It did not immediately identify the person.

According to a U.S. official cited by the Associated Press, the man is a D.C. resident, and investigators currently do not have any reason to doubt his story.

The crash caused a lockdown at the compound until the device was recovered and examined, the Secret Service said.

The service later said it questioned a person who called to “self-report” the incident and that “initial indications” pointed to a “recreational use” of the drone.

The latest security breach at the executive mansion came as President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were visiting India, but their two daughters remained behind in Washington.

The Secret Service statement identified the object as a “quad copter,” a commercially available drone with four propellers.

“There was an immediate alert and lockdown of the complex until the device was examined and cleared,” the statement said. “An investigation is underway to determine the origin of this commercially available device, motive, and to identify suspects.”

In its subsequent update, on the incident, the Secret Service said: “An individual called the Secret Service this morning at approximately 9:30 a.m. to self-report that they had been in control of the quad copter device that crashed on the White House grounds early this morning. The individual has been interviewed by Secret Service agents and been fully cooperative. Initial indications are that this incident occurred as a result of recreational use of the device.”

The statement added: “This investigation continues as the Secret Service conducts corroborative interviews, forensic examinations and reviews all other investigative leads.”

Earlier, White House press secretary Josh Earnest, speaking to reporters in New Delhi, said the device did not pose a threat to the building or the first family.

The Service said the drone was spotted about 3:08 a.m. flying at a low altitude onto the White House grounds, crashing on the southeastern side.

It was not immediately clear whether the Obama children, Malia and Sasha, were at the White House when the device was discovered before dawn. They were under the care of their grandmother, who also lives at the White House.

“There is a device that has been recovered by the Secret Service at the White House,” Earnest said when asked if a drone was found. “The early indications are that it does not pose any sort of ongoing threat to anybody at the White House.”

Around 5 a.m., authorities could be seen searching the White House grounds with flashlights. Investigators continued the search after sunrise as a light snow fell. The lockdown was later lifted.

The incident follows a series of lapses in security at the White House and a shake-up in the leadership at the Secret Service.

In September, a knife-wielding man scaled the fence at the White House and ran through much of the mansion's main floor. An armed private security contractor in Atlanta also boarded an elevator with Obama that same month.

In a series of reports, The Washington Post disclosed how the Secret Service failed to respond well after a gunman shot at the White House in 2011. That incident raised major concerns among lawmakers.

Small drones previously have violated the highly restricted airspace near the White House and the Capitol. But this was believed to be the first time that a drone has penetrated the White House perimeter.

Most commercially manufactured quadcopters are small devices that weigh two to five pounds, measure one to three feet in length and sell for a few hundred dollars, AP reported.

“Something of that size is going to be very limited in terms of what it can carry, probably down to a few ounces in payload,” Paul McDuffee, vice president at drone-maker Insitu, said of the device that crashed, according to AP.

About 7:30 pm on July 3, a Secret Service patrol detained an individual who was flying a small quadcopter drone in President’s Park, about one block from the White House grounds, said an incident report filed with the Federal Aviation Administration.

The camera-equipped drone was flying about 100 feet in the air near the statue of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, close to the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and 15th Street NW. The FAA report noted that the drone was confiscated by the Secret Service but did not identify the pilot or elaborate on whether charges were filed.

A three-mile area around the White House, called the P56 zone, is a permanent no-fly zone. All pilots are warned to steer clear though standard “notices to airmen,” and they are given emergency alerts if they come close to crossing the line.

Drones have violated that airspace on at least three other occasions in the past six months.

On Aug. 29, the U.S. Capitol Police reported detaining an individual for flying a small drone on the Capitol grounds, according to an FAA incident report that gave no further details.

Ten days earlier, on Aug. 19, District police arrested an unidentified man after they found him stuck in a tree in Freedom Plaza, just east of the White House at the intersection of 14th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue. According to an FAA report, the man had climbed up the tree to fetch a small drone that he had been flying when it got caught in the branches.

And on July 7, another person was questioned by the U.S. Park Police for flying a small quadcopter drone in the vicinity of the Lincoln Memorial, according to an FAA incident report that gave no other details.

A boom in sales of small consumer drones in recent years has triggered hundreds of other incidents around the country in which the remotely controlled aircraft have buzzed dangerously close to passenger planes, rescue helicopters and sports stadiums, according to FAA data.

Quadcopters also have been linked to smuggling attempts, including a failed bid last year to transport drugs into a Dublin prison. Last week, a quadcopter carrying 6.6 pounds of methamphetamine from suspected Mexican traffickers crashed into a supermarket parking lot in San Ysidro, Calif.

While the White House grounds are an especially sensitive area, drone operators have gotten into trouble elsewhere in the Washington region.

On Oct. 6, for example, Prince George’s County police arrested at least two people for flying a white drone over FedEx Field about one hour before the Washington Redskins kicked off against the Seattle Seahawks during a nationally televised Monday Night Football matchup, according to an FAA incident report. The drone, which was equipped with red and blue lights, was spotted flying about 150 feet over the stadium, according to the report, which did not identify the suspects or give further details.

A recent incident involving a drone crashing in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a campaign event reinforced the possible dangers posed.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has been investigating the Service’s recent security lapses and said Monday in a phone interview that the incident is “deeply concerning”.

“These kinds of threats are not going away. But I do believe they are on top of it,” he said of the Service.

He stressed that the problems with drones is they are easily accessible.

“Anybody can go down to RadioShack and buy one of these. It could be a guy down by the river in his van or it could be a nefarious terrorist,” Chaffetz said. “You just don’t know.”"

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/29/kabul-us-contractors-killed/22546595/",0,"The Taliban claimed responsibility Friday for a shooting incident at a military base attached to Kabul's international airport Thursday that killed three American civilian contractors and wounded a fourth, saying the attacker had infiltrated the ranks of the security forces. The contractors worked for Praetorian Standard Inc., or PSI, a small firm based in Fayetteville, N.C., with offices in Maryland and Virginia. According to its Web site, the firms says ""it specializes in providing innovative strategic planning, logistics, operational and security management support services in challenging environments around the world.""

In a statement Friday, the company confirmed that “three employees of Praetorian Standard, Inc. were killed and one was wounded in Afghanistan while supporting the efforts of the U.S. Government.” It added: “This was a terrible day for the families involved, our company and the United States. We are shocked by the tragic nature of these deaths and offer our deepest condolences to the families of these brave men.”

The company has worked in Afghanistan since 2010, mostly providing logistics, transportation and security support to a Defense Department and U.S. Geological Survey program that is exploring potential mineral deposit sources in Afghanistan.

The victims, whose names have not yet been released, were working out of the firm’s Kabul office.

In Twitter messages and a subsequent statement, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid identified the shooter as Ihsanullah bin Mullah Rahmatullah, from Laghman province in eastern Afghanistan. He said the man had infiltrated the ranks of the Afghan security forces in anticipation of an opportunity to attack Americans and was working at Kabul’s airport.

“He managed yesterday evening to attain his goal and opened fire with his rifle on a group of American occupiers,” the spokesman said. The attacker was then “martyred by return fire,” Mujahid said.

“The martyr was able to successfully defend his religion . . . and the glory of his country, and by giving himself away as a sacrifice, he cast a number of the occupying disbelievers into the abyss of hell,” Mujahid said.

He gave a higher casualty figure for the attack, claiming that “three American soldiers died and four others were critically wounded.”

Authorities said Thursday that an Afghan national was also killed in the attack, but it was not immediately clear whether that person was the shooter or an additional victim.

Immediately after Thursday’s attack, suspicion fell on a possible “insider attack” perpetrated by a member of the Afghan security forces who also had access to the military base at the airport. An unidentified Afghan air force official told the Reuters news agency the shooter was an Afghan soldier.

It was not immediately clear how the contractors were attacked.

Referring to the attacker as an “infiltrator,” Mujahid used a term often used by the Taliban for an insurgent who had penetrated the Afghan army or police for months or years, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

When asked Thursday whether the incident was an insider attack, a U.S. military spokesman, Col. Brian Tribus, declined to comment. He said there would be no further comments on the incident until the investigation was complete.

The sprawling base where the shooting occurred is protected by tall concrete blast walls and filled with hangars, office trailers and maintenance buildings. It is a hub for the coalition’s air operations, as well as the main base of the Afghan air force.

As of last year, before a drawdown of U.S. combat forces, it was home to as many as 4,000 foreign military personnel and civilian contractors from more than a dozen nations, including the United States. Top U.S. commanders spent much of their time there.

Insider attacks have long plagued the relationship between Afghan forces and their U.S. and international allies, breaking down trust and reducing interaction. The assaults by rogue Afghan soldiers or police particularly rose in the last years of the NATO combat mission, which formally ended in December. Assaults reached record levels in 2012, when there were 37 such attacks that killed 51 people, including 32 U.S. troops, according to the Pentagon.

Since then, U.S. and coalition forces have tightened vetting procedures for Afghan security forces and required that all foreign troops be armed at all times. The efforts have reduced the number of insider attacks, but they nevertheless remain a major concern.

The killings were a reminder of the threats faced by the roughly 10,600 U.S. troops and thousands of American contractors who remain in Afghanistan, mostly to train and advise Afghan security forces. Such tasks require close interaction with Afghans, and it remains to be seen whether the attacks will have an adverse impact or restrict such relationships.

“We can confirm that there was a shooting incident at North Kabul International Airport complex 29 January at approximately 6:40 p.m.,” Tribus said in an e-mailed statement. “Three coalition contractors were killed as was an Afghan local national. This incident is under investigation.”

A U.S. defense official in Washington, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the nationalities of those killed, said the contractors were all Americans and that the fourth one had been wounded.

In August, a gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform opened fire at a military training school near Kabul, killing U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Harold J. Greene. He was the highest-ranking U.S. officer to be killed in 13 years of war in Afghanistan and the first general to be killed in the line of duty since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that prompted the United States to intervene militarily in Afghanistan, combining with Afghan resistance forces to topple the radical Islamist Taliban regime.

Virtually everyone on the base at the Kabul airport is armed. But that did not stop U.S. military officials from worrying about insider attacks during a flag-lowering ceremony in early December that marked the official end of the coalition’s combat mission. Before the ceremony, the officials warned journalists that if any rockets landed, or if anyone started shooting, to run and take cover.

With the U.S. military drawdown, civilian contractors have become more visible. Even though their numbers have also sharply decreased, thousands of contractors remain in Afghanistan, most of them based in Kabul.

As of mid-2014, about 17,400 U.S. citizens were working in Afghanistan as civilian contractors for the Defense Department, according to military figures reported by the Web site Danger Zone Jobs. Other private contractors work for various international relief and development organizations. A year earlier, the Congressional Research Service put the number of Pentagon contractors at about 33,000.

Thursday’s killings broke a roughly three-week lull in violence in the capital. In the last two months of 2014, the Taliban intensified its attacks in Kabul and other parts of the country, targeting foreigners as well as influential Afghans and symbols of government authority.

The shooting was the first suspected insider attack since U.S. and NATO forces formally terminated their combat mission in Afghanistan. Under an agreement with the Afghan government, the previous coalition force is being replaced by a follow-on mission dubbed ""Resolute Support,"" which began Jan. 1 and consists of about 12,000 mostly U.S. troops focused on training.

Earlier on Thursday, a roadside bomb killed a police commander and three other people in the eastern province of Laghman, and a suicide bomber targeted the commander's funeral later in the day, according to Afghan officials. They said 16 people — four policemen and 12 civilians — were killed and 39 were wounded when the bomber mingled with mourners in the town of Mehtar Lam and detonated his explosives."

The massive document is a blueprint for what Obama has been calling “middle-class economics,” but congressional Republicans are likely to view it merely as the president’s opening bid in a contentious process designed to forge a tax and spending plan for the new fiscal year.

The document will become, if not law, another defining moment for the president as he tries to carve out priorities for his remaining two years in office. Administration officials have tried to map out potential political trade-offs by offering elements such as a corporate tax revision that could appeal to Republicans, while asking for more spending on infrastructure.

But the president is also seeking to fund his proposals by raising taxes on the richest Americans, an approach that has immediately drawn Republican opposition.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), appearing on television Sunday, rejected many of Obama’s ideas for raising taxes on the wealthy as “envy economics.”

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said during the daily briefing that President Obama's budget proposal would put forward spending levels that exceed those cuts prescribed in sequestration legislation. (Video: AP)

The president’s budget features a six-year, $478 billion public works program for upgrading the nation’s infrastructure, including roads, railroads and ports.

The package is bigger and stretched over more years than Obama’s earlier unsuccessful requests for infrastructure money.

The administration is proposing to pay for the ambitious program in part with revenue from a one-time mandatory 14 percent tax on about $2 trillion in profits that corporations have been keeping overseas in order to avoid corporate income taxes here. The tax would be a sizable hit on multinationals and a way of discouraging them from parking money in foreign countries.

The administration also is seeking to lower the corporate federal income-tax rate to 28 percent from 35 percent by closing loopholes.

And the president wants to raise pay for federal workers and troops by 1.3 percent, which would be more than the 1 percent pay bump given to them the past two fiscal years.

The administration is also seeking a 6 percent increase in research and development spending, a “substantial investment” in early education, boosts in efforts on cyber-security, and resources to fight the Islamic State and other foreign threats.

The Office of Management and Budget said the president’s plan would produce a $474 billion deficit, or 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product, which is little changed from the current fiscal year but in line with deficits as a share of the economy over the past half-century.

The budget requests exceed the spending caps established in 2010 by $74 billion spread evenly between military and non-military discretionary spending, and while the administration is proposing offsets, it also argued strongly for the elimination of the limits that trigger wide cuts known as sequestration. “We’ve seen bipartisan agreement that the sequestration is mindless and is not the right approach for our country,” said a senior administration official.

The OMB also forecasts that over the next decade, nearly $6 trillion will be added to the national debt, but that would represent a small decline as a share of the economy at 73.3 percent in 2025, said a congressional aide familiar with the plan who was not authorized to speak about it publicly. That forecast includes $1.8 trillion in deficit-reduction measures, said another person familiar with the plan.

The administration said it “achieves these goals by replacing mindless austerity with smart reforms, paying for all new investments” and seeking new savings.

That isn’t likely to appease Republicans, however, who are expected to quickly dismiss Obama’s budget request and start drafting their own blueprint that would seek to eliminate deficits entirely over the next 10 years and tackle the biggest drivers of government spending: Social Security and federal health programs.

Although the president has previewed his tax and spending priorities over the past two weeks, the budget provides important — and controversial — details.

“This is a budget that fleshes out the president’s State of the Union address and puts meat on the bones of his middle-class economics agenda,” said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “It makes important strategic investmens to sharpen our competitive edge, including investments in infrastructure, science research and education — things that have helped power the American economy in the past — and we risk falling behind if we don’t make those investments going forward.”

Van Hollen added that the administration is proposing tax changes — including an increase in the capital gains tax and expanded tax credits for families with children — “designed to address what is currently a tilt in the tax code in favor of those who make money off of money and against those who make money off of hard work.”

According to a Tax Policy Center paper, if all of the major individual income tax provisions were fully phased in, the president's package would raise taxes by an average of $164 per household in 2016. But winners would outnumber losers by more than 7 to 1, with the tax increases concentrated among the richest 1 percent of households.

The vast majority of households in the bottom four quintiles would pay lower taxes — or receive larger refunds — as a result of the policy proposals. Those in the lowest quintile would by far save the most.

“My job is to present the right ideas,” Obama told NBC News in a pre-Super Bowl interview broadcast from the White House. “If the Republicans think they’ve got a better idea, they should present them. But my job is not to trim my sails and not tell the American people what we should be doing, pretending somehow that we don’t need better roads or more affordable college.”

The president will also propose approximately $1.8 trillion in deficit-reducing measures over a 10-year period. Those measures, which resemble past proposals, would include about $160 billion in higher income and Social Security taxes resulting from immigration reform, $400 billion in health care savings. and $640 billion from taxes raised mostly by eliminating deductions without raising rates. Additional savings would come from lower interest costs on the federal debt.

One item that will still be in the printed version of the budget: a tax on withdrawals from 529 accounts designed to promote parents’ savings for college tuition. After that proposal was recently greeted with a backlash, the administration retreated from the idea, but it was too late to change the printed budget.

Obama administration officials have been trying to link various tax and spending changes to build support among members of Congress who might favor only one part of those pairings.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew recently said that the windfall resulting from taxing foreign profits accumulated by corporations should go to funding the infrastructure program. The administration also paired increases in capital gains taxes and a new fee on the liabilities of big banks and insurance companies with proposals to expand middle-class tax credits and free community-college education. And the administration has also said that it wants to break through spending caps for discretionary spending by equal amounts for military and non-military programs.

But making those trade-offs will prove more difficult in Congress than on paper.

For example, the tax on foreign profits, regardless of whether they are brought back to the United States, is likely to face strong headwinds in Congress. Obama’s plan would impose an immediate tax of up to $280 billion on U.S.-based multinationals at a time when many lawmakers are worried about pushing companies to move their headquarters overseas.

The 14 percent tax would “transition” to a long-term 19 percent rate, senior administration officials said.

As previously announced, the budget will include an increase in the top capital gains tax rate to 28 percent, which would fall primarily on the richest 1 percent of Americans.

“What I think the president is trying to do here is to, again, exploit envy economics. This top-down redistribution doesn’t work,” Ryan said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “It may make for good politics; it doesn’t make for good economic growth.”

For example, Ryan called Obama’s plan to expand the amount of inherited wealth subject to the capital gains tax “a bad idea” that would make it “really hard for a family to pass on a family business to the next generation.”

Still, Ryan embraced some of Obama’s proposals for cutting taxes, especially for the struggling middle class. Ryan has long endorsed expanding the earned-income tax credit to childless adults, for example, saying it “pulls people into the workforce.”

""We really believe that we should reform the entire tax code for all people — individuals, families, businesses, simpler, the whole thing. But it is pretty clear to us that the president doesn't agree with that on individuals,"" Ryan said. ""So the question is — which I don't know the answer to — is there common ground on aspects of tax reform that we think can help grow the economy? . . . We'll find out.""

The king huddled with his security cabinet and top generals Wednesday just hours after Jordan hanged two convicted terrorists in retaliation against the Islamic State, which posted a video Tuesday of its fighters burning alive a captured Jordanian pilot in a cage.

The immolation prompted harsh condemnation from leaders across the Middle East and in the United States, with the White House speaking of Jordan’s “strength and commitment” to the international coalition against the Islamic State “in the face of this barbaric act.”

In Jordan, the killing mostly silenced critics of the U.S.-led offensive against the Islamic State, the heavily armed al-Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIS or ISIL. It was used by the government to stoke patriotic sentiment, with billboard-size posters in Amman reading “We Are All Jordan” and a rally of flag-waving supporters greeting the king at the airport as he arrived back in the country from a visit to the United States.

“We will be on the lookout for these criminals, and we will hit them in their own homes,” Abdullah declared, according to the state news agency Petra. “We are fighting this war to protect our faith, values and our humanitarian principles. Our fight will be relentless.”

The hangings underscored the hardening stance by the monarch and his military in Jordan, a key U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State, amid street protests calling for revenge against the militant group.

The backlash from the video — released while Abdullah was in Washington to sign a deal boosting the amount of U.S. aid to Jordan — appears to have drawn the usually cautious monarch into a direct confrontation with radical Islamists.

The king, who claims to be a descendant of the prophet Muhammad and was educated in Britain and the United States, has previously avoided direct threats against the Islamic State and has sought to keep secret the number of bombing missions his air force has flown over Syria.

But according to Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.), Abdullah — who met with members of Congress before he left Washington — quoted the Clint Eastwood character William Munny, an aging gunslinger in the Oscar-winning film “Unforgiven” who exacts vengeance when his friend is tortured to death.

Abdullah did not elaborate on where or how Jordan’s retaliation would be carried out.

It is unlikely that Jordan would fly strike missions in Syria outside those coordinated by the U.S-

directed coalition. Out of about 1,000 strikes in Syria since September, the vast majority have been by U.S. aircraft. But ""the coalition is not going to turn their nose up at additional kinetic activity by one of the members,"" said a senior U.S. defense official in Washington. ""If they want to do more, we welcome it.""

Overall, the coalition strategy and the pattern of strikes will not change, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. But outside of coalition operations, “we can’t speak for Jordan,” the official said. “They might feel that for their own sense of national pride, they need to do something.”

The Obama administration declined to join with the European Union — where there is no death penalty — in criticizing the rapid Jordanian executions. White House press secretary Josh Earnest noted that both individuals “had gone through the Jordanian justice system” and were “sentenced to death.”

The administration did not immediately respond to a letter sent to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Secretary of State John F. Kerry by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which wrote that Abdullah, in a meeting with the panel in Washington before his departure Tuesday for Amman, had complained of “complications and delays” in providing defense items such as aircraft parts and munitions.

Jordan's chief government spokesman said the two prisoners executed Wednesday included Sajida al-Rishawi, an Iraqi woman sentenced to death for her role in a deadly 2005 terrorist attack in Amman. The Islamic State had sought her release as part of a possible prisoner swap. Jordan had offered to free Rishawi in exchange for the pilot, Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh, and a Japanese journalist, Kenji Goto, held by the Islamic State.

The other inmate was Ziad al-Karbouli, who was linked to a terrorist attack against Jordanians in Iraq in 2005 and whose freedom was also demanded by the Islamic State.

The two were hanged less than 12 hours after the video of the pilot’s killing was posted online.

Across Jordan, voices that recently called for the country to withdraw from the U.S.-led offensive against the Islamic State fell silent as Jordanians came together to denounce the militants.

“This terrible act has created tremendous unity in Jordan,” said Jawad Anani, a senator and former foreign minister. “Ordinary Jordanians now see the threat to their own security.”

Anani, who is close to Abdullah, suggested that airstrikes by Jordan and the coalition would intensify, and he said it was possible that Jordanian ground troops or special forces might be deployed in Syria.

“The next logical step, you can intensify the conflict,” Anani said.

But others doubt that the backlash will stir major changes in Muslim participation in the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State.

“The killing’s impact on the coalition will not really be a game-changer, because the participation of countries depends on a variety of issues that are specific to each country,” said Elias Hanna, a retired Lebanese general who teaches geopolitics at the American University of Beirut.

“We won’t see Arab boots on the ground,” he predicted. “That’s for certain.”

In his first public statement since the video, Safi al-Kaseasbeh, the pilot’s father, said Wednesday that he expects Jordan and the U.S.-led coalition to avenge his son’s death. Just last week, the elder Kaseasbeh had appealed for Jordan to pull out of the coalition.

“I urge the government, I expect the government, to seek revenge, severe revenge, for the blood of Muath against this horrid organization, this criminal organization, this organization that is far from Islam and the spirit of Islam,” the pilot’s father said Wednesday.

Members of the extended Kaseasbeh clan greeted a stream of visitors at their mourning tent outside the city of Karak, south of Amman. The family had no body to bury. In the video, Islamic State fighters are shown dumping a bulldozer load of cement rubble over the pilot’s body.

Mosques across Jordan held prayers for the pilot at noon, with government-supported imams denouncing the Islamic State. Meanwhile, churches in Amman pealed their bells in interfaith solidarity. After noon prayers, Royal Jordanian Air Force fighter jets flew over Amman and Karak.

But Jordan also faces tests on whether it can build on the displays of unity and resolve. There have been past signs of support for the Islamic State in Jordan — especially in poorer regions — although relatively few people have waved Islamic State flags or endorsed the group on the Internet.

Labib Kamhawi, an Amman-based political analyst, said Abdullah is in “a difficult position” on how to frame the response.

“The issue is whether he can transform this into a national issue that affects Jordanians, or whether it becomes a tribal matter with mounting calls for revenge and eye-for-an-eye attacks,” he said.

http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/10/opinion/brinkley-brian-williams-cronkite/index.html",0,"Within minutes on Tuesday night, two major media stories exploded. The first detonated around 7 p.m. Comedy Central announced on Twitter that Jon Stewart, the longtime host of “The Daily Show,” will step down later this year after more than 16 years running the show. Then, less than an hour later, the Brian Williams bomb dropped. NBC dispatched a letter saying it had suspended its lead anchor, who weathered days of intense scrutiny following his admission he had cooked up a personal tale of Iraq bravery, for six months. Without pay.

It wasn’t long before the murmurs started — through Twitter, through Facebook, through the nether reaches of the Internet. They called for something that at first seemed totally insane but, as it sank in, began to make sense: Jon Stewart, now as much a newsman as a comedian, and Brian Williams, now as much a comedian as a newsman, should just switch chairs.

Advertisement

Let that marinate for a moment.

“Please raise your hand if you want Jon Stewart to replace Brian Williams at NBC?” wrote Steven Greenhouse of the New York Times. A Miami journalist then placed a fake Guardian story on Facebook under the headline, “Jon Stewart leaves The Daily Show to anchor NBC Nightly News following Brian Williams departure.” (Clicking on this link, however, led the reader to a Rick Astley video.) NPR’s Scott Simon had this to say: “I can’t be the first person to notice that Brian Williams & Jon Stewart both seem available in about 6 months.”

Even @TheTweetOfGod, with his 1.8 million followers, got into the mix. He offered: “Jon Stewart leaving. Brian Williams looking for work. It’s almost TOO obvious, isn’t it.”

@TheTweetOfGod has a point. Here’s why: Despite his protestations to the contrary, Jon Stewart is not exclusively a comedian. His career has careened from procuring doobies in “Half Baked” to directing the substantive film, “Rosewater,” a sobering tale of a captured journalist in Iran. More and more, he has admitted he’s grown tired of comedy.

Jon Stewart leaves ‘The Daily Show’ + 23 After 16 years on ‘The Daily Show,’ Jon Stewart has departed.

While promoting “Rosewater” last year, he told NPR that he loves his job as the host of “The Daily Show.” “That being said, I think there are moments when you realize that that’s not enough anymore, or maybe it’s time for some discomfort.” On Tuesday night he affirmed his restive spirit. “This show doesn’t deserve an even slightly restless host, and neither do you.”

Stewart has become as much a serious media man as anything else. (Remember, NBC reportedly offered him the plumb job of host of “Meet the Press.”) And most Americans agree. In 2008, Pew Research took a poll, asking which journalist they most admired. Stewart finished fourth. “Are Americans confused?” Pew asked in its release.

They weren’t. “The Daily Show closely resembles the news agenda of a number of cable news programs as well as talk radio,” Pew continued. “The program also makes heavy use of news footage, often in a documentary way that employs archival video to show contrast and contradiction, even if the purpose is satirical rather than reportorial.”

Another journalist finished right ahead of Stewart in the poll. It was Williams, who had already sat in NBC’s anchor chair for years, and was authoring a much quieter, but no less remarkable transition — the opposite of Stewart’s own. Williams was becoming a comedian.

Share this article Share

“Brian Williams: The funniest guy in the room,” Esquire sang in 2005. “What do you do call a former fireman from Jersey with a surprisingly quirky wit and no college degree? Anchorman.” But this anchor had gifts of showmanship more than any other major anchor of the modern era. He could make ’em laugh. This ability arguably brought more celebrity than even his best journalism.

“I’m forever getting approached in airports by people who say, ‘I saw you on Jon Stewart,'” he commented in the Esquire article. “‘I didn’t know you …’ There’s an uncomfortable pause, and I feel compelled to take them off the hook and finish the sentence: ‘… had a personality at all?’ ”

NBC suspends Brian Williams for six months + 29 NBC has suspended the anchor for six months without pay after it says he “misrepresented” events about his Iraq coverage.

As other anchors such as Katie Couric foundered in a new media environment cluttered with the likes of John Oliver and Stephen Colbert, Williams’s mixture of sternness at the news podium and irreverence on David Letterman’s show made him unique. “Though his career in comedy may have started by happenstance, Williams has managed to stay in the conversation because he can speak in the vernacular of his new competition,” New York Magazine writer John Swansburg said.

Williams got spot after spot on “The Daily Show,” “Late Show with David Letterman” and “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.” He acted in “30 Rock.” He did “Saturday Night Live.” He even lobbied NBC to give him Jay Leno’s chair at “The Tonight Show” a few years ago, as several outlets reported on Tuesday. “Brian wants to be a late-night comedian,” one former colleague told New York.

While lobbying, he exercised his comedic chops, dropping an epic bit on “Morning Joe” when he roasted the New York Times’ earnest, baffled coverage of Brooklyn.

“Once a day, there’s a story about all the riches offered in that borough,” Williams said as the other broadcasters cracked up. “There are young men and women wearing ironic glasses frames on the streets. There are open-air markets, like trading posts in the early Chippewa tribe, where you can make beads at home and then trade them for someone to come over and start a small fire in your apartment that you share with nine others. Artisanal cheeses, for sale on the streets of an entire American borough. It’s fascinating to watch the paper venture over the bridge. Venture through the tunnel. Go out to the outer reaches.”

This was very funny. And very accurate. It’s a combination that Jon Stewart is also pretty good at. So let’s honor Twitter God’s words: Let’s switch one for the other. As one Redditor pointed out: Williams has already “proven himself to be good at fake news.”

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/19/superbug-ucla-medical-center/23663747/",0,"The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday warned doctors and hospitals around the country that a commonly used medical scope could be difficult to clean and “may facilitate the spread of deadly bacteria.” The agency’s warning comes after seven patients were infected and two died from a drug-resistant “superbug” at UCLA’s Ronald Reagan Medical Center. Public health authorities are tracking down at least 179 other patients who might have been exposed to the dangerous bacteria through the use of contaminated medical scopes.

The affected patients suffered from a drug-resistant superbug known as CRE, or Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae, during “complex endoscopic procedures” to diagnose and treat diseases in the pancreas between October and January at the hospital, UCLA’s Health System said late Wednesday in an emailed statement.

In its warning on Thursday, the FDA noted that the medical scopes in question, known as duodenoscopes, are used in more than half a million procedures each year in the United States as the “least invasive way” of draining fluids from pancreatic and biliary ducts blocked by tumors, gallstones and other conditions. The light, flexible tubes are typically threaded through the mouth, throat, stomach, or into the top of the small intestine. Unlike other endoscopes, they have a movable “elevator” mechanism at one end that allows the instrument to treat problems with fluid drainage.

But that intricate design also can make the devices difficult to sterilize, the FDA said. Cleaning the scopes is “a detailed, multi-step process,” and meticulously following the manufacturer’s directions for disinfecting them “should reduce the risk of transmitting infection, but may not entirely eliminate it,” the agency said. The FDA also noted that recent medical publications and adverse event reports it had received had associated drug-resistant bacterial infections with patients who had undergone procedures using the scopes.

UCLA told the Los Angeles Times, which first reported the deadly infections, that it detected the bacteria last month while conducting tests on a patient and alerted both the California and Los Angeles County health departments. An internal investigation revealed that two medical endoscopes may have transmitted the infection, though the scopes had been sterilized in line with the manufacturer’s standards, it said.

Two people have died, at least seven others are possibly infected and more than 100 might have been exposed to a drug-resistant “superbug” at UCLA’s Ronald Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles. (Video: Reuters)

Health officials sent out letters this week to 179 patients who were possibly exposed to the bacteria through one of the endoscopes, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said in a statement.

“We notified all patients who had this type of procedure, and we were using seven different scopes. Only two of them were found to be infected. In an abundance of caution, we notified everybody,” UCLA spokesman Dale Tate told the Associated Press.

The CRE superbug has been described as a form of “nightmare bacteria” by Tom Frieden, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Our strongest antibiotics don’t work and patients are left with potentially untreatable infections,” he said. CRE infections, most of which happen in hospital settings, can lead to infections in the bladder or lungs, causing coughing, fever or chills. And, according to the CDC, the bacteria kills nearly half of patients who get infections in the bloodstream.

The patients infected at the Ronald Reagan Medical Center had undergone a procedure called an ERCP, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, the Los Angeles Times reported. The test uses an endoscope along with X-ray images to examine the pancreatic system to help diagnose tumors or treat gallstones, for instance. It is not the same one used for more common endoscopies and colonoscopies, the newspaper said.

Over the past couple years, similar outbreaks have occurred when contaminated scopes were used at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital near Chicago, where 44 people were infected, and at the Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, where at least 32 patients became ill and 11 died. Although it was unclear whether the outbreak in Seattle contributed to the deaths, the hospital stressed that medical professionals there, too, had cleaned the instruments according to the manufacturer’s stipulations.

“There is either a design issue to be addressed or a change to the guidelines for the cleaning process,” Andrew Ross, section chief of gastroenterology at Virginia Mason, told the Los Angeles Times. “It’s the role of the federal government to make some of those decisions.”

Olympus Medical Systems Group, which is UCLA’s endoscope supplier, told the Los Angeles Times it is working with the FDA as well as doctors and hospitals to address public health concerns.

Patients who may have been exposed at Ronald Reagan Medical Center have been given a home-testing kit that medical professionals will analyze. The university is now taking steps to ensure patients’ safety."
2384,2384,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/02/22/its-imperative-congress-fund-dhs-jeh-johnson-says/,0,"Americans must be vigilant in light of a terror threat calling for attacks at malls such as the Mall of America in Minnesota, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Sunday. ""If anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they've got to be particularly careful,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""There will be enhanced security there, but public vigilance, public awareness and public caution in situations like this is particularly important, and it's the environment we're in, frankly.""

Johnson’s comments came after the release of a video Saturday that was purported to be from the Somali militant group al-Shabab and called for attacks on malls in the United States, Canada and Britain. The video used footage of the 2013 attack on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi and specifically mentioned the Mall of America, in Bloomington, Minn.; West Edmonton Mall in Canada; and Westfield mall in Stratford, England, among others, as potential targets.

The video called on Muslims to conduct these attacks independently and quickly. “So hurry up, hasten towards heaven, and do not hesitate, for the disbelievers have no right whatsoever to rejoice in the safety of their lands until safety becomes a reality in Palestine and all the lands of Muslims,” an English-speaking narrator says in the video, provided by the Site Intelligence Group.

Johnson said Sunday that groups such as al-Shabab are ""relying more and more on independent actors to become inspired"" and ""attack on their own.""

He also said there was a need for a comprehensive approach to fighting the ever-present threat posed by terror groups, including the Islamic State, which is variously known as ISIS and ISIL.

""Groups like ISIL, al-Shabab, AQAP [al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] are now publicly calling for attacks, either through the Internet, through videos, through publications, which means that we need to respond militarily,"" he said. ""But we also have to have a whole government approach to law enforcement.""

DHS Undersecretary Suzanne E. Spaulding elaborated on such an approach during a Senate hearing last fall. She noted that government officials routinely work with the private sector to understand the scope of threats they face and to share information and training. For instance, she said the DHS and the Energy Department regularly provide threat briefings to energy company CEOs and other executives about physical threats and cyberthreats. She also referenced the 2013 attack in Kenya.

""In the wake of the terrorist attack on the shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, DHS and the FBI engaged more than 400 major malls across the United States to facilitate table-top exercises based on a similar attack involving active shooters and the use of improved explosive devices,"" Spaulding told lawmakers, according to a transcript.

The Mall of America released a statement Sunday indicating that it takes potential threats seriously and that it had increased security.

Johnson also said Sunday that he hopes Congress this week will ""finally come together"" and pass an appropriations bill that would not defund DHS. Should it be defunded, his headquarters staff would be ""dialed back to a skeleton,"" he said on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""

Johnson has condemned House Republicans for their efforts to defund DHS over President Obama's immigration executive action.

""I'm a little frustrated, frankly, because when I talked to my friends on the Senate side, they say, 'Go talk to the House.' And when I go talk to my friends on the House side, they say, 'It's not me, I passed my bill. Go talk to the Senate,'"" he said Sunday.

Johnson also dived into the debate over how to refer to the Islamic State.

On ""Fox News Sunday,"" he said that calling the militant organization an Islamic group gives it ""more dignity than it deserves."" He said the president's refusal to tie the militant organization to ""radical Islam"" is more about not giving the group religious ""legitimacy"" than about being politically correct.

""To say that they are in any form Islamic cedes to them a playing field that they would like to be drawn into,"" he said.

After making the rounds of the Sunday talk shows, Johnson also addressed the National Governors Association winter meeting in Washington, where he again outlined the consequences of an agency shutdown.

Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott (R), in an interview, disputed as ""baloney"" warnings by Johnson of the potential impact on states and cities, noting that all essential personnel would still be on the job even if funding is halted.

Abbott also said that in light of the recent court ruling blocking implementation of the president's executive actions, it is now the Democrats who stand as the major obstacle to passing legislation in Congress. ""It would be irresponsible,"" he said, for Democrats to block action this week."

http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/01/politics/obama-benjamin-netanyahu-clash/index.html",0,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that his planned speech to Congress is not meant to signal any disrespect for President Obama, nor to insert political partisanship into the U.S.-Israel relationship. “Never has so much been written about a speech that hasn’t been given,” Netanyahu said about the address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday. “My speech is not intended to show any disrespect to President Obama or the esteemed office that he holds. I have great respect for both.”

Speaking at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on Monday, Netanyahu said he intends to focus his remarks to Congress on the potential of an international nuclear deal with Iran that he believes could ""threaten the survival of Israel.""

Netanyahu said those who see a partisan motive in his address have misconstrued his purpose. He has frequently addressed AIPAC, but he has never before addressed Congress without the expressed blessing of the White House. Netanyahu was invited to speak by House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who did not inform the White House of the invitation in advance.

“Israel has always been a bipartisan issue,” he said. “Israel should always remain a bipartisan issue.” Netanyahu said his purpose Tuesday is not to ""inject Israel into the American partisan debate.""

Speaking at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual policy conference on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he did not intend upcoming address to Congress to be divisive or disrespectful to President Obama. (Video: AP)

Deploying one of the visual aids for which his international speeches have become known, Netanyahu said Iran is such a large threat to Israel’s future that he cannot stay silent.

He displayed a map showing Iran’s alleged support of terrorism on five continents, and accused Iran of ""developing, as we speak, the capacity to make nuclear weapons, lots of them.”

Netanyahu said he wants to make his case before Congress, where there is bipartisan legislation that would impose additional sanctions on Iran. President Obama has said he would veto the bill. Netanyahu's stance on Iran puts him at odds with the Obama administration, which has been working to hammer out a nuclear deal with Iran. Secretary of State John F. Kerry is scheduled to meet Tuesday morning with his Iranian counterpart in Geneva to work out the framework of the deal before a March 24 deadline.

“The purpose of my speech to Congress tomorrow is to speak up about a potential deal with Iran that could threaten Israel’s future,” Netanyahu said. He said he had a moral obligation to speak up ahead of the deadline.

Israel is strong but vulnerable, and it must not only defend itself militarily but stand up for itself on the world stage, Netanyahu said.

“We have a voice,"" he said. ""Tomorrow, as prime minister of the one and only Jewish state, I plan to use that voice,” he added to applause.

President Obama said in an interview with Reuters on Monday that the speech is a disruption that will not permanently damage U.S.-Israel relations.

President Obama dismisses speculation that relations between Washington and Israel are strained, saying “we actually share a goal, which is making sure that Iran does not have a nuclear weapon.” (Video: Reuters)

Obama said that while there is ""substantial disagreement"" between the two countries on whether to broker an international deal to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, the fissure will not be ""permanently destructive"" to the relationship.

Netanyahu's trip to Washington is extraordinary, both in the content of the speech he is scheduled to give Tuesday and the fissures that it has created between the Israeli government and the White House, leading Jewish American groups and Jewish Democrats.

“Disagreements between allies are only natural” and nothing new, Netanyahu said, and understandable given the different role and geography of the United States and Israel. He ticked off several past periods of tension, each of which passed without permanent damage to the U.S.-Israeli bond, and said that Israel and the United States are more like a family than friends.

“Disagreements in the family are always uncomfortable, but we must always remember that we are family,” he said.

The White House said Obama would not meet with Netanyahu because the speech is so close to Israel's elections. Obama told Retuers he would be more than happy to meet with Netanyahu after election day.

""This is not a personal issue. I think that it is important for every country in its relationship with the United States to recognize that the U.S. has a process of making policy,"" Obama said.

Share this article Share

When asked if Obama watched the AIPAC speech, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, ""I don't believe that he did.""

Netanyahu spoke shortly after the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, defended the Obama administration’s approach to negotiations with Iran over that country's nuclear program and pledged anew that the United States will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. She said U.S. support for Israel is bipartisan, and that U.S. promises to the partnership with Israel are ""bedrock commitments.""

Tensions between the two sides have been coming to a boiling point since Netanyahu's speech was announced in January. They rapidly escalated last week, after national security adviser Susan E. Rice, who is also scheduled to speak at the conference Monday evening, denounced Netanyahu's speech to Congress, calling it ""destructive"" to the relationship between the United States and Israel. Rice said it ""injected a degree of partisanship"" to the bond between the two countries.

""It's always been bipartisan. We need to keep it that way. We want it that way. I think Israel wants it that way. The American people want it that way. And when it becomes injected or infused with politics, that's a problem,"" Rice said.

Netanyahu is facing a tougher-than-expected contest for reelection to an unprecedented fourth term on March 17.

Kerry tried to tamp down tensions over the past few days, and Monday he said that anti-Israel bias by the U.N. Human Rights Panel is undercutting its mission.

""The United States will oppose any effort by any group or any participant to abuse the U.N. system in order to delegitimize or isolate Israel,"" Kerry said from Geneva, where he is negotiating ahead of the March 24 deadline for the Iran nuclear deal.

""Israel's security is absolutely at the forefront of all of our minds, but frankly, so is the security of all the other countries in the region, so is our security in the United States,"" Kerry said.

President Obama laid out the parameters of a potential plan to Reuters, asserting that Iran must commit to freezing its nuclear program for at least 10 years for an agreement to be reached. Obama said the likelihood of an agreement is not certain; Earnest said odds were ""only at best 50-50"" Monday afternoon.

“If, in fact, Iran is willing to agree to double-digit years of keeping their program where it is right now and, in fact, rolling back elements of it that currently exist ... if we’ve got that, and we’ve got a way of verifying that, there’s no other steps we can take that would give us such assurance that they don’t have a nuclear weapon,"" Obama said in the interview.

Obama said a major hurdle would be Iran agreeing to exacting demands for inspection and keeping enriched uranium levels very low.

""But if they do agree to it, it would be far more effective in controlling their nuclear program than any military action we could take, any military action Israel could take and far more effective than sanctions will be,"" Obama said.

While Netanyahu is adamantly against a deal, Earnest said the prime minister has not ""laid out that strategy"" to prevent Iran from creating a nuclear weapon, while Obama has.

Obama, as Secretary of State John Kerry said last week, asserted that Netanyahu has been wrong on Iran before, when he opposed a 2013 interim deal with the country.

""Netanyahu made all sorts of claims. This was going to be a terrible deal. This was going to result in Iran getting $50 billion worth of relief. Iran would not abide by the agreement. None of that has come true,"" Obama said. ""It has turned out that in fact, during this period we’ve seen Iran not advance its program. In many ways, it’s rolled back elements of its program.""

The invitation has also rankled congressional Democrats, many of whom will not attend the speech. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said that Netanyahu's point of view is not emblematic of the entire Jewish community, which he claimed he would be representing in his speech to Congress.

""He doesn't speak for me on this,” the California Democrat said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union."" ""I think it's a rather arrogant statement. I think the Jewish community is like any other community. There are different points of view. I think that arrogance does not befit Israel, candidly.""

High-ranking Democrats have said they will boycott the speech. Netanyahu has declined a meeting with Democratic lawmakers, writing in a letter that it ""could compound the misperception of partisanship regarding my upcoming visit."""

The plan, which the leaders pitched to rank-and-file Republicans in a closed-door meeting, was the first sign they were willing to pass a new bill after passing another one weeks ago that takes aim at President Obama’s executive actions on immigration and has been blocked in the Senate. But the plan faces an uncertain outlook, as House Democratic leadership decided to marshal support against it.

Facing a Friday-night-into-Saturday-morning shutdown deadline, the plan might ultimately win support from lawmakers in both parties on Friday. But its passage would only continue a standoff between the House and the Senate over longer-term DHS funding. Separately, the Senate was moving toward a final vote on a funding bill that would not go after Obama’s immigration directives.

Exiting the House GOP meeting, Republican members said the leadership presented the plan as a way to allow time for the House and Senate to try to go to conference on their competing bills. But Senate Democratic leaders have rejected the idea of a conference.

Rep. Walter B. Jones (R-N.C.), a foe of House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), said that he would not support the plan but that of those who spoke, a “majority, probably, are inclined to support it.”

Rep. Richard B. Nugent (R-Fla.), who has also clashed with Boehner, said he would support the proposal.

“I think the speaker has laid out a plan. Obviously, he can’t control what the Senate does,” Nugent said.

The GOP meeting came as the Senate’s bill appeared unlikely to face tactical delays from rogue conservative senators who want to battle Obama. The measure could win final passage Friday.

One of the leading critics of the president’s immigration actions, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), said he did not plan to hold up the measure and was “not aware” of others planning to do so.

“I think it’s appropriate to move forward with the bill,” Sessions said. “Ideas about how the process will go forward seem to be firming up. I’m not happy with them, but I’m not interested in delay merely for the sake of delay.”

But House Republican leaders, bent on fighting Obama’s directives, did not embrace the Senate plan.

Boehner declined to say whether he would take the Senate bill up in his chamber. He said Thursday morning that the House has done its part by passing its own bill.

""We'll wait to see what the Senate can or can't do,"" Boehner told reporters. He accused Senate Democrats of ""blackmail to protect the actions of the president.""

Meanwhile, Democrats ramped up pressure on Boehner to take up the measure. Speaking at a joint news conference, Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called on Boehner to swiftly bring it to a vote and warned Boehner not to amend it with immigration riders.

“It is a waste of time. We will not allow a conference to take place,” said Reid, addressing the possibility of a House-Senate conference.

The Senate bill, which Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) put forward after it became clear the House bill would not advance in his chamber, already cleared a key procedural hurdle. It remained possible the Senate could vote on it Friday.

Reid declined to say whether he would try to block a short-term stopgap bill if the House passed one. Pelosi argued that a short-term bill is not an ideal solution.

“It’s harmful to our national security, our homeland security, for us to be inching along, whether it’s two months, four months,” she said.

Congressional Democratic aides sent conflicting signals Thursday evening. Some suggested their leadership would probably supply enough votes for the bill while others said they would try to defeat it.

“If House Republicans want to end up with another manufactured crisis that risks our national security in a matter of days, they can do it with 218 votes of their own,” said a House Democratic leadership aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy.

Democrats pointed to dangers the United States is confronting as the DHS debate is unfolding. They cited the threat of the Islamic State, the mass shooting at a French satirical newspaper and concerns about disaster preparedness.

And Democrats lambasted the Republicans for not moving more quickly.

“I have a grandson in eighth grade, and his knowledge about how to pass a bill is superior to what we’ve seen among the Republicans,” Pelosi said.

At least one member said he would forgo pay during a DHS shutdown, in solidarity with nonessential employees facing the prospect of a furlough.

""As long as the employees of the Department of Homeland Security including Border Patrol, Coast Guard and TSA are working while not receiving paychecks, I will ask that my paycheck be withheld,"" Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) said in a statement.

Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), a conservative critic of GOP leadership, said Boehner is handling the DHS fight “as best as can be expected.” But in a sign of lingering House-Senate tension, Huelskamp lashed out at McConnell.

“Harry Reid’s still in charge. There are going to be millions of folks that helped change the Senate from Democrat to Republican [who] are going to be disappointed in Senator McConnell,” he said."

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/robert-gibbs-hillary-clinton-private-emails-115689.html?hp=rc3_4",0,"Hillary Rodham Clinton used a private e-mail account for her official government business when she was secretary of state and did not routinely preserve and turn over those e-mails for government records collection, the State Department said Monday. Clinton has turned over thousands of e-mails to the department from her private account, a step that was first reported by the New York Times late Monday. The private account came to light when the department sought records from Clinton and other former secretaries who have held the post during the e-mail age.

Some 300 of Clinton’s recovered e-mails were then turned over to a congressional committee investigating the 2012 deaths of four Americans at U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

“Last year, the Department sent a letter to representatives of former secretaries of state requesting they submit any records in their possession for proper preservation,” Psaki said in a statement. “In response to our request, Secretary Clinton provided the Department with e-mails spanning her time at the Department. After the State Department reviewed those e-mails, we produced about 300 e-mails responsive to recent requests from the Select Committee.”

Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement Tuesday: “Like secretaries of state before her, she used her own email account when engaging with any Department officials. For government business, she emailed them on their Department accounts, with every expectation they would be retained.”

Clinton “immediately said yes” when the State Department asked former secretaries last year for help preserving e-mail records, he said.

“Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved,” Merrill said.

It was not clear why Clinton, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, created the private account. But the practice appears to bolster long-standing criticism that Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, have not been transparent.

“Hillary Clinton should release her e-mails,” said Kristy Campbell, a spokeswoman for former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who is also weighing a presidential bid. “Hopefully she hasn’t already destroyed them.”

Share this article Share

Campbell noted that Bush ­created a Web site, at ­www.jebemails.com, providing public access to his electronic communications while in office. ""Governor Bush believes transparency is a critical part of public service and of governing,"" she said in a statement.

Clinton’s aides reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal e-mails and decided which ones to turn over to the State Department, the Times reported. In total, 55,000 pages of e-mails were turned over, the newspaper reported.

Clinton was not the first secretary of state to use a private account. The State Department said Clinton’s successor as top diplomat, John F. Kerry, is the first secretary to use a standard government e-mail address ending in “state.gov.”

Psaki played down the effect of Clinton’s use of a private account.

“The State Department has long had access to a wide array of Secretary Clinton’s records — including emails between her and Department officials with state.gov accounts, as well as cables,” Psaki said in the statement.

Clinton never had such an address and relied exclusively on the private account, the Times reported. The Times said Clinton’s aides took no action during her four years as secretary to ensure that the records would be preserved on department servers, as required by the Federal Records Act.

It is not clear whether Clinton retained copies of all the e-mails from her four years at the department.

“The department is in the process of updating our records preservation policies to bring them in line with recent 2013 National Archives and Records Administration guidance,” Psaki said. “These steps include regularly archiving all of Secretary Kerry’s emails to ensure that we are capturing all federal records.”"

http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/04/politics/election-2016-hillary-clinton-critics/index.html",0,"A congressional committee issued subpoenas Wednesday seeking information about Hillary Rodham Clinton’s use of a private e-mail account for official business while she was secretary of state, setting up a potential legal clash with the presumptive Democratic front-runner for president. The move followed the revelation that Clinton had installed a private server at her New York home that allowed her, and not the State Department, to store her e-mail correspondence and later decide which ones to turn over as public records.

The subpoenas, sent by the special House committee probing the fatal 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, reflected the angry response more broadly from Republican lawmakers and conservative watchdogs who said Clinton’s private e-mail system allowed her to evade scrutiny from investigations and legal proceedings.

Late Wednesday, Clinton responded to the issue for the first time tweeting, “I want the public to see my e-mail. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.”

In a tense exchange with reporters, State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf denied anything inappropriate occurred after revelations that former secretary of state Hillary Clinton used a private e-mail account for work. (Video: C-SPAN)

Marie Harf, deputy state department spokeswoman, said the e-mails provided by Clinton will be reviewed for public release “using a normal process” that guides such releases. “We will undertake this review as quickly as possible,” she said. “Given the sheer volume of the document set, this review will take some time to complete.”

Meanwhile, government transparency advocates expressed concern over the level of control Clinton had asserted over her records. Security experts wondered if hackers could exploit weaknesses in the Clinton server to gain access to sensitive information.

And, on the political front, some Democrats worried about whether the e-mail issue would damage Clinton’s strength as a presidential candidate.

“There’s always another shoe to drop with Hillary,” said Dick Harpootlian, a former Democratic Party chairman in South Carolina who has said he hopes Vice President Biden runs. “Do we nominate her not knowing what’s in those e-mails?”

The subpoenas issued Wednesday seek all Clinton e-mails related to Libya during her time as secretary of state — an attempt to collect new e-mails sent from the clintonemail.com domain, the private account Clinton established when she took office in 2009.

Also Wednesday, the president of Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, said the organization is considering filing legal petitions to reopen as many as nine cases in which the group unsuccessfully sought public records from the State Department. The cases were either dismissed, closed or settled after the administration claimed it found no records involving Clinton related to the group’s requests.

Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail address that she used while secretary of state reinforces everything people don’t like about her, argues The Post’s Chris Cillizza, and is very dangerous to her presidential ambitions. (Video: The Washington Post)

And other lawmakers who have tried to investigate Clinton’s tenure at State said they were outraged and felt misled, and were concerned many of the public records they had requested had not been provided because of the use of private e-mail.

State Department officials have confirmed that Clinton exclusively used a personal account, instead of a government e-mail address, during her time in office.

Instead of using State Department servers to send and receive those e-mails, she used a server housed at her private home in Chappaqua, N.Y., a Clinton ally familiar with her e-mail practices confirmed Wednesday. The server’s existence was first reported by the Associated Press.

The Clinton ally said the server and e-mail addresses were established after the conclusion of Clinton’s unsuccessful bid for president in 2008, as she was transitioning away from using an account held by her defunct campaign.

Neither State Department officials nor Clinton aides would provide information about which officials had signed off on the arrangement, whether a legal analysis was performed and whether any agency officials ever raised questions about Clinton’s e-mail system.

Beyond her late night tweet, Clinton herself has not addressed the e-mail issue, and her spokesman has not expanded on a brief statement issued Monday, in which he said Clinton had complied with both the letter and spirit of the law. The spokesman, Nick Merrill, also said that other secretaries of state have used private e-mail accounts.

State Department officials said Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of e-mail records last year after officials requested that former secretaries turn over public documents in their possession.

But, agency officials said, the decision over which e-mails would be deemed public record fell to Clinton and her private advisers — not to government officials or archivists.

State Department spokesman Harf told reporters Wednesday that she could not answer “when it was set up, and all that.” She referred questions about the system’s security to Clinton’s personal office.

Harf said there was no indication that Clinton had used the account for classified information, but she acknowledged that she was relying on information conveyed by Clinton and her aides.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest also defended Clinton, saying he had seen no evidence to suggest Clinton’s team had failed to turn over everything in its possession. But Earnest also took pains to say that he was relying on the Clinton team for his information.

“I also want to just be crystal clear about the fact that this is a responsibility that they assumed,” he said.

Federal regulations in place while Clinton was in office required that e-mails sent on non-government accounts be preserved in the “appropriate agency record-keeping system.” Harf said the regulation contained no “time requirement” to turn over records, meaning Clinton’s response — more than a year after she left office — complied.

But government transparency advocates said the use of a private e-mail account and a private server meant that for years, Clinton’s e-mails were off-limits to public records requests filed with the State Department.

The long delay in turning records over to the State Department also places enormous power in the hands of her closest aides to decide which of her e-mails should be made public and which should be shielded from view.

“There’s no legitimate way to claim that there wasn’t a requirement, certainly to keep with the spirit of the law, to make real-time copies available to the agency,” said David Sobel, senior counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

In Congress, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said new subpoenas were a good step because lawmakers do not have confidence Clinton has turned over all of her relevant e-mails to the State Department.

Agency officials have said they have submitted 300 of Clinton’s e-mails to the committee investigating the Benghazi attack.

“The prime reason to set up an account like this is to skirt the law, avoid disclosure,” Chaffetz said. “The question isn’t the number of e-mails she has turned over, it’s the percentage. I want to know who decided what we could see.”

Likewise, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said he is concerned that the State Department did not turn over all e-mails by Clinton aide Huma Abedin that he requested in 2013 as part of an effort to see whether Abedin was simultaneously working for the government and an outside consulting firm.

Abedin, like Clinton, sometimes used a private clintonemail.com account.

“The trend of using private e-mail for public business is detrimental to good government,” Grassley said. “The public’s business ought to be public with few exceptions.”

A number of Democrats insisted Wednesday that the e-mail issue would fade quickly in voter’s minds.

2420,2420,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/03/12/christie-allies-launch-super-pac/,0,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s allies have launched a new super PAC to beef up the presidential hopeful’s campaign-in-waiting, allowing his supporters to raise unlimited sums of money and bucking critics who say his potential White House bid is already in trouble. Phil Cox, the former executive director to the Republican Governors Association, on Thursday launched the America Leads super PAC amid an increasingly fierce competition for top donors among potential GOP candidates. Cox, who worked for Christie when he chaired the RGA during the 2014 election cycle, will serve as director of the new political action committee.

""He’s provided effective, conservative leadership in a deep blue state, bringing people together to solve difficult problems and get results. That’s exactly the kind of leadership we need in America today, and we hope he decides to run,"" said Cox. “I’ve established this Super PAC because it’s time for America to lead again, and I believe Governor Christie is exactly the kind of strong leader we need at this critical point in our nation’s history.""

Super PACS have emerged as a top priority for potential candidates eager to raise large sums of money to bolster their candidacies. That is particularly true in the fledgling GOP field this cycle, which is already crowded with candidates fighting for top donors.

The pro-Christie America Leads is just the latest such organization. Per a Thursday story by Matea Gold:

Already, operatives with close ties to eight likely White House contenders have launched political committees that can accept unlimited donations — before any of them has even declared their candidacy. ...

The goal is simple: Potential candidates want to help their super PAC allies raise as much money as possible now, before their official campaigns start. That’s because once they announce their bids, federal rules require them to keep their distance.

Paige Hahn, who worked alongside Cox as the RGA’s top finance operative, will join American Leads as finance director. Cox has also brought on Meredith O’Rourke, a leading Republican fundraising operative in Florida, as a financing consultant.

One of the big benefactors of the new super PAC is expected to be Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone, who told The Washington Post recently that he was prepared to contribute substantial sums to the group when it launched.

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Christie’s Leadership Matters PAC has also brought on three former George W. Bush campaign advisers: Brian Jones, Cary Evans and Kevin Shuvalov."

http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/16/us/robert-durst-arrest/index.html",0,"From the moment the HBO series “The Jinx” made its debut, it has been called “the new ‘Serial.'” Both the series and the podcast are about unsolved murders. Both let viewers into the process of uncovering what happened. Both tell stories so compelling, it’s easy to sometimes forget the characters are real. But on Saturday, HBO achieved something “Serial” never could. The subject of its six-episode documentary “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst” has been arrested.

Robert Durst, a New York real-estate heir, is known for his alleged connection to three deaths: his wife, who went missing in 1982; his neighbor, who was dismembered in 2001; and a close friend, who was shot in the head in 2000. Until Saturday, the 71-year-old has walked free.

Robert Durst on HBO’s ‘The Jinx’: I ‘killed them all.’ + 38 The New York real-estate heir known for his alleged connections to three deaths was arrested on the eve of the show’s finale.

On March 8, HBO aired the fifth and penultimate episode of “The Jinx,” which included a previously uncovered piece of evidence. On the eve of the finale, Durst was arrested in New Orleans in connection to the murder of his friend, Susan Berman, a little more than 14 years ago. Sunday night, the final episode aired. In its closing minutes, Durst says, “What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.”

He was not speaking to the camera and was seemingly unaware his words were being recorded — but he had left his microphone on while using the bathroom.

Earlier in the day, Durst’s attorney, Chip Lewis, told The Post: “He’s maintained his innocence for 10 years now. Nothing has changed.” It is unclear whether Lewis knew about Durst’s bathroom comments, or whether the recording will be admissible in court.

The attorney accused prosecutors and the documentary’s director, Andrew Jarecki, of timing the arrest as a publicity stunt for the last episode. In January, Jarecki all but promised TV critics and reporters that the “The Jinx” would end with a satisfying conclusion — something many thought “Serial” lacked because host Sarah Koenig ended the podcast with no concrete theory. The widely publicized arrest and the audio of what could be interpreted as a confession surely fits the bar he set.

Durst has been a willing participant in the series that may have brought about his downfall. He spent more than 20 hours in interviews with filmmaker Jarecki, who has been researching Durst for eight years. Jarecki’s 2010 film “All Good Things” was a fictionalized version of the Durst story, in which Ryan Gosling played a somewhat-empathetic version of a killer.

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Jarecki said that Durst came to him after seeing the film, admitting it made him cry three times. The two have been working together ever since, with Durst agreeing to let Jarecki ask any question.

It wasn’t a question that led to the arrest, however. In an episode titled “Family Values,” the filmmakers met with the stepson of Berman, Durst’s friend who was found dead on Christmas Eve, 2000. Police were led to her body by a letter that told them of a “cadaver” at her address.

That letter was addressed “Beverley Hills Police” in block letters. Beverly is misspelled.

At the end of episode five, Berman’s stepson shows the filmmakers a letter from Durst to Berman from the March before she was murdered. On the envelope, Durst wrote Berman’s address in block letters. He spelled “Beverly” as “Beverley.”

Durst had known Berman, a writer and daughter of a known Las Vegas mobster, since they met at the University of California in the 1960s. When Durst’s wife Kathie went missing in from their house in New York in 1982, Berman asserted Durst’s innocence to the media. In the series, Jarecki seems to be hinting that Berman helped Durst hide Kathie’s body.

He asks Durst about his habit of making collect calls to his family company, the Durst Organization. Soon after Kathie went missing, a number of collect calls were made to the company from an area known as the Pine Barrens in New Jersey. This heavily-wooded land had the reputation of being a dumping ground for the bodies of Mafia victims.

“And what connection is that?” asks Kevin Hynes, the assistant district attorney on the case. “Well, Susan Berman who was very friendly with [Durst] at the time, had a lot of connections and a lot of friends in organized crime.”

The filmmakers take you to the places Durst might have been, like the Pine Barrens, and what they can’t show you live footage of, they recreate. Durst appears on screen to rebut theories and allegations. Wearing a grey cable sweater and khaki pants, he nearly always speaks calmly, like an eccentric 71-year-old man recounting an old story, not a man from one of the richest families in New York trying to convince you he’s not a triple-murderer.

Until the final episode, Durst has maintained in the series that he did not kill his wife and does not know where her body is. The camera crew had already packed up from the day’s interviewing but the recorder kept rolling as Durst went to the bathroom.

It appears he was talking to himself, making comments that included: “There it is, you’re caught. You’re right of course, but you can’t imagine. Arrest him. . . . What a disaster. . . .I’m having difficulty with the question.” Then follows the “I killed them all” line.

Filmmakers told the New York Times they didn’t find the recording for more than two years.

Durst admitted to killing one of the three persons that “them all” could inlude: his 71-year-old neighbor, Morris Black. In 2001, Durst was living in Galveston, Texas, dressing as a female to avoid media attention about the reopened investigation of his wife’s disappearance.

He testified that his neighbor, who he was friends with for a time, sneaked into his apartment. When a scuffle occurred between the two men, Durst shot his neighbor accidentally in self-defense. He then “panicked,” cut up the body with a bow saw and dumped it into Galveston Bay. Black’s head was never found.

After four days of deliberation, the jury acquitted Durst.

Judge Susan Criss, who oversaw the Galveston trial, told The Post Sunday she could not be more thrilled that Durst was arrested. “Presiding over that trial was like watching a slow train wreck. The prosecution dropped the ball every step of the way and the defense came prepared,” Criss said.



Durst was eerily calm, the judge said, and there were times when he even seemed charming. She thinks she was dealing with an exceptionally cunning serial killer, a man made all the more dangerous by his financial resources.

“I saw the pictures of the cut up body,” she said. “That body was cut up like it had been done by a surgeon. He knew what sort of tool to use for this bone and that muscle. It would have been impossible for someone to do that if it was their first murder attempt. That is a cold, calculating act.”

The Durst Organization, his family’s prominent real estate company, also applauded the arrest. In a statement to CNBC, Durst’s brother Douglas said, “We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst. We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done.”

Durst has been estranged from his family for years: when his father cut him out of the line of succession for the family’s real estate empire in 1994, Durst is said to have urinated in his uncle’s waste basket.

His penchant for theatrics might be what drove Durst to allow — and assist — Jarecki in publicly dissecting his life.

“He has a compulsion to tell his story, and frankly I think he enjoys the feeling of being at risk,” the filmmaker told the Los Angeles Times in February. “He knows that this is a very live ball, that he hasn’t been prosecuted for two of the three murders that he’s been accused of.”

Jarecki declined an interview request on Sunday.

“We simply cannot say enough about the brilliant job that Andrew Jarecki and [producer] Marc Smerling did in producing The Jinx,” HBO said in a statement. “Years in the making, their thorough research and dogged reporting reignited interest in Robert Durst’s story with the public and law enforcement.”

Coincidence or not, there’s no doubt the timing of Durst’s arrest will lead to a surge in viewers for “The Jinx.” The accused himself, meanwhile, will be sitting in a New Orleans jail cell or on his way back to California to face the murder charge.

“We’ll saddle up and head west,” Durst’s lawyer said. “And handle this one just like we did this last one.”

With the clock ticking, diplomats from the six world powers conducting the negotiations with Iran held a string of meetings that have come to resemble an endurance test in their search for a preliminary agreement.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who arrived Sunday, left for Moscow, and his spokeswoman said he would return if a deal seems realistic.

Many assessments were measured, with success and failure deemed equally plausible.

Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who has been negotiating with the Iranians in Lausanne since Thursday, said that difficult issues remain on the table.

“We are working very hard to work those through,” he said Monday. “We are working late into the night and obviously into tomorrow. We are working with a view to get something done. There is a little more light there today, but there are still some tricky issues. Everyone knows the meaning of tomorrow.”

Gerard Arnaud, the French ambassador to Washington, said on Twitter, “Very substantial problems remain to be solved.”

Marie Harf, a spokeswoman for the State Department, put the odds of an agreement at 50-50. “There’s a chance we will get it done,” she said.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters that he was “cautiously optimistic” and saying that “positions are narrowing.”

As the deadline approached, the negotiators worked to settle some core issues: What kind of nuclear research would Iran be allowed to pursue in the final five years of a 15-year accord? When can the United Nations’ sanctions be eased? Will the sanctions be lifted or merely suspended so that they can be slapped back into place if Iran does not meet its commitments?

Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister, tweeted that because the talks were ongoing, negotiators had not started drafting a document that outlines agreed-upon principles that would guide further discussions on complex scientific details. A final agreement is to be worked out by the end of June.

The White House said that President Obama has been receiving regular updates from the negotiating team, which is led by Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, and it predicted that the talks would stretch into the final hours.

“I’m not going to presuppose failure,” White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. “Those negotiations are going to go down to the wire.”

In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement saying that the negotiators were turning a blind eye to Iranian ""aggression"" supporting Houthi rebels in Yemen.

“The agreement being formulated in Lausanne sends a message that there is no price for aggression and, on the contrary, that Iran’s aggression is to be rewarded,” he said.

“The moderate and responsible countries in the region, especially Israel and also many other countries, will be the first to be hurt by this agreement. One cannot understand that when forces supported by Iran continue to conquer more ground in Yemen, in Lausanne they are closing their eyes to this aggression.”

The Tuesday deadline is crucial for U.S. negotiators, because Obama and Kerry have said that if a framework agreement is not reached by then, they will have to assess whether to continue the process. But an interim agreement, under which Iran has limited its nuclear output, does not expire until June 30. Negotiators from France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia have expressed less urgency about getting some sort of understanding outlined by midnight Tuesday.

An agreement, if there is one, could still be difficult to sell to a skeptical Congress — and many Americans.

“The very notion of America compromising with Iran is very difficult,” said Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, who is in Lausanne and following the talks. “We’re dealing with what America thinks of as a Third World country, and the United States doesn’t have to compromise.

“But this is not about discussing Iran’s capitulation. It’s a negotiation.”

Parsi said that Araghchi may have been practicing some last-minute brinkmanship when he told Iranian reporters Sunday that Tehran would not send most of its stockpiles of enriched uranium to Russia.

Araghchi has made similar comments in recent months, and Tehran swiftly denied that any decision on stockpiles had been reached. A senior State Department official said that the fate of Iran’s stockpiles is still open for discussion.

“Iran has by and large accepted American demands,” Parsi said. “What it’s not accepting is what it’s getting in return. The United States has said it won’t lift sanctions upfront. But it may have to.”

2464,2464,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/04/01/arkansas-governor-cites-his-son-while-rejecting-religious-freedom-bill-that-says-it-all/,0,"In his announcement Wednesday that he wouldn't sign a ""religious freedom"" bill that had reached his desk, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) offered a personal example of the contentiousness of the issue. ""My son Seth signed the petition asking me to veto the bill,"" he said. Given Hutchinson's son's politics, that's not a big surprise. Seth Hutchinson is an organizer with the Texas State Employees Union and has been ""a progressive since college days,"" according to this Arkansas Times story.

But there's another reason it's not a surprise: Seth Hutchinson is a generation younger than his father. And in the politics of gay rights, that makes a big difference.

The closest such metric that's been measured the most consistently in recent years is the level of support for gay marriage. Last May, Gallup reported that nearly 80 percent of people aged 18 to 29 support the legalization of gay marriage, compared with 42 percent of those 65 and older. (Asa Hutchinson is 64 -- in the group that was at 48 percent support in the poll.) Younger people have consistently been more supportive of legalized gay marriage, but the margin at this point is wide.

Share this article Share

What's more, gay marriage is supported by a wide majority of young Republicans, according to a survey from Pew Research last March. It found a slightly lower level of support among young people, but still a big difference in support by generation.

And it goes beyond gay marriage. On Tuesday, the Daily Beast declared millennials to be the ""gayest generation,"" based on how many identify as gay or bisexual. We noted a poll earlier this week showing that more millennials -- those born between 1980 and the early 2000s -- considered homosexual relationships to be less immoral than casual sex. That's a stark difference from their parents -- governor or no.

The debate over religious freedom bills isn't only a debate over the rights of gay couples, but it has certainly become a proxy for that fight. Asa Hutchinson's generation is still the one in power, but it's Seth Hutchinson's generation that seems to be calling the shots on gay rights.

Seth certainly won this battle."

http://theweek.com/articles/547098/insane-national-freakout-over-indianas-religious-freedom-law",0,"Republican lawmakers in Indiana promised Monday to amend a religious liberties bill that critics have labeled as anti-gay, bowing to protests that have rapidly spread to several other states considering similar measures. Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma (R) said the legislature would act as soon as this week to ""clarify"" the state's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which grants individuals and businesses legal grounds to defend themselves against claims of discrimination. The fix, Bosma said, would make clear that the law does not allow people to discriminate against gays, as critics contend.

Opponents of the measure say the fix suggested by Bosma and other Republicans is vague and probably insufficient. Meanwhile, criticism of the act, signed into law last week by Gov. Mike Pence (R), continued to mount.

Apple chief executive Tim Cook condemned the law in an op-ed in The Washington Post. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) wrote a letter to the Indianapolis Star inviting business leaders troubled by the law to move to Virginia. The president of the NCAA hinted that the Indiana-based athletic organization may stop holding major events there. And the rock band Wilco canceled a May 7 show in Indianapolis.

In addition, the Star devoted its entire front page Tuesday to an editorial about the law under the headline “FIX THIS NOW.”

The pressure was reverberating in other states, where some GOP leaders postponed consideration of their own religious freedom laws or disavowed them outright.

In Georgia, lawmakers canceled a hearing set for Monday morning on their version of the bill. In Arkansas, lawmakers debated tweaking a bill that passed the Senate last week, perhaps limiting its reach. And in North Carolina, Gov. Pat McCrory (R) said he was not inclined to sign a bill working its way through the statehouse. “What is the problem they’re trying to solve?” he asked Monday on WFAE’s “Charlotte Talks” radio program. The bill, he said, would “make no sense.”

The debate injected a divisive new issue into the 2016 presidential campaign, presenting Republican hopefuls with a difficult choice: publicly back Pence on an issue that threatens to hurt the GOP among the majority of Americans who support gay rights, or side with the party’s business wing against the law and risk angering base conservatives.

In recent days, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), former Texas governor Rick Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal have all spoken approvingly of the law; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has been more circumspect. Likely Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has criticized it.

The debate also shines a spotlight on other Religious Freedom Restoration Acts, which are in force at the federal level and in 19 states other than Indiana. The federal law was signed in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, and state versions have had broad support from both parties.

The current batch of religious liberties bills has been more controversial, in part because of the timing. Same-sex marriage is rapidly becoming the norm, with such unions legal in 37 states and the District. Last year, Arizona passed a similar law after a New Mexico photography company was sanctioned for refusing to take pictures for a lesbian commitment ceremony. But that bill sparked nationwide protests, drew criticism from the National Football League and was ultimately vetoed.

But the new laws are also fundamentally different. The federal law protects only individuals seeking relief from government intrusions on their religious beliefs. The Indiana law and others like it also apply to disputes between private parties.

Share this article Share

University of Virginia law professor Douglas Laycock, one of the nation's leading law-and-religion scholars, said ""religious freedom"" has become a catchphrase since last year's Supreme Court ruling in the Hobby Lobby case. The court found that business owners who object to certain contraceptives on religious grounds may decline to provide them through their employee health plans.

“There’s bad behavior on both sides,” Laycock said. “Gay rights groups, as they become stronger and stronger and get more support for same-sex marriage, keep demanding more and more. Now they don’t want any religious exceptions for anybody.”

Advertisement

Meanwhile, he said, “Republican legislators are pandering to the base and saying we need to protect against gay marriage. These statements from the right fuel the outrage on the left.”

Bosma, the Indiana House speaker, said the law there has been misconstrued and is more limited than critics contend. For example, he said, it would not shield a dry cleaner who refused to serve a gay customer. “Both the opponents and proponents were indicating they felt that the language allowed a denial of services to gay Hoosiers,” Bosma said in an interview. “That definitely wasn’t the intent, nor do I believe was it the effect, but we intend to take action to make it clear.”

In an op-ed to be published Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal, Pence says the law ""only provides a mechanism to address claims, not a license for private parties to deny services. Even a claim involving private individuals . . . must show that one's religious beliefs were 'substantially burdened' and not in service to a broader government interest — which preventing discrimination certainly is.""

Advertisement

Opponents note, however, that the law comes just months after a judge ordered same-sex marriage to be made legal in the state. And they note that Indiana does not include sexual orientation or gender identity as categories that are protected from discrimination under civil rights statutes — something they’d like to see addressed as part of the legislature’s fix.

The issue could have tremendous economic consequences in Indiana. Many companies have expressed displeasure with the law, including drugmaker Eli Lilly, one of the state's largest employers and a frequent donor to local political candidates. Angie's List, also based in Indiana, has halted expansion plans over the act. Monday, Gap and Levi Strauss & Co. announced their opposition to Indiana's law and similar proposals.

Gay rights activists are hoping for similar reactions in other states. The Human Rights Campaign, a prominent gay rights group, has asked the NFL to deny Atlanta’s bid to host the 2019 Super Bowl. It also launched an advertising campaign warning Hollywood studios filming in Georgia that the state is “writing off LGBT people.” And a full-page ad in the San Jose Mercury News takes aim at Silicon Valley companies considering investments in Arkansas.

“Arkansas wants your business,” the ad says, “but at what price?”

Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) said he intends to sign that state’s religious freedom bill, which could come to a House vote this week. In a statement Monday, Hutchinson said he was “pleased that the legislature is continuing to look at ways to assure balance and fairness in the legislation.”

However, he said, “if this bill reaches my desk in similar form as to what has been passed in 20 other states, then I will sign it.”

Adam Talbot, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, cautioned Hutchinson to rethink that stance.

“The governor should take note of what’s happening across the country,” Talbot said. “People don’t want this. People don’t need this. People think it’s dangerous. And there’s still time to stop it.”"

Kerry decided to stay in Switzerland an extra day in search of a breakthrough. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said that progress had been made and that Kerry would remain “until at least Thursday morning.” But the short period appeared to reflect the difficulties in the talks between six world powers and Iran over a preliminary agreement on restricting the Islamic republic’s ability to use its civilian nuclear technology to build atomic weapons.

“We continue to make progress but have not reached a political understanding,” Harf told reporters.

The talks with Iran appeared to be on ever-more-shaky ground as the day elapsed. The White House said Iran had not made commitments about its nuclear program in Wednesday’s sessions, and Iran’s foreign minister described negotiations with the West as “always problematic.”

Though the talks continued, Germany’s foreign minister said it was possible they could collapse.

""It is clear the negotiations are not going well,"" two prominent Republican senators who have been wary of an agreement — John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) — said in a joint statement. ""At every step, the Iranians appear intent on retaining the capacity to achieve a nuclear weapon.""

The Obama administration had sought a broad political framework for an agreement by Tuesday, with three additional months to negotiate the technical details. But a deadline that perhaps was intended to pressure Iran to make concessions came and went as the country's representatives bargained hard. A temporary nuclear agreement with Iran remains in effect until June 30.

Diplomats and politicians sounded exasperated Wednesday, even as they acknowledged they were still exploring proposals to find a way out of their impasse.

In Washington, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the talks were productive but that there were unresolved details. He said the United States would not arbitrarily end the negotiations if they were making progress, “but if we are in a situation where we sense that the talks have stalled, then yes, the United States and the international community is prepared to walk away.”

In Lausanne, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said that new proposals would be considered but that the two sides were still far apart.

When asked whether the talks could collapse, Steinmeier told German reporters: “Naturally. Whoever negotiates has to accept the risk of collapse. But I say that in light of the convergence [of views] that we have achieved here in Switzerland, in Lausanne, it would be irresponsible to ignore the possibility of reaching an agreement.”

Steinmeier said he would reassess on Thursday morning whether to stay or return home. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who went to Paris on Wednesday morning, was headed back to the talks in Lausanne that night.

‘Mutually exclusive’

Iran's chief negotiator, Mohammed Javad Zarif, was critical of his counterparts when he was approached by reporters as he strolled along the shores of Lake Geneva.

“I’ve always said that an agreement and pressure do not go together; they are mutually exclusive,” he said. “So our friends need to decide whether they want to be with Iran based on respect or whether they want to continue based on pressure. They have tested the other one. It is high time to test this one.”

Earlier, speaking to Iranian reporters outside the Beau Rivage Palace, where talks are being conducted, Zarif sounded weary with the approach taken by the multiple negotiating teams on the other side of the table.

“The negotiations’ progress depends on political will,” he said, according to Iran’s Mehr News Agency. “The other party’s political will has always been problematic.”

With the departure of several foreign ministers who had arrived over the weekend, Kerry was joined at the table by the British and German foreign ministers and the European Union’s foreign policy chief. France, China and Russia were represented by their ministers’ deputies.

The Obama administration and its negotiating partners are seeking an agreement that will sharply limit Iran's ability to build nuclear weapons for at least a decade and maintain lesser restrictions in subsequent years. Iran says that its nuclear program is for peaceful, civilian purposes. It is seeking the lifting of international sanctions that have battered its economy.

The day’s negotiations started amid hopes of a preliminary agreement on at least some issues.

Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he expected the talks to end late Wednesday with a statement “announcing progress.” That was quickly contradicted by diplomats from other countries.

Araghchi also offered some insight into Iran’s position on two central issues — the lifting of sanctions and the future of Iran’s research on centrifuges to enrich uranium.

“We insist on lifting of financial and oil and banking sanctions immediately,” he told Iranian state television, adding that the pace for lifting other sanctions was still being negotiated.

“We insist on keeping research and development with advanced centrifuges,” he added, referring to Iran’s desire to eventually replace its outdated centrifuges with more modern technology that enriches uranium more quickly. The United States and its negotiating partners want to keep restrictions on Iran’s nuclear research through the final years of a potential 15-year accord. They also want economic sanctions lifted more gradually.

For months, the State Department avoided the word deadline, a term that was used in Congress and the press. Officials called it a goal. In recent weeks, though, even U.S. diplomats began using the term.

“We’ve said that March 31st is a deadline; it has to mean something, and the decisions don’t get easier after March 31st,” Harf said Monday.

Some say the White House should never have adopted the “D” word.

“It was a mistake to set the March 31 deadline in the first place, because we need a positive outcome more than anyone else,” said Gary Samore, a former nuclear arms adviser to President Obama. “Naturally, the Iranians are taking advantage and playing hard ball.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu kept up his unrelenting criticism of an agreement with Iran.

“Yesterday, an Iranian general brazenly said, and I quote, Israel’s destruction is nonnegotiable. But evidently giving Iran’s murderous regime a clear path to a bomb is negotiable,” he said in a statement from Jerusalem.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who was visiting Israel on Wednesday with a congressional delegation, said in an appearance with Netanyahu: “Regardless of where in the Middle East we’ve been, the message has been the same: You can’t continue to turn your eye away from the threats that face all of us.”

At this early stage in the 2016 competition, the prospective candidates suffer from image weaknesses, but the Republicans have a more acute problem. Most Republicans are not well known, but at this point, not a single one of six Republicans included in the survey has a favorability rating that is net positive.

Bush — by far the best known among those running for the GOP nomination — is viewed favorably by 33 percent of the public, while 53 percent say they view him unfavorably. Only Clinton among all those included in the poll has a net positive rating, but by the slender margin of three percentage points (49 percent to 46 percent). Her favorability rating has dropped nine points in the past year and 18 points since she left the State Department in 2013.

Clinton stands now as the leading contender in either party for the White House, with no serious opposition at this point in the race for the Democratic nomination. But as she prepares to launch her campaign, she emerges also as a polarizing figure, with huge differences in the way she is perceived by Republicans and Democrats.

Overall, she is seen as a strong leader and as someone with new ideas for the country. But on questions of honesty and trustworthiness, as well as on whether she understands people’s problems or shares the values of average Americans, the public is split almost evenly pro and con.

In the contest for the Republican nomination, Bush tops the field with 20 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents saying they would support him if their primary or caucus were held today. He is followed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas at 13 percent and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at 12 percent. Five other Republicans received at least 6 percent support, with an additional six candidates at either 2 percent or 1 percent. Bush, Cruz and Walker are the only three to register noticeable gains since the last Post-ABC survey on the GOP race in December.

Bush, who faces potential resistance from some Republicans for his stands on immigration and Common Core school standards, enjoys his strongest support among moderate and liberal Republicans and among those who say they are “somewhat conservative.”

Bush has been on an aggressive pace to stockpile funds for his candidacy and appears to have benefited from decisions by 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and 2012 vice-presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.) to stay out of the race. His 20 percent support level, hardly an indication of dominance, underscores potential challenges ahead. But 1 in 3 Republicans say they think Bush will be their party’s nominee.

The survey was taken in the days after Cruz became the first Republican to formally announce a bid for the nomination. The former Texas solicitor general, running unabashedly as the true conservative in the race, enjoys his greatest support among the most conservative Republicans. Walker, who began rising after a well-received speech in Iowa in January, enjoys about equal support among those who say they are somewhat conservative and those who say they are very conservative.

Support for Bush and Cruz is mostly evenly distributed among demographic groups. Walker runs far better among men than women and far better among Republicans with college degrees than those without, although he did not graduate from college. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who hopes to redraw the GOP coalition, runs three times as well among those younger than 50 as among older voters.

Nearly all the Republican contenders are viewed favorably within their own party. Bush, Walker, Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is set to formally launch his campaign April 13, are viewed positively by margins of about 26 percentage points among self-identified Republicans. Paul, who plans to announce Tuesday, has a 13-point positive-to-negative rating in his party.

Meanwhile, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, once regarded as a top-tier prospect for the nomination, has a major image problem within his party as well as with the public at large. He is viewed favorably by 38 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning ­independents and unfavorably by 41 percent. Among all poll respondents, 51 percent have an unfavorable impression of Christie, topped only by Bush’s 53 percent.

While Clinton’s image is stronger than those of Republicans, perceptions of her honesty and empathy have eroded as she has moved toward a 2016 presidential candidacy. Since last measured in June, as she began her tour to promote her State Department memoir, she has suffered a ­seven-point slip in perceptions of her honesty and an identical fall on the question of whether she understands the problems “of people like you.” Almost all of the decline came from more negative assessments among Republicans.

Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, Clin­ton continues to hold a commanding lead in the competition for her party’s presidential nomination. She has a 6-to-1 advantage over Vice President Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, neither of whom has announced plans to run. Those who have expressed interest — former senator James Webb of Virginia, former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley and Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) — are in the low single digits.

Tested against four possible Republicans in a general election — Bush, Cruz, Walker and Rubio — Clinton holds double-digit leads in every case. Bush does marginally better than the others but trails by 53 percent to 41 percent among registered voters, while Cruz runs weakest at 54 percent to 37 percent.

Clinton’s supporters are more passionate about their candidate than are Bush’s supporters. More than 8 in 10 Clinton supporters say they are enthusiastic, with more than 4 in 10 saying they are very enthusiastic. Among Bush supporters, while almost 7 in 10 say they are enthusiastic, just over 1 in 10 say they are very enthusiastic.

The Post-ABC poll was conducted March 26 to 29 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults interviewed by telephone, including 335 cellphone-only respondents. The overall margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points; the error margin is 5.5 percentage points among both the samples of 444 Republicans and GOP-leaning independents and 446 Democratic and Democratic-leaning independents."
2484,2484,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/04/10/hillary-clinton-to-announce-plans-to-run-for-president-on-sunday/?hpid=z1,0,"This story has been updated. Hillary Rodham Clinton will formally enter the presidential race with an announcement on Sunday followed by appearances on the campaign trail next week, three people familiar with her plans said on Friday, ending months of anticipation surrounding the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination. Clinton plans to launch her campaign via social media and with a video on Sunday articulating her rationale for seeking the White House. She'll then travel to the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa early next week for campaign events, these people said. She is expected to hold mostly small discussion events with voters designed to help the former secretary of state connect with ordinary Americans and listen to their concerns, forgoing the large rallies and traditional announcement speeches of some of her Republican rivals.

Behind the scenes, meanwhile, Clinton's fundraising machine is revving up. Her top bundlers are plotting aggressive outreach to thousands of Democratic donors over the weekend and into next week urging them to immediately send checks and make donations online as soon as the Clinton campaign's Web site goes live.

Democratic strategists, advisers and fundraisers described Clinton's plans only on the condition of anonymity because she and her team have not yet finalized all aspects of her campaign rollout. Her official spokespeople declined to comment.

Clinton's Sunday announcement would come one day before the expected campaign launch of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is planning a major speech to supporters on Monday afternoon at Miami's iconic Freedom Tower. Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Rand Paul (Ky.) are the only two major Republican candidates who already have officially entered the race.

For months, Clinton, like many Republican contenders, has been assembling a campaign-in-waiting. Widely considered by Democrats to be the heir apparent to President Obama, Clinton has hired several of Obama's top campaign strategists to work on her 2016 bid and dozens of staffers, including in the early caucus and primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Last week, the Clinton team signed a lease on office space in Brooklyn, N.Y., as her national campaign headquarters.

Ahead of the campaign launch, Clinton released a new epilogue on Friday for ""Hard Choices,"" her State Department memoir that is coming out this month in paperback. The chapter touches on an array of issues, from her relationship with Obama to economic mobility to childhood education. She writes about her desire for every American in the 21st century to have an equal and fair shot at economic success, a theme she has highlighted in her public speeches over the past year.

Clinton ends the epilogue by ruminating about a ""memory quilt"" she received as a gift after her granddaughter's birth: ""I wondered for a moment what a quilt of my own life would look like. . . . There was so much more to do. So many more panels waiting to be filled in. I folded up the quilt and got back to work.”

Using a social media launch for her campaign, rather than a boisterous and celebratory rally, is a deliberate attempt by Clinton and her advisers to avoid the pitfalls that tripped her up in her 2008 presidential campaign, when she was heavily favored at the outset but ultimately defeated by Obama. Clinton suffered from criticism then that she appeared as if she felt entitled to the nomination and often came off as flat and uninspired on the stump in front of large crowds.

The go-slow, go-small strategy, Democratic advisers say, plays to her strengths, allowing her to meet voters in intimate settings where her humor, humility and policy expertise can show through.

That approach is modeled on the listening tour she conducted across New York state at the start of her successful 2000 Senate race. Longtime advisers and allies said Clinton wants to reestablish the connection with voters and regular people she had in that campaign, when she traveled into diners and people’s living rooms and kitchens to listen to their concerns.

Jay Jacobs, a former New York Democratic Party chairman and longtime Clinton friend and supporter, said the 2000 listening tour became “a two-way conversation that impressed voters not by just what she said, but by how intently she listened. I think that’s Hillary. That’s something that has worked before, and it’ll work again.”

Jacobs, who recently met privately with Clinton when she addressed his group of the American Camp Association in Atlantic City, N.J., said Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign will not be “reactive.”

“It will be one that really presents Hillary Clinton to the voters as she is known by people who are close to her: as a very warm, genuine, thoughtful, certainly intelligent, regular person,” Jacobs said. “There’s been so much that we’ve seen that seems to create an image, by the press and by others, those who are looking to derail her, but now the voters are going to hear from Hillary and they’re going to see Hillary.”

Within hours of news reports Friday morning that Clinton would launch her campaign this weekend, the Republican National Committee announced an online ad as part of its ""#StopHillary"" campaign to highlight scandals over her use of private e-mail at the State Department and foreign donations to her family's charitable foundation.

“From the East Wing to the State Department, Hillary Clinton has left a trail of secrecy, scandal and failed liberal policies that no image consultant can erase,” RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. “Voters want to elect someone they can trust and Hillary's record proves that she cannot be trusted. We must 'Stop Hillary.'”

Clinton's fundraising team is standing by for the launch of her Web site, when the campaign can begin accepting donations online. One priority is creating a robust small-donor network similar to the Obama campaign's vaunted list from his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, and Clinton advisers see her announcement period as a ripe opportunity.

“We’re going to have to raise as much money as possible,” said one Clinton fundraiser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign’s internal plans. “We’re not going to take it slow. The announcement is a good time to raise money, and we’ll have everyone out there asking people to support her candidacy.”

Several Clinton fundraisers described a rush of major donors wanting to get checks in the door on Day One of the campaign.

“All the horses are in the gate just waiting for those gates to open,” said John Morgan, a prominent Florida donor and Clinton fundraiser. “That’s how I describe the fundraising efforts. There’s really nothing to do until the gate opens. But the gate could open Sunday, and it could be the flood gate. The only issue they’ll have is how fast can they raise the money, because the money is pent up. And if they start holding events, the line will be around the block to host an event.”

Clinton's fundraising efforts are being directed by Dennis Cheng, who had been finance director at the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. But the campaign is not expected to give titles to top bundlers or announce a list of finance committee chairs or members, according to Democrats with knowledge of the Clinton strategy.

Clinton’s focus for now will be on raising money just for the primary – with a cap of $2,700 a donor – through Internet appeals. That will free her up to spend time on the trail, talking to voters, rather than wooing wealthy donors at high-priced fundraisers.

“I don’t think the first thing out of the gate she should be doing is a bunch of big fundraising events,” said one senior party strategist.

This is a notable contrast to former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who has spent the better part of four months crisscrossing the country holding closed-door finance events for his Right to Rise political action committee and super PAC with tickets costing as much as $100,000 each.

“I think she’ll be in Iowa eating corn on the cob instead of clinking champagne flutes with donors,” Morgan said. “She can do this much quicker, much more efficiently because she’s not fighting for donors. Rubio, Bush, that whole crowd is in mortal combat for dollars. She’s not. That’s her advantage.”

Without a strong Democratic challenger on the horizon, Clinton does not feel the pressure to match the kind of “shock and awe” fundraising effort that Bush has been undertaking to scare off other Republican hopefuls. “They have the luxury of doing this the right way, and not trying to just see how much money they can hoover up,” the senior party strategist said.

In fact, Clinton’s team is wary of raising too much money too quickly -- creating a bulging war chest that could play to the inevitability theme she wants to avoid this time around.

Clinton will not be able to seed her new campaign with a major cash infusion as she did at the start of her 2008 campaign, when she transferred $10 million from her Senate reelection committee. That helped her post a record $36 million haul for her first fundraising quarter. Her 2008 presidential committee is shut down, and her Senate committee has just $158,000 left in reserves.

But her campaign this time will be able to build on the efforts of Ready for Hillary, an outside group started in 2013 to lay the groundwork for Clinton's campaign, which has held more than 1,000 grass-roots events across all 50 states in the past two years. In the process, the group amassed a donor pool of more than 135,000 people, the vast majority of whom gave contributions of $100 or less, according to super-PAC officials. Ready for Hillary also has cultivated a network of local organizers who could sign on for similar roles with the official campaign.

That could give Clinton a sizable head start over some of her Republican rivals in building a small-donor operation. Ready for Hillary will not be able to coordinate with Clinton once she announces, but it could share its list of supporters with her campaign through a list swap, campaign finance lawyers said.

But the group may not even have to take that step. Once Clinton declares her candidacy, the super PAC can simply direct its supporters to her Web site, allowing her campaign to quickly build a small-donor list.

And once she’s officially in, Ready for Hillary plans to post online the names of hundreds of donors who have given or raised more than $5,000, according to a person familiar with the plans. That list — which includes at least 222 donors who gave $25,000 — would be valuable not just for Clinton’s campaign but for Priorities USA, the high-dollar super PAC planning to finance a pro-Clinton television advertising campaign and now faces pressure to kick-start its fundraising."
2489,2489,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/04/14/chris-christie-kicks-off-his-comeback-tour-in-nh-going-all-in-on-entitlement-reform/,0,"GOFFSTOWN – Chris Christie kicked off a two day swing to New Hampshire with a sober prescription for tackling escalating entitlement spending. The New Jersey governor and potential Republican presidential candidate proposed raising the retirement age for Social security to 69, means testing for Social Security, and gradually raising the eligibility age for Medicare.

Christie outlined his proposals on entitlement reform at a speech Tuesday morning at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College.

“In the short term, it is growing the deficit and slowly but surely taking over all of government. In the long term, it will steal our children’s future and bankrupt our nation. Meanwhile, our leaders in Washington are not telling people the truth. Washington is still not dealing with the problem,” Christie said.

“Washington is afraid to have an honest conversation about Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid with the people of our country. I am not,” the governor added.

Christie said that Social Security should be retirement insurance, and he proposed what he described as “modest” means testing.

“Let’s ask ourselves an honest question: do we really believe that the wealthiest Americans need to take from younger, hardworking Americans to receive what, for most of them, is a modest monthly Social Security check? I propose a modest means test that only affects those with non-Social Security income of over $80,000 per year, and phases out Social Security payments entirely for those that have $200,000 a year of other income,” Christie said.

He added that his proposal would only affect 2 percent of all Social Security recipients.

When it comes to Medicare, Christie would increase the current sliding scare of means testing.

“We should expand the sliding scale under my proposal. Seniors with an $85,000 a year income will pay 40% of premium costs and increasing it to 90% above $196,000 a year in retirement income, Christie said.

Christie also proposed raising the retirement age for Social Security.

“I’m proposing we raise the age to 69, gradually implementing this change starting in 2022 and increasing the retirement age by two months each year until it reaches 69. I also believe we need to raise the early retirement age – people who take their retirement early -- at a similar pace, raising it by two months per year until it reaches 64 from the current level of 62,” Christie

And he also called for raising the eligibility age for Medicare at what he described as “a manageable pace of one month per year, so that by 2040, you’d be eligible for Medicare at 67 years old, and by 2064 would be 69 years old. Raising the eligibility age, slowly so that people can plan for it, has another advantage. It encourages seniors to remain in the workforce.”

Christie also trained some of his fire on President Barack Obama, saying the president “has left us a debtor nation. In his short time in office, he has almost doubled the national debt – increasing it by over $8 trillion.”

“It won’t be easy to turn around the fiscal mess that Barack Obama has left us either. He has avoided the tough decisions. Imagine that the straightforward discussion I’ve just had with you today, President Obama has been afraid to have with you for the last eight years -- from the day he declared for president in February of 2007 to this very day,” Christie added.

Christie ended his speech by touting that he’s not afraid to tackle the difficult issues, like entitlement reform.

“Here’s what you’ll learn about me. I have been talking about the growth of entitlements as a big problem, at both the state and federal levels, for a number of years. Not because it is politically popular, but because it is true. And because it will affect everything we can do as a country to make this century the second American century. I will not pander. I will not flip flop. I’m not afraid to tell you the truth as I see it, whether you like it or not,” Christie concluded.

Prior to his address, Christie met with students at Saint Anselm College. After a conference call with conservative reporters who were unable to watch the speech, Christie was headed to a retail stop at Caesario’s Pizza on Elm Street in Manchester.

Later in the day he was scheduled to hold a meet and greet at the Stone Church Tavern in Newmarket, followed by a closed door Seacoast Roundtable hosted by Renee Plummer, one of the most influential GOP activists along the coast."

http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/14/politics/corker-iran-bill-obama-veto-explainer/index.html",0,"President Obama’s quest to get a deal with Iran on its nuclear program hinges on not only reaching across the aisle in Congress but also across oceans to find common ground with enemies. That strategy — which links two themes that have dominated his presidency, a yearning for post-partisan politics and a belief in engagement — receives a new test Tuesday as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee begins debate on a bill that would severely restrict Obama’s ability to cut a nuclear arms deal with Iran.

The bill would force him to send an Iran accord to Congress for approval and require Tehran to renounce terrorism. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that Obama would veto such a bill.

The issue of Iran has pushed Obama’s core principles to the limits on two fronts. His overtures to Iran have inflamed ­already-simmering partisan politics at home. Abroad, they have tested his broader theory of engagement, straining relations with U.S. allies without any guarantee of easing sectarian fighting that appears to be spinning out of control throughout the Middle East.

Success may be close, but failure looms almost everywhere.

Even if the Iran deal holds, the result will lack the pomp and promise that mark some of the historic foreign policy of the past, such as President Richard M. Nixon’s opening to China. There will be no equivalent of Nixon’s walk on the Great Wall or banquet in the Great Hall of the People. Obama will not stroll through the ruins of Persepolis or dine in Qom.

“The big disappointment for Obama is what he was hoping would be his signature foreign policy agreement, even if he gets a deal, will be one that generates enormous opposition abroad and political discord at home,” said Richard H. Solomon, former president of the U.S. Institute of Peace and a former U.S. ambassador who worked with ­then-national security adviser Henry Kissinger on Nixon’s trip to China. “Internationally, it’s going to mean further gaps and tensions, not just with the Israelis, but with a number of the Sunni states.”

Despite Republican victories in November, Obama began his presidency’s seventh year with high hopes and an impassioned plea for what he called a “better politics” to replace the partisan divisions that have marked much of his time in office.

“Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns,” Obama told lawmakers at his State of the Union address in January. “Imagine if we did something different.”

As a deadline on Iran talks neared, Republicans did, indeed, produce something “different” — an open letter, signed by 47 GOP senators, that sought to undermine the talks by warning that a future president or Congress could undo any nuclear deal.

Now, Obama has stopped talking about a “better politics.”

Even as the administration works to resolve contentious details before a June 30 deadline for the Iran negotiations, the White House will be scrambling simultaneously to stop or alter legislation that could prompt the Iranians to back out of the deal.

The biggest worry is the Senate Foreign Relations Committee bill, sponsored by committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). Obama has praised Corker as “a good and decent man” and spoke with him by phone Wednesday as part of an effort to find common ground. Some Democrats want to strip the terrorism portion out of the bill, but some Republicans would go even further. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a presidential candidate, would demand that Iran explicitly recognize Israel’s right to exist.

If Obama’s outreach to Congress fails, it could doom the Iran accord and extend bitter partisan infighting far beyond “the water’s edge,” where, in the mid-1940s, Republican Sen. Arthur Vandenberg famously said it should end. “Essentially we would have 535 secretaries of state,” Earnest said. “Not just one.”

Such an outcome would damage not only relations with Iran, but with Britain, France and Germany — members of a group that also includes Russia and China and that has been negotiating alongside the United States. “The impact on alliance structure would be devastating,” said Charles W. Freeman, Jr., former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia and a veteran diplomat. “Who would trust us after that?”

The coming months will also test Obama’s broader world view that “principled” engagement — even with America’s longest-standing enemies such as Cuba and Burma, also called Myanmar — can produce sweeping change. “I believe that engagement is a more powerful force than isolation,” he said of Cuba during a stop in Jamaica on Thursday.

It is a view born in part of Obama’s criticism of President George W. Bush’s strategy of removing dictators by force, in the hope that democratic leaders, with help from the United States, would come forward.

On Iran, Obama has navigated this issue carefully, saying the framework deal was primarily about stopping Iran from producing a nuclear weapon and heading off an arms race in one of the most unstable regions of the world.

But he also has voiced repeatedly the hope that an Iran free of sanctions and open to Western investment would change, spending more money on improving living standards and less on destabilizing proxy militias and terrorist groups.

In the near term, though, the nuclear deal seems just as likely to increase tribal infighting between Iran and America’s allies abroad.

Saudi Arabia remains deeply suspicious of Iranian intentions. Before the framework was complete, a former Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Turki al-Faisal, warned that a flawed deal could spark a global nuclear arms race. In early March, Kerry traveled to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, to calm nerves, assuring Saudi leaders that the nuclear deal would not mean a U.S. rapprochement with Iran — and that the old divisions Obama once talked about overcoming would remain comfortably and familiarly intact.

Obama has begun providing weapons and intelligence to help Saudi Arabia in its battle against Iranian-supported Houthi fighters in Yemen. Last week, the Pentagon said that it would expedite weapons deliveries to the Saudis and that it was using air-refueling planes to support the Saudi-led coalition conducting airstrikes in Yemen.

In return, Saudi Arabia has given the nuclear deal tepid support. The state news agency said that the kingdom’s council of ministers “expressed hope for attaining a binding and definitive agreement” and stressed a need for “good neighborliness and non-interference in the affairs of Arab states.”

The statement hinted at an important question: How far will U.S. engagement go? Should the technical details of an agreement be linked to understandings about Iran’s conduct in the region — where it lends support to allies such as Hamas, Hezbollah, the Iraqi government and Houthi rebels while questioning Israel’s right to exist?

Obama has said that those sorts of demands would torpedo the preliminary deal.

Instead, the president, as part of his overseas sales job, has promised to bolster security assistance to America’s Arab allies so that they can better defend themselves against what he said are some “very real external threats.” By that, Obama principally means Iran. He has also vowed new efforts to make sure that the Israeli people are “absolutely protected.”

At the same time, the president hopes that Iran will keep at home whatever money it gets from a full or partial lifting of economic sanctions. Some critics doubt that will be the case.

“I mean it’s an authoritarian regime,” said Tamara Cofman Wittes, a former top Obama administration State Department official and director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. “It has never focused on its people and sanctions relief won’t change it.”

The extra money that comes from lifting sanctions would give Iran more resources to fund proxy fighters and terror groups.

“It is much more likely that Iran will react to a nuclear deal by acting more aggressively in other domains,” Wittes said, adding that such an outcome doesn’t mean the nuclear deal is a bad idea. Rather, she said, it puts new pressure on the Obama administration to articulate a clearer vision for how it plans to counter Hezbollah and Iranian influence, especially in Syria where critics have said that the administration lacks a coherent strategy."

http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/29/us/baltimore-protests/index.html",0,"A pallor reminiscent of an earlier desperate era hung over this city Tuesday as National Guardsmen with rifles and police in riot gear looked on while fire-scarred buildings smoldered, burnt cars were towed away and the rocks hurled by rioters were swept from the streets. The acrid smell of smoke lingered, just as it had in Harlem, Watts, Newark, Philadelphia, Chicago and Washington during the tumultuous decade of the 1960s.

Soldiers dressed as if for combat and police in full riot gear patrolled the streets. Sand-colored military Humvees mixed in with police squad cars rolling through neighborhoods. Merchants and neighbors came out to clean up shattered stores and streets strewn with debris.

There was no repeat of Monday’s violence, in which dozens of people — many of high school age — pelted police with rocks and bottles, looted several stores and set things ablaze.

But at 10 p.m., when a newly imposed curfew went into effect, tensions between police and several dozen peaceful protesters became heated. A loudspeaker from a hovering helicopter reminded the crowd of the curfew and asked people to go home.

As a 10:00 p.m. enforced curfew loomed, the mood on the streets in Baltimore shifted from positivity to a tense stand-off with law enforcement that was quickly dispersed. (Video: Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)

The request was met with expletives, and rocks were thrown at a line of police in riot gear. Police unleashed smoke cannisters and shot pepper balls. The line moved forward slowly, while officers banged their shields. Some in the crowd, including a few who had donned bandannas as masks, tossed plastic or glass bottles and shouted profanity.

But most of the crowd dispersed with the show of force, and the mood began to ease. Seven people were arrested for curfew violations and three others arrested on other charges, police said.

For most of Monday, though, the city was generally subdued and even turned hopeful as a band played in the street and people sang and prayed.

Talk of the rioting supplanted conversation about the controversial death of Freddie Gray after he was taken into police custody April 12, which had been the primary topic of discourse before Monday’s mayhem. The outburst of lawlessness that erupted after his funeral Monday seemed inextricably linked to his death, but city leaders and Gray’s family said it was born out of a more general frustration that found voice in his death.

“It breaks my heart,” Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (D) said, with tears welling in her eyes, at an appearance with leaders at Bethel A.M.E. Church in West Baltimore. “We will recover. We will be better on the other side of things.”

She said she regretted calling the rioters ""thugs"" at a Monday night news conference.

“We don’t have thugs in Baltimore,” she said. Then, referring to a recent skit by President Obama at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, she added: “Sometimes my own little anger translator gets the best of me. They’re going to regret what they’ve done, but it’s too late.”

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) was less charitable about the rioters Tuesday, calling them “roving gangs of thugs.”

“Criminal activity will not be tolerated,” Hogan said after meeting with community leaders. “We are not going to have another night of what happened last night.”

From the White House, Obama made an impassioned call for Americans to do “some soul searching” in the wake of the rioting, arguing that the United States has faced “a slow-rolling crisis” over race and economic opportunity in urban areas.

The president said the violence in Baltimore took away from peaceful protesters who have expressed “real concern and outrage over the possibility that our laws were not applied evenly in the case of Mr. Gray.”

“When individuals get crowbars and start prying open doors to loot, they’re not protesting, they’re not making a statement — they’re stealing,” the president said. “When they burn down a building, they’re committing arson. And they’re destroying and undermining businesses and opportunities in their own communities that rob jobs and opportunity from people in that area.”

Authorities said about 250 people were arrested during the unrest that began Monday afternoon, and 20 police officers have been injured. They said blanket coverage of what took place provided ample video to identify criminal acts.

The global reach of that vivid coverage was made evident when members of the Islamic State took to Twitter to claim the rioters as fellow “rebels.” One tweet said, “rebels destroy cars of oppressive militarized police in Baltimore.”

With a 10 p.m. citywide curfew in place until next week, the Baltimore Orioles canceled Tuesday night’s 7:05 p.m. game. They said Wednesday’s game will go on, but it will be closed to the public. The team also changed an evening game scheduled for Thursday to an afternoon start and said a three game homestand against Tampa Bay would be played in St. Petersburg, Fla., instead.

Many offices, including federal buildings, were closed Tuesday or sent workers home early. The courts, the science center, the National Aquarium and two commercial malls were shuttered.

Public schools remained closed Tuesday, and there were concerns that some children would go hungry because of it. Eighty-four percent of the city’s school children qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. Schools were scheduled to open as usual Wednesday.

Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts also responded to mounting criticism from those who said officers should have been more aggressive when Monday’s rioting began with swarms of young people who had just gotten out of school.

“Because they’re 14-, 15- , and 16-year-old kids out there. Do you want people using force on 14- , 15- 16-year-old kids?” Batts said.

The most threatening moment of the afternoon came at the intersection where the CVS pharmacy burned Monday. When several people threw a few items toward a line of police in riot gear, other people linked arms and some raised their hands to quell the outburst.

An unidentified man with a microphone pleaded with those throwing to stop.

“This emotional stuff is not going to work,” he said.

The Rev. Al Sharpton urged people gathered outside City Hall to refrain from violence. “Every brick thrown is a potential roadblock to justice for Freddie Gray,” he said. “We’re fighting violence, not adding to it.”

State officials said they planned to have 2,000 National Guard troops in the city by nightfall Tuesday, augmented by 400 state troopers and police from surrounding communities, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and the District.

Even with the heavy police presence, much of the city seemed in a mood to cleanse itself from the images and debris of Monday night’s violence.

“We saw people coming together to claim our city, to clean our city and to help to heal our city,” Rawlings-Blake said.

Hundreds of people wielding brooms, dustpans, trash cans and even small bulldozers took to the blocks around the epicenter of the rioting in an impromptu cleanup effort. Some handed out water and trash bags, while others plucked trash from vacant lots and picked up broken glass.

Antoinette Rucker, 27, was typical. The woman from Baltimore County loaded a large, black trash can in her car and headed down to the city to clean up.

“I didn’t have to work, so I wanted to do my part,” Rucker said.

Activists shouted through bullhorns, a man registered people to vote, a woman burned incense and a group broke out in song with “Amazing Grace.”

Monica Mitchell said she felt compelled to do something. “My mother always taught me to control the controllable,” she said.

With gloves and garbage bags, she arrived at Pennsylvania and West North avenues, where much of Monday's violence was centered, just after 5 a.m. A rake in her hand, she smiled as an orange sunrise cascaded over the city.

Randy Howell, 55, nailed boards over the windows of the stone rowhouse near the corner of North Mount and Baker streets that has been in his family since the 1950s. He thinks looters torched the convenience store next door and that the flames spread to his roof.

Howell estimated the damage to his house at $50,000. He said it would take a lot of work to keep it from becoming one more boarded-up home in West Baltimore.

“We are going to make it into a project — a lot of tender love and volunteers,” Howell said.

During the afternoon, a group of six musicians calling themselves the Baltimore Brass Factory played jazz near the burned CVS, breaking up the constant hum of crowd chatter with familiar tunes. “It’s the healing of music,” said band member Clarence Ward III, who played the trumpet. “That’s how I can best help people get their mind off the negativity. It’s all about putting some love in the air.”"

One wound occurred when Gray struck his head on a bolt that jutted out in the van, the official said, but that was not Gray’s only head injury. And the injuries overall are consistent with what medical examiners often see in car collisions, the official said.

The findings, which have not been publicly released, are part of an investigation into Gray’s death that Baltimore police handed over to prosecutors Thursday. The new information leaves many unanswered questions for a city roiled by riots and unrest after the 25-year-old’s death from injuries that occurred while in police custody.

Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts said at a news conference that his department provided the report a day before his self-imposed deadline because he understood residents’ anger and their eagerness to learn more about how Gray died. Still, he and a department spokesman declined to provide many details about what investigators uncovered.

""I understand the frustration. I understand the sense of urgency . . . and that is why we have finished it a day ahead of time,"" Batts said. ""I also know that getting to the right answer is more important than the speed.""

In the aftermath of Baltimore riots after Freddie Gray’s funeral + 60 Residents clean up from the looting and fires that plagued parts of the city after the funeral for Freddie Gray.

Although cellphone video showing Gray being dragged into the back of a police van with limp legs has ignited much of the attention, police have been focusing their probe on what happened to him in the back of the van. Police say his legs were shackled and he wasn’t wearing a seat belt, which authorities say was a violation of policy. They said officers ignored his pleas for medical help.

The van made four stops before arriving at a police station, including one that police officials on Thursday said they had not initially known about. They said that stop was captured by a private security camera but did not provide additional details. From the police station, Gray was taken to the hospital, where he died a week later. Authorities said he suffered a severe spinal injury.

Some residents had feared that turning over the report to prosecutors might spark more violence in the city, where on Monday cars were torched, stores looted, and rocks and bottles thrown at police. But with the National Guard patrolling the streets and a 10 p.m. curfew still in effect Thursday, Baltimore remained calm.

Just before 5 p.m. Thursday, about 500 people — some carrying signs or wearing shirts that read ""I bleed Baltimore"" or ""I ♥ being black"" — marched in the streets, chanting and raising their fists in the air. They soon met up with another group, and together they moved peacefully toward City Hall.

Gray’s death has sparked marches in other parts of the country. In Philadelphia, a peaceful rally turned tense Thursday night when a group of protesters who tried to enter Interstate 95 clashed with police.

Baltimore police said that more demonstrations were planned for Friday and beyond and that they intended to maintain a large presence of law-enforcement officers.

“Although we’ve had two days of peace and quiet, we still have a weekend to make it through,” Batts said.

Also on Thursday, the national response team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives began investigating the site of a three-alarm fire Monday night that destroyed a senior center being built next to a church in East Baltimore.

The blaze at the Mary Harkins Senior Center on North Chester Street is one of seven fires the ATF team is investigating as possible arsons, said Special Agent David Cheplak, an ATF spokesman. The others include fires at two CVS pharmacies and a Rite Aid pharmacy.

In many parts of the city Thursday, residents tried to return to business as usual. In the West Baltimore neighborhood that was at the center of the rioting, some people waited for buses. Next door to a CVS that was looted and burned Monday, about 60 senior citizens who live in a building there worried about how they would get their medication, food and toiletries. But on Thursday, some of their concerns were alleviated as residents, businesses and sororities dropped off donated items.

“This is such a blessing,” said Reginald Hope, 72, one of the residents.

Some groups, including CASA de Maryland and members of the Baltimore United for Change coalition, criticized authorities for not being transparent enough.

“The public has a right to know the details of the investigation,” said Kim Propeack, director of CASA in Action, the political arm of the immigrant-advocacy organization.

Local authorities defended their handling of the case and pleaded for patience, noting that their investigation and related federal probes are continuing. On CNN, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (D) seemed to lash out at people who have criticized her response to the crisis.

“The record is clear. I invited the Department of Justice in here to reform our Police Department. . . . I know we have problems, and I was determined to fix them. Don’t get it twisted,” she said.

The office of Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby released a statement confirming that it had “received the hard copies” of the police investigative file but that the results of the probe were “not new to us.”

“We have been briefed regularly throughout their process while simultaneously conducting our own independent investigation into the death of Freddie Gray,” the statement said. “We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.”

The case is fraught with unanswered questions and controversy.

When Gray was taken into custody, two officers put their knees into his back, then dragged his seemingly limp body to the van as he cried out, according to a video shot by bystanders.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) has questioned the cause for stopping Gray: A police document says he ran from officers and he was later found to have a knife.

Authorities have said previously that the transport van stopped once to put Gray in leg irons, another time to check on him and a third time to pick up another arrestee.

Kevin Davis, a deputy police commissioner, said investigators had found out about an additional stop — at North Fremont Avenue and Mosher Street — after reviewing footage from a private surveillance camera, although he did not specify what happened during it.

Batts has said an officer driving the van has described Gray as “irate,” and an application for a search warrant says that Gray “continued to be combative in the police wagon.”

The search warrant affidavit said another prisoner in the van told investigators he heard Gray banging against the sides of the vehicle as if he “was intentionally trying to injure himself.” But the law enforcement official said that the prisoner may have heard Gray’s body thrashing uncontrollably after sustaining a “catastrophic injury to his spine.”

An attorney for Gray’s family has disputed the notion that Gray could have “severed his own spinal cord” and questioned the accuracy of some police reports.

Officials with the state medical examiners office would not discuss details of Gray’s case.

Bruce Goldfarb, a spokesman for the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, said the autopsy work is not complete. “We don’t do preliminary findings,” he said.

Six police officers, including a lieutenant and a sergeant, were suspended after the incident.

http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/04/us/garland-mohammed-drawing-contest-shooting/index.html",0,"Two gunmen, including a man once suspected of seeking to join Islamist militants in Somalia, waited only seconds to open fire on police blocking their way to a cartoon exhibit and contest depicting the prophet Muhammad, authorities said Monday during a widening probe into a suburban shootout near Dallas that left both attackers dead and raised possible links to a homegrown terror plot.

The motive for the late Sunday attack was not immediately clear, but one of the event’s keynote speakers — Dutch parliament member Geert Wilders — has been denounced by Islamist militant groups such as al-Qaeda for his outspoken criticism of the Muslim presence in Europe.

The event’s organizer, too, has been criticized for its anti-Muslim rhetoric by rights groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The firepower of the suspected attackers — assault weapons and some type of body armor — also suggested that the Dallas suburb of Garland could be the latest point of violence linked to tensions between Western-style open expression and drawings considered highly provocative by many Muslims.

“Obviously they were there to shoot people,” Garland police spokesman Joe Harn told reporters. But he stopped short of describing the shooting as a terrorist attack. He said, however, that investigators have not ruled out possible terrorist connections.

Nearly 900 miles to the west, meanwhile, investigators searched the Phoenix apartment of the suspects. A U.S. law enforcement official told The Washington Post that the attackers have been identified as Elton Simpson, 30 — who had previously been the target of a terror-linked probe — and his roommate, Nadir Soofi, as officials tried to piece together the planning behind the late Sunday attack that wounded one guard.

Some Twitter posts, including several claiming affiliation with the Islamic State, had appeared in recent days decrying the cartoon event organized by a group widely viewed as anti-Muslim. But investigators had made no public connections between the social media traffic and Sunday’s attack.

Simpson was convicted in 2011 of lying to federal agents about plans to travel to Africa in an apparent attempt to join a terrorist group in Somalia. The judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to link Simpson to “international terrorism” and placed him on three years of probation.

At the Phoenix apartment complex, agents wearing FBI jackets combed the first-floor apartment and a white Chevy minivan.

Harn said the bloodshed happened quickly.

Shortly before 7 p.m. Sunday, a vehicle approached the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, about 20 miles northeast of Dallas, but was stopped on the perimeter of the complex by two officers — part of an extensive security detachment guarding the event.

The gunmen then opened fire with assault weapons. One officer, armed with a pistol, fired back and killed both attackers, said Harn.

An unarmed security guard was wounded, but the injuries were not life-threatening.

“[The officer] did what he was trained to do,” said Harn, “and probably saved lives.”

More than 12 hours after the shooting, the gunmen’s bodies were still lying on the street, as bomb squads searched their car and surrounding areas.

Nearby businesses and a hotel were locked down or evacuated. Some “suspicious” items were destroyed as a precaution, Harn said. Extra ammunition was uncovered, but no explosives were found. The vehicle, however, contained luggage, suggesting the attackers may have driven directly to the conference center.

Security was extremely tight for the event: A contest hosted by the New York-based American Freedom Defense Initiative, which promised to award $10,000 for the best cartoon depicting the prophet Muhammad. The group’s president, Pamela Geller, told the AP she had planned the contest to make a stand for free speech following violence over Muhammad drawings.

Geller’s group has led opposition to Islamic-linked projects in the United States, including a campaign against building an Islamic center near the former World Trade Center site. Current plans call for an Islamic museum and prayer space at the Lower Manhattan building.

Participants at the event had to have tickets in advance, and IDs were checked to match with a guest list. Off-duty police officers and private security were hired amid concerns over a possible backlash.

Usama Shami, president of the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix, told CNN that Simpson had drifted away from the group’s mosque and other activities since 2011, but never appeared to display “extremist views” in earlier years.

“It is totally out of character of the person I knew,” said Shami when asked about the Texas attack.

Wilders, who has spoken out against radical Islam, has advocated hard-line views including closing the Netherlands to future Muslim immigration. He has lived under round-the-clock police protection since 2004 when he joined others pushing anti-Islamic positions following the slaying of Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh by a Dutch-Moroccan assailant.

Wilders and Geller presented a check to the contest winner, Bosch Fawstin.

One of Fawstin’s cartoons depicts a sword-swinging caricature of Muhammad saying: “You can’t draw me!” The artist replies: “That’s why I draw you.”

“And the pen, the drawings, will prove mightier than the sword,” Wilders said during his speech at the event — whose poster was inspired by Norman Rockwell’s famous “Triple Self Portrait,” but with Muhammad taking the place of Rockwell.

“The Muhammad art event was organized and brought here by people from outside of the Garland community,” the city of Garland said in a statement. “They rented convention center space at the Curtis Culwell Center.”

The police similarly said that many attendees, including people who had to abandon their cars inside an active crime scene, were not from the city.

“A lot of these people don’t even live in Garland,” said the police spokesman Harn. “In fact, this event doesn’t even have much to do with Garland, other than they rented a site here in Garland.”

There have been a number of attacks associated with depictions of the prophet Muhammad — the most deadly being an assault in January on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo that left 12 dead, including Charlie Hebdo’s editor and cartoonists. Two attackers, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were killed by police after a manhunt following the shooting.

“This new event will stand for free speech and show that Americans will not be cowed by violent Islamist intimidation,” according to the group’s Web site. “That is a crucial stand to take as Islamist assaults on the freedom of speech, our most fundamental freedom, are growing more insistent.”

But Sunday’s competition had been a point of contention in the community since Garland Independent School District agreed to rent out its event center to the group, which is considered an anti-Muslim “hate group” by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ahead of the event, Islamic groups said it was an attack against their faith, according to the Dallas Morning News.

After the shooting, Geller took to Twitter.

“This incident was obviously related to our event, as evidenced by the ISIS supporters on Twitter taking credit for and praising the gunmen,” she told The Post in an e-mail, referring to the Islamic State, a radical al-Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIS or ISIL. “The Islamic jihadis are determined to suppress our freedom of speech violently. They struck in Paris and Copenhagen recently, and now in Texas.

“This incident shows how much needed our event really was. The freedom of speech is under violent assault here in our nation. The question now before is — will we stand and defend it, or bow to violence, thuggery and savagery?”

But Harn said it was still unclear whether the shooting was related.

After the shooting, some of the contest attendees were escorted to a room deeper in the conference center. Some stood and sang “God Bless America.”

Garland police said in a statement:

As today’s Muhammad Art Exhibit event at the Curtis Culwell Center was coming to an end, two males drove up to the front of the building in a car. Both males were armed and began shooting at a Garland ISD security officer. The GISD security officer’s injuries are not life-threatening. Garland Police officers engaged the gunmen, who were both shot and killed. Police suspect the vehicle may contain an incendiary device and the bomb squad is on the scene. The surrounding businesses including Academy Sports, Walmart and Sam’s are being evacuated. Event participants are also being evacuated from the Curtis Culwell Center for their safety.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Washington-based advocacy group, condemned the attack but said the organizers also displayed intolerance.

“We also reiterate our view that violence in response to anti-Islam programs like the one in Garland is more insulting to our faith than any cartoon, however defamatory,” CAIR said in a statement. “Bigoted speech can never be an excuse for violence.”

Nearly a decade ago, tensions over the publication of cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad spread around the world after a Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, carried a series of drawings. In November 2005, several European newspapers republished the images, triggering more protests around the Muslim world.

In February — a month after the Paris attacks — a 22-year-old man in Copenhagen went on a 12-hour spree of violence that began with an attack on a gathering attended by a Swedish artist, Lars Vilks, who had received threats for his cartoons of Muhammad."

http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/22/us/washington-mansion-fire-slayings/index.html",0,"Authorities said in court papers Friday that the brutal killings of the Savopoulos family in Northwest Washington probably involved a conspiracy of more than one person taking the victims captive and waiting more than 19 hours for a $40,000 ransom before killing them and setting fire to their multimillion-dollar home. Savvas Savopoulos, 46, his wife, Amy, 47, and their housekeeper, Veralicia Figueroa, 57, were beaten and stabbed, according to the court papers — the arrest warrant affidavit written by police. The couple’s 10-year-old son, Philip, was found dead on a charred queen-size mattress in his bedroom. He had been beaten, stabbed and burned, police said in the document, and his room and others in the house were doused with gasoline.

The new details came as the first suspect identified in the slayings made his initial appearance in D.C. Superior Court. Daron Dylon Wint, 34, was arrested Thursday night after a two-day manhunt and charged with first-degree murder while armed.

Police said in the affidavit that the elaborate crime probably “required the presence and assistance of more than one person.” The document also says that police think “all four decedents were held captive by Mr. Wint and others.” Police did not elaborate, but they have said other suspects have not been ruled out.

Suspect in quadruple killings captured in D.C. + 16 Police apprehended a man they say killed a Northwest Washington businessman, found dead with his wife, son and housekeeper.

Wint was captured in Northeast Washington after a task force of federal marshals and police tracked him to New York and back to the District over two days.

Wint so far is charged only in the death of the family patriarch, a wealthy socialite and business executive who ran American Iron Works, a large supplier of iron and steel to construction projects. Officials said additional charges are likely in the deaths of the wife, son and housekeeper.

Wint appeared in court with his wrists and ankles shackled, escorted by three marshals.

He said only his name at the hearing. At times, he shook his shoulder-length dreads out of his eyes.

His attorney, Natalie Lawson of the Public Defender Service, said in court that the case was “based on speculation and guesswork.” She added: “He is innocent. There is no link to the killings or the death of the decedent. There is nothing linking him to these deaths.”

Magistrate Judge Errol R. Arthur ordered Wint held until his next court appearance June 23, saying there was “a lot of circumstantial evidence here, but it all points to the defendant.”

The Savopoulos family on Friday thanked law enforcement for the arrest.

“While it does not abate our pain, we hope that it begins to restore a sense of calm and security to our neighborhood and to our city,” they said in a statement issued by a family spokeswoman.

The police affidavit filed in court Friday offers new details about how the family and Figueroa were held and killed in the three-story home on Woodland Drive NW, near the vice president’s mansion. Police have said that Wint once worked for Savopoulos’s American Iron Works firm in Hyattsville, Md., but have not offered a motive. D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier has assured residents that the family was targeted and the crime was not random.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily Miller said Wint’s DNA was found on discarded pizza left in the room where the three adults were found dead.

She said police found a fingerprint on a water bottle at the house, and that prosecutors were seeking to compare it with Wint’s fingerprints.

Police also have been examining confusing and mysterious text messages sent among the Savopouloses and another housekeeper, whom they repeatedly told to stay away from the home. They also investigated the actions of Savopoulos’s assistant, who delivered the $40,000 to the house May 14 in the moments before the killings.

In the affidavit, police said the assistant told detectives that Savopoulos called him on the morning of May 14 and told him to go to the iron company, pick up a package and deliver it to the D.C. house.

The assistant told police two versions of how he obtained the package — a red bag filled with $40,000 that had been withdrawn by other Iron Works employees from one of the company’s accounts at Bank of America.

The assistant said Savopoulos instructed him to take the money from the red bag and put it in a manila envelope, then place it inside a red car parked in the garage at the family home. The assistant then texted another person a photo of a red bag with what appeared to be two bundles of money wrapped in white bands. Authorities declined to comment on the assistant’s text or say who received it.

The arrest affidavit says matter-of-factly that “after the money was delivered, the four decedents were killed.”

Police said Wint took the family’s blue Porsche, which was found later that day burned in a church parking lot in Prince George’s County, two miles from Wint’s parents’ home.

Wint’s capture was precipitated by the pizza the family ordered during the ordeal. The affidavit says Amy Savopoulos ordered two pizzas from a Tenleytown Domino’s at 9:14 p.m. May 13 and instructed the driver to leave the boxes on the front porch, ring the bell and leave, saying she was nursing a sick child. The delivery person reported seeing the house completely dark, except for the porch light.

Police said they found two Domino’s boxes in the bedroom where the three adults were found.

A cheese pizza had not been eaten, but a pepperoni pie had been partially consumed. Police used a federal lab to expedite a DNA test and said a match came back for Wint, who has an arrest and conviction record in Maryland.

U.S. Marshals Cmdr. Robert Fernandez, who runs the Capital Area Regional Fugitive Task Force, said his agents were summoned Tuesday after D.C. police learned Wint’s name for the first time.

By Wednesday, they believed he had fled to Brooklyn, where he has family and friends. But a raid on an apartment there later that night turned up empty.

“He had just left,” Fernandez said. “We barely missed him.”

Fernandez said his team “worked through the night,” and Thursday they learned Wint might be back in the Washington area, at a Howard Johnson hotel in College Park, Md. By that time, D.C. police had released his name and announced a $25,000 reward.

But as agents were trying to learn what room he was in, Fernandez said a surveillance team noticed Wint leaving in one of two vehicles that pulled out of the parking lot shortly before 11 p.m.

Police followed a box truck and a white Chevrolet Cruze sedan heading toward the District. “It was obvious they were traveling together,” he said.

About 25 unmarked police cars and a helicopter from Prince George’s County — tracking the vehicles with a thermal-imaging camera — followed them into the District. Near Rhode Island Avenue and 10th Street NE, Fernandez said an unmarked police car got between the truck and the sedan, and other cars pinned them. Officers, some armed with semiautomatic weapons, detained five people from both vehicles.

Fernandez said Wint was in the back seat of the sedan, which had a female driver and passenger. He said two men were in the truck. They were seated on a curb and handcuffed. “They had no idea they were being followed,” he said.

Authorities said they found $10,000 in the truck; Fernandez said he saw money stuffed into the side door. Court documents say authorities found money orders exceeding $10,000 and a large stack of $100 bills, the same denomination delivered to Savopoulos in the $40,000 delivery.

D.C. police said only that Wint was arrested. A spokesman said none of the others were charged with crimes, but offered no explanation. Wint said everyone in the vehicles surrendered without incident.

“They were in the face of overwhelming odds and force,” he said.

It has been updated to include the news that Pataki has announced his presidential campaign. The tall man in a blazer burst into the Chipotle in the middle of the afternoon. He had a smile, a TV camera following him and the jovial air of a man who expects to be recognized.

“George Pataki, from New York,” he said, shaking hands with the first two diners he met. “We’re doing the non-Hillary tour. We’re actually saying ‘hi’ to people.”

Then the tall man moved on, to quiz the next table about their food. (“Chicken burrito? I gotta try something new.”) When he was gone, the first two diners wondered: Who was that? Do they not have Chipotle where he lives?

“It’s like, ‘Oh, I’m from New York,’ ” said Aaron Lee, 22. “What are you doing here, then?”

Officially, what George E. Pataki was doing was flirting — for the fourth time in 16 years — with the idea of running for president of the United States.

A few weeks ago, Pataki was in New Hampshire: raising money, and telling people that he was close, close, close to making a decision. “I’m strongly leaning toward making the run,” he told a radio station in New Hampshire.

This happened three times before. Every other time Pataki flirted with running, he didn't [On Thursday, the Republican ex-governor of New York announced that this time, he is actually is running].

Spring is the flirting season in American politics: in the early part of this year, more than 20 politicians were officially “considering” or “exploring” a run for president. The key to understanding this strange every-four-years ritual is to understand that there are two kinds of flirting.

For the big-name candidates, the presidential flirt is a useful, temporary, legal dodge. They will run. They are essentially running already. But they don’t want to admit it yet, because that would bring on tighter fundraising rules.

Advertisement

For the others — particularly the eight or so who have fallen out of the political spotlight — the flirt can be an end in itself. It allows them to experience some of the most pleasant parts of a campaign: audiences, media attention, a chance to raise money. And then it lets them escape before they have to face the less-pleasant parts. Such as getting crushed.

This time, apparently, Pataki is ready to take that risk.

“I make a joke that every four years, there’s the Olympics, there’s the World Cup and I come to New Hampshire thinking about running for president,” Pataki told a crowd of 15 people during a speech at a Sea-Doo and snowmobile dealership in Laconia, N.H.

Nobody laughed. Then Pataki said this election was different: “This time, in all honesty, I see things differently.”

Pataki, 69, has already lived a remarkable political life. The son of a postman, he unseated liberal icon Mario Cuomo (D) in a 1994 governor’s race — one of New York’s legendary upsets. Pataki then won second and third terms by large margins. He led New York through the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the rebuilding of Ground Zero.

Advertisement

But he has not held office since 2007. Since then, his political star has faded somewhat.

“Who is Bloomberg?” a “Jeopardy!” contestant said in January while looking at a photo of Pataki.

The category was ""New York governors,"" and the clue was ""He took New York into the 21st century.""

“No,” host Alex Trebek said. The other two contestants stared blankly at the same photo, without buzzing in, until time ran out.

Another sign: There used to be a museum about Pataki in his hometown of Peekskill, N.Y. It opened after he left office, complete with an exhibit where schoolkids could see Pataki’s gubernatorial desk.

Then, in 2013, it closed. Its leaders thought maybe more schoolkids would visit if it was a Web site.

“Basically, it would be like a monkey flying out of a unicorn’s [posterior]” if Pataki won the 2016 Republican nomination, said Florida-based GOP strategist Rick Wilson. If Pataki got into the GOP primary, he would face obstacles that go far beyond his meager name recognition. He is pro-choice. He signed strict gun-control laws. He let state government spending grow rapidly.

In recent polls, his best showing has been 1 percent.

“Let’s just say a meteor strikes the first debate and kills everyone except Pataki, who is stuck in traffic. Let’s hypothesize for a moment,” Wilson said. He thought. No. It still wouldn’t be Pataki. They’d find somebody else.

But despite those long odds, Pataki came to New Hampshire last month for his eighth flirting-related visit since September. He later made a ninth.

“I know I can appeal — not just to Republicans and conservatives — but to independents and intelligent Democrats as well,” Pataki told an audience of eight College Republicans at the University of New Hampshire.

This is the heart of Pataki’s pitch to voters. He’s a Republican who won big in a blue state. He’s a reformer who would tame Washington’s bureaucracy. “I go there today, and it’s like I’m on an alien planet,” Pataki said of Washington. “They are an insular world. They talk a language you don’t understand.”

In New Hampshire, Pataki’s crowds were not big. At the official opening of his super PAC’s office in Manchester, for instance, 25 people turned up. And one of them turned out to be an incognito staffer for Donald Trump. Think about that. If this was an intentional act of flirter-against-flirter espionage (which the Trump staffer denied), it might be the most pointless dirty trick in the history of American politics.

Nevertheless, wherever Pataki went, the crowds were pleasant and admiring.

“Under a Pataki administration,” one man asked him at a diner, how would Middle East policy change?

“You’d change everything,” Pataki told him.

This is one of the things that makes flirting worthwhile: for an ex-politician, it is an unlocked door back into the American political arena.

That can mean new audiences for men used to audiences. The same College Republicans, for instance, had recently hosted a 2016 flirter whose odds are even longer than Pataki's: former Virginia governor James Gilmore III (R). Gilmore left office in 2002.

“I mean, thank God for Wikipedia,” said UNH senior Elliot Gault, 22.

And the same kind of magic works on the news media. Before former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee (D) announced he was exploring a presidential run on April 9, The Washington Post had not quoted him about anything in nine months.

In the weeks after that, The Post quoted him eight times. Er, nine.

“Clinton is just too hawkish,” Chafee said in an interview, repeating his signature attack line on the Democratic front-runner, former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton.

The other great thing about flirting is the money. While you flirt, you can raise it. And if you don’t run, you can spend it anyway.

In 1999, for instance, Pataki flirted with a campaign, then gave up and endorsed George W. Bush. In 2007, he did it again. “I was very serious about it” that time, Pataki says now. “But: Mayor Giuliani.” The former New York City mayor was in the race, and Pataki didn’t think there was room for two New Yorkers. So he got out.

Both times, Pataki raised more than $1 million in donors' money. Both times, the New York Times reported, Pataki spent it — giving to allied Republican candidates, paying for Pataki's travels, and paying a circle of Pataki's own advisers, strategists and fundraisers.

Then came 2012.

""I was very serious about it,"" Pataki says. ""But everywhere I went, people had committed to Mitt Romney."" He pulled the plug but still raised and spent more than $600,000 via a political nonprofit.

This year, Pataki is raising money again — for a super PAC called “We the People, Not Washington.” Among those leading the fundraising are several Pataki associates who got paid from the money he raised in past flirtations. Aides wouldn’t say how much he’d raised or spent this time.

“Because he was my friend, I wouldn’t feel cheated [if Pataki didn’t run]. I’m never one to say that a guy should be a suicide lunatic,” said Peter Kalikow, a New York real estate titan who donated to Pataki’s super PAC this year. In the last presidential cycle, Kalikow was a major backer of another long shot: pizza executive Herman Cain.

Pataki’s aides said they had a strategy ready if their man really got into the race. He’ll stand out in the debates with his genial wit and executive experience. Then he’ll surge in New Hampshire, by appealing to libertarian-leaning . . .

Wait.

Perhaps we’re getting ahead of ourselves.

“When I heard the name, I was like, ‘Pataki. Pataki. Pataki.’ But I didn’t know that he was the mayor of New York,” Tony Coutee, 42, a crane operator who was at the second table Pataki visited in that Manchester Chipotle, said incorrectly. After Pataki left his table, Coutee said, “I Googled him and found out.”

""So he is running?"" asked Coutee's lunch companion, Jason Soto, 35.

Yes, Coutee said.

While the two of them were talking, Pataki was into a full-blown, campaign-style restaurant schmooze. He bumped elbows with the grill man. He walked back to greet employees in the walk-in cooler (“He just shook my hand and I said I didn’t want to be on camera, and he asked if I was on parole,” one said, bewildered.) Pataki went through the line and loudly asked if he could leave a tip.

Then he came back and sat down with Coutee and Soto. “I’m trying the chicken burrito,” Pataki told them.

The two men quickly got up to leave.

“Kinda normal,” Soto said of this only-in-flirting-season interaction, a pseudo-conversation with a pseudo-candidate, who never said what he was running for. “But abnormal.”"
2581,2581,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/05/27/pentagon-army-laboratory-inadvertently-distributed-live-anthrax/,0,"An Army laboratory in Utah inadvertently distributed live samples of anthrax to facilities in nine states, prompting an ongoing effort to recover them and and another sample sent to a U.S. military base in South Korea, Pentagon officials said Thursday. The first live sample discovered was shipped from Dugway Proving Ground in Utah to an undisclosed facility in Maryland and reported by workers there May 22. Live samples from that same batch — labeled “AG1” — were sent to laboratories in eight other states, and could have been distributed from there to additional facilities run by the government or private companies, according to a defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the incident.

The Pentagon also said that one sample of anthrax was sent to the Joint United States Forces Korea Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition Program at Osan Air Base. It did not clarify whether that same was live.

“The sample was destroyed in accordance with appropriate protocols,” said Army Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, in a statement.

Warren said the Department of Defense is collaborating with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in an investigation to determine what happened.

“There is no known risk to the general public, and there are no suspected or confirmed cases of anthrax infection in potentially exposed lab workers,” Warren’s statement said. “Out of an abundance of caution, [the Defense Department] has stopped the shipment of this material from its labs pending completion of the investigation.”

The Pentagon confirmed a U.S. military facility mistakenly shipped live anthrax bacteria to laboratories in nine states and a U.S. base in South Korea. (Video: Reuters)

The lab at Dugway was involved in a Defense Department effort to develop a test to identify biological threats in the field, Warren said. A defense official said an anthrax sample is typically irradiated to kill it, and then distributed to facilities that are involved in the program. It is not clear what wrong in that process.

A broad effort to lock down the other samples began less than a day after the Maryland laboratory reported the live sample, and the CDC was called in, a defense official said. The other samples were sent to labs in Texas, Wisconsin, Delaware, New Jersey, Tennessee, New York, California and Virginia, the official added.

Dugway Proving Ground is an isolated area about 85 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, and is known for testing biological and chemical weapon defense systems. It has suffered at least one significant incident previously: A 2011 lockdown prompted by a misplaced vial of nerve agent. The base was re-opened without any illness after the vial was discovered."

One father — a tiny man — suddenly became agitated. He was speaking in Spanish, and Kearney could not understand him. A visitor in the courtroom stepped in: “I think he needs to be someplace. He needs someone to translate for him.”

So on the spot, Kearney swore in the helpful stranger as an officer of the court. His name, it turned out, was Jeb Bush.

The frantic man was a jockey at a nearby horse track, and the court proceedings were running so late that he was likely to miss his next race. “He’s worried, because he’s afraid to lose his job. And if he loses his job, he can’t get his daughter back,” Bush explained.

Bush stayed for hours, until that and every other case had been dealt with. Then, Kearney recalled, Bush asked her: “Can we have lunch next week?”

That was late spring of 1997, a time in his life that Bush now refers to as “wandering around.”

But he was far from aimless.

In that period, Bush retooled himself and his image from that of a sometimes cartoonish ideologue into what he is today. Indeed, as he prepares to formally announce his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, the question being asked is whether he is strident enough.

Humbled by defeat the first time he ran for office, Bush spent the mid-1990s broadening and deepening his knowledge of how his state worked, forging relationships that softened his profile and striving to talk about what he believed in a way that would bring people together.

""I learned tone,"" Bush said in an interview. ""You can say the same thing that represents your core beliefs in a way that draws people toward your message, rather than pushes people away.

Advertisement

“And that’s a lesson in 2016,” he added. “To win, you’ve got to get to 50. To get to 50, you draw people toward your message, not use language that makes the dramatic point, which is effective in political discourse but turns some people away.”

On the day he is expected to announce his run for president, former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) released a video saying he is ""ready to lead."" (Video: Jeb Bush)

Tough-talking conservative

Bush had run for governor in Florida three years before that day he showed up in Kearney’s courtroom.

It was a spectacularly good election season for Republicans across the country, and Bush had followed the 1994 playbook to the letter. He boasted of himself as a “head-banging conservative.” He talked of “blowing up” state agencies. Asked what he would do for African Americans, he answered: “Probably nothing.” Women on welfare, he said, “should be able to get their life together and find a husband.”

""You could argue he was one of the most conservative politicians in the country,"" said Matthew T. Corrigan, who chairs the University of North Florida's department of political science and wrote a book about Bush's two terms as governor titled ""Conservative Hurricane: How Jeb Bush Remade Florida.""

Advertisement

Corrigan added: ""In some ways, he was the Ted Cruz of his time,"" a reference to the firebrand senator from Texas who is also running for the GOP presidential nomination.

Bush fell barely short of winning against Democratic incumbent Lawton Chiles, whom Republicans accused of dirty tactics at the end. That same night, his brother George W. Bush won an upset over a sitting governor in Texas and took the first step toward becoming the second Bush in the White House.

Jeb Bush was devastated.

“I put my heart and soul into it,” he recalled. “I thought I was going to win, and so did a lot of other people. It was kind of hard, because I’m normally pretty good at just moving on.”

Bush was not sure whether he would run again. But he did know one thing: If he did, he would go about it in a very different way.

“It just dawned on me at some point. I don’t remember exactly what it was, but I just came to this awareness of myself that I didn’t show my heart,” Bush said.

“I lost not because he cheated. I lost because, when the attacks started, not enough people shrugged their shoulders and said: ‘That’s not true. I know this guy. He’s a good man,’ ” Bush said. “That was kind of the catalyst for the next few years of my life.”

He also began to realize how much he had to learn. He had to put the policies that he advocated in the context of human faces and personal stories — something that did not come naturally to him.

“Personally, I’m an introvert. I’m not, like, a gregarious guy, who needs the energy of a crowd to make me feel fulfilled. I’d rather read a 20-page policy brief,” he said. “So I just met a whole new group of people. We did a lot of interesting things.”

He scaled back his involvement in his real estate development business. He started a think tank — or, as he likes to call it, a “do tank” — called the Foundation for Florida’s Future.

And Bush made some changes in his private life. Most notably, he fulfilled a long-standing promise to his wife, Columba, to convert to Catholicism.

Shortly after the 1994 election, he began attending weekly religious instruction classes.

“I was hanging out with real people who couldn’t care less about politics. They were obviously people grounded in their faith because they were the sponsors for a really diverse group of people that were coming into the faith,” Bush said. “So that was meaningful as well.”

Bush acknowledged that there was maintenance work to do at home as well, though he said that reports that his marriage hit the rocks after the 1994 campaign were “a little over-exaggerated, in the sense that there weren’t deep strains or anything.”

“Just getting reconnected to make sure that I was being a good dad, being a good husband was important,” he said.

And he wandered around.

‘He would just drive’

“There was no grand plan. He would hear about these people and say, ‘I want to go see them,’ ” said Sally Bradshaw, who was and remains his closest adviser. “He would just drive. He would get in his car and drive.”

Bush sent long memos to aides about what he had learned. Some of the people he met later played major roles in his gubernatorial administration.

Kearney, for instance, had been known as a fierce critic of the Florida Department of Children and Families; she was tapped to run it under Bush. (She resigned in 2002, after coming under fire in several cases in which children disappeared from the state’s foster-care system.)

In early 1995, Bush asked to meet Miami Urban League President T. Willard Fair, ostensibly because he wanted to donate some of his leftover campaign money to Fair’s programs to improve education. As the two talked, they discovered that they shared many of the same ideas about what was wrong with the school system and how to fix it.

“He said, ‘You know, why don’t we start a charter school?’ ” Fair recalled. “I said, ‘What’s a charter school?’ ”

He and Fair worked with the governor who had beaten Bush to pass a law establishing a charter-school system. In 1996, they set up the first one in Florida.

“Then it dawned on us: We didn’t have any children,” Fair said.

Fair gathered a group of mothers. It took some persuading to get them to enroll their children, given that none of them had ever heard of a charter school.

The meeting itself, the Urban League director noticed, was a new experience for Bush.

“This was the first time he had ever met with an all-black audience,” Fair recalled. “He was visibly uncomfortable.”

But over time, as Bush became a regular presence at the Liberty City Charter School, “he became as comfortable with my mothers and babies as I was,” Fair said. “By continuous association, like anything else.”

When he became governor, Bush ceased his direct involvement with the school, to avoid a conflict of interest; it shut down because of financial difficulties in 2008.

Chris Card, who was executive director of the nonprofit Florida Network of Youth and Family Services, met Bush during his failed 1994 campaign, through his friend Carl Weinrich, head of the Sarasota YMCA. They found they agreed that private, community-based groups should be empowered to provide child-welfare services.

But “the issue didn’t rise during that campaign at all that I could recall,” Card said. So he was surprised when Bush called Weinrich after the election and said, “This is too good an idea to let go of, just because I lost the election.” Bush helped them push the idea with Chiles, who supported it and got it through the legislature.

Bush was campaigning again for governor in the summer of 1998 when he met Berthy De La Rosa-Aponte, the mother of a disabled child in Broward County. She complained that there wasn’t enough support for parents like herself, who wanted to care for their children at home.

“I talked and talked,” she recalled. “Maybe 30 minutes into the thing, he asked me: ‘Will you take me around? I want to learn.’ ”

Bush often cited Aponte in his speeches and ultimately committed hundreds of millions in state money to the disabled — though cynics noted he was spurred in part by the fact that Florida was facing lawsuits over the issue.

Aponte insisted, however, that theirs was a connection, not a calculation on Bush’s part: “I’m Latina. He didn’t know if I’m a Democrat or a Republican. He didn’t know if I vote. He didn’t know if I’m a U.S. citizen.”

Bush’s 1998 Democratic opponent was a weaker one, Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay. He warned Floridians not to fall for Jeb 2.0.

“Voters need to know [Bush] is the same person he was in 1994,” MacKay said. “He’s presenting himself with a smile and a smoother image. But the people who are giving him money, putting muscle in that campaign, are the same ones as before. That’s a Christian Coalition conservative right. And they need to understand Jeb Bush hasn’t changed. People may be in for a real surprise.”

‘I took the horns off’

Bush won by more than 10 points. His victory signaled a sea change in Florida and the South because it gave Republicans control of both the legislature and the governor’s office for the first time since Reconstruction.

What he had done in the years since that first loss changed everything, even though he maintained that his ideas were the same.

“Yeah, in 1994, I called for a statewide [school] voucher program. In 1998, I called for a statewide voucher program,” he said. “The difference was that I took the horns off. I’m sure I didn’t get every teachers-union-member vote, but they knew I was serious. They knew I had a heart for this. They knew I understood their challenges, their issues.

“So what I called then ‘wandering around’ probably was a pretty effective political tool,” he said. “But for me personally, it was really important. It added a lot of purpose and joy to the experience, which can be a little dreary. And I learned a lot.”

The question for Bush now is how much of his party wants him to take the horns off. Bush’s notion of getting to 50 percent of the vote indicates a focus on the general election, not the heated primary battle he’s engaged in. He has been received coolly by much of his party, in part because of a desire for a fresh face, but also because his moderate stances on issues such as immigration and education are out of stride with the views of many conservatives. It’s not soft tones they want but hard edges.

In retrospect, Bush allows that his 1994 loss might have been a good thing in some ways — for himself and maybe even for Florida.

""If I was elected in '94, started out serving in '95, I would have learned it,"" he said. Then he laughed. ""I think I would have learned it.

“But it would have been on the run,” he said. “When I showed up in January 1999, I had an agenda. I had a team. It was the most diverse team in Florida’s history. It was grounded."

“I’m not doing that to brag,” he said (heaven forbid!), “because you know what? I don’t have to brag.”

But he can’t seem to stop himself. Trump’s announcement (from Trump Tower, ’natch) that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination was a veritable festival of the first person. A search of the transcript finds that he uttered “I” 195 times, “my” or “mine” 28 times, “me” 22 times and “I’ve or “I’d” 12 times — for a grand total of 257 self-references. This compares with seven mentions of “America” or “American,” most of which were references to his holdings (“I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war — very valuable”) and his declaration that “the American Dream is dead.”

If the American Dream weren't already dead, it would have killed itself listening to Trump's 45-minute greed-is-good speech at a time when the gap between rich and poor is wider than it has been since the Great Depression. But don't blame Trump, the doughy showman President Obama dubbed a ""carnival barker"" for his role in the birther movement. This reality TV star is simply exploiting the political system as it exists.

Trump is the Frankenstein monster created by our campaign-finance system in which money trumps all. The Supreme Court has equated money with free speech (by letting first candidates and then contributors spend unlimited sums), which means the more money you have, the more speech you get. Trump may be preposterous, but there are 8,737,540,000 reasons we have to listen to him — the figure Trump claimed is his net worth.

So let’s hear about Trump’s qualifications to hold the nation’s highest office.

“I beat China all the time — all the time.”

“I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.”

“I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They’re great.”

“I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I’m building all over the world.”

""We're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office. . . . It's going to be the best hotel in Washington.""

“We need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote ‘The Art of the Deal.’ ”

Trump’s speech had the feel of a lonely bar patron’s monologue to the captive saloon keeper. He bounced among stray thoughts about China, the Islamic State, conversations he had with friends, a claim he can build a Web site for $3, Obama’s golf game, John Kerry’s bicycle accident, Bowe Bergdahl and a fanciful negotiation between President Trump and Ford Motor Co. (“he’ll say ‘please, please, please’ ”). At one point, music started up as if Trump’s speech had ended, but the candidate kept going — invariably returning to his favorite subject.

CHARLESTON, S.C. — Emanuel AME Church swung open its doors for services Sunday, four days after a 21-year-old white man who told police he wanted “to start a race war” allegedly killed the pastor and eight congregants attending a Bible study in the church basement. Hundreds lined up in the hot Charleston sun to climb the stairs to the sanctuary of “Mother Emanuel,” one of the country’s oldest African American churches and one with a rich history of resilience. The organist played and church bells chimed as the choir sang “Blessed Assurance.”

Worshipers from Charleston and across the country filled the pews and balcony of the church. Some watched the sermon from seats in the fellowship-hall basement — where the shooting occurred Wednesday.

“This is our house of worship,” said the Rev. Norvell Goff, presiding elder of the Edisto District of the State Conference of the AME Church, addressing the congregants. “The doors of the church are open, praise be to God.”

“No evildoer, no demon in hell or on Earth can close the doors of God’s church.”

Many in the pews fanned themselves furiously, beating back a thick heat and their fragile emotions. People fought tears, rocking back and forth. Some comforted each other in long embraces. Ushers passed out bottles of cold water. And above them all loomed the pastor’s usual seat, empty, covered by a black cloth.

In Emanuel AME’s nearly 200-year-old history, the congregation has withstood slavery, segregation, racially motivated laws to keep worshipers from meeting and fires set by angry, white mobs. But the massacre Wednesday of state Sen. Clementa C. Pinckney, who was the church’s pastor, and eight church members left many wondering how such a horrible tragedy could occur in a place they consider a safe haven.

“It has been tough, it’s been rough, and some of us have been downright angry. But through it all, God has sustained us and encouraged us,” Goff said. “When times of trouble come into our lives, how do we respond? Do we respond by being afraid? Or do we respond in faith?”

Goff encouraged the congregation to continue to pray and look to God for healing.

“The blood of the Emanuel Nine requires us to work for not only justice in this case, but for those living on the margins of life,” he said. “We must stay on the battlefield until there is no more fight to be fought.”

Reporters, he said, had asked him how some grieving family members who attended the bond hearing of suspect Dylann Roof could say they would forgive him. Roof, who was arrested Thursday in Shelby, N.C., about four hours away from the church, was charged with nine counts of murder and possessing a firearm in the commission of a violent crime.

The families, Goff said, were holding on to a strong faith that teaches them to love their neighbors. “God is our refuge and our strength,” Goff said. “We ought to put our hope and trust in God.”

Daniel E. Martin Jr., 52, who said his family has been on the membership rolls of Emanuel for more than 100 years, said the church would heal and grow stronger. “It’s painful and difficult, but if you know anything about the people of faith, Charlestonians, members of the church, you will understand when we come to church we receive the word of God.”

His wife, Reba Martin, 54, a steward in the church, said when she walked in the church Sunday, she thought she saw Pinckney. “Pastor was so tall,” she said. “I can almost see him standing there with all the people who sat next to him in the pulpit.”

Instagram videos show a large crowd gathered in solidarity outside Mother Emanuel AME Church on the day of its first services since Wednesday's shooting. (Video: The Washington Post)

Reba Martin said the congregation full of people who had come to share in the service was an answer to Pinckney’s dream of getting more people to come to church: “When pastor first came, our congregation was so small, he would say, ‘One day you will see the church full to the rafters.’ That happened today.”

On Saturday, Charleston police gave church leaders permission to open the church. Church leaders met in the basement, which police had cleaned, covering bullet holes.

“I was pleased when authorities made a phone call and said you can go back in Mother Emanuel,” Goff said. “The open doors of Emanuel on this Sunday sends a message to every demon in hell that no weapon formed against me shall prosper.”

Many members said they looked forward to the church opening its doors. Others were still hesitant.

“How do you bring yourself to a place where tragedy struck?” said Brandon Robinson, 26, minister of music of “Little Emanuel,” a sister church. “There is an opened wound. Someone lost a brother, a husband, a father, a sister and auntie.”

Before sunrise Sunday, sextons — keepers of the church — began clearing a path amid hundreds of flower bouquets left on the church steps by mourners. Some lit white votive candles and prayed. Others threaded long-stemmed red and pink roses through the bars of the church’s gate.

Police officers swept the church early in the morning and screened worshipers as they filed in. No backpacks were allowed in the building. At least half a dozen officers stood watch, sometimes passing out water and butterscotch candies to churchgoers.

People, shaken by the tragedy, stood looking up at the church’s white steeple and prayed.

“You have individuals across the country asking, ‘How could God allow something like this to happen?’ ” said the Rev. Branden Sweeper, 30, who was close friends with Pinckney. “Church is still the best place to be.”

“Mother Emanuel,” as members call the church founded in 1816, is one of the oldest and largest AME churches in the South. The white stucco church with towering steeples, wooden rafters and arched stained-glass windows sits in downtown Charleston on Calhoun Street. The church was the site where in 1822, Denmark Vesey, a freed slave, planned one of the biggest slave insurrections in U.S. history.

“When authorities were made aware of his plot, Vesey and a number of his followers were executed,” according to the book “African Methodism in South Carolina,” a collection of histories compiled by the AME Church.

The church was burned down by white crowds. “And even more strict regulations were imposed on Charleston’s Black Churches,” the book said. By 1834, all black churches were closed by state law. Some members of the church joined white churches, and “others continued the tradition of the African church by worshiping underground.” In 1865, Emanuel AME resurfaced with 3,000 members.

With the latest tragedy still looming large in the church Sunday, some members doubled over in grief, weeping for the victims.

“There they were in the house of the Lord studying your word, praying with one another, but the Devil also entered,” an elder said in a prayer Sunday. “And the devil was trying to take charge. But thanks be to God — hallelujah — that the devil cannot take control over your people, and the devil cannot take control of the church.”

Eartha Ugude drove eight hours Saturday from Port St. Lucie, Fla., compelled to be in the service. “I felt such a tremendous loss,” she said from her seat, 10 rows from the pulpit. “I felt helpless and tired — one more tragedy against our people.”

The shooting, she said, was cowardly. The gunman “sat amongst them.”

Goff preached that the members should not respond to the tragedy with fear. “Do we respond by being afraid? Or do we respond in faith?” Goff asked. “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord, because it is by faith we are standing here this morning.”

Acknowledging the congregation has difficult days ahead, Goff said: “The only way evil can triumph is for good people to sit down and do nothing. We are children of God. We will march on to victory.”

The service ended with a prayer, “May the people of God say Amen.” Members who filed out of the church said they were encouraged by the sermon.

Marlene Coakley-Jenkins, whose sister Myra was killed in the church basement, said she was inspired.

“I think the message was powerful, positive and compassionate,” Coakley-Jenkins said on the church steps. “Everything the family needed at this particular time. It gave us strength and faith. It allowed us to have all the emotions that an experience like this might conjure and more.”

Someone asked her whether she was thinking of the shooter. “I pray at some point he finds God’s mercy,” she said. “God’s mercy is even there for him. We can’t afford to lose one soul on Earth. I am ready to forgive him. I have to because that would block so many blessings. Nothing grows positive out of hate.”"

Nikki Haley called Monday for removal of the Confederate battle flag from the statehouse grounds. It was the right thing to do and, to many of us, long overdue. Whatever arguments have been offered in the past for its prominent placement on government property, the massacre of nine people at Charleston's Emanuel AME Church nullified them. The pro-heritage argument can no longer hold.

I say this as a South Carolinian who joined others in 2000 in calling for the flag's removal from the capitol dome. I say this today as a human being who, along with millions of others, insists that removal of the flag is the least we can do to honor those killed.

To this end, Haley (R), surrounded by fellow leaders including Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, the first African American elected to the U.S. Senate from the South since Reconstruction, put the South Carolina General Assembly on notice that it will be called upon to remove the flag from where it was transferred 15 years ago. Today it lists upon a flagpole near a Confederate statue on the statehouse grounds but close to the city's more important intersection and more visible from the street. Removal of the flag requires a two-thirds vote of lawmakers.

The flag issue, which erupts every few years, has always been complicated. It is fair to respect the feelings of people whose forebears fought and died in the Civil War — and this was the argument for allowing it to wave. I myself had family who fought for the Confederacy, as well as other family members who fought for the Union. I have visited their graves deep in the woods of rural Illinois.

I have a rocking chair that my Southern great-great-somebody sat in, according to family lore, as she watched her soldier-husband, minus one leg, hobble across a field toward home. I love that chair for the person who loved her husband who loved his homeland, who fought bravely — and who definitely never owned a slave — and from whom I am descended. For so many poor Southerners — most soldiers weren’t planation owners — the war was about protecting their homes and families from invaders who came to conquer and burn. The reasons for that invasion were noble and no one would argue otherwise. Wars to liberate people from bondage don’t come any nobler. But the story of honoring one’s forebears with the flag is as true for many as is the story of hatred that the flag represents for so many others.

To me personally, the flag was offensive long before a mad-boy of evil heart gunned down nine lovely, innocent people as they included him in their prayers. As I wrote many years ago, I was just as afraid of a pickup truck with a Confederate flag in the window as any African American would be. This is because we all know that the occupants of that truck mean no good by showing that flag. It says: Danger.

The fact that the mere sight of the banner brings pain and humiliation to our African American neighbors is argument enough to bring it down. But last week’s brutal slayings nullified the pro-heritage argument. Forevermore, there’s no disputing its power as a symbol of racial hatred and the sickness of racism we all have a duty to fight with the same ferocity soldiers a century-and-a-half ago mustered to end slavery.

It’s no longer of matter of if but when the flag comes down and finds a home in a museum with other artifacts of historical significance. My hope is that it won’t take a demand from the NAACP but will occur by a consensus of the good people of South Carolina to do the right thing.

The United States and the world saw the coming together of whites and blacks in Charleston this past weekend and marveled that such a thing could happen in the Deep South where, indeed, the first shot of the Civil War was fired.

But the reason so many came together is because enlightened Southerners, black and white — especially in Charleston — have been working on racial understanding and reconciliation for decades. The unity we all observed doesn’t happen overnight but takes work and commitment — and love.

In the final analysis, love requires that the flag come down."

If the voucher isn’t worth what it takes to buy health insurance in the private marketplace, you’re out of luck. You’ve got to make up the difference. You’re on your own. So one independent, nonpartisan study found that under a similar plan, seniors would have to pay nearly $6,400 more for Medicare than they do today. Where are you going to get that from? Where are you going to get it from — $6,400?”

— President Obama, remarks in West Palm Beach, Fla., July 19, 2012

On a campaign trip to Florida last week, President Obama — no surprise! — brought up the subject of Medicare.

This is a highly emotional and difficult subject to understand. There's a reason why we suggested last year that readers would be best advised to mute the sound if any ad concerning Medicare aired — for either party.

Let’s look more deeply at the president’s remarks.

The Facts

The current Medicare system, in place since the mid-1960s, is essentially a government-run health-care program, with hospital and doctors' fees paid by the government, though beneficiaries also pay premiums for some services as well as deductibles and co-insurance.

Romney, following the lead of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), would convert Medicare to a “premium support” plan, in which private plans would compete with the government plan and the federal government would pay a predetermined contribution.

Obama derides this notion as a “voucher,” though the concept of “premium support” was originally developed by Democratic-leaning analysts (who have distanced themselves from the GOP version).

After sustained criticism of his plan last year by Democrats, Ryan worked closely with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to alter it for this year’s budget blueprint. Two key changes were: (1) Traditional Medicare is retained as an option (previously only people over 55 could stay in the traditional plan); and (2) Medicare spending after 2023 would be permitted to grow slightly faster than the nation’s economy (+0.5 percent), the same growth rate as Obama’s budget. (The old plan capped growth at the rate of inflation.)

The premium support payment would be based on the cost of the second least-expensive private plan or traditional Medicare, whichever is lower. Any difference in costs would need to be made up by the beneficiary. But, Ryan aides say, Medicare benefits of at least one plan would be covered by the premium-support payment. If costs rise above the spending cap, then Congress would be required to act, similar to the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) — much criticized by conservatives — that was created in Obama's health-care law.

(For readers interested in more information, Health Affairs has published an excellent — and neutral — article describing how this idea would work. For a critique, you can read this article. And here is support for the idea.)

Share this article Share

It is important to note that this is not exactly Romney's plan, though his Web site says ""Congressman Paul Ryan and Senator Ron Wyden introduced a bipartisan proposal that almost precisely mirrors Mitt's ideas."" So Ryan-Wyden is a fairly close substitute.

Advertisement

One would think that Obama, in referring to a ""similar plan,"" would be relying on estimates concerning the new version of Ryan's plan. But the figure of $6,400 actually comes from a year-old analysis of a Congressional Budget Office estimate of the different — and less generous — 2011 Ryan plan. The CBO analysis showed that over time, beneficiaries would have to pay a greater share of Medicare costs.

But the CBO did not do a similar analysis of the 2012 plan, saying simply that ""beneficiaries might face higher costs"" but that the CBO did ""not have the capability at this time to estimate such effects for the specified [Ryan-Wyden] path of Medicare spending."" It did show that Medicare spending would be lower than under current spending scenarios — which many experts say are unsustainable for the federal budget.

The Obama campaign justifies using the out-of-date figure because Romney had indicated support for the original Ryan plan during the GOP primaries and because not enough is known about how Romney's plan would work. But Romney also said: ""His plan is not the plan I'll put forward; I have my own plan.... I'll be putting that out before I debate President Obama.""

The Pinocchio Test

We are not going to take a position on the core philosophical dispute — whether ""you would be out of luck"" with one plan or other. (Republicans would argue the current system would leave folks out of luck.) We earlier failed to reach a verdict when faced with such starkly different claims about the Ryan plan and Obama's health-care law.

We simply repeat the warning we made before: Readers should remember when they hear gloom and doom predictions about either Obama’s health law or Republican alternatives for Medicare that no law is perfect, and adjustments are often made if problems emerge.

The policy differences on Medicare are substantial, but that still does not justify using out-of-date figures from last year’s plan — especially because the plan has been updated and made more generous to deal with some of the original criticisms made by Democrats.

The president should avoid claiming such specifics unless he can cite new data to make his case.

In the 6-to-3 decision, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. delivered a sympathetic affirmation of what has become known as Obamacare, and his legal reasoning seemed to insulate the 2010 law against the legion of opponents who want to undermine the program before it takes hold in American life.

From the White House Rose Garden, Obama declared: “The Affordable Care Act is here to stay.”

The decision for the second time defused a potential conflict between Obama and the Supreme Court over the sprawling government program that is likely to define the president’s domestic legacy. Although more challenges are to come, an adverse ruling in this case could have been a mortal blow to the program, which continues to divide the nation and roil political conversation.

Scenes of demonstrations outside the Supreme Court over Obamacare + 16 Protesters on both sides took to the court as the Affordable Care Act was deliberated on this spring.

The ruling came on a day when the court handed the administration a second significant victory, upholding a legal tool that civil rights groups say is vital in challenging discriminatory housing tactics.

In considering the health-care law, the justices were asked to interpret a passage that said the tax credits are authorized for those who buy insurance on marketplaces that are “established by the state.”

But federal exchanges were authorized for states that did not set up their own, and the Obama administration argued that millions of people served by a federal marketplace were entitled to the subsidies, too.

The court agreed that that was the only way the law would work and that, although the legislation’s wording was problematic, Congress’s intent was clear.

“Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them. If at all possible we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter,” Roberts wrote.

Advertisement

Joining the chief justice in the majority were Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Opposing the decision were Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.

Kennedy’s position in the majority was particularly significant. In 2012, he was one of four justices who would have found the entire law unconstitutional.

Scalia said Roberts, who wrote the decision in 2012 that saved the Affordable Care Act from that challenge, has performed “somersaults of statutory interpretation” to preserve the law.

“We should start calling this law SCOTUScare,” he said. The comment drew laughter as Scalia emphasized his disagreement with the decision by reading part of his dissent from the bench.

The two cases, Scalia said, “will publish forever the discouraging truth that the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites.”

The latest filings show that about 10.2 million people had signed up and paid their insurance premiums through the exchanges as of March, and 6.4 million were receiving subsidies to help afford coverage in the 34 states that had not set up their own marketplaces.

Those consumers stood to lose their subsidies, worth about $1.7 billion a month, if the justices had agreed with the challenge.

Customers in the jurisdictions with their own exchanges — 16 states, including Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia — were not at risk. But because of the delicate economics of the health-care law, the entire national program could have been in jeopardy if the court had struck down the contested subsidies.

Obama heralded the court ruling. “After nearly a century of talk, decades of trying, a year of bipartisan debate, we finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few but a right for all,” he told reporters as Vice President Biden stood by his side.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the administration should not “crow” about its victory.

“Today’s ruling won’t change Obamacare’s multitude of broken promises, including the one that resulted in millions of Americans losing the coverage they had and wanted to keep,” he said in a statement.

Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said Republicans should stop trying to kill the legislation that passed five years ago and move on to other matters. “Enough is enough,” he said.

Health-care stocks jumped immediately after the decision. The ruling was particularly good news for hospitals, which are likely to see fewer uninsured patients in emergency rooms.

Stock in HCA Holdings, which runs 165 hospitals nationwide, rose 9 percent after the ruling, while that of Universal Health Services, which has 226 hospitals including George Washington Hospital in the District, increased 7 percent.

The challenge to the health-care law was brought by the same conservative legal strategists who three years ago fell one vote short of convincing the court that the law was unconstitutional. The latest challenge was about how the law is to be carried out.

There seemed to be a different tone to Roberts’s opinion this time. In 2012, he distanced the court from the legislation, writing, “It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.”

But in Thursday’s opinion, the language was more sympathetic. The complicated program “grew out of a long history of failed health insurance reform,” Roberts noted. He added that it was designed “to ensure that anyone who wanted to buy health insurance could do so.”

He acknowledged the disjointed way the law was written. It ""contains more than a few examples of inartful drafting. . . . Congress wrote key parts of the act behind closed doors, rather than through the traditional legislative process,"" Roberts wrote.

Advertisement

But rather than simply focusing on the phrase “established by the state,” Roberts said the court had to look at the intent of the entire law.

""The statutory scheme compels us to reject petitioners' interpretation because it would

destabilize the individual insurance market in any state with a federal exchange, and likely create the very 'death spirals' that Congress designed the act to avoid,"" Roberts wrote.

He rejected the challengers’ argument that Congress intended to give the states an incentive to create their own exchanges.

To agree, Roberts said, would require rewriting the statute. “The states likely would have created their own exchanges in the absence of the IRS rule, which eliminated any incentive that the states had to do so.”

Some legal experts had thought the court might find the law ambiguous and thus simply uphold the Internal Revenue Service rule that said those who buy insurance on the federal exchange are entitled to the subsidies, in the form of tax credits, just as those who buy on a state exchange are. The court’s precedents call for deference to an agency when the law is unclear.

Advertisement

But crucially, Roberts said this was not a decision for an agency to make. He said the court needed to look at the law as a whole and concluded that even though the legislation’s language might be murky, its intent was clear.

“This is an even stronger ruling for the government than anticipated and means that a future president will not be able to reverse the interpretation through a different administrative interpretation,” said Heather Howard, a lecturer at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.

Scalia said the majority had exceeded its power and colorfully accused it of ""interpretive

jiggery-pokery.""

The decision “reflects the philosophy that judges should endure whatever interpretive distortions it takes in order to correct a supposed flaw in the statutory machinery,” he wrote. “We lack the prerogative to repair laws that do not work out in practice, just as the people lack the ability to throw us out of office if they dislike the solutions we concoct.”

Although Republicans generally denounced the ruling, some party leaders concluded that it at least relieved them from having to find an alternative.

Many of the 6.4 million Americans who receive subsidies through the federal marketplace are in conservative Southern states where Republicans are the strongest, according to a recent Urban Institute analysis. Many live in states such as Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas, where elected officials oppose the health-care law and have balked at setting up their own exchanges. Another big group lives in the Midwest, in states such as Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin.

Supporters of the law were worried when the court initially reached out to consider the challenge.

The case involved four plaintiffs from Virginia, which did not establish its own exchange. They said it was illegal for the IRS to say subsidies were available through the federal marketplace, which operated in the state.

A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit had ruled unanimously that, even though it was a close call, the IRS was within its authority to interpret the law to mean all Americans should receive the subsidies, because the statute authorized the federal health-care exchange to step in for states that did not establish their own.

In a separate case involving the same issue, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit had ruled 2 to 1 for different challengers. The full D.C. Circuit put that ruling aside to let all the court’s judges weigh in, and the argument had been scheduled.

But the challengers said the Supreme Court should decide the issue, because if they were correct, billions of dollars from the federal Treasury were being illegally spent."

The court’s action rewarded years of legal work by same-sex marriage advocates and marked the culmination of an unprecedented upheaval in public opinion and the nation’s jurisprudence.

Marriages began Friday in states that had previously thwarted the efforts of same-sex couples to wed, while some states continued to resist what they said was a judicial order that changed the traditional definition of marriage and sent the country into uncharted territory. As of the court’s decision Friday morning, there were 14 states where same-sex couples were not allowed to marry.

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who has written all of the court’s decisions recognizing and expanding gay rights, said the decision was based on the fundamental right to marry and the equality that must be afforded gay Americans.

“Under the Constitution, same-sex couples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as opposite-sex couples, and it would disparage their choices and diminish their personhood to deny them this right,” Kennedy wrote. He was joined in the ruling by the court’s liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.

All four of the court’s most conservative members — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. — dissented, and each wrote a separate opinion.

The common theme in their dissents was that judicial activism on the part of five members of the court had usurped a power that belongs to the people.

“If you are among the many Americans — of whatever sexual orientation — who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today’s decision,” wrote Roberts, who for the first time in his tenure marked his disagreement with a decision by reading part of his dissent from the bench.

“Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it,” he wrote.

Scalia called the decision a “threat to American democracy,” saying it robs citizens of “the freedom to govern themselves.”

In a statement in the White House Rose Garden, President Obama hailed the decision: ""This ruling is a victory for America. This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts. When all Americans are truly treated as equal, we are more free.""

Emotional scenes from same-sex weddings around the U.S. on Friday + 16 Couples all over the U.S. rushed to get married after the Supreme Court’s ruling.

It wasn’t until 2012 that Obama declared that same-sex couples should be able to marry, and it was only last year that he said he thought the Constitution provided such a right. But by Friday evening, the rainbow colors that gay rights activists have adopted were projected onto the north face of the White House. With the Supreme Court’s ruling, Obama said, “Today we can say in no uncertain terms that we have made our union a little more perfect.”

There were wild scenes of celebrations on the sidewalk outside the Supreme Court. Same-sex marriage supporters had arrived early, armed with signs and rainbow flags. They cheered at the announcement of a constitutional right for gay marriage, which did not legally exist anywhere in the world until the turn of this century. The first legally recognized same-sex marriages in the United States took place just 11 years ago, the result of a Massachusetts state supreme court decision.

Jim Obergefell, who became the face of the case, Obergefell v. Hodges, when he sought to put his name on his husband's Ohio death certificate as the surviving spouse, said, ""Today's ruling from the Supreme Court affirms what millions across the country already know to be true in our hearts: that our love is equal.""

“It is my hope that the term gay marriage will soon be a thing of the past, that from this day forward it will be, simply, marriage,” he said.

But Austin R. Nimocks, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a group that supports traditional marriage, said: “Today, five lawyers took away the voices of more than 300 million Americans to continue to debate the most important social institution in the history of the world. . . . Nobody has the right to say that a mom or a woman or a dad or a man is irrelevant. There are differences that should be celebrated.”

The Supreme Court used cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee, where restrictions against same-sex marriage were upheld by an appeals court last year, to find that the Constitution does not allow such prohibitions.

Kennedy over the past 20 years has written the Supreme Court’s most important gay rights cases: overturning criminal laws on homosexual conduct, protecting gays from discrimination and declaring that the federal government could not refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed where they were legal.

Share this article Share

He often employs a lofty, ­writing-for-history tone, and Friday’s decision was no different.

Referring to the couples who brought the cases before the court, Kennedy wrote: “It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions.”

Kennedy did not respond directly to the court’s dissenters, but he addressed the argument that the court was creating a constitutional right. The right to marriage is fundamental, he said. The difference is society’s evolving view of gay people and their rights, he said.

“The limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed natural and just, but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is now manifest,” he wrote. “With that knowledge must come the recognition that laws excluding same-sex couples from the marriage right impose stigma and injury of the kind prohibited by our basic charter.”

As in previous decisions, Kennedy did not spell out how courts should scrutinize laws that treated gays differently. But Mary Bonauto, who argued the case for gay plaintiffs at the Supreme Court, said that message from Kennedy’s combined opinions “is one of inclusion: Stop making rules for gay people.”

Scalia was a sharp critic of Kennedy’s style, saying it was “as pretentious as its content is egotistic.”

“The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie,” Scalia wrote.

Roberts wrote a lengthy dissent that was a point-by-point takedown of the majority opinion. Gay activists had wondered whether the 60-year-old justice might take note of the increasing public support for same-sex marriage and find a way to join the majority on what they called the “right side of history.”

But he and the other dissenters said the question was not whether same-sex marriage was a good idea, but who should decide.

“The court invalidates the marriage laws of more than half the states and orders the transformation of a social institution that has formed the basis of human society for millennia, for the Kalahari Bushmen and the Han Chinese, the Carthaginians and the Aztecs,” Roberts wrote. “Just who do we think we are?”

Roberts rejected a comparison to Loving v. Virginia, in which the court struck down bans on interracial marriage. That did not change the age-old definition of marriage as between a man and a woman, he said. He raised concerns that the decision could lead to polygamous marriages — he mentioned a married threesome of lesbians called a ""throuple.""

He noted that voters and legislators in only 11 states had authorized same-sex marriages, and said it was better for gay marriage to be adopted through the democratic process than by judicial order. He said religious leaders could take little comfort from the majority opinion that their beliefs would be respected.

That theme was picked up by Alito in his dissent. He said there could be “bitter and lasting wounds” from the decision and warned that the decision will be “exploited by those who are determined to stamp out every vestige of dissent.”

The questions raised in the cases decided Friday were left unanswered in 2013, when the justices last confronted the issue of same-sex marriage. A slim majority of the court said at the time that a key portion of the Defense of Marriage Act — withholding the federal government’s recognition of same-sex marriages — was unconstitutional. In a separate case that year, the court said procedural issues kept it from answering the constitutional question in a case from California but allowed same-sex marriages to resume in that state.

Since then, courts across the nation — with the notable exception of the Cincinnati-based federal appeals court that left intact the restrictions in the four states at issue — have struck down a string of state prohibitions on same-sex marriage, many of them passed by voters in referendums.

Last week, Walker’s campaign released a video, ""Recall the Recall,"" that recounts the governor’s fight with the unions with the tone and pacing of an action movie.

""He took big, bold action,"" the narrator says as black-and-white video footage plays, later turning to color. “The left erupted. They stormed the capital. But Scott Walker stood his ground, unintimidated. They even threatened his family, but he stood firm. And he won. The battle left the big-government, special interests crippled. But the real winners? Children, taxpayers, seniors.”

Walker continued that messaging in his announcement video and used it to contrast himself to the other Republicans who are running for president.

""In the Republican field, there are some who are good fighters, but they haven't won those battles. There are others who have won elections but haven't consistently taken on the big fights,"" Walker said. ""We showed you can do both.""

Later this week, Walker will visit five early primary voting states in six days – Nevada, South Carolina, Georgia, New Hampshire and then Iowa, where he will spend three days crisscrossing the state in a Winnebago. The whirlwind trip includes visits to at least four stores that sell Harley-Davidson motorcycles, a Wisconsin-based company that Walker likes to plug.

Walker’s aides say they are determined to win Iowa. Walker was the first major potential candidate to lease office space there, and he has hired strategists who advised Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) during her high-profile win last year. Walker has visited Iowa at least half a dozen times so far this year, talking about his Midwestern roots and often out-spending other candidates. At the Iowa GOP Lincoln Dinner in May, Walker threw a glitzy post-party, complete with a DJ, huge chunks of Wisconsin cheese, a photo booth with a Harley and posters featuring quotes from Walker. The campaign also aims to finish well, like in the top three, in New Hampshire and South Carolina, where Walker has spent much less time.

Soon after Walker's video went public, the attacks began. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who fought Walker's dramatic labor reforms, put out a six-word statement: ""Scott Walker is a national disgrace.""

The Democratic Party tweeted out a quick video clip of Walker saying the only way he would be a viable presidential candidate is if things were going well in Wisconsin:

Pro-immigration and abortion rights activists also criticized Walker as too conservative. “Scott Walker has proven himself to be a terrible governor of Wisconsin, and a Walker presidency would be even worse for Latinos and for our nation as a whole,"" labor and civil rights activist Dolores Huerta said in a statement.

Erika West, the political director at NARAL Pro-Choice America, said Walker ""threw Wisconsin women under the bus to score points with a few right-wing voters in Iowa"" by supporting a ban on abortions after 20 weeks.

Although Walker has spent nearly his entire adult life in politics, he casts himself as an average guy who is in touch with working and middle-class families. He routinely slams D.C. as being “68 square miles surrounded by reality.” And in a race that already involves two wealthy candidates from well-known political families – Hillary Rodham Clinton and Jeb Bush – Walker often talks about growing up without much money in a small town and says his family still lives modestly, packing brown-bag lunches and using coupons at Kohl’s department store.

“Unlike some out there, I didn’t inherit fame or fortune from my family,” Walker said in a speech in Nashville earlier this year, a line that he often repeats. “I got a bunch of things that were a whole lot better than that. I got from my parents and my grandparents the belief that if you work hard and you play by the rules and you’re in America you can do and be anything that you want. That’s a powerful belief.”

Scott Kevin Walker was born in Nov. 2, 1967, in Colorado Springs. At a young age, his family moved to Plainfield, a small town in northeast Iowa where his father, Llew Walker, was a Baptist pastor and his mother, Pat Walker, did bookkeeping work. At one point, Walker and his younger brother, David, realized that the local city hall didn’t have a state flag, so they washed out a mayonnaise jar and walked around town collecting donations for one.

In 1977, the family moved to Delavan, Wis., where Walker attended high school, participated in Boys State and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. Old photos show Walker sported a mullet hairstyle. He often talks about saving up money to pay for college by washing dishes at a Countryside restaurant and then flipping burgers at a McDonald's – at about the same time that Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was working at a McDonald's in Janesville, about 15 miles down the road.

""The only difference is his manager told him he had to work the back flipping hamburgers because he didn't have the interpersonal skills to work the front cash register,"" Walker likes to tell audiences, always prompting laughter.

The two Wisconsin Republicans are close, although Ryan is staying neutral in the primary. Mitt Romney named Ryan as his running mate during the last presidential election, and a tear slid down Walker's cheek when Ryan spoke at the Republican National Convention.

""Paul is one of the smartest and most courageous people I know in politics. He is also one of the most decent,"" Walker wrote in his 2013 book, ""Unintimidated."" ""I was overwhelmed with pride.""

In 1986, Walker enrolled at Marquette University, a Jesuit Catholic private school in Milwaukee. Walker was known for wearing suits to class and being obsessed with Ronald Reagan. Even then, Walker was involved in politics and talked about running for president. One former classmate recalls calling Walker ""Niedermeyer"" after the power-hungry character on the movie ""Animal House."" In 1990, Walker mysteriously left college without graduating. He was at least 34 credits short, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Walker took a job at the local American Red Cross and soon was running for the state house, a race that he lost. He has said that he had eventually wanted to finish up his degree, but got caught up with work and family.

In 1992, Walker met his future wife, Tonette Tarantino, a young widow and Catholic Democrat who grew up on the east side of Milwaukee and is a dozen years older than him. Months after meeting, Walker proposed and the two married in February 1993 on Reagan's birthday. Four months later, Walker was elected to the state assembly, where he championed tough-on-crime reforms and several anti-abortion bills. He was re-elected four times. The couple has two sons, Matt and Alex, who are taking time off from college to help with their dad's campaign.

In 2002, the Democratic Milwaukee County Executive resigned amid scandal and Walker ran in a special election to replace him. Soon after winning, Walker quickly began plotting a run for governor. His time as county executive become the subject of a secrecy-shrouded investigation that examined political work Walker's staff members did on county time, using a secret wireless router to avoid detection. That led to the conviction of six former aides and associates, including Walker's deputy chief of staff who is currently serving a jail sentence through house arrest. Later, prosecutors launched a second investigation probing accusations of improper coordination between Walker's recall election campaign and outside groups like the Wisconsin Club for Growth.

Walker has called these investigations a politically driven ""witch hunt."" He has never been charged in connection with them.

E-mails and court documents released as part of those investigations provided a rare look at how the politician operates. Walker -- who goes by ""SKW"" in emails -- is often humorless and to-the-point, a constant strategist who is obsessed with media coverage. A long-time associate says Walker has a rare gift of carefully tracking what he's hearing on the ground and then subtly shifting his messaging to better connect, although rivals have painted this as flip-flopping. While most presidential contenders decline to publicly discuss the details of their political strategy, Walker's voice picks up with excitement as he talks about the strong push he wants to make in neighboring Iowa and how he likely won't spend much in Florida, allowing Floridians Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio to blow through cash fighting each other. Wisconsin Senate President Mary Lazich, a Republican who is also from the Milwaukee suburbs, carpooled with Walker for years and doesn't remember ever discussing anything other than political strategy -- how to rally votes for legislation and what can be learned from previous races.

""He's a political animal,"" Lazich said in an interview. ""I think he was born that way.""

In 2006, Walker tried to run for governor but dropped out. He tried again in 2010 and was elected as part of a wave of Republican wins that year. Weeks after taking office in January 2011, Walker launched the attack on public-sector unions that would come to define him on the national stage. Walker had been frustrated with collective bargaining since his days as county executive, when he says that he was forced to lay off young workers because of seniority rules. He figured that the state could save millions of dollars by no longer bargaining with state employees on pay, lay-offs and benefits. These were entitlements the state could not afford, he said.

""We can no longer live in a society where the public employees are the haves and the taxpayers who foot the bill are the have-nots,"" Walker said in a speech in December 2010. ""Public employees can't be the untouchables.""

The backlash was swift and angry, with as many as 100,000 protesters descending on Madison. Republican lawmakers who dominate both chambers rushed to push the legislation through the statehouse, often using complicated maneuvers. At one point, Democrats fled the state to avoid a vote. Eventually, the changes -- referred to as ""Act 10"" -- passed. Union membership in the state plummeted, providing less dues and less resources to support Democratic lawmakers.

While visiting early-voting states, Walker always talks about these protests, which he says were the precursor to the Occupy Wall Street movement. Walker says that he and his family, along with other Republicans, faced harassment and death threats. Walker describes the scene as a war zone in his book, and he had to sneak out of the statehouse through tunnels and use decoy buses to fool protestors who might hurt him: ""It was like a scene out of 'Call of Duty.'""

Activists then pushed for recall elections for Walker and other Republicans. These races attracted millions of dollars in donations from wealthy Republicans across the country who might typically not get involved in Wisconsin races but sympathized with Walker. The governor won the recall election and then was re-elected last year -- meaning that he has won three elections in four years in a state that for decades has voted for a Democrat for president.

Soon after winning in November, Walker has said that he and his family began discussing a possible run for president. In January, Walker started a political organization, Our American Revival, which has been funding his months of travel around the country. Walker's expected campaign manager is Rick Wiley, a longtime political operative and former RNC political director who has deep ties to Wisconsin. Wiley has a forceful presence -- a hulking, fitness-crazed Cubs fan with a shaved head and tiny chin-beard who is a prolific tweeter and frequent user of the word ""bro."" Unlike other campaign managers, Wiley frequently joins Walker on the road.

In April, two of Walker's former aides started a pro-Walker super PAC that can collect unlimited donations. It is called the Unintimidated PAC, borrowing the name from Walker's 2013 book. The PAC is run by Keith Gilkes, the strategist who played top roles in Walker's three gubernatorial races. His deputy is Stephan Thompson, who managed Walker’s 2014 campaign and was deputy manager of his 2010 bid.

Those two groups, along with another called ""Friends of Scott Walker,"" have raised at least $20 million and hope to have at least $40 million by next year, according to aides. That's far less than Bush and Clinton have collected, but supporters of the governor remain confident that it will be enough to get his message out. Plus, Walker has said in interviews that Bush will likely burn through at least half of his money trying to win the Florida primary over Rubio.

One of Walker's first challenges is upping his name recognition, and he has been doing dozens of interviews with small market television stations and newspapers in key early-voting states. He also has struggled to speak about foreign policy with gravitas, prompting cram sessions with advisors and four foreign trips in five months. And while Walker has fought and defeated Democrats, this presidential primary will require him to spar with fellow Republicans -- and his usual tactic of writing off attacks as partisan or driven by a liberal media may no longer work. The past few months have been further complicated by problems at home, including a tight budget and Republican disagreement over how to pay for major transportation projects and a new professional basketball stadium.

Even though he's one of the last major candidates to get into the race, Walker has been passively attacking his rivals for months. Walker argues that while Republicans are ""blessed"" to have such a robust field, the candidates fall into two camps: U.S. senators who have challenged the Obama administration but have ""yet to win any of those serious battles,"" and governors and former governors who are good at winning elections but have yet to ""consistently take on those big fights.""

Walker pitches himself as the perfect blend of both. He also says enduring three polarizing elections in four years has fully vetted him and taught him how to stay on message."

On Friday, federal officials said they were investigating the shootings Thursday in Chattanooga as a possible terrorist attack but were a long way from drawing conclusions. They said the gunman, 24-year-old Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez, had not previously drawn the attention of authorities, save for a drunken-driving charge a few months ago.

On Saturday, the Navy said a male petty officer died at 2:17 a.m. of wounds received in Thursday’s shooting — bringing the number killed in the rampage to five. The sailor’s name had not been released.

Abdulazeez’s travels to the Middle East, his acquisition of several firearms and his recent online musings about the meaning of Islam were coming under fresh examination as hundreds of federal agents sought to reconstruct his movements and mind-set.

“At this time, we have no indication he was inspired by or directed by anyone other than himself,” Edward Reinhold, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s office in Knoxville, Tenn., told reporters Friday.

U.S. officials said that devices including a computer and cellphone believed to have belonged to Abdulazeez were being examined by FBI technicians in a laboratory at Quantico, Va.

The FBI said that Abdulazeez was armed with at least two rifles or shotguns, as well as a handgun, when he opened fire on a military recruiting center and a Navy Reserve facility in Chattanooga. Authorities did not give a more detailed description of the firearms or say how he obtained them.

“Some of the weapons were purchased legally and some of them may not have been,” Reinhold said.

U.S. counterterrorism officials have become increasingly worried about the ability of the Islamic State and al-Qaeda offshoots to attract and radicalize followers in the United States. At the same time, authorities have expressed concern that their ability to detect such contact has been eroded by the spread of encrypted communication.

View Graphic Here are the stories of those who died in Chattanooga

Federal authorities have arrested more than 10 people over the past six weeks who are suspected of having ties to the Islamic State. U.S. officials said the crackdown was part of an effort to suppress a surge in suspected plots aimed at unleashing violence on U.S. targets during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ended the day of the attacks in Chattanooga.

But officials have also said that homegrown radicals have gotten better at hiding their intentions and cloaking their contacts with overseas groups, despite a massive expansion in U.S. surveillance capabilities since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Two U.S. law enforcement officials said Abdulazeez traveled to Jordan on four occasions prior to the shootings. The last trip he took was from April 2014 to November 2014. One of the officials said there was no information the trips were connected to attempts to enter Syria or establish contacts with a terrorist group.

Jordan has been a way station for foreign fighters attempting to enter Syria, including a 22-year-old U.S. citizen who similarly went undetected during trips to Jordan before carrying out a suicide attack in Syria last year.

But Jordan is also a popular tourist destination, one of several nations bordering Syria that account for more than 2 million travelers who arrive in the United States each year.

Moreover, Abdulazeez had a grandmother and other relatives in the country, according to neighbors and court papers.

And while his father, Youssuf Abdulazeez, was investigated by the FBI in 1994 and again in 2002 for donating to Palestinian groups suspected of having ties to terrorism, U.S. officials said the father was removed from a terrorism watch list a decade ago.

Based on the limited information available so far, the younger Abdulazeez appears to have repeatedly brushed up against U.S. screening systems without triggering an alert, said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

“You have to do something that would set off some type of alarm,” Nunes said in an interview. Because of the mounting odds against disrupting plots, as well as the countermeasures being taken by terrorist groups, Nunes said that stopping attacks is “becoming tougher and tougher.”

Nunes said the FBI has warned lawmakers repeatedly in recent months that the bureau was facing a surge in the number of threats it is tracking — many based on intelligence gleaned overseas — but has been unable to connect those tips to individuals or specific targets in the United States.

“The FBI has warned us that there are a bunch of threats that they know about but can’t find,” Nunes said. “They have enough specifics to say something is being planned. We know [the Islamic State] is talking to someone but we can’t find the person.”

U.S. counterterrorism officials emphasized Friday that they have no evidence so far that the attack by Abdulazeez fell into that troubling security gap.

Four Marines were killed in Thursday’s attack: Gunnery Sgt. Thomas J. Sullivan of Hampden, Mass.; Staff Sgt. David A. Wyatt of Burke, N.C.; Sgt. Carson A. Holmquist of Polk, Wis.; and Lance Cpl. Squire K. Wells of Cobb, Ga.

An unidentified Navy petty officer and a Chattanooga police officer were wounded. Abdulazeez was killed after exchanging gunfire with police.

While the FBI was cautious in making judgments, other lawmakers said there was clear reason to suspect that Abdulazeez had been inspired, directly or indirectly, by the Islamic State or a similar group.

""Based on my experience, I think he was radicalized by these individuals in Syria,"" Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told reporters. ""The threat is real and it comes from the Internet,"" he added. ""They don't have to travel to Iraq and Syria. . . . They're already here.""

Abdulazeez could trace his heritage to several parts of the Middle East — he was born in Kuwait as a Jordanian citizen, although his parents identified themselves as Palestinians. He came to the United States with his family while very young and grew up in Chattanooga, attending a local high school and earning a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.

In addition to his visit to Jordan last year, he traveled there on at least one prior occasion, during a combined trip to Kuwait in 2010, according to the official Kuwait News Agency.

A high school friend, Levon Miller, added that Abdulazeez traveled abroad once every few years. “He’d take off for a month or two mostly during his college breaks,” Miller said, although he said he didn’t know details about where he went.

Other signs emerged Friday that Abdulazeez and his four sisters had grown up in a troubled household, afflicted by marital strife and debt.

His father filed for federal bankruptcy protection in 2002. Seven years later, his mother filed for divorce, charging that her husband had sexually and physically abused her, and had threatened to take a second wife. The couple later reconciled.

Three months ago, Abdulazeez was hired as a shift supervisor by Superior Essex, a firm that manufactures specialty wiring and cables. Co-workers said he called in sick last weekend and hadn’t been seen since."

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/10/fbi-chief-roof-gun-shooting/29966337/",0,"Dylann Roof, who is accused of killing nine people at a church in South Carolina three weeks ago, was able to purchase the gun used in the attack only because of lapses in the FBI’s background-check system, FBI Director James B. Comey said Friday. Comey said Roof should have been prevented from buying the .45-caliber weapon used in the shooting, which authorities have said was motivated by Roof's racist views. The political repercussions of the June 17 massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston led South Carolina to remove the Confederate flag from its statehouse grounds Friday.

“This case rips all of our hearts out,” Comey said. “But the thought that an error on our part is connected to this guy’s purchase of a gun that he used to slaughter these good people is very painful to us.”

The breakdown was a result of errors not only by the FBI but also apparently by local law enforcement, and Comey said he has ordered a 30-day review to examine the procedures that led to the failure and to see if the process can be tightened. The errors came to light as investigators examined a gun purchase Roof made two months before the shooting.

Roof had been arrested for possession of narcotics in February, a charge that alone did not disqualify him from buying a gun. But Comey said Roof’s subsequent admission of the drug crime would have triggered an automatic rejection of his gun purchase if the information had been properly recorded in criminal-record and background-check databases.

Instead, Comey said, the data was not properly entered in databases of criminal records that are submitted by state, local and federal law enforcement agencies, and in records kept by the bureau. As a result, an FBI examiner assigned to review Roof's purchase never saw his admission to the narcotics charge. The examiner runs checks under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which relies on these databases and the bureau's own records.

Comey's disclosure to reporters who were summoned to the bureau's headquarters Friday amounted to a heartbreaking admission by the FBI director that the attack on a Bible study group might have been averted.

The failure to block Roof’s gun purchase is likely to renew scrutiny of a federal background-check system that also allowed troubled individuals to acquire firearms before previous shootings.

On Capitol Hill, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) promptly sought to head off any effort to tighten gun-control laws. “It’s disastrous that this bureaucratic mistake prevented existing laws from working and blocking an illegal gun sale,” he said in a statement. “The facts undercut attempts to use the tragedy to enact unnecessary gun laws. The American people, and especially the victims’ families, deserve better.”

The Center for American Progress, meanwhile, used the case to call for tightening the law on background checks. “Like the Virginia Tech massacre, the Columbine massacre, and countless every day shootings, gaps in our gun background check system contributed to the Charleston attack,” said a statement from Arkadi Gerney, senior vice president at the center. “The answer is simple: all records of prohibited individuals need to go in the FBI system and every gun sale needs to go through a background check.”

Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was seriously wounded in a gun attack in 2011, and her husband, Mark Kelly, said they were “deeply troubled to learn details of the failures” and called for a full investigation.

Comey said Roof’s transaction began when he went to a gun store in West Columbia, S.C., on April 11. The dealer submitted his biographical information to the NICS, which handles background checks for gun purchases in about 30 states, including South Carolina.

Here’s a look at the alleged gunman's background, including recent arrests, and what authorities say happened inside the church. (Video: Alice Li/The Washington Post)

Under the law, the FBI has three business days to deny or approve a purchase. If a decision is not made in that time frame, the law permits the dealer to complete the sale.

On April 13, a veteran FBI examiner who routinely handled 15 or more cases a day pulled up Roof's request. Checking his criminal record, she saw a record of the narcotics arrest, which erroneously listed the arresting agency as the Lexington County Sheriff's Department. She faxed a request for information to the sheriff's office and to the county prosecutor. But officials at the sheriff's office told her they were not handling the case and referred her to the Columbia Police Department.

Share this article Share

The fact that the Columbia police handled the arrest — not the sheriff’s department — was not reported in the NCIC, which relies on the agency in question to submit information.

“It’s not clear why that happened,” Comey said of the error, “but it made a big difference.”

The sheriff’s department, which unlike the Columbia Police Department has a jail, booked Roof, and that might have led to the confusion.

Had the examiner been able to see the Columbia police report that Roof admitted to possession of a drug, or had the county prosecutor gotten back to her and told her of the report’s existence, “that transaction would have been denied,” Comey said. The prosecutor’s office never replied to her query.

The examiner’s effort was further tripped up by a geographic irregularity that the FBI did not reflect in its system.

Only a small part of the city of Columbia is located in Lexington County, with most in neighboring Richland County. The FBI’s system did not account for that jurisdictional split, and the examiner contacted only the West Columbia Police Department, which reported no record of Roof’s arrest.

On April 16, after the mandatory three-day waiting period lapsed with no adverse ruling from the FBI, Roof got his gun — a .45-caliber Glock pistol. There is no requirement for a dealer to notify the bureau when it has sold a gun, bureau officials said.

“There were a combination of things; one could say highly improbable events came together in this circumstance,” Comey said. “But the one we are definitely accountable for is not having reflected the geography of South Carolina on our contact sheet.”

Comey said he had spoken to the examiner and described her as “heartbroken,” but he said she had followed proper procedures.

FBI agents in South Carolina met Friday with the families of the victims to explain what happened, he said.

This report has been updated to correct the kind of drug charge Roof was facing in South Carolina. It was a misdemeanor not a felony charge."

And it's not just because he's a businessman and untested politician who happens to be in the lead. It's also because he's, well, Donald Trump. His rhetorical devices, use of hyperbole, looseness with the facts and bravado simply cannot be compared to any recent presidential hopefuls.

The Fix checked in this week with several debate coaches, political communication experts and rhetoric experts to see what they would advise for Trump -- oh, and the other nine men on stage tonight who have to face him.

Their responses have been edited for length and clarity.

The 2 big questions

1. How would you describe Trump's style?

BIRDSELL: Trump betrays very little sense of a thought process behind what he does and says. I don’t mean that in the sense that he’s not a smart man. But you see a lot of what we call ""flat assertions,"" and when he does refer to evidence, it’s often information that almost no one else is able to replicate.

KIMEL: I personally think that leaving politics aside and approaching Trump from a purely oratorical standpoint, he's a magnetic television personality and a hugely entertaining speaker who is much more fun to watch than the other candidates. Because he speaks his mind unabashedly, is willing to take controversial and offensive stances on the strength of his convictions, and doesn't care about being rude, he gives the impression of being an honest speaker. [All of that] is a welcome relief in a world full of talking points.

Advertisement

MINOR: I would characterize Trump's style as dominating -- dominating with soundbites. Now, he doesn’t do that with facts or intricate arguments, but with soundbites and aggression. I think a lot of traditionalists would say what we do know points to a very risky, maybe very colorful style on the debate stage. Right now with Trump a lot of his comments appear to be not vetted, not linked to traditional data and information sources that most candidates tend to rely upon. That is something that seems to appeal to some voters.

Share this article Share

So, I would be surprised to see him abandon that completely. Then again, he could soften things just to throw his competitors off.

VOTH: Trump is a bi-product of an uncivil society. Although, I should be clear and also say: This is not new. We used to shoot each other with pistols at dawn; that was a normal thing to do to resolve a dispute. Now that would be considered insane. But his style -- it’s very extemporaneous and candid and, at many moments, it’s coarse.

It's fairly deliberately abrasive and trying to cause some sparks to fly, and I think connecting to a deep cycle of populism the American public has cyclically been drawn into.

Ahead of Thursday's Republican presidential primary debate, campaign strategists and journalists in Cleveland discussed Donald Trump's appeal to voters and why he should be taken seriously as a candidate. (Video: Meena Ganesan/Washington Post Live, Photo: Scott Shaw/Washington Post Live)

2. How should other candidates handle The Donald?

BIRDSELL: The rules of this debate are such that if you mention someone by name, that person is given 30 seconds to respond. So, tactically, it makes no sense -- no sense at all -- to attack Trump directly. In terms of Trump's weaknesses, he can probably be pressed on policy specifics in ways that show him off to less-than-optimal effect.

For example, he's very likely to say something to the effect of, 'What we need is legal immigration, legal immigration, legal immigration.' You can’t go too deep, but in 60 seconds you are probably going to need more than two words. So the candidates need to master the indirect hit. That's things like, 'We can't have a politics where we condemn million of people by association.' Or, 'No one on this stage should feel comfortable unless he can give you a detailed approach to crafting 4 percent GDP growth. I'll tell you what I am going to do: 1,2,3. And anyone who tells you we simply have to make America great is not being honest with you.'

KIMEL: [Trump's] main drawback as a political orator -- beyond the obvious fact that he often puts his foot in his mouth -- is that while he's great at agitating others and criticizing policies, he's not the most inspiring speaker. His vanity is his Achilles' heel. If another candidate can make fun of him or stir up topics that might potentially fluster him, he could easily slip into seeming sloppy or petty on camera rather than presidential.

But making fun of someone takes wit, and challenging them takes courage, and contemporary political oratory traditionally rewards neither quick-thinking nor spontaneity, so who knows how the debate will turn out. But the danger is that when the other candidates try to do this, they will falter at it and simply turn the entire debate into a circus.

MINOR: To contend with Trump, they have to be dominant as well and truly prepared to think in terms of soundbites. I would have them review every single world he has said publicly in the six months leading up to the debate and then fact-check it. The only way that you are going to take control is to bring some facts, some type of truth to the discussion and with that some kind of moral authority and display of fitness for the job.

I suspect we are going to hear him talk over others, bleed into their time. I am going to look for a little bit of bark -- maybe even a little bit of bite -- from the other candidates, probably with a professional edge. But I would caution, if you are ready to put up your dukes with Donald Trump, be prepared to sustain that charge.

VOTH: Trump has some advantages in being the no-holds-barred speaker and will possibly score what I call some ""public resentment"" points. We're talking about the viewer who will hear his unconventional way of talking about policy and think, 'Yeah, yeah. That’s what I would have said.' Next to Trump, someone like Rubio, a more traditional candidate and senator, is going to be more boxed in.

Of course, all of these people must know that they need to step up and try to stand out and outshine Trump, because he has become this runaway sensation in the polls. So, other candidates would be wise to identify their biggest difference or disagreement with Trump and play that up. The challenge is that they are actually going to have emulate his straight-shooter style a bit while also looking presidential."

There’s where Hillary Rodham Clinton was strolling on Saturday, shaking hands and posing for selfies with sweaty supporters under an unforgiving sun, when the whirring sound of helicopter blades approached, then grew louder, then louder still.

“Look up in the sky!” Greta Tarbell, 63, cried out. “There’s Trump! He’s got his own helicopter. Have at it, baby!”

The black chopper with bold white letters spelling T-R-U-M-P circled the fairgrounds once. Then twice. Then a third time.

The Donald had arrived. And with that, the forces that are making the 2016 presidential contest so extraordinary collided theatrically at the legendary Iowa State Fair.

Donald Trump, the billionaire reality television star whose shamelessness and braggadocio is disrupting the Republican primary, was out of his element here but undoubtedly in command.

He stepped out of his helicopter like a Palm Beach mogul, sporting a navy blazer and breezy cream slacks, a red cap with his “Make America Great Again” slogan, French cuffs and buffed white dress shoes, which would be challenged moments later when the Trump entourage walked through a pile of horse dung.

A political Willy Wonka, Trump offered rides in his helicopter, which landed at a nearby baseball field, to randomly selected handfuls of Iowa children. “Come here,” he said to the kids. “Does anyone want to take a ride? It’s nice, right? . . . Who wants to go first?”

""You know we don't do subtle,"" Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, acknowledged.

This, apparently, is how America chooses its presidents.

At the fairgrounds, there was no collision between the Democratic and Republican front-runners. Still, the chaos and spectacle Clinton and Trump each created during their visits Saturday crystallized the dynamics of the race.

First was Clinton. A dynasty candidate criticized for being aloof, she tried to ingratiate herself with everyday Iowans. She had as her guide Tom Harkin, the state's legendary populist senator who retired earlier this year and gave Clinton his endorsement on Friday. Harkin, wearing his signature straw hat, showed her the way.

The former secretary of state stood at the fence of a dirty paddock to meet a shorthorn cow named Maggie. (She paid no attention to the shiny black Rolls-Royce parked a few yards away.) She expressed amazement at a Monopoly-themed butter statue. She bit into a greasy pork chop and sipped from a jumbo cup of fresh-squeezed lemonade.

“I love your blue outfit!” Clinton gushed to one stranger.

""This is like being back at the New York State Fair, surrounded by friends,"" she told another.

Walking through the Agriculture Building — past showcases of the thickest carrots, roundest beets and biggest heads of iceberg lettuce — Clinton made her way to the famed butter cow. She smiled and waved, waved and smiled.

“I’m so excited,” said Kate Reed, 48, an accountant. “This was my whole goal today, to get to see her. But oh, my God. This is insane.”

From start to finish, Clinton was surrounded by a swarm of Secret Service agents, campaign staffers and reporters shouting questions such as, ""What about your e-mail servers?"" and ""Have you had any conversations with Biden?"" (The vice president has been weighing whether to challenge her in the Democratic primary.)

The everyday Iowans Clinton had come here to meet and win over risked physical danger getting close to her. The candidate was engulfed by a mob of media and photo-snapping supporters, everyone hot and sticky, tripping over each other.

""Is that her behind the bald guy?"" one woman asked. ""I've seen blond hair pop up a couple of times.""

Louis Picone, 44, got close enough. Then he taunted everyone else. ""I shook Hillary's hand,"" he called out. ""Only $2 to shake my hand!""

And that was before Trump showed up.

An even larger horde surrounded the celebrity businessman as he inched down the main concourse of the fair, past picnic areas and stands hawking such heart-healthy delicacies as deep-fried nacho balls, bacon-wrapped smokies on a stick and deep-fried Twinkies.

“I have a crowd 10 times what Hillary had,” Trump boasted, though his estimate was definitely inflated. Earlier, reminding reporters he topped the latest polls here, Trump declared: “I love Iowa, great place. I’ve really developed a relationship with it.”

""Hey, Donald, you're my favorite man!"" shouted a boy, who stood on top of a golf cart to see the candidate in the red cap walk by.

The scene was mayhem. Trump's private security agents tried to enforce a buffer around him. When a camera crew dropped a boom microphone overhead, an agent said, ""Gotta keep the mics away from his head.""

Fans reached out their arms toward Trump. They stood on their tiptoes to snap pictures of the man they recognized from television. They screamed his name and cheered him on. “Give me a selfie!” yelled one fan. “Save our country!” screamed another.

After one woman shook Trump's hand, her friend gleefully asked, ""Was his hand soft?"" She said it was.

Al Linquist, 63, called his wife from the middle of the scrum: ""I just shook hands with Trump. Honest to God. Scouts' oath. I got my hand in there and told him, 'Keep it up!'""

But not everyone gawking at Trump was so encouraging of his campaign.

One woman stood on a park bench and shouted, ""Donald, we love you! Woooo!"" But when a reporter asked if she really loved him, she shook her head sheepishly and said, ""No, do you?""

Faith Lain, 37, was absolutely giddy after meeting Trump, but he doesn’t have her vote.

“He’s a spectacle and he’s ridiculous,” she said. “That’s why I wanted to shake his hand. . . . The state fair is about doing ridiculous things. And there’s nothing more ridiculous than Donald Trump being president.”

When Trump got to the pork chop stand, where Clinton had been only an hour earlier, an aide handed him a box of chops on sticks. He picked up one, took a big bite out of it and held it up for the cameras. “This is the real deal, right?” Trump said. After one bite, however, he put the chop back in the box. He didn’t eat anything else.

Trump, who earlier in the day had singled out former Florida governor Jeb Bush for criticism, called out to the crowd that had gathered: ""Who do you support? Trump or Bush?""

""Trump!"" the crowd yelled back. The candidate mugged for the cameras and held up two fingers in a victory sign.

Both Trump and Clinton opted out of appearing at the Des Moines Register Soapbox, a state fair rite of passage for presidential aspirants, who each get 20 minutes to address fairgoers — and often get mercilessly heckled. Trump said he skipped the soapbox because of his feud with the Register. The newspaper, he said Saturday, was ""not relevant.""

Some of Clinton’s supporters criticized her decision to avoid taking questions from fairgoers at the soapbox, although she did answer a few questions from reporters at a morning news conference.

""She should go to the soapbox, absolutely,"" said Nancy Thise, 47, a Clinton supporter. ""She should get it over with. She should face her fears and her critics. People love her for the right reasons and her campaign people are not doing her any justice by protecting her.""

Shortly after Clinton and Trump were ferried off the fairgrounds — Clinton by armored Chevrolet Suburban, Trump by golf cart — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is waging a populist challenge to Clinton for the Democratic nomination, stepped onto the soapbox.

As Sanders’s commanding voice boomed from the tiny stage, hundreds of people — perhaps 1,000 or more — stopped in their tracks to listen, making the main concourse of the fair nearly impossible to pass for the roughly 15 minutes he spent speaking.

Sanders delivered his talking points about leading a “political revolution” to take on “the billionaire class.” And then, up in the sky, he spotted Trump’s helicopter hovering, soon to leave town.

“I apologize,” Sanders told the crowd. “We left the helicopter at home.”"

http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/20/politics/jimmy-carter-cancer-update/index.html",0,"Former president Jimmy Carter said that the cancer doctors discovered earlier this year on his liver has also been found on his brain. Carter, 90, said he will receive his first radiation treatment for the disease Thursday afternoon. ""I'm perfectly at ease with whatever comes,"" Carter said at a news conference. Carter said Thursday that doctors found ""four spots of melanoma on my brain -- small spots"" after first discovering cancer during an Aug. 3 operation to remove a tumor from his liver. During that surgery, Carter said, doctors suspected that the cancer had originated in another part of his body. They later discovered the melanoma spots, about ""two millimeters"" in size, on his brain.

Doctors removed about one-tenth of his liver during the surgery, which he said healed quickly and left him with ""minimal pain.""

He will undergo a single course of radiation treatment -- though more may be necessary, in the future -- and four treatments with an immune system-boosting drug, which will be administered at three-week intervals.

Carter said doctors will continue to scan his body for cancer, in an effort to determine where the melanoma originated.

As Carter noted, while in a majority of cases melanoma is a cancer of the skin, a relatively small portion of cases occur inside the body. Rarely, it can develop in places other than skin, such as the eye or mucous membranes.

According to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, ""one of the most common primary tumors to spread to the brain is malignant melanoma. In nearly 50 percent of people with melanoma that has metastasized, the disease can be found in the brain.""

The center added that ""the outlook for patients with brain metastases generally depends on the number, size, location, and origin of the primary tumor or tumors.""

Carter will be receiving a drug called Keytruda to boost his immune system. Keytruda became available only in the last year and is so new that it is unclear whether it might improve his chances of survival with the cancer.

In general, the average length of survival with melanoma is 11 months, if surgery and radiation do not successfully remove the lesions or tumors, The Washington Post's Amy Ellis Nutt reported.

In May, during a trip to Guyana to monitor elections there, Carter fell ill with a ""very bad cold"" and returned to Atlanta early. Doctors performed a complete physical examination and found the tumor on his liver.

By the end of June, doctors were certain that he would need to have an operation on his liver, Carter said. But he chose to delay surgery in order to complete a book tour for his memoir published this year, ""A Full Life: Reflections at Ninety.""

""The doctors told me that it was a very slow growing cancer, apparently it wouldn't make any difference between the middle of July and August, so we scheduled it when I got through with the book tour,"" Carter said.

Carter said that an MRI scan the afternoon after the cancerous mass was removed from his liver revealed that melanoma had already spread to his brain.

""I just thought I had a few weeks left,"" he said during the news conference at the Carter Center in Atlanta. ""But I was surprisingly at ease -- much more so than my wife was.""

Carter is the second-oldest living president, separated by just over 100 days in age from George H.W. Bush. Carter, the 39th president, served in the White House from 1977 to 1981.

After his presidency, he has continued his humanitarian and human rights work through the Carter Center. It was for that work that he was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.

For now, he noted that his cancer treatment will become his ""top priority.""

""The Carter Center is well prepared to continue on without any handicap,"" Carter noted.

Several members of Carter's immediate family -- his brother, two sisters, his mother and father -- have all died from cancer.

Beyond his international travel schedule, Carter and his wife of 69 years, Rosalynn, have maintained a life in Plains, Ga., his hometown. He noted that he doesn't expect cancer treatment to halt his usual contributions to his place of worship, Maranatha Baptist Church.

""I plan to teach Sunday school this Sunday -- and every Sunday as long as I'm physically and mentally able,"" Carter said.

He noted that the well wishes have poured in from President Barack Obama and the first family, as well as all of the living former presidents.

Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton and current Secretary of State John F. Kerry have also called to wish him well.

""It's the first time they've called me in a long time,"" Carter joked.

Carter spoke to a full room of journalists, reflecting on -- and occasionally joking about -- his legacy in the White House and as a global humanitarian.

He called his work with the Carter Center ""personally more gratifying"" than his presidency, though he joked that he wished he might have been able to serve a second term and then engage in humanitarian work after leaving the White House.

""I think I have been as blessed as any human being in the world,"" Carter said. ""So I'm thankful and hopeful.""

This story has been updated to clarify that Carter misspoke when he said during his press conference that he would receive four radiation treatments. The Carter Center said in a statement late Thursday that he would receive one radiation treatment and four treatments with the immune-boosting drug Keytruda.

Kerry presided over the official reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Cuba under a blazing Caribbean sun Friday morning, declaring an end to ""too many days of sacrifice and, sorry, too many days of suspicion and fear"" during more than half a century of estrangement between the two countries.

As a brass band played the “Star-Spangled Banner,” three now-retired Marines who lowered the flag here in January of 1961 handed a new, folded banner to their young counterparts for it to be raised and saluted.

Before an invited audience of about 300 U.S., Cuban and foreign diplomatic officials, and a crowd of several hundred Cubans gathered outside the embassy’s fenced front courtyard, Kerry praised President Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro for what he called “a courageous decision to stop being prisoners of history and to focus on the opportunities of today and tomorrow.”

“The time has come for us to move in a more promising direction,” Kerry said. “In the United States, that means recognizing that U.S. policy is not the anvil on which Cuba’s future will be forged.” Instead, he said, it “is for the Cubans to shape.”

On the ground in Cuba for historic flag raising at U.S. embassy + 31 After 54 years, the flag flies in Havana again.

Neither country, he said, has “illusions about how difficult our new relationship will be.” But “we are each confident in our intentions, in the contacts we have made, and the friendships we have begun to forge,” Kerry added in an address that quoted the 19th-century Cuban nationalist hero José Marti.

But in both his embassy speech and in comments later in the day, Kerry made clear that full normalization of relations, including an end to the U.S. trade embargo, ultimately depends on improvements in the Cuban government’s human rights record.

“There is no way Congress is going to vote to lift the embargo if they’re not moving with respect to issues of conscience,” Kerry told reporters who traveled with him for the one-day visit.

While Kerry praised the progress both countries have made in improving their relationship in the brief eight months since Obama and Castro pledged to restore diplomatic relations severed 54 years ago, he outlined a range of issues on which the two countries plan to work, including a move toward a free and open democracy.

“We remain convinced that the people of Cuba would be best served by a genuine democracy where people are free to choose their leaders, express their ideas and practice their faith,” Kerry said, “where the commitment to economic and social justice is realized more fully; where institutions are answerable to those they serve; and where civil society is independent and allowed to flourish.”

At a joint news conference, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said he appreciated the U.S. outreach and echoed Kerry’s optimism about the future. But Cuba, he said, found equal fault with human rights in the United States, and he insisted that the “reality” of Cuba’s one-party state is not the anti-democratic regime described in Washington.

Noting U.S. gender and racial “discrimination,” police “brutality” and political corruption, Rodriguez said “we also have our own concerns in the area of human rights in the United States.”

“We are very much willing to talk about any of these issues,” Rodriguez said of human rights and democracy, “except that in some of them, it would be very difficult to reach an agreement.” In addition to lifting the embargo on most trade and financial dealings with Cuba, he demanded that the United States vacate its naval base at Guantanamo Bay.

After a series of meetings over the past several months on issues of common concern, Kerry said he and Rodriguez had agreed on a more formal structure to deal with three “baskets” of issues, ranging from what Kerry descried as the “easy” ones of cooperation on environmental and maritime matters, through “more complicated” matters of civil aviation and Internet connectivity, which the Cuban government has been slow to implement here.

The third package of issues, Kerry said, are the “toughies,” including human rights, law enforcement and compensation claims on both sides. The first round of those talks, he said, would begin in the District on Sept. 10.

Kerry said he hopes to return here for a stay of several days this winter. Obama has also said he would like to visit Cuba before the end of his term.

U.S. opponents of the embassy opening were quick to criticize Kerry’s visit. Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush called it “a birthday president for Fidel Castro” — referring to Cuba’s revolutionary leader, who turned 89 on Thursday — and “a symbol of the Obama administration’s acquiescence to his ruthless legacy.”

Fidel Castro turned over the presidency to his brother in 2008 but remains a popular and influential figure in the communist government.

Bush, a former Florida governor, said in a statement that the absence of Cuban political dissidents at the flag-raising ceremony was “especially insulting,” and said that if he becomes president, he would “reverse Obama’s strategy of accommodation and appeasement and commit to helping the Cuban people claim their freedom.”

Kerry said in a series of television interviews earlier in the week that the flag-raising ceremony was a “government to government” event, and that he would meet separately with dissidents.

Late Friday, during a reception at the U.S. diplomatic residence, Kerry met with 10 prominent opposition activists and former political prisoners, most of whom have supported the restoration of relations. Two dissident leaders who have publicly opposed the diplomatic opening declined an invitation to attend.

Opposition activists have grown more bold in the months since the normalization process was begun, with expanding demonstrations and regular nonviolent marches that have in turn sparked an increase in short-term political detentions by the government.

Two official planes carrying the U.S. delegation to the embassy ceremony took off from Washington at dawn Friday. While they were in the air, workers in Havana hung the official U.S. seal and the words “Embassy of the United States of America” on the outside of the building along the capital’s broad seaside boulevard, the Malecón.

The embassy has been open for business since July 20. But the administration postponed the official flag-raising ceremony until Kerry could schedule his visit. The official delegation included eight members of Congress, all of whom were long supporters of restored relations.

During the flight, Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) recalled that she had first visited Cuba in 1977. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) wore a baseball cap emblazoned with the name of his personal hero, Cuban slugger Minnie Minoso, the Chicago White Sox great who died this year. In his pocket, Cohen carried a laminated 1961 Minoso baseball card, which he said he hoped to present as a gift to a worthy Cuban during the trip.

Other lawmakers in the delegation, which also included selected Cuban Americans, were Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.); and Democratic Reps. Karen Bass (Calif.),and Jim McGovern (Mass.).

At the embassy ceremony, Obama’s inaugural poet, Richard Blanco, whose family left Cuba shortly before his birth in 1968, read “Matters of the Sea,” a poem he had written for the occasion.

“What matters is this,” it began. “We all belong to the sea between us.”

Before taking off for Washington at sunset, Kerry visited Finca Vigia, the home of Ernest Hemingway outside Havana.

http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/11/politics/hillary-clinton-email-server-justice-department/index.html",0,"Hillary Rodham Clinton’s attorney has agreed to provide the FBI with the private server that housed her e-mail during her four years as secretary of state, Clinton’s presidential campaign said Tuesday. Her attorney also has agreed to give agents a thumb drive containing copies of thousands of e-mails that Clinton had previously turned over to the State Department.

The FBI has been looking into the security of Clinton’s unusual private system, which has emerged as an issue in her campaign amid growing questions from Republicans and some U.S. intelligence officials about whether government secrets might have been put at risk.

The development in the FBI inquiry came the same day that a top intelligence official whose office has been reviewing some of Clinton’s e-mails informed congressional leaders that top-secret information had been contained in two e-mails that traveled across the server.

The finding, contained in a letter sent to leaders of key oversight committees, marked the first indication from government officials that information regarded as top secret — the government’s highest category of security designation — may have passed across Clinton’s server while she led the State Department.

Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail + 43 The former secretary of state, senator and first lady is the Democratic nominee for president.

A State Department spokesman late Tuesday described the top-secret designation as a recommendation and said they had not been marked classified at the time, but said staffers “circulated these e-mails on unclassified systems in 2009 and 2011 and ultimately some were forwarded to Secretary Clinton.”

Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, said Tuesday night that Clinton is cooperating with the FBI probe. He declined to say whether the FBI ordered that she turn over the devices and when her attorney, David Kendall, had done so.

“She directed her team to give her e-mail server that was used during her tenure as secretary to the Department of Justice, as well as a thumb drive containing copies of her e-mails already provided to the State Department,” Merrill said. “She pledged to cooperate with the government’s security inquiry, and if there are more questions, we will continue to address them.”

The inquiry by the FBI is considered preliminary and appears to be focused on ensuring the proper handling of classified material. Officials have said that Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, is not a target.

The FBI’s efforts have included contacting the Denver-based technology firm that helped manage the Clintons’ unusual private ­e-mail system.

Clinton has resisted relinquishing control of the server. In March, she said the server contained “personal communications from my husband and me.”

“I believe I have met all of my responsibilities, and the server will remain private,” she said then, in response to a question from a reporter about whether she would allow an independent party to examine the device

Clinton turned over more than 30,000 e-mails from the account to the State Department in December, and the agency is vetting those messages for release to the public. She has said that she deemed an additional 32,000 ­e-mails to be personal and chose not to keep them.

Kendall told a congressional oversight committee in a letter that there was “no basis” to support a third-party examination of the server. He indicated that he had confirmed with IT staffers that no e-mail sent or received by Clinton’s account while she was secretary of state remained on the server or backup systems associated with the system. “Thus, there are no hdr22@clintonemail.com emails from Secretary of State Clinton’s tenure on the server for any review, even if such a review were appropriate or legally authorized,” he wrote.

Meanwhile Tuesday, 17 House and Senate members from both parties were informed about the presence of “top secret” information on the Clinton e-mail system in a letter from the inspector general for the intelligence community, I. Charles McCullough III. The letter was first reported Tuesday by the McClatchy news service.

Much of the classified information in the e-mail conversations originated with the CIA, according to two government officials familiar with the records. Some of the information was deemed to be classified by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s classification guidelines. The information included references to information related to satellite images and electronic communications, according to the officials.

The findings by McCullough stemmed from his office’s review of a sample of 40 of Clinton’s ­e-mails. Previously, he had said that the sample included four classified e-mails, but on Tuesday he adjusted his assessment — saying that intelligence agencies deemed two of those e-mails to have contained top-secret information.

McCullough has asked for access to all of the e-mails to conduct a more thorough review but was denied by State Department officials in July.

Last week, State Department spokesman John Kirby said that while the agency was working to “resolve whether, in fact, this material is actually classified, we are taking steps to ensure the information is protected and stored appropriately.”

McCullough also located two e-mails that included classified material from among a separate batch of 296 related to the 2012 attacks on U.S. outposts in Benghazi. One of those e-mails had been publicly released by the State Department, causing consternation within the intelligence community.

He has also located one additional e-mail in the sample of 40 that was classified at the time it was sent but has since been declassified, suggesting that there is no longer a reason to protect the information or that it has since become public, two people familiar with the finding said.

McCullough also told lawmakers that his reviewers found two e-mails they believe contain information that the State Department considers classified, and they have alerted the agency so it can conduct its own review.

All told, McCullough has pointed to seven e-mails that he said contained classified information, including two with top-secret material.

His findings appear to contradict Clinton's earlier comments.

""I am confident that I never sent or received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received,"" she told reporters last month in Iowa.

Clinton said she had ""no idea"" which e-mails have caught McCullough's attention.

Trump booted the nation's top Latino newsman out of his press conference, but moments later he let Univision's Jorge Ramos reclaim his seat in the front row and the two men sparred passionately about illegal immigration.

Next, Trump added to his enemies list. He refused to apologize to Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, whom he ridiculed anew on Twitter Monday night. He launched fresh attacks against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. And he sprinkled spicy slams on former Florida governor Jeb Bush throughout his speech at a rollicking rally.

To top it off, Trump went after the entire political class in Trumpian fashion, saying he wants to outlaw Teleprompters (one of his best applause lines of the night) and asserting that as soon as politicians get to Washington, they become “impotent.”

“They look at these beautiful buildings, these beautiful halls and all of a sudden they become impotent,” Trump said, as the crowd laughed. “Is that an appropriate word? I think so.”

Trump’s lively visit to Dubuque, where he rallied an estimated 3,500 supporters inside a convention hall on the banks of the Mississippi River, comes as he expands his campaign in Iowa and other key states.

Trump appeared on stage with Sam Clovis, a prominent Iowa conservative activist who had been former Texas governor Rick Perry's state chairman but abruptly defected from Perry's camp because of fundraising troubles. Trump poached Clovis and named him a national co-chairman and policy adviser. Trump's top Iowa strategist, veteran organizer Chuck Laudner, is a friend of Clovis and had been courting Clovis for weeks.

Trump also announced five additional staffers in several early-voting states, including Charles Munoz as his Nevada state director. In South Carolina, Nancy Mace, the first female graduate of the Citadel, is now Trump’s state coalitions director, while James Epley is his upstate regional director. He announced hires in New Hampshire as well.

Trump, who is leading GOP polls nationally, said in an interview that he is determined to expand his campaign in the coming weeks, moving from a small circle of aides to a national grass-roots operation that he hopes will sustain the momentum he has built this summer with raucous speeches and seemingly nonstop appearances on television talk shows.

“They said I wouldn’t run. They said I would not file the papers. They said I didn’t have a campaign,” Trump said, with a hint of exasperation. “Well, I did — and I do.”

Two minutes into Trump’s news conference here on Tuesday, the candidate had a tense exchange with Ramos, one of the country’s most recognizable Mexican-Americans.

Ramos stood up in the front row of journalists to ask Trump about his plan to combat illegal immigration. But Trump did not want to answer.

What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail + 42 Businessman Donald Trump officially became the Republican nominee at the party’s convention in Cleveland.

“Excuse me,” Trump said. “Sit down. You weren’t called. Sit down.”

Ramos, holding a piece of paper, calmly said, “I’m a reporter, an immigrant, a senior citizen. I have the right to ask a question.”

Trump interrupted him. “Go back to Univision,” he said. Then Trump motioned to one of his bodyguards, who walked across the room and physically removed Ramos from the room.

The ejection lit up social media. Reporters asked Trump why he removed Ramos. At first, he accused Ramos of violating his news conference protocol. “He stood up and started screaming,” Trump said of Ramos. “He’s obviously a very emotional person.”

But moments later, Ramos returned to his seat in the front row — and Trump called on him. For five minutes, they tangled over immigration policy, an issue on which both men have passionately different views.

“Here’s the problem with your immigration plan,” Ramos said. “It’s full of empty promises.”

Ramos pointed out it would be unconstitutional to deny citizenship to what Trump calls “anchor babies,” children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants. Trump disagreed, saying it could be done as an act of Congress and that some legal scholars argue the 14th Amendment should be changed.

“A woman’s getting ready to have a baby,” Trump said. “She crosses the border for one day, has the baby, all of a sudden for the next 80 years — we have to take care of” the child.

The next question from Ramos: How do you build a 1,900-mile wall across the U.S. border with Mexico?

""It's very easy,"" Trump said. ""I'm a builder. . .What's more complicated is building a building that's 95 stories tall.""

The questioning continued. At one point, Trump said, “I can’t deal with this.” A Trump aide interrupted and told Ramos, “Is there one question — one question?”

Yet Trump let the questioning continue, seemingly determined to prove his case. “I have a bigger heart than you do,” he told Ramos. “We’re going to do [deportations] in a very humane fashion.”

Trump went on to assert that gang members in Baltimore, St. Louis and other cities are illegal immigrants.

""Listen, we have tremendous crime,"" he told Ramos. ""We have some very bad ones. Do you mind if I send them back to Mexico?""

Ramos replied, “No human being is illegal, Mr. Trump.”

The candidate’s response: “Well, when they cross the border, from a legal standpoint, they’re illegal immigrants when they don’t have their papers.”

When Ramos pressed Trump on polls showing his unpopularity with Latinos, Trump would not accept the premise and turned the question on him: “How much am I suing Univision for right now? Do you know the number? I know you’re part of the lawsuit.”

“I’m a reporter,” Ramos said.

“Five hundred million dollars,” Trump replied. “And they’re very concerned about it, by the way. I’m very good at this.”"
2716,2716,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/20/the-myth-of-the-anchor-baby-deportation-defense/,0,"Donald Trump said it; Jeb Bush said it, too. Frankly, a whole range of people have used the term ""anchor baby"" this week in public discussions about Trump's immigration-related policy ideas -- ideas that include an end to the nearly 150-year-old practice of granting citizenship to anyone born in the United States.

It's the former, known as ""birthright citizenship,"" which is delineated in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. And as all sorts of public figures have discussed the future of the 14th Amendment this week, the more colloquial -- many say pejorative -- term ""anchor baby"" has come up over and over again.

But the anchor baby, while potent politically, is a largely mythical idea.

Here's the basic concept: People, namely women, come to the United States illegally and give birth to children, generally for the specific purpose of bolstering legal attempts of the child's parents remain in the United States or even become citizens themselves.

Looser definitions suggest ""anchor babies"" can simply be intended to help illegal-immigrant parents access taxpayer-financed public education and/or social services through their citizen children -- another political hot button, to be sure. (Even here, the law limits those benefits to the children themselves.)

But usually the debate has been about the residency of the parents, who after all are supposed to be using the child as their ""anchor.""

This is the definition that has little legal underpinning. For illegal immigrant parents, being the parent of a U.S. citizen child almost never forms the core of a successful defense in an immigration court. In short, if the undocumented parent of a U.S.-born child is caught in the United States, he or she legally faces the very same risk of deportation as any other immigrant.

The only thing that a so-called anchor baby can do to assist either of their undocumented parents involves such a long game that it's not a practical immigration strategy, said Greg Chen, an immigration law expert and director of The American Immigration Lawyers Association, a trade group that also advocates for immigrant-friendly reforms. That long game is this: If and when a U.S. citizen reaches the age of 21, he or she can then apply for a parent to obtain a visa and green card and eventually enter the United States legally.

In order to apply for such an option, the parent of a so-called anchor baby would need to do all of the following.

Advertisement

Wait for his or her child to reach the age of 21.

Leave the United States.

Return to their home country.

Have their child begin the lengthy process of applying for a family reunification immigration request.

Clear consular interviews and a U.S. State Department background check. (One or both would very likely provide evidence that said parent, at some point, lived in the United States illegally -- long enough for that ""anchor baby"" to be conceived or born. And despite widespread belief to the contrary, there is indeed a penalty for that.)

If a person has lived in the United States unlawfully for a period of more than 180 days but less than one year, there is an automatic three-year bar on that person ever reentering the United States -- and that's before any wait time for a visa. So that's a minimum of 21 years for the child to mature, plus the three-year wait.

And, for the vast majority of these parents, a longer wait also applies. If a person has lived in the United States illegally for a year or more, there is a 10-year ban on that person reentering the United States. So, in that case, there would be the 21-year wait for the child to mature to adulthood, plus the 10-year wait.

All told, the parents of the so-called anchor baby face a 24-to-31-year wait to even enter the United States, much less obtain a visa and green card or become a citizen.

Immigration courts routinely reject claims that an undocumented parent must remain in the United States to care for a U.S. citizen child. The main but rare legal exceptions are for children who are so seriously ill or profoundly disabled that one parent must care for them full-time, or for a child in need of medical care unavailable in their parents' home country.

These parents are given something called ""humanitarian parole,"" Chen explained. And this is very rarely applied to people already living in the United States illegally. It is more often given to the parents of, say, an Afghan war burn victim who want to accompany their child to the United States for medical care. And, even then, humanitarian parole is generally granted for limited period of time.

Alternatively, these parents can apply for something even more rare: an extreme hardship exception, according to Deborah Anker, a clinical professor of law and director of the Harvard University Law School’s immigration and refugee clinical program. Very rarely they can apply for a waiver that may allow them to reenter the United States sooner, Anker said. But if that request is denied, there is no form of appeal available. Decisions are final.

Yes, it is true that some undocumented immigrants come to the United States and have children with or perhaps even because of the mistaken belief that this will strengthen a legal bid to remain in the United States. Mistaken beliefs have spurred previous surges in illegal immigration -- including last year's.

And it is true that some people -- such as breast-feeding mothers, children brought to the United States illegally as children and others -- have benefited from the immigration system equivalent of proprietorial discretion, known as ""deferred action.""

Advertisement

But with the exception of an Obama administration program known as DACA (limited to an estimated 1.2 million young adults brought to the United States illegally as children) and a second program currently blocked by a federal court that would have granted deferred action to another 300,000 people (mostly the parents of those eligible for DACA), deferred actions typically come with a short and limited timeline. They also do not include a pathway to a visa or legal work in the United States. And these programs did not exist when the concept of an ""anchor baby"" was politically popularized, so it becomes harder to accept the idea that having an ""anchor baby"" was the express goal of many people immigrating illegally.

It's also important to note that, as of August 2014, only about 550,000 DACA applications had been approved, according to a Pew research Center analysis of federal data. And even these applicants must wait until their 21st birthday to begin the lengthy process described above to attempt to help an undocumented parent. And ""attempt"" is the key word here.

And if you're still skeptical, here's the real proof that having a baby in the United States does little to help an undocumented parent remain in the United States, there's this:

2719,2719,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2015/08/24/new-day-of-carnage-for-financial-markets-amid-global-selloff/,0,"What trading floors around the world look like this week + 11 The chaotic week of trading started with many large U.S. companies losing billions in market value amid a global sell-off. A worldwide selling frenzy on Monday bruised U.S. stocks and sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging nearly 600 points, as investors worried over China’s slowing economy extended a global-market meltdown. The Dow fell more than 1,000 points within six minutes, its largest single-day slump in history, before staggering back to close down 588 points, or 3.6 percent, its lowest point in 18 months. It marked the second straight day of a 500-point-or-more loss for the Dow, a blue-chip index of 30 large companies.

The Standard & Poor’s 500, a broader look at the market, and the Nasdaq Composite, a tech-heavy index, posted similarly dismal starts before swinging wildly then sinking again to losses of close to 4 percent.

The global whiplash underscored investors’ shaken confidence in China’s slowing economy and central bank. The world’s second-largest economy is now reeling over what China’s state media is calling “Black Monday,” during which its markets just recorded their biggest one-day nosedive in eight years.

The sell-off and ensuing chaos bruised every industry, wiping out gains in rapid order after a year of mostly steady trading. Some of America’s biggest companies shed tens of billions of dollars in market value in only a few days, and the markets’ early gains have yet to restore those losses.

“This is all about fears of a hard landing in China,” said Campbell Harvey, an economist and business professor at Duke University. The morning’s panicked opening, he added, “is bare-faced evidence of a market overreaction.”

The trading roller-coaster roiled the world’s most valuable company, Apple, which began the morning down 13 percent before bouncing back into positive territory — and then sagging back nearly 2 percent into the red. The $592 billion tech giant lost more than $58 billion in market value last week.

The dismal opening marked an unnerving continuation of last week’s free fall. The Dow’s blue-chip index plunged more than 500 points on Friday, capping its worst week since 2011 and entering what Wall Street calls a correction, having tumbled 10 percent from its May peak.

The panicked opening and steep downfall had a “flash crash-type feel to it,” Credit Suisse analysts wrote Monday, with some making comparisons to the “Black Monday” trading disaster of 1987, when the Dow plummeted more than 22 percent.

Early Monday, the S&P 500 came startlingly close to a tripping point in which trading would have been shut down for 15 minutes to help halt the disarray.

Though the recent investor rally has helped, the Dow is still down 11 percent from the start of the year.

On Friday, a key barometer of Chinese manufacturing sagged to its lowest point since the global financial crisis, following shortly after Beijing earlier this month surprised investors with a move that helped devalue the nation’s currency.

China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite index has fallen by nearly 40 percent since June, after soaring more than 140 percent last year. Markets in Europe also plummeted, and Asian shares on Monday hit a three-year low.

“There’s no doubt the Chinese economy is slowing,” said Jim Dunigan, chief investment officer at PNC Wealth Management. “But the question now is: How much is it slowing, and what will the government step up to do about it?”

China’s woes stoked fears over commodities and forced oil prices further down. Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, dropped to about $43.50 a barrel, sinking below the $45 mark for the first time since 2009. U.S. light crude fell 4 percent, to $38.90 a barrel, a six-year low.

Demand for U.S. Treasury bonds also heated up as investors flocked to safety. Yields for the 10-year bonds dwindled below 2 percent for the first time since April.

The markets’ mayhem could further dent workers’ 401(k) retirement accounts and could affect the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.

The weakness overseas comes at a time when the U.S. economy is relatively strong, fueled by encouraging signs in the job market and better-than-expected corporate results.

President Obama was briefed on the turmoil, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday. He added that the Treasury Department “has been closely monitoring” markets in China and across the world."

And his father, another former president. And one of his foreign policy advisers, Paul D. Wolfowitz, the architect of his brother's war in Iraq. And about the war itself.

Under a blazing sun, Bush expressed irritation with what he called “the parlor game” of focusing on Wolfowitz and other past Bush administration advisers who have resurfaced for this Bush campaign.

“If I’m president, we will have a strategy on Day One to take out this grave threat to our national security and to the world,” he said. “I promise you that.”

This was supposed to be the week when Bush would finally lay out his own thoughts on how to combat the Islamic State terror group and put Hillary Rodham Clinton on the defensive — and wrest himself from his family legacy in the process. But over several days, it has become evident that his ideas on the subject are remarkably similar to George W. Bush’s ideas and that he firmly believes that Democrats — not his brother — deserve the blame for the unrest in Iraq and neighboring Syria.

His new struggles with the issue also come as he is fading in polls and being drowned out by the angry outsiders dominating the race.

According to Bush this week, the removal of Saddam Hussein from power “turned out to be a pretty good deal.” The 2007 troop surge was “an extraordinarily effective” strategy. By the time his brother left office, he said, the “mission was accomplished” in Iraq because security had been restored.

Bush also said he won’t rule out waterboarding in the interrogation of terrorism suspects, although he added, “I do think in general that torture is not appropriate.”

Bush faults President Obama for his unwillingness to talk directly about “radical Islamic terrorists” and Clinton for visiting Iraq only once as secretary of state. He said it might be necessary to deploy more U.S. forces to both Iraq and Syria — and that troops already on the ground should be embedded more closely with local forces.

As for questions about advisers, Bush told fairgoers Friday that he has a young team working at his campaign headquarters in Miami. Shrugging, Bush said any veteran GOP foreign policy advisers “had to deal with two Republican administrations” run by his brother and father.

“I mean, this is kind of a tough game to be playing, to be honest with you,” he said. “I’m my own person.”

In an interview Friday, radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Bush whether it’s easier or harder for him to talk about national security given his last name. Bush shot back: “It doesn’t matter. I’m the first candidate to have a view on this with enough detail for people to see what the world would look like if I’m president.”

Funny images of politicians chowing down on the campaign trail + 14 Normally polished politicians often try and fail to elegantly eat inelegant foods under the bright lights at state fairs and other campaign events.

But Democrats are eager to exploit Bush’s remarks this week to remind voters of his family ties. During a town hall in Dubuque, Iowa, on Friday afternoon, Clinton took aim at Bush’s criticism of her, noting that his brother signed an agreement as president to withdraw combat troops from the country by 2011.

“I do think that it’s a little bit surprising to hear Jeb Bush talk about this,” she said. “He expects the American people to have a collective case of amnesia.”

Later in the town hall, Clinton sought to single out Jeb Bush’s comments on women’s issues but mistakenly referred to him as “George Bush.”

“I get confused,” she said, seeming to relish her error. “Oh, well.”

Most Americans still believe the Iraq war was a mistake and are opposed to new military engagement — making Jeb Bush’s approach to national security risky. But polling suggests that his positions are popular among most Republicans, especially if it means raising doubts about Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state.

“Jeb is going to talk about the threat of radical Islamic terrorism and how to defeat it,” said Tim Miller, Bush’s campaign communications director. “If the Democrats want to talk about the past, that’s their prerogative, but the American people are looking for someone who will address today’s growing terror threat, and they didn’t get it from Obama/Clinton.”

Among his GOP rivals, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has said that “it was a mistake to topple” Hussein, while New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says it “makes no sense for us to be re-litigating yesterday.”

Businessman Donald Trump has it both ways, blaming George W. Bush for invading the country in the first place and Obama for pulling troops out in 2011. “The war should have never happened,” he told Fox News earlier this year. “Once it did happen, you should have left the troops in. It’s really a double fault.”

In Iowa — where Bush polled seventh in a CNN-ORC poll released this week — there are some Republicans who appreciate his approach and think his dynastic lineage is a positive attribute.

""He's going to be our man because he's presidential; he knows what's going on,"" said Belinda Schlueter, a 56-year-old homemaker. ""He comes from a family that actually knows what the country's all about and how the office runs. We need somebody there that knows what they're doing.""

Bush launched his discussions of national security Tuesday in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif. He faulted Obama and Clinton for their “blind haste” to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq, a “premature” decision and a “fatal error” that disrupted the fragile progress his brother helped forge in Iraq. He did not mention his brother’s role in starting the process for withdrawal.

While there are about 3,500 U.S. support troops in Iraq now, ""more may well be needed,"" Bush said. He endorsed deploying troops to work more closely with Iraqi forces, including as forward air spotters to help identify targets. ""We do not need, and our friends do not ask for, a major commitment of American combat forces,"" he said. ""But we do need to convey that we are serious, that we are determined to help local forces take back their country.""

In Syria, he called for more active U.S. involvement in the brutal Syrian civil war — including a no-fly zone and the expansion of “safe zones” in the country.

On Thursday, at a national security forum in Davenport, Iowa, he said “Iraq was fragile but secure” when his brother left office in 2009. He added that the “mission was accomplished in the way that there was security there and it was because of the heroic efforts of the men and women in the United States military that it was so.”

That answer immediately prompted comparisons to George W. Bush’s 2003 “Mission Accomplished” speech on the deck of a Navy carrier that critics say prematurely declared the end of the Iraqi military campaign.

At the forum, Jeb Bush would not say for certain whether he would preserve the executive order Obama signed banning enhanced interrogation. Later Thursday, he told reporters that he would not rule out using waterboarding during interrogations of terrorism suspects.

Former House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), whose group hosted the forum, credited Bush with presenting “the most nuanced approach to a really hard problem.”

Rogers, who is neutral in the GOP primary contests, said, ""Campaigns now are [so] tapped in to 140 characters and Twitter, it's very difficult to have a thoughtful conversation about national security.""

Peter Feaver, who advised George W. Bush on Iraq, applauded Bush for delivering “a detailed speech” and suggested he represented views “advocated by serious Democrats and Republicans.”

He pointed to a recent Washington Post op-ed co-written by Michèle Flournoy, Obama's former undersecretary of defense for policy who has been touted as a possible defense secretary for Clinton. Writing with Richard Fontaine, a former foreign policy adviser to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Flournoy advocated a series of proposals similar to what Bush called for: to provide more military aid to Sunni tribes and the Kurdish peshmerga in Iraq; to embed more Special Operations forces with Iraqi security forces; to deploy forward air controllers to identify targets; and to build a stronger global campaign against the Islamic State.

After parrying questions lobbed at him by Iowans, Bush donned a red apron and flipped pork chops with Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad (R). Carl Owens, a hog farmer, stood off to the side taking in the scene.

“I don’t know if he’s like his brother and dad or not,” said Owens, 59. “I wasn’t too happy with them. Mr. Bush, the last president, look at the mess he got the United States into over there where we shouldn’t have been. Kind of like the Vietnam War. We shouldn’t have been there.”"

That was the language used by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as he warned Europe against allowing in mostly Muslim families. A day after a drowned Syrian toddler washed up on the Turkish coast, another European leader retorted that Christian values demanded helping the less fortunate.

The furious exchange — a rare breach of the E.U.’s buttoned-down decorum — came as Hungarian authorities apparently laid a trap for thousands of asylum-seekers who had packed Budapest’s central train station after days of worsening conditions outside the station. Police had blocked them from entering the station for days but allowed them in early Thursday.

But a refugee-packed train apparently bound for the Austrian border came to a halt just west of Budapest, in a small town where dozens of police officers were waiting on the platform. They tried to force people off the train to take them to a migrant-processing center, threatening their chances to make it onward to Western Europe.

By day’s end, there was a standoff, with the packed train surrounded by police and the migrants refusing to budge. Some of the passengers received medical treatment on the platform.

Orban, Hungary’s nationalist leader who has spearheaded attempts to turn back the migrants, said Thursday that he had little choice but to seal his nation’s border with razor wire, soldiers and a high fence.

“We Hungarians are full of fear, people in Europe are full of fear, because we see that the European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation,” he said in Brussels in a raw joint appearance with European Parliament President Martin Schulz. Orban and Schulz, a veteran politician from Germany, made no attempt to paper over their differences or their distaste for each other.

The Hungarian leader blamed Germany for the crisis, saying that its open-door policy toward Syrian asylum-seekers was propelling a wave of migrants to undertake dangerous journeys toward Europe’s heart. Germany expects 800,000 asylum-seekers this year, and it has said that it does not plan to turn away Syrians.

“The moral, human thing is to make clear: ‘Please don’t come. Why do you have to go from Turkey to Europe? Turkey is a safe country. Stay there. It’s risky to come,’ ” Orban said.

Hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan have overwhelmed Europe’s capacity to respond in recent months, opening stark divisions. Some leaders believe that the world’s largest economic bloc — a vast territory of 503 million residents — is more than capable of accommodating refugees. Others, including Hungary’s Orban, believe the continent’s population is in a far more delicate state.

The divisions could threaten some of the most basic tenets of the E.U., an alliance built on the ashes of World War II in a bid never again to allow such destruction. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said this week that a Europe with no internal borders — a key achievement of European unification — could be in question if no solution to the refugee crisis is found.

Migrants’ desperate quest to cross into Europe + 66 More than 332,000 people have reached the continent this year.

Schulz called Orban’s approach “wrong.”

He warned that the splits emerging during the refugee crisis could do lasting damage to the 28-nation alliance, which was founded on a spirit of consensus and burden-sharing.

“This is a crucial moment for the European Union,” Schulz said. “A deeper split of the union is a risk we cannot exclude.”

Orban’s fears are shared by many Eastern European nations, which have pushed hard against any attempt to require them to take in asylum-seekers. Slovakia has said it will accept only Christians. In Estonia, where fewer than 100 migrants have been resettled, police on Thursday were investigating a suspicious early-morning fire at a dormitory that was housing victims of Syria’s war.

But the concerns also extend to Britain. There, fewer Syrians than would fit in a London subway train have been accepted this year. British media reported Thursday that Prime Minister David Cameron would soon announce plans to take in “thousands” more Syrian refugees, a striking turnaround for a leader who a day earlier had said that the answer to the crisis was not simply taking in “more and more” refugees.

Elsewhere in Europe, the refusals brought mounting anger from leaders who are more sympathetic to the growing crowds of asylum-seekers.

“For a Christian, it shouldn’t matter what race, religion and nationality the person in need represents,” European Council President Donald Tusk said Thursday, launching into Orban before the two met in Brussels. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, proposed resettling at least 100,000 refugees across Europe.

In France, President François Hollande said the death of the toddler is “a tragedy, but it’s also a call to the European conscience. Europe is made of values and principles.” Images of the child’s body lying facedown and partly in the water on a Turkish beach evoked consternation around the world.

Hollande said he had just reached an agreement with Germany on a proposal for mandatory quotas to more equitably spread refugees across the E.U. Some European countries ""are not shouldering their moral obligations,"" he said.

Merkel, meanwhile, said she understood that not every nation was prepared to take on as large a burden as her country was doing. But she said it was impossible for Germany, Sweden and Austria alone to continue taking in the vast majority of the incoming asylum-seekers.

“The Geneva Convention does not apply only to Germany but also to every state,” she said, referring to the international treaty that requires countries to take in refugees of war.

Orban has vowed to seal Hungary’s borders by Sept. 15, empowered by emergency measures expected to be approved by the country’s parliament in the coming days. The measures would give authorities broad powers to crack down on illegal migration.

Outside Budapest’s elegant stone-and-glass-fronted station Thursday evening, people living in tents and atop worn woolen blankets sprawled across a vast public plaza and into an adjacent subway concourse. Tourists carrying frame backpacks slipped into the station entrance past women cradling babies, men pacing anxiously and children arguing over the few available toys.

Refugees expressed a keen awareness that Hungary does not want them — and said the feeling is mutual.

“Hungary is a poor country. They can’t give us the life we’re looking for. They can’t even give us food or water,” said Yahya Lababidi, a tank-top-wearing 21-year-old law student from the northern Syrian province of Idlib. “We want to go to the rich countries.”

Lababidi said he had been traveling for a month, passing along “the usual route” — through Turkey, Greece, Macedonia and Serbia — with a plan ultimately to settle in the Netherlands. But he said that when he tried to enter the train station in Budapest five days earlier, police officers barred his path. Since then, he’s been sleeping on the cold stone of the plaza.

“I escaped from war,” he said. “I thought things would be better than this.”

Hungarian leaders “have done all they can to stir up popular sentiment against immigrants and refugees,” said Marta Pardavi, a co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a group that offers legal advice to asylum-seekers. “This has become a totally divided issue. Friendships break up over this.”

Critics of the European response said the continent’s 20th-century history of dictatorships and wars should instill in it more sympathy for others in need.

“We are facing a historical moment, perhaps one of the biggest the E.U. has had to face over the last couple of decades,” said Yves Pascouau, director of migration and mobility policies at the Brussels-based European Policy Center. “European citizens have fled dictatorships and wars. This is a part of our history. We’ve been able to be protected elsewhere in our countries.”

More than 150 were detained as the country drew its line in the sand. Its get-tough approach to the European refugee crisis created an immediate bottleneck and howls of protest.

Within hours, a tent city sprouted on the Serbian side of the border, creating another potential flash point of misery and anger, as refugees scrambled for new routes to their preferred destinations in Germany and Scandinavia.

Hungary’s move was condemned by neighboring countries, humanitarian organizations and migrants, who staged spontaneous demonstrations along the newly erected fence.

Yet Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his government made good on their promise to take a hard line, insisting that refugees who had escaped Syria’s civil war, for example, were safe once they had reached Turkey or Jordan and did not need to march through Hungary on their way to wealthy, welcoming nations such as Germany.

From a Hungarian outpost at the border fence, a voice shouted in Arabic through a loudspeaker: “We are not opening the border!”

Hungary dispatched the first of 800 new border guards to the fence, as authorities declared a state of emergency in two counties bordering Serbia, a move that would allow the parliament to deploy troops to the region.

Gyorgy Bakondi, a Hungarian security adviser, said authorities detained at least 155 people trying to cross into the country, some of whom were attempting to damage portions of the fence.

New rules in Hungary also put smuggling networks on notice, increasing prison terms for convicted human traffickers.

The refugees kept coming — and dying along the way.

At least 22 migrants were reported drowned in the Aegean Sea after their 65-foot boat capsized as they were trying to reach the Greek island of Kos. Among the dead were four children.

The Turkish coast guard said 249 people were rescued in that incident, just two days after 34 refugees drowned in a similar sinking.

Migrants chanted “Save us from drowning” at Istanbul’s main bus station as they demanded transport to the border crossing near Greece and Bulgaria, about 100 miles to the northwest, possibly opening up new routes through the Balkans, the Reuters news agency reported.

Diplomatic fallout

Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children — many from war-racked Syria and Iraq — have been racing to reach Western Europe before their path is blocked by tighter border controls and a dramatic rollback of the European Union’s hallmark policy of open movement across frontiers.

The crackdown in Hungary also brought diplomatic fallout.

Serbia’s foreign minister, Ivica Dacic, denounced the Hungarian moves as “unacceptable” and insisted on talks with the European Union.

“We want to be part of the solution, not collateral damage,” said Dacic, whose nation is not an E.U. member.

Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann also criticized Hungary, saying at a news conference, “You can’t just stick your head in the sand.”

Speaking to reporters, German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended her country’s open-door policy for refugees, saying Germany had shown its “friendly face” to the world.

Merkel also said Germany acted properly when it began to enforce immigration controls at its border with Austria, which led to huge traffic snarls and canceled trains in Austria.

At Vienna’s central railway station, where many were stranded, crowds awaited word on whether stalled buses and trains would again move toward Germany, whose generous social programs and giant economy draw many asylum seekers.

Austria’s Interior Ministry said the country was running out of shelter for refugees, with almost every one of 20,000 beds filled.

“We’re hoping for a decision by the Germans that they will accept us again,” said Mohammad, 24, from Fallujah, Iraq. He declined to give his last name for fear of reprisals against his family back home. He had reached the heart of Europe without showing anyone any documents, he said.

Transit zones

In Washington, President Obama said the United States and its allies “may have to deal with the source of the problem, which is the ongoing crisis in Syria.”

The United States, he said, “feels it is important for us to also take our share of Syrian refugees as part of this overall humanitarian effort.” He gave no details.

A Hungarian government spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, told reporters that Hungary would create new transit zones to hold asylum seekers while their applications are processed. Human rights activists predicted that most asylum claims would be quickly rejected by Hungary.

At the Hungarian border town of Roszke, several hundred refugees staged a peaceful protest, sitting on the highway and holding signs saying they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to continue their journey.

“We just want to pass through their country,” said Amir Kirit, 25, a software engineer from Damascus, Syria. “There is no going back now. We took the most dangerous trip in the world to get here because in Syria there is just death. So we will die here if we have to. Women, children. We need the international community to help.”

Across the border in Serbia, the needs were even starker. Hundreds of migrants spent the night in tents or curled up on yoga mats in the open.

Volunteers braced for another potential humanitarian crisis, with shelter and food in short supply.

A record 156,000 migrants entered the European Union in August, the bloc’s border agency, Frontex, said Tuesday. That brought the total for the year to more than 500,000, with many arriving by sea in Greece and Italy.

Last year, 280,000 migrants crossed into the E.U., the agency said.

http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/16/politics/gop-debate-wednesday-what-to-watch/index.html",0,"The last time Carly Fiorina was here, the former Hewlett-Packard chief ­executive sketched out her ­foreign policy blueprint. One thousand people heard her condemn the slow training of ­anti-Islamic State forces, the ambitions of China and the wonky ""tooth to tail"" ratio of military power to military bureaucracy.

It was sober. It was serious. It was basically ignored. Like much of this summer’s political news, Fiorina’s July speech was subsumed by Donald Trump; it inspired only a fraction of the news searches that Rolling Stone attracted last week when it quoted Trump seemingly making fun of her looks, according to Google Trends data.

The rise of Trump and of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, two first-time candidates who prefer broad strokes to policy debates, has left the Republican establishment looking confused and helpless. Originally expecting a clash of ideas among a diverse, talented field, the establishment’s national security Brahmins paired up with candidates and got to work — only to be blown out of the conversation by Trump.

That has left some Republicans hoping that Wednesday’s debate will break the fever — and change the tenor of the race from flashy to substantive. Hugh Hewitt, the syndicated Orange County radio host who will co-moderate the event, has promised to grill candidates about geopolitics and world leaders. If that happens, the debate will become a crucial test for Trump and Carson — and for the staying power of their campaigns.

“If this isn’t the moment to finally get serious, when the hell will it be?” asked Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), another Republican presidential contender. “Is the next time we get serious about foreign policy going to be when we get attacked? Everybody criticizes Barack Obama’s foreign policy, everybody knows he has no strategy in Iraq and Syria, but we need something specific to replace that. If we don’t hear that from the candidates, this week will have been a waste of time.”

Graham is an unwilling mascot for how foreign policy has fallen out of the primary debate. Just months ago, he was engaged in a near-daily debate with fellow GOP candidate Rand Paul, the libertarian-leaning senator from Kentucky, over issues including Iran and the Islamic State. “I’m running,” Graham said, “because the world is falling apart.”

On Wednesday afternoon, Graham will join former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.), another longtime Washington hawk, at the four-man second-tier debate. Santorum is at least invited to a policy-focused forum later this week in Greenville, S.C., hosted by Heritage Action for America; Graham, who lives near the venue, is not.

That will leave the task of vetting Carson and Trump on Wednesday to nine other candidates and the moderators. Neither front-runner has laid out a specific plan for attacking the Islamic State; Trump consistently has told audiences that he has a secret plan that he cannot share lest the enemy find out. Both candidates have been light on strategies for other crises.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, lamented how little attention has been paid to foreign policy.

“There certainly hasn’t been very serious discussion of it, because of the nature of the campaign,” McCain said. “Just rhetoric.”

Trump’s most insulting jabs at other presidential candidates + 11 Republican Donald Trump has made incendiary comments — many of them directed at his opponents — that keep him in the spotlight.

McCain added about Trump: “He’s not been asked tough questions. He’s said he wants to deport 11 million people. How do you do that? He hasn’t answered that question. He said in the Middle East he would go, and quote, ‘take their oil.’ I’d like to know how you do that. I think the American people deserve an explanation.”

Not all of them want one — at least not yet. Trump and Carson both bombed interviews with Hew­itt — to no appreciable effect. In March, Carson appeared not to realize that the Baltic states were NATO members. Asked about the fumble, he explained that a president would have “access to a lot of experts in a lot of areas” and that he would not be stymied by gotcha questions. “You don’t want to devote all your attention to learning facts on a fact sheet,” he said. His standing has grown dramatically since then.

Trump, under more scrutiny, fared even worse. He’d previously told “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd that his foreign policy advice came from watching Sunday talk shows and talking to national security hawks. Faced with Hewitt’s questions, Trump seemed to confuse Iran’s Quds forces for the decidedly non-Iranian Kurds, and he couldn’t describe the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas.

It was a disaster, compounded by Fiorina’s largely adroit answers to the same questions. Yet like every “disaster” of Trump’s summer, it did not halt his momentum; in poll after poll, he has held his position as front-runner of the Republican field since early July.

Hewitt, meanwhile, returned to his debate prep with some new thinking about how to really draw out the candidate.

“I don’t think those questions, quiz questions about knowledge, tell you anything about understanding,” Hewitt said. “Knowing names is dumb. That’s not necessary. I wish I had phrased my question to Trump as: ‘General Soleimani, who leads the Quds forces, is about to get $100 billion. What will the impact of that be?’ That’s what I wanted to ask, and it went off the rails.”

It’s true that Trump’s and Carson’s actual positions have been largely unexamined — and have remained room-shaking applause lines at his rallies. Trump offers audiences a vision of an America that’s always “winning,” that learned from the Iraq war (which he came out against 16 months after the invasion), that is ready to “take the oil” from conquered Islamic State territory.

""We're going to have so many victories,"" he told more than 10,000 people in Dallas on Monday, ""at some point it's going to be coming out of your ears!""

He offered no more detail Tuesday in Los Angeles when he delivered what was billed as a national security speech. ""We're going to make our military so big and so strong and so great — it's going to be so powerful that no one is going to want to mess with us,"" he said.

Carson has offered a lower-decibel version of the same idea, minus the oil seizures. At a rally last week in Anaheim, Calif., Carson said that some generals had told him that the Islamic State could be defeated easily if the military’s “hands aren’t tied.” In Anaheim, and at a later rally in a Houston suburb, Carson said he would oblige.

“I would use every resource, including financial resources, offensive and defense resources, covert and overt activities,” he said in Texas. “I would use everything possible not to contain them but to destroy them.”

For the people who study foreign policy and try to shape the national conversation, the simple answers from Carson and Trump are frustrating — yet totally understandable. The rise of the Islamic State has stoked panic among some conservative voters, but it has not defined their conversations. In the most recent Gallup poll, conducted in August, only 19 percent of voters listed a foreign policy issue as “the most important problem facing this country today.” Only 3 percent said, specifically, that the biggest problem was the Islamic State.

The GOP's hawks have tried, with little success, to sober up the base. Former vice president Richard B. Cheney and his daughter Liz reemerged last week with a book, ""Exceptional,"" and an argument about how the party must rediscover its inner hawk. They sold 14,000 copies, according to Nielsen's BookScan service.

Yet they were stymied by a problem bedeviling former Florida governor Jeb Bush’s White House bid: lingering ill will toward the administration of his brother, George W. Bush. Both Trump and Carson tell voters they are right to be skeptical of military adventures in the wake of the Iraq war. The debate about what a “serious” foreign policy may look like has been paused, and every other candidate wants to change that.

“We haven’t even begun the substance part of the campaign,” said Paul, who has fallen in most polls but will take part in the main debate. “It’s really been about celebrity and really sophomoric insults. I think the beginning of the decline of Trump is at hand, might have begun with Perry dropping out. The media and the voters may be starting to ask: ‘Oh, my goodness, we are promoting something bad for the country. Do we want someone this unserious in charge of our nuclear arsenal?”"

The expanding Russian involvement in Syria threatened to further complicate efforts to secure a negotiated settlement to the four-year-old war at a time when the influx of refugees into Europe and the endurance of the Islamic State are focusing world attention on the unrelenting bloodshed in Syria.

Amid indications that more Russian troops and military hardware may be heading to Syria, it remained unclear how far Moscow was prepared to go in support of its quest to spearhead a Russian-led solution to the war.

The latest attacks came as Russian officials extended an olive branch to moderate rebels fighting the Syrian government and said they could be included in Moscow’s plans for an eventual peace settlement.

Speaking at a news conference in New York, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that “the Free Syrian Army should be part of the political process.”

The comment seemed at odds, however, with airstrikes conducted against one of the few areas in the country where moderate rebels still have a foothold and from which the Islamic State was ejected more than a year and a half ago.

Thursday’s attacks focused on a strategically vital belt of territory in the provinces of Idlib, Hama and Homs, where steady rebel gains in recent months have threatened the government’s link between the capital Damascus and the Assad family’s coastal heartland of Latakia. The nearest Islamic State-controlled territory is more than 100 miles away.

Some of the towns struck are strongholds of a recently formed coalition, Jaish al-Fateh, or Army of Conquest, that includes the Syrian al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra alongside an assortment of Islamist and moderate factions. Among the targets was a mosque in the northern Idlib town of Jisr al-Shughour, whose capture by the rebel coalition in April underscored the growing threat to the regime.

One strike hit the outskirts of Kafr Nabl, a town that has won renown as a symbol of the peaceful protest movement against Assad family rule. The local council there receives U.S. assistance, and the local rebels have been supported under a covert CIA program aimed at bolstering moderate rebels.

The strike hit a training camp for a U.S.-vetted group called Suqour al-Jabal that is adjacent to Roman ruins on the outskirts of the town, according to activists in the area. Raed Fares, a leader of the protest movement in Kafr Nabl, said the explosion was bigger than anything local residents had seen in three years of airstrikes conducted by Syrian warplanes.

“It was like a nuclear bomb,” he said. “It made a fire six kilometers wide.”

Ground level: On the scene of controversial Russian strikes in Syria + 27 Russia continues its military operations in Syria.

In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook reiterated the U.S. assessment that the Russian planes “do not appear to be hitting targets in areas where ISIL is operating.”

“We have encouraged them, once again, to focus their attention on ISIL,” he added.

Russian officials insisted that the Islamic State was the main target of the air attacks, but also acknowledged that Jabhat al-Nusra “and other terrorist groups” were being included in the strikes, according to Lavrov.

“If it looks like a terrorist, if it acts like a terrorist, if it walks like a terrorist, if it fights like a terrorist, it’s a terrorist,” Lavrov told journalists in New York.

He added that Russia does not consider the Free Syrian Army a terrorist group and said the participation of moderate rebels in any peace process was “absolutely necessary.”

In Moscow, however, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov questioned whether the Free Syrian Army exists, underscoring the gulf in perceptions of the anti-Assad rebellion between Russia and the United States, which has given limited support to moderate rebels in their quest to unseat the Assad regime.

“Is there a Free Syrian Army? Does it still exist? Have not the majority of its fighters switched sides and joined ISIL?” he said when asked whether Russia considers the Free Syrian Army a terrorist group.

The comment was certain to deepen suspicions by Washington and its allies that Russian President Vladi­mir Putin’s short-term aim is to give more breathing space to Assad, whose depleted and wearied forces have been losing ground to the rebels in southern and northern Syria since the spring.

The location of the strikes suggests the Russians’ immediate priority is to safeguard Syrian government communication lines between Damascus and the coast, where Russian troops are operating from an expanded air base not far from Assad’s home town of Qardaha, military analysts said.

A spokesman for Russia’s Defense Ministry, Igor Konashenkov, said that warplanes had hit a dozen Islamic State sites in the previous 24 hours, destroying targets including a command center and two arms depots.

In the first official Russian indication of the size of the intervention, Konashenkov told journalists in Moscow that Russia has deployed 50 warplanes and helicopters to the expanded Bassel al-Assad International Airport outside the coastal city of Latakia.

The strikes may not make a significant military difference to a battlefield that has remained largely stalemated for the past two years, with neither the rebels nor the government capable of delivering a decisive blow.

But with the Russian military buildup continuing, it remains unclear precisely what Russian intentions are, said Jeffrey White, a military analyst with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Russian and Syrian news reports said more troops are heading for the Syrian coast, including Marines, airborne troops and special forces. A report by the official Syrian news agency, SANA, said amphibious landing craft are also expected to arrive in the coming days.

“What the Russians are doing is saying, ‘What is the priority threat to the regime?’ And they are dealing with that,” White said. “At some point, they might get around to hitting ISIS. But at the moment, it’s about the threat, not the group, and they want to deal with the threat to the regime.”

The targeting also seemed to diminish any hope that Russia would quickly win wider support for its vision of a peace settlement in Syria, central to which is the creation of an anti-Islamic State coalition that will include Syria and Iran, and which Russia is urging the United States to join.

The Syrian opposition said it would not countenance peace talks brokered by Moscow that appear aimed at propping up Assad and urged the U.N. Security Council to take action to stop the Russian bombing.

Syrian opposition figures, and some Free Syrian Army units, held discussions with Russian officials during the summer over possible ways to end the war, said Monzer Akbik, a senior official with the coalition. But the strikes suggest a different goal, he said: to bomb Syrian rebels into submission.

“What the Russians are trying to do is threaten the Syrian people that they are able to help Assad defeat you, to pressure the Syrians into accepting Assad to remain in power,” he said. “This is not going to happen. They will refuse to engage according to these terms.”

2775,2775,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/04/chaffetz-formally-announces-bid-for-house-speaker/,0,"The Republican chairman of a high-profile House committee on Sunday shook up the race to succeed outgoing Speaker John A. Boehner, launching a challenge to the heavy favorite, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. The bid by Rep. Jason Chaffetz (Utah), chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, comes amid unrest from conservatives driven by doubts that McCarthy (Calif.) will be any more inclined than Boehner to embrace the right flank of the House Republican Conference.

Chaffetz said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that he was “recruited” by members displeased with McCarthy’s ascent and that he would “bridge the divide” in the House GOP.

“You don’t just give an automatic promotion to the existing leadership team,” he said. “That doesn’t signal change. I think [House Republicans] want a fresh face and fresh new person who is actually there at the leadership table in the speaker’s role.”

Advertisement

Chaffetz’s remarks not only reflect tensions between conservatives and establishment Republicans, but also concerns about McCarthy’s ability to communicate with the GOP base and the public at large. Those concerns grew after McCarthy made comments last week suggesting that a House investigation into the 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic compound and a CIA annex in Benghazi, Libya, stemmed from political motivations.

“We need somebody who’s out there who is actually going out there and making the case to the American people, talking to the Senate about what we need to do, and going on the national television shows and winning that argument,” Chaffetz said. “We don’t seem to win the argument, and that’s a problem.”

Chaffetz has spent his four House terms working his way to the top of the Oversight Committee, a post that makes him the GOP’s prime attack dog against President Obama’s administration. He is well versed in the hand-to-hand political combat of cable news and talk radio and has become the party’s face on a variety of issues, including Secret Service failures and government funding for Planned Parenthood.

Advertisement

He made headlines this week after an inspector general’s report found that a top Secret Service executive suggested leaking information that Chaffetz had been passed over for an agent’s job years ago in retaliation for his committee’s aggressive investigations.

But McCarthy retains considerable advantages ahead of the closed-door GOP leadership elections set for Thursday. He enjoys a week’s head start in building support, a ready-made political infrastructure, and close relationships across the Republican conference built during his stint as the GOP’s chief House candidate recruiter ahead of the 2010 midterm elections.

A McCarthy spokesman declined to comment Sunday on Chaffetz.

In Thursday’s party elections, a speaker candidate need only win the backing of a simple majority of those voting to become the Republican nominee. But unlike other leadership posts, the speaker is chosen in a subsequent floor vote of all House members, and the House’s 246 Republicans will be under no obligation to select the party nominee.

No Democrats are expected to back McCarthy or any other Republican, so the nominee cannot afford to lose the support of more than 28 GOP members.

Share this article Share

Chaffetz suggested that McCarthy does not have that level of support: “There are nearly 50 people and a growing number that will not and cannot vote for Kevin McCarthy as the speaker on the floor. He’s going to fall short of the 218 votes on the floor of House.”

But Chaffetz has weaknesses of his own. He has received mixed reviews of his tenure as the Oversight Committee chairman, with conservative commentators recently accusing him of squandering a hearing last week featuring the president of Planned Parenthood, Cecile Richards. And Chaffetz, who criticized McCarthy’s comments on the Benghazi investigation, has his own history of bombastic and controversial remarks.

He also played a role in a key episode that fanned conservative outrage against establishment Republicans, stripping an Oversight subcommittee chairman of his gavel in retaliation for breaking with leaders on a June procedural vote. That member, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), went on to file a rare motion to vacate the speaker’s chair, accelerating Boehner’s departure.

Chaffetz said Sunday that he “learned from that lesson, that you’re not going to do things by cutting people off at the knees.”

“I think I’m better for it, and I think Mark is better for it, and we’re certainly good friends on this day,” he said.

Meadows agreed Sunday that bygones are bygones: “Any emphasis placed on past disagreements would be misguided and is certainly not a factor in this race for me.”

Chaffetz will audition alongside McCarthy and a third speaker candidate, Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), in closed-door meetings this week scheduled ahead of the Thursday elections. A Tuesday evening session sponsored by hard-line conservative groups, including the increasingly influential House Freedom Caucus, could be especially crucial.

Webster, a back-bencher who has emphasized the need for procedural improvements, has won some support from conservatives, but his appeal across the conference is limited. A previous speaker bid, challenging Boehner in January, garnered 12 votes.

The stakes of the speaker’s race were heightened in recent days after the Treasury Department announced that Congress must act to raise the federal debt ceiling on or about Nov. 5 — less than a week after Boehner leaves office.

An effort by Boehner to pass a debt-limit increase in his final days with mainly Democratic votes — as happened last week on a 10-week government funding extension — could further weaken McCarthy, who as majority leader is considered to be in control of the floor agenda.

Chaffetz said Sunday that “we’re just not going to unilaterally raise the debt limit” and suggested that he would take cues from members who overwhelmingly support using the deadline as leverage in spending negotiations with Obama."
2776,2776,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/02/oregon-shooter-said-to-have-singled-out-christians-for-killing-in-horrific-act-of-cowardice/,0,"One gunman, nine victims dead: Scenes from the attack, aftermath + 24 Multiple casualties and deaths occurred after shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. ROSEBURG, Ore. —Investigators including cyber-experts and hate crime specialists peered Friday into the life of a 26-year-old gunman whose massacre across an Oregon campus may have been driven by religious rage and a fascination with the twisted notoriety of high-profile killers. What is known so far about the attacker — identified by a U.S. law enforcement official as Chris Harper Mercer — appear only as loose strands that suggested an interest in firearms and the infamy gained by mass shooters.

Witnesses also said he seemed to seek specific revenge against Christians, and police examined Web posts that hinted of wider antipathy toward organized faith.

But authorities still struggled to build a clearer picture at what drove the California-raised Mercer to stalk rural Umpqua Community College — armed with three pistols and a semiautomatic rifle — and methodically pick off students and professors Thursday on the fourth day of the fall semester.

At the end, nine people were dead, plus Mercer, and the college joined the mournful roster of America’s mass shooting sites.

At least 10 others were admitted for treatment at the Mercy Medical Center, said the chief medical officer, Jason Gray, on Friday. Three patients were transferred to larger facilities for more intensive care, he added.

“The days and weeks ahead will be the most challenging” as the small community copes with the aftermath, Gray said.

The names of those killed and wounded were not yet released nor would Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin name the shooter publicly, more out of rage than discretion. “I will not name the shooter,” he said at a news conference Thursday night. “I will not give him credit for this horrific act of cowardice. Media will get the name confirmed in time … but you will never hear us use it.”

A gofundme fundraising page was started for one man believed to be a victim of the shooting, Christopher Mintz, an Army veteran who was shot seven times. The page, which includes a photo of Mintz lying in a hospital bed, was established by a man who identified himself as Derek Bourgeois, a cousin of Mintz’s. Bourgeois said he grew up with Mintz in Randleman, N.C.

Relatives told CNN that Mintz tried to block the door of a classroom and was shot three times. When the shooter made his way in, Mintz told them that Thursday was his son’s sixth birthday and was shot at least twice more. Mintz was wounded in the back, stomach, hands and legs, according to the report.

The gofundme page says that “yesterday my cousin Chris Mintz was shot 7 times while trying to protect others from the gunman at Umpqua Community College.” It adds that “during the shooting both of his legs were broken and he is going to to have to go through a ton of physical therapy.”

The transition from the anonymity of “before” to the notoriety of “after” took just about 10 terrifying minutes, during which the shooter strode through a school building armed with three pistols and a semiautomatic rifle. Clad in a dark shirt and jeans, driven by a motive that is still unknown, he methodically sprayed bullets into classrooms full of students, who hid behind desks and desperately tried to block doors that didn’t lock.

In one classroom, he appeared to single out Christian students for killing, according to witness Anastasia Boylan.

“He said, ‘Good, because you’re a Christian, you’re going to see God in just about one second,'” Boylan’s father, Stacy, told CNN, relaying his daughter’s account while she underwent surgery to treat a gunshot to her spine.

“And then he shot and killed them.”

Another account came from Autumn Vicari, who described to NBC News what her brother J.J. witnessed in the room where the shootings occurred. According to NBC: “Vicari said at one point the shooter told people to stand up before asking whether they were Christian or not. Vicari’s brother told her that anyone who responded ‘yes’ was shot in the head. If they said ‘other’ or didn’t answer, they were shot elsewhere in the body, usually the leg.”

The violence stopped only after authorities exchanged gunfire with Mercer. At 10:47 a.m. local time Thursday, the end was announced over the police scanner: The suspect was down.

The scraps of information about Mercer uncovered so far did not fit together easily and much remained unconfirmed, including reports that he had forecast some act of violence in Oregon in a dark corner of the Internet known as 4chan, a report being investigated by federal authorities, according to the New York Times. But a murky portrait was emerging of a quiet and withdrawn young man who struggled to connect with other people, instead seeking attention online, and who harbored anger against organized religion.

Thursday’s rampage was the latest in a series of mass shootings that have produced national revulsion, even as they have left Republicans and Democrats divided over whether such violence should lead to stricter gun laws. The campus shootings came three months after nine people were gunned down at a historic African American church in Charleston, S.C.

One group that tracks gun violence, the Mass Shooting Tracker, said it was the 294th death or injury from a shooting involving four or more people in the United States this year — a rate of more than one victim a day.

School shootings have figured prominently in this series of tragedies, including the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado, the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings and the deaths of 20 children in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

From Washington, a visibly frustrated President Obama offered prayers for the victims and their families and quickly pivoted to repeat his call for stricter gun-safety laws, something he has done throughout his presidency to no avail.

“Each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough,” he said. “It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. It does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America.”

But in Douglas County, a rural region where hunting is popular and crime rates are low, support for gun rights is strong.

“I carry to protect myself — the exact same reason this happened,” Casey Runyan, a disabled Marine Corps veteran who now lives in the area, told the Associated Press. He told the AP he brings a Glock-29 pistol wherever he goes.

Hanlin, the Douglas County sheriff, sent a letter to Vice President Biden in 2013, after the shootings in Newtown renewed the debate about gun control. Hanlin said that proposed restrictions would be “irresponsible and an indisputable insult to the American people,” and he and his deputies would refuse to enforce them.

For Thursday night, at least, attention was mainly on the victims. In a ritual that has repeated itself many times in other places over the past few years, people gathered at the Douglas County Fairgrounds where evacuees from the school had been taken to meet their families. With darkness falling, the site of reunions became a base for an anxious vigil. A chaplain led a group prayer. Families missing a member clung to one another. Friends stood by and struggled to stave off dread.

“It’s agonizing to be here and just wait,” said Sarah Cobb, 17, a UCC student who had survived the shooting by ducking under her desk but was still waiting to hear about some of her classmates and friends.

“The longer people sit in there, the more they know it is going to be bad,” she said, referring to a gathering of investigators and FBI agents in a small building at the fairgrounds. “But you’re just praying and hoping that it’s not.”

All day Thursday, local and federal law enforcement officials swarmed Umpqua’s small campus, a modest collection of about a dozen buildings largely unprotected by gates or walls.

Umpqua, one of 17 community colleges in Oregon, has about 2,000 students and about 200 full- and part-time faculty members. Federal data suggests Umpqua is a quiet campus; the only crimes reported there in recent years have been an occasional burglary and, in 2013, an aggravated assault.

After a 2006 incident in which one student was shot by another at Roseburg High School, local institutions — including UCC — hired security guards, according to the Eugene Register-Guard. Those security guards are unarmed, interim college President Rita Calvin told the newspaper. The campus is a gun-free zone.

Investigators also fanned out across two states where Mercer lived, questioning family members and former neighbors, sifting through social media postings and obscure Internet forums in search of some clues about what happened, and why.

Public records showed no previous brushes with law enforcement by Mercer. Social media accounts attributed to him, including a MySpace page and an online dating profile, offer hints of his interests — the Irish Republican Army, punk rock music, an antipathy toward religion — but little real insight.

According to reports, authorities are investigating a conversation on the message board 4chan posted Wednesday evening. The site is notorious for staging online hoaxes, in addition to cat memes, hackings and Internet attacks. But the conversation, if authentic, appears to show a gunman’s plans for a shooting. “Don’t go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest,” the post reads.

Mercer grew up in California, where he attended the Switzer Learning Center for students with disabilities. Rick Rada, a former classmate, recalled Mercer as quiet, cheerful and non-violent.

“To me Chris was just an ordinary guy, really. He was one of the silent types like me,” Rada told The Washington Post. “… But we got along with our teachers. He opened up with the teachers, talked to them, had fun.”

Former neighbors in Torrance, Calif., a beachside city just south of Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times that Mercer liked to practice target shooting and tended to act “anxious or nervous,” as Rosario Espinoza put it. He and his mother, Laurel Harper, mostly kept to themselves, except for occasional disputes over bugs or loud noises. Espinoza’s mother, Rosario Lucumi, recalled thinking it “strange” that Harper referred to her son as “baby.”

Mercer moved to Oregon with his mother a year or two ago, according to public records. It’s not clear if and how he may have been affiliated with Umpqua Community College, though a student told CNN that she took a theater class with Mercer, and a “Chris Harper-Mercer” is listed as a production assistant on the Facebook page of a UCC fall show.

His father, Ian Mercer, still lives in Los Angeles. He stepped outside his home there briefly on Thursday night to say that he had spent the day speaking with law enforcement and could not answer questions about his son or the shooting.

“Shocked is all I can say,” he told reporters. “It’s been a devastating day.”

Gloria Buhring, a neighbor at the Winchester, Ore., apartment complex where Mercer appeared to have lived, said police officers swarmed the area Thursday, blocking much of the complex off with police tape.

Buhring didn’t know Mercer. But on Wednesday, she returned home to find a previously empty dumpster “overflowing with stuff that looked like it had been moved from an apartment,” she told The Washington Post. “It looked like somebody had gotten rid of a lot of stuff and left.”

Another Winchester neighbor, Bronte Hart, told Seattle TV station KIRO that Mercer would “sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light.”

Hart said a woman she believed to be Mercer’s mother lived with him and was “crying her eyes out” Thursday.

Steven Fisher, who also lives nearby, described Mercer as “skittish.”

“His demeanor, the way he moved, always looking around,” Fisher told CNN. “I got a bad vibe from him.”

Those words — “silent,” “skittish,” “strange” — come up a lot in answers to questions about Mercer. But not “violent.” No one interviewed who knew him said they suspected that he might be the type of person to fire into a classroom full of college students.

The attack started just after 10:30 a.m. local time, when students in Snyder Hall — a modest building in the southeast part of campus where science and English classes are held — heard a sudden popping noise.

Some were bewildered by the noises. But Cobb, a 17-year-old who heard the sound from her Writing 121 class in Snyder, recognized them immediately.

Gunshots.

“I grew up hunting, so by then I knew what it was,” she told The Washington Post. Cobb screamed to her teacher that they all needed to get out, and the instructor opened the door onto chaos: students running, a teacher crying, a man screaming for someone to call 911. Cobb left her phone, her backpack and all of her belongings in the classroom and then ran out of the building, tripping her way down the stairs.

“There was so much screaming you knew it was serious,” she said. “I was terrified. I was sprinting. You could hear the gunshots echoing in the hall.”

Cobb had just moved to Roseburg from Eugene a few months earlier, and she didn’t know anyone in her class.

“I think everyone in my room escaped,” she said. “But you know right away that wasn’t going to be the same next door.”

One of Cobb’s classmates, 19-year-old Hannah Miles, told the Eugene Register-Guard that she followed her instructor and several other classmates to the school bookstore, where an employee called 911.

The report came in at 10:38 a.m: “Active shooter at UCC,” the dispatcher said.

While police, paramedics and first responders went into action, Mercer continued his rampage on campus.

Anastasia Boylan, the witness being treated for a spinal injury, told her family that the gunman entered her classroom firing, according to CNN.

“I’ve been waiting to do this for years,” he told the professor. Then he shot the man point blank.

According to Boylan’s account, as retold by her family, everyone in the classroom dropped to the ground. Mercer reloaded his weapon, then asked students who were Christian to stand up.

They did so. That’s when he told them “you’re going to see God,” and fired, choosing to shoot others in the legs.

Boylan, 18, survived by pretending to be dead. She’d been hit in the back and lay on the floor bleeding, according to CNN. When Mercer said, “Hey you, blonde woman,” she did nothing.

Eventually, Boylan was rescued and airlifted to a Eugene hospital, where she is being treated for her injuries, her grandmother told the LA Times.

In a room nearby, Cassandra Welding heard the percussive sounds of gunshots with horror. A classmate opened the door to look at what was happening, Welding told the LA Times, and was shot.

“We were screaming, ‘Close the door! Close the door!'” Welding said.

Someone dragged the injured woman back into the room and locked the door. Taking turns, classmates performed CPR on the woman, who had been shot in the torso. Her broken glasses lay on the floor near her, Welding told the LA Times. Blood was splattered on the walls.

The students crawled toward the back of the room, away from the door.

“I was so terrified for my life and I was shaking,” Welding said. While another classmate called 911, the 20-year-old phoned her mother. She wasn’t the only one.

“I just heard other people in tears, crying, calling their loved ones and telling them, ‘I love you.'” she told the Times. “It was such a heart-wrenching thing.”

Minutes after the initial 911 call, police arrived on campus.

Their quick, deadly confrontation with gunman was reported over the police scanner.

“We exchanged shots with him; he’s in a classroom on the east side of Snyder Hall,” an officer hurriedly informed the dispatcher.

Then, minutes later: “The suspect is down. We’ve got multiple gun shot wounds. We’re going to need multiple ambulances on scene,” an officer urged. “… As many ambulances as possible. We have upwards of 20 victims.”

Later in the day, that figure was revised down: 10 dead, including the gunman, and seven more wounded.

Hanlin, the Douglas County sheriff, said at a Thursday night press conference that the victims likely won’t be identified for another 24 to 48 hours. Officials want to ensure that all families have been notified before releasing the names of those killed.

Officials at Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg said the hospital had received 10 patients from the shooting.

PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend, a hospital about 70 miles north of the school, said it had three female patients, one in critical condition and the other two in serious condition.

The UCC campus will remain closed Friday, as officials continue to catalog and investigate the aftermath. Around Oregon, flags are being flown at half-staff.

“Today was the saddest day in the history of the college,” Cavin said at a news conference Thursday.

That evening, with their friends in the hospital, their campus a crime scene and the dead still nine nameless unknowns, hundreds of people gathered at a park in downtown Roseburg. Cheeks wet, candles clutched in their hands, mourners listened as professors, public officials and the college president urged them to think of the victims, and not the man who killed them.

When the speeches were over, a chant went up: “We are UCC.”

“After” was underway."

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/paul-ryan-house-speaker-pleas-214586",0,"As soon as Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) shocked his fellow Republicans by withdrawing from the race for House speaker, Paul Ryan knew what was coming. “I will not be a candidate,” the Wisconsin Republican said in a release issued less than 20 minutes after McCarthy’s stunning Thursday announcement, in an immediate bid to cut off any pressure for him to do a job he has repeatedly said he does not want.

But this time, it didn’t take. By mid-afternoon, outgoing speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) had spoken to Ryan at least twice, trying to convince the reluctant congressman that he was the only man who could save House Republicans from their self-created chaos.

By day’s end, after hunkering down for two hours in his ceremonial office a few steps from the House floor, after listening to pleas from friends to take the reins of the bitterly divided Republican caucus, he emerged, declining to explicitly state his plans.

""I've got no news for you guys,"" Ryan told reporters, exiting the Capitol. ""I've got nothing to add right now. . . . This is not the time or place, guys.""

Boehner and several other prominent Republicans are turning to their party’s 2012 vice-presidential nominee out of desperation, believing that he is the only member of the House with the stature to be speaker. Two other members, Reps. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.) and Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), have announced their candidacies, but they are widely seen as too inexperienced or underwhelming to handle the job.

Although Ryan has the standing and experience — at 45, he has already been in office 17 years — it is not clear that he is suited to the role, either. He has never held an elected leadership position, never had to spend hours listening to every complaint possible from rank-and-file lawmakers. A self-styled policy wonk, Ryan prefers to spend time in a committee room cobbling together legislation than working the fundraising circuit in New York and Florida — a modern-day requirement of any House speaker.

Even if Ryan does win the job, some supporters question whether the most respected member of the House Republican Conference would be able to tame the divisions to push a unified agenda: The same 30 to 40 conservatives who have helped usher Boehner toward the door, and who appeared ready to deny McCarthy the job, plan to be just as hard on whoever the next speaker is when it comes to showdowns with President Obama and Democrats.

“He’s still going to have to deal with the same dynamic,” said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), a leader of the small moderate wing and a backer of Ryan’s ascension. “That may be part of the reason why he’s denying this so far — he knows the dynamic.”

Yet by 6:15 p.m. Thursday, as McCarthy increased the pressure on Ryan to run for the job and the Capitol press corps camped outside his office, Ryan’s spokesman resorted to Twitter.

“Nothing has changed,” Brendan Buck tweeted.

But everything has changed, according to his colleagues.

As they voted on the House floor late Thursday, Ryan was besieged by his GOP colleagues. As the lawmakers huddled, Ryan aides canceled his fundraising and political events for the next

48 hours, a move interpreted by his friends as a signal that he had gone from a hard ""no"" to undecided after speaking with Boehner.

His party's elder statesmen, long enamored with Ryan's policy inclinations since his days as a disciple of Jack Kemp, said he needed to answer the call. But that doesn't mean the door is shut.

“Knowing him, if it becomes clear to him, as it is to so many others, that he’s first among peers, he may do it,” William J. Bennett, an education secretary in the Reagan administration and a close friend of Ryan, said in an interview Thursday.

The situation is more dire than the one Ryan confronted two weeks ago when Boehner, under intense pressure from the right flank, shocked the House Republican Conference by announcing his plan to resign Oct. 30, setting

Oct. 29 as the original date for a full vote of the House on his successor.

Walking out of that Sept. 25 meeting, Ryan said then — and has consistently repeated — that he did not want the job and that it would be a terrible one for a man with three school-age children living in Janesville, Wis., 75 miles southwest of Milwaukee.

His long game, according to those close to him, is not rising up in the House. He has been touted as a potential treasury secretary in a GOP administration. He declined to run for president this time, but he still has a couple of decades ahead of him.

That future could crumble if he listens to his colleagues. Not since Tip O’Neill (D-Mass.) left as speaker in 1986 has anyone retired from that job in good standing. Today’s House is more rife with pitfalls than it was even a decade ago.

Many of his colleagues, such Rep. Bill Flores (R-Tex.), head of the conservative Republican Study Committee, were calling on him Thursday to gamble his future to meet the present need.

“I would say, unequivocally, if I could choose the perfect person to be speaker, today, for this conference, it would be Paul Ryan,” Flores said."

http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/13/politics/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-2016-election/index.html",0,"The Republican presidential debates have become appointment television. Tens of millions of Americans have tuned in to watch Donald Trump whack his unwieldy field of opponents — pooh-poohing Jeb Bush's energy level, for example, or disparaging Rand Paul's appearance. So, what happens if the biggest fireworks in the first Democratic debate here Tuesday night are over which candidates opposed the Keystone XL pipeline first, which would resurrect the Glass-Steagall banking act, or how each would pay for his or her higher-

education overhauls?

Democrats expect the debate to be substantive and to set the course for an unexpectedly ­contentious nominating contest. Americans are either going to find a pleasing contrast to the rip-roaring show Republicans have put on — or they’re going to be bored senseless.

“Let’s be honest: Donald Trump truly is a ratings machine. Twenty-three million people did not tune in to see Marco Rubio,” said Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and an analyst on CNN, which is airing Tuesday’s debate. “So, unless the Democrats can talk one of the Kardashians into running, don’t expect the Democrats’ ratings to approach the Republicans’.”

For better or worse, Republicans have engaged a massive swath of the country with their first two debates, which were watched by 25 million and 23 million people, respectively. (By comparison, the highest-rated Democratic presidential ­debate in 2008, when Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton were locked in a battle royal, drew 10.7 million viewers.) Even if some voters tuned in just to witness the spectacle that is Trump's front-running candidacy, they now are familiar with many of the other GOP candidates.

A test for Democrats is whether Clinton, a former secretary of state and first lady, and a cast of four challengers, led by liberal insurgent Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), can generate the same level of interest in their primary campaign.

In the run-up to Tuesday’s debate, there are signs that they could. On Sunday, there were 124,812 mentions of the Democratic candidates on social media, television and in newspapers. By comparison, there were 377,223 mentions of the Republican candidates two days out from their Sept. 16 debate, according to an analysis by Zignal Labs, The Washington Post’s analytics partner.

But the Republican statistic is larger in part because it included many more candidates and came on a Monday, which tends to have more traffic than a Sunday. Generally, Clinton and Sanders have larger social-media presences than any GOP candidate other than Trump, according to Zignal.

“More people are talking about the Democrats than about the Republicans, outside of Trump,” said Josh Ginsberg, Zignal’s co-founder and chief executive. “The Clinton-Sanders horse race is ­interesting to people.”

As they prepare for their first face-off, Clinton and Sanders have signaled that they will wear velvet gloves. Each plans to focus on his or her own policy proposals and backgrounds, drawing comparisons with each other wherever appropriate but avoiding the kind of direct, personal attacks that have been so prominent in the Republican race.

None of the Democratic candidates is Trump’s equal in bombast and showmanship. And unlike many of the Republican candidates, the Democrats are downright predictable.

Sanders will probably bring the most passion, as he has all summer and fall while drawing massive crowds across the country. Clinton, who earned a reputation as a steady and skilled debater in her 2008 campaign, is by her nature cautious and is likely to display more competence than entertainment value.

“The level of humility and seriousness in this debate will be stark compared to what has been happening in the Republican ­debates, and that’s a good thing for our party,” said Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist and veteran of President Obama’s campaigns.

The wild card could be former Maryland governor Martin O’Mal­ley, who is struggling to break out of the low single digits in polls and sees the fall debates as make-or-break opportunities. On the campaign trail, he has fired shots at Clinton, and he could do so on the debate stage.

Still, Anderson Cooper, the CNN anchor who will moderate Tuesday’s debate, said he does not expect the Democratic candidates to be willing to criticize one another too much. He is preparing for a different kind of debate than the Republicans have held.

""I'm always uncomfortable with that notion of setting people up in order to kind of promote some sort of a face-off,"" Cooper said Sunday on CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" ""I think these are all serious people. This is a serious debate. They want to talk about the issues. And I want to give them an opportunity to do that.""

CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash and CNN en Español anchor Juan Carlos Lopez will join Cooper as questioners. CNN anchor Don Lemon will ask questions submitted through Facebook, which is co-sponsoring the debate.

The debate, at the Wynn Las Vegas luxury resort, will begin at 8:30 p.m. Eastern time and last two hours. There are expected to be five candidates on stage. Should Vice President Biden enter the race before Tuesday night, he is pre-qualified to appear at the debate. His advisers have said he will not attend, but CNN has a sixth lectern at the ready in case he springs a surprise.

Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, who says he has raised more than $1 million from a devoted base of supporters but is polling at or below 1 percent, was not invited.

The Republicans, who began the debate season with 17 candidates (Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas governor Rick Perry have since dropped out), have had to hold undercard debates just to fit everyone on stage.

Steve Schmidt, a strategist on George W. Bush’s and John McCain’s presidential campaigns, said the comparison between what he considers a vibrant Republican debate stage and the Democratic stage of five will not be favorable for the Democrats.

“The country’s not yet had an opportunity to see the current field of Democrats all on the stage together,” Schmidt said. “Certainly there is a high likelihood that the weaknesses of that field will become more apparent than they are today.”

Regardless, Cutter predicted that Tuesday’s debate will draw the kind of audience that counts most.

“The voters who will be voting in the primaries will tune in,” she said. “The number of people ­tuning in to the Republican ­debate — it was more like watching a car wreck than choosing a president.”

In an interview with The Washington Post last week, Trump was asked whether he thought the Democratic debate would be as popular a show as the Republican debates. He gave a one-word answer: ""No.""

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/clinton-benghazi-hearing-takeaways-215095",0,"Hillary Rodham Clinton easily parried barbed Republican questioning Thursday about the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, emerging unscathed from a high-stakes congressional hearing with a smooth and sometimes poignant account of her role in the event that has loomed as among her largest political liabilities. Just over a year before the 2016 general election, the long-anticipated showdown was suffused with presidential politics — though neither Clinton nor members of the House Select Committee on Benghazi mentioned her position at the top of the Democratic field.

Both she and her Republican questioners claimed the high ground, insisting that they were focused on learning what went wrong when militants overran two U.S. compounds in the restive Libyan city in September 2012, just months before Clinton left office as secretary of state.

Democrats defended Clinton’s leadership and repeatedly accused Republicans of using the special investigative panel to hunt for damaging information about her.

“I would imagine I’ve thought more about what happened than all of you put together. I’ve lost more sleep than all of you put together,” Clinton said. “I have been racking my brain about what more could have been done or should have been done.”

Republicans sought to establish a link between Clinton’s ­decision-making — before and during the attacks — and the four deaths, but they clearly struggled to build a theory of the case that she was directly responsible or negligent.

They also hurt their own cause at times. Several spent their 10-minute periods on peculiar lines of questioning: One pressed Clinton repeatedly about an e-mail exchange between two State Department staffers whom Clinton said she did not know. Much of the hearing was also consumed by bickering between Republicans and Democrats on the panel, leaving Clinton to sit by, sometimes shuffling papers or resting her chin on her hand.

U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others were killed in a chaotic, hours-long assault that revealed serious gaps in security and communications but not, Clinton claimed, a failure of leadership or policy.

“This was the fog of war,” Clinton said following an emotional recounting of harrowing events that included the failed attempt to rescue Stevens and the gut-wrenching hours that followed when the State Department could not account for his whereabouts.

The hearing comes at a moment when Clinton is reestablishing herself as the clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, following several months in which her poll numbers had nose-dived. Her stumble came in part because of her handling of a controversy over her use of a private e-mail account while she was secretary of state — an unorthodox practice that was unearthed by the panel she appeared before on Thursday.

In recent days, Clinton has recovered much of her advantage.

She has built upon her strong performance at the first Democratic debate on Oct. 13. She also got a stroke of good fortune when Vice President Biden ended months of speculation with an announcement Wednesday that he would not seek the Democratic nomination.

As was the case with the debate, the hearing setting was one that played to Clinton’s natural strengths. She kept her composure through the 11-hour session and appeared well prepared for the lines of attack by the Republican members of the committee. As the day wore on, with her command of the proceeding becoming more apparent, she even appeared bored at times.

There was no replay of the famous, and politically damaging, moment from a January 2013 hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Then in her final days as secretary of state, Clinton shouted and waved her arms at a Republican senator and demanded, “What difference, at this point, does it make” whether the attacks were premeditated?

This time, Clinton also had the benefits of missteps by Republicans — most notably remarks by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) that the committee investigation had succeeded in damaging Clinton politically. Democrats seized upon that statement as proof that the investigation was motivated by partisanship rather than getting to the bottom of what had happened in Benghazi.

Clinton has called the panel “basically an arm of the Republican National Committee,” but she did not confront her Republican questioners on that point Thursday. She mostly smiled in mute agreement when Democrats called the exercise a partisan fishing expedition or a waste of taxpayer money.

At one point, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) suggested the Obama administration tried to whitewash the terrorist origins of the attacks because it undercut the political success that Clinton and others claimed in Libya. “I’m sorry that it doesn’t fit your narrative, Congressman,” Clinton responded. “I can only tell what the facts were.”

Two of Clinton’s personal attorneys sat behind her during the hearing, underscoring the peril the Benghazi episode and the questions surrounding her e-mails pose for her. The FBI is investigating whether classified information was compromised through Clinton’s e-mail system, which operated outside the usual State Department procedures and controls.

In her testimony, Clinton said she did not have a computer in her State Department office and did little of her daily work via e-mail.

“I conducted it in meetings,” she said. “I read massive amounts of memos, a great deal of classified information. I made a lot of secure phone calls. I was in and out of the White House all the time. There were a lot of things that happened that I was aware of and that I was reacting to.”

Republicans had wanted to interview Clinton in private, leading to months of negotiations over the terms of her appearance. Her attorneys refused, saying Republicans could selectively leak damaging material from a closed-door session.

Clinton’s disciplined performance, command of facts and pure stamina may bear out her calculation that a public performance would work to her benefit, as well as remind her opponents why she is an imposing candidate.

Conservative columnist Byron York wrote in the Washington Examiner that ""a hearing billed as an epic, High Noon-style confrontation . . . instead turned out to be a somewhat interesting look at a few limited aspects of the Benghazi affair. In other words, no big deal. And that is very, very good news for Hillary Clinton.""

The day began with the panel’s chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), defending the committee’s mission and motives. Much of his opening statement was spent rebutting claims of partisan bias.

“The House of Representatives, including some Democrats, I hasten to add, asked this committee to write the final accounting of what happened in Benghazi,” Gowdy said. He said that despite seven previous inquiries, his panel was the first to interview many witnesses and the first to discover Clinton’s exclusive use of a private e-mail server for her government work.

“Not a single member of this committee signed up to investigate you or your e-mail,” he assured Clinton. “We signed up to investigate and therefore honor the lives of four people that we sent into a dangerous country to represent us, and to do everything we can to prevent it from happening to others. Our committee has interviewed half a hundred witnesses. Not a single one of them has been named Clinton until today.”

Republicans on the committee have repeatedly pressed Clinton about the special access she gave longtime friend Sidney Blumenthal, who sent reports about Libya to the private e-mail address that Clinton used for government business while she was secretary of state.

Why, the panel members asked, could a Clinton loyalist get messages to her inbox while the American ambassador in Libya had to send his concerns about security through official channels.

“Help us understand how Sidney Blumenthal had that kind of access to you, Madam Secretary, but the ambassador did not,” Gowdy said.

Clinton said that was exactly the way the system should work. She said security issues were discussed and resolved by professionals whose work she would not second-guess. She used the question of adequate security to make an impassioned case that the legacy of Benghazi should not be a retrenchment of American engagement in dangerous places.

Repeatedly, the Republicans were baited by Democrats into fights over whether the committee was a partisan tool, and whether any of them should be there at all. Just before the lunch break, Gowdy and several Democrats got into a loud argument about whether to release Blumenthal’s interview transcripts, while cameras showed Clinton shuffling papers.

“I don’t know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of the deaths of four Americans,” Clinton said to Gowdy before the intra-committee bickering began.

Democrats repeatedly charged that the majority Republicans were rehashing questions that had been answered in the many inquiries into the only death of a sitting ambassador since 1979.

The committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), claimed Republicans had focused on Clinton to the exclusion of other relevant Cabinet members, including the then-heads of the Defense Department and the CIA.

It was under sympathetic Democratic questioning that Clinton grew pensive and emotional, particularly when recalling Stevens and how he died. She called Stevens a rising star whose deep knowledge of Libya made him her choice to be ambassador. She swore him in for that post.

Clinton gave a detailed account of efforts to bring Stevens and State Department officer Sean Smith to a “safe room” inside the lightly defended diplomatic compound Stevens was visiting from his headquarters in the capital, Tripoli.

“I wanted to point out that even when we try to get it right, which we do try, sometimes there are unintended consequences, and there is an example out of this tragedy,” Clinton said. “The attackers used diesel fuel to set the compound on fire. And the safe room was anything but safe.”

The security situation in Benghazi was deteriorating rapidly over the summer of 2012, and Stevens requested additional security measures.

Many of the security requests, she said, were fulfilled. “Others weren’t.”"

Then he did something unexpected: He turned left. Paul Ryan, the young Wisconsin Republican who in minutes would accept the speaker’s gavel, walked through the Democratic side of the well. He accepted a bear hug from Rep. Gene Green (Tex.) and handshakes from Rep. John Conyers (Mich.) and a half-dozen other African American Democrats. He reached in to greet Rep. Tammy Duckworth (Ill.) in her wheelchair; shook hands with Rep. Sander Levin (Mich.), a frequent critic; and hugged Rep. John Lewis (Ga.), the civil rights icon.

""If you ever pray, pray for each other: Republicans for Democrats and Democrats for Republicans,"" Ryan told the House. To laughter, he added: ""And I don't mean pray for a conversion, all right? Pray for a deeper understanding, because when you're up here, you see it so clearly: Wherever you come from, whatever you believe, we are all in the same boat.""

There was rapt silence when, a moment later, Ryan said: ""Let's be frank. The House is broken. . . . And I am not interested in laying blame. We are not settling scores. We are wiping the slate clean.""

Just about everybody — even, after some hesitation, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) — rose and applauded.

House Speaker John Boehner's teary farewell address to lawmakers (Video: AP)

I felt goose bumps watching from the gallery, for a most unfamiliar sense of hope had admitted itself to the bitterly divided chamber. In this dark hour for the House, there was a tantalizing glimpse that the institution, which has strayed so far from what the Founders created, could heal itself. Only an ingénue would believe all will be different now. But only the most hardened cynic would dismiss the possibility of what Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), in her speech nominating Ryan, called a “fresh start.”

For a day, the ideological freak show was shut down. Only nine Republicans voted against Ryan, a far more unified showing than in January, when 25 opposed John Boehner. For the moment, the Republican speaker was overtly courting Democrats. And for once, Democrats and Republicans were rising in unison to applaud.

“How reassuring it would be,” Ryan told his colleagues, “if we actually fixed the tax code, put patients in charge of their health care, grew our economy, strengthened our military, lifted people out of poverty and paid down our debt.”

Pelosi shrugged and looked around. Finding nothing objectionable in what Ryan had said, she rose and joined in the applause.

It may not be long before Ryan winds up in the same position Boehner was for five years: forced to bring up pointless abortion bills and Obamacare repeals and otherwise placating hard-liners.

But he may be the only one who has a shot at repairing the chamber, because of his youth (he’s 45), his renown (Mitt Romney, on whose ticket Ryan ran in 2012, watched the proceedings as Ryan’s guest in the speaker’s box) and his popularity.

Pelosi, handing the gavel to Ryan, offered ""the hand of friendship"" from Democrats, and said: ""This is the speaker's house."" She corrected herself: ""This is the people's house."" But her misstatement was apt: For now, at least, this is Paul Ryan's house.

Ryan benefits from a big parting gift from Boehner, who in his final days infuriated conservatives one last time by negotiating a bipartisan deal that will postpone budget and debt-limit fights until 2017. The outgoing speaker waved a box of tissues to his chuckling colleagues before his farewell speech, and he dabbed his eyes as he pleaded for reason. ""Yes, freedom makes all things possible,"" he said, ""but patience is what makes all things real.""

Boehner was not a great speaker — he was often paralyzed by the right — but he is a good man. His parting boasts about achievements were dubious, but the emotion was real. ""I describe my life as a chase for the American Dream,"" he said, his voice breaking.

The departing speaker was still wiping his eyes when, standing in the back of the chamber, he heard Pelosi celebrate him as “the personification of the American Dream,” and Ryan accurately call him “a man of character.”

Boehner gave a final salute and walked out.

“Now I know how he felt,” Ryan said, confiding that the weight of the office makes him feel that “the moon, the stars and all the planets had fallen on me.” He suggested his colleagues should feel the weight of their offices, too.

“At bottom,” the speaker said, “we vindicate a way of life. We show by our work that free people can govern themselves.”

That proposition is now seriously in question. Let’s all — Democrats, Republicans, liberals and conservatives — pray for Ryan’s success in defending it.

In a report released Monday, the World Anti-Doping Agency called into question some results from the 2012 London Olympics and recommended that Russia’s track and field team be banned from next year’s Rio de Janeiro Games unless the country takes immediate action.

While some Russian athletes have long been suspected of doping, WADA’s report described tactics that evoked memories of the state-run East German doping program of the 1970s, with revelations of shadow laboratories, destroyed samples and surveillance of lab workers by Russian intelligence agents.

It “would be naive in the extreme to conclude that activities on the scale discovered could have occurred without the explicit or tacit approval of Russian governmental authorities,” read one section of the 323-page report by WADA’s independent commission. The London Olympics, the report added, were “sabotaged” by the presence of athletes “who should not have been competing.”

Monday’s report suggested that Russia’s doping program may be more widespread, too, saying, “There is no reason to believe that [track and field] is the only sport in Russia to have been affected.”

“It may be the residue of the old Soviet Union system,” Richard W. Pound, lead author of the report and former WADA president, said at a news conference in Geneva. The widespread corruption, Pound added, “was worse than we thought.”

Among the report’s findings:

●Grigory Rodchenko, the head of Moscow’s anti-doping lab, admitted he ordered the destruction of 1,417 test samples in order to thwart WADA’s investigation.

●Russian authorities operated a second, “shadow” laboratory on the outskirts of Moscow, with identical testing facilities as the WADA-sponsored one, in order to assist in “the cover-up of positive doping results.” According to the report, it is suspected that Russian athletes were pre-screened at the shadow lab to make sure they passed before the samples were sent on to the official one.

●While some athletes participated willingly in the doping, others who resisted “were informed they would not be considered as part of the federation’s national team for competition.” One Russian marathoner told WADA investigators she was forced to pay a percentage of her earnings to representatives of Russia’s track and field federation to help her avoid positive doping tests.

●The Russian testing lab used during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi was infiltrated by agents of the FSB, the successor to the KGB, who posed as lab engineers and who “actively imposed an atmosphere of intimidation” on the staff and “compromised” the lab’s integrity. It was part of a wider pattern of “direct intimidation and interference by the Russian state” in the anti-doping program. However, the report did not make conclusive statements regarding doping by Russian athletes in Sochi.

●The Russian sports ministry, led by sports minister Vitaly Mutko, directly instructed lab personnel to manipulate samples. In his news conference in Geneva, Pound said Mutko “knew what was going on.”

Mutko, in an interview aired on Russian television, denied wrongdoing and said the WADA commission’s report relies on “unverified sources, on unverified facts.” He added, “These are all conjectures.” Mutko also accused Pound of overstepping the commission’s authority by “evaluating the entire system of doping in Russia.”

“This was an absolutely politically motivated statement like anti-Russian sanctions,” Vladimir Uyba, the head of Russia’s Federal Medical-Biological Agency, told the Interfax news agency. “It has no grounds whatsoever.”

Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, accused Russia of an “effort to take over sport through unlawful means.” Monday’s report, Tygart said in a statement, “sends a clear message to Russia that they will not be allowed to cheat the world’s athletes and escape justice behind a wall of deception and lies. If Russia has created an organized scheme of state-supported doping, then they have no business being allowed to compete on the world stage.”

Although the report stopped short of recommending an outright ban of Russia’s track and field team from the 2016 Rio Games — a threat Pound equated to a “nuclear weapon” — it called for an immediate suspension of the team, with the understanding the suspension could be lifted in time for the Olympics if Russia complied.

“For 2016, our recommendation is that the Russian federation be suspended,” Pound said in Geneva. “If they don’t [comply], then it has to play itself out. The outcome may be that there are no track and field athletes at Rio.”

Russia won a total of 81 medals at the London Games — third-most among all countries — including 18 in track and field. A year later, it led all nations with seven gold medals at the 2013 World Track and Field Championships — the same year in which WADA reported that Russian athletes accounted for 225 doping violations, the most in the world, including 42 violations in track and field.

The report recommended lifetime bans for five Russian coaches and five athletes — including Mariya Savinova and Ekaterina Poistogova, the gold and bronze medalists from the women’s 800 meters at the London Games, respectively. The IAAF could strip the implicated Russian athletes of their medals in the coming months.

American Alysia Montaño, who finished fifth in the 800 meters at London — bumped off the medal stand by the two now-tainted Russians — said the prospect of receiving the bronze medal she was denied in London has left her with a mixture of relief, joy, frustration and sadness.

“It’s actually incredibly painful just to think about that moment, those moments lost,” Montaño said in a telephone interview. “I can’t get that back. Of course I want what’s mine. At the same time, it’s incredibly saddening.”

Russia is in the midst of a period of sustained visibility within international sports, having hosted the aforementioned 2013 World Track and Field championships in Moscow and 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, as well as the 2015 FINA World Aquatic Championships in Kazan.

In 2018, Russia will host the coveted FIFA World Cup, winning a closely watched bid process that has come under scrutiny in recent months amid a widespread corruption scandal within FIFA. Mutko, the Russian sports minister accused in Monday’s WADA report of ordering lab personnel to manipulate test samples, is also a member of FIFA’s executive committee and the head of the 2018 World Cup organizing committee.

“The credibility of sport has taken some body blows over the last few months,” Pound said Monday. “The public view will move towards believing all sport is corrupt. If you can’t believe results, then there is a serious credibility problem. I hope all sports will look at their governance and their anti-doping systems, because their existence may be at risk.”

The IAAF itself was implicated in the report, along with the Russians, for what its authors called a “collective and inexplicable laissez-faire policy” toward pursuing doping suspicions. The report’s findings have spurred at least two criminal inquiries. French authorities said they are investigating Lamine Diack, the Senagalese former head of the IAAF, track and field’s governing body, for allegedly accepting bribes that allowed tainted Russian athletes to compete, while Interpol said Monday that it had opened a global investigation into doping allegations in Russia and beyond.

Britain’s Sebastian Coe, a former Olympic gold medalist and now the president of the IAAF, said in a statement that he had “taken the urgent step of seeking approval from his fellow IAAF Council Members to consider sanctions against” the Russian federation. The IAAF, Coe told reporters, has given the Russian federation until the end of the week to respond to the allegations

Monday’s report credited German television station ARD with spurring the WADA investigation by airing a documentary, “Top Secret Doping: How Russia Makes Its Winners,” in December 2014.

The WADA commission launched almost immediately, and according to its report Monday, so did Russia’s cover-up: The destruction of the 1,417 test samples, allegedly ordered by Rodchenko, the Russian anti-doping head, occurred in December, three days before WADA investigators were due to visit the lab"

Republican Matt Bevin won a big upset in the Kentucky governor’s race. The guy who Mitch McConnell crushed by 25 points in a 2014 primary will now become just the second Republican to govern the Bluegrass State in four decades. The guy who Mitch McConnell crushed by 25 points in a 2014 primary will now become just the second Republican to govern the Bluegrass State in four decades.

Democrats failed to pick up Virginia’s state Senate. It’s It’s a huge blow to Gov. Terry McAuliffe , who went all-in to make it happen. Democrats could have won by capturing just one seat because of the tie-breaking authority of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D). But Republicans held every single seat.

Houston’s Equal Rights Ordinance, designed to protect the rights of gay citizens and others, failed by a wide margin.

Ohio rejected marijuana legalization by a two-to-one margin.

Even in San Francisco, the sheriff who steadfastly defended the city’s “sanctuary city” policy went down. Fox News : “Ross Mirkarimi and his office received heavy criticism after Mexican illegal immigrant Francisco Sanchez allegedly shot and killed 32-year-old Kate Steinle on San Francisco’s waterfront July 1. Sanchez had been released from Mirkarimi’s jail in March even though federal immigration officials had requested that he be detained for possible deportation.” The city also rejected new regulations on Airbnb. [Sign up to receive The Daily 202 delivered directly to your e-mail inbox] The Kentucky surprise is the biggest story of the night. Here are eight takeaways from Bevin’s blowout in the Bluegrass State: –2015 really is the Year of the Outsider. Democratic Governors Association executive director Elisabeth Pearson chalked up Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway’s defeat to “Trump-mania” in a press release: “Jack Conway ran a strong campaign … Unfortunately, he ran into the unexpected headwinds of Trump-mania, losing to an outsider candidate in the Year of the Outsider.”

–Focusing on social issues, including promises to defund Planned Parenthood and defend Kim Davis, helped drive the conservative base to turn out. I wrote here Monday about Bevin’s focus on energizing evangelicals in the final days, and it clearly paid off. Kim Davis called herself “ecstatic” about Bevin’s victory in a statement released by the nonprofit representing her: “He is such a genuine and caring person. I will be forever thankful that he came to visit me while I was in jail. At a clerks’ meeting he hugged me and said he was praying for me. I am looking forward to his leadership as our new Governor.”

–The South is becoming even redder, and the realignment that began a half century ago is nearly complete. President Obama is toxic, even in non-federal elections. Mississippi Republican Gov. Phil Bryant easily won reelection, too, and the GOP increased its majority in that state’s House from 67 to 73 (of 122 members). That’s nearly a super majority. Republicans even toppled the House Minority Leader, per the Clarion Ledger.

–Pressure will let up a little bit on Rand Paul to drop out of the presidential race to focus on his 2016 Senate reelection campaign. The incumbent state auditor, Adam Edelen, who national Democrats hoped would challenge Paul in next year’s Senate race lost in a stunning upset, David Weigel and Paul Kane note in a smart take. “What this election shows is that people who’ve been promoting Democrats on the rise in Kentucky have been completely wrong,” Paul told The Post last night. “Not only has President Obama destroyed the party in Kentucky, he’s destroyed the bench. The bench that was supposed to rise up and run for office — that’s gone.”

Paul celebrated Bevin’s win, even though Bevin had said during the campaign Ben Carson is his favorite candidate in the presidential race…

–The Republican win is another big nail in the coffin for big labor unions in the South. Bevin’s top economic priority is making Kentucky a Right To Work state.

–Bevin will be a bull in the china shop, but he is unlikely to govern as radically as many of the stories you’ll read today suggest. I’ve spent more than 24 hours with the governor-elect going back to January 2014, when I profiled him for Politico. Bevin is certainly an ideologue, but I’ve seen him show signs of a profound pragmatic streak. He told me last week that he’ll lead in the tradition of a former KFC CEO, a moderate Democrat, who was not beholden to anyone and cleaned up state government in the ’70’s. His efforts to make nice with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who attacked him fiercely last year, show that he’s capable of becoming a serious politician.

–There should be more soul searching among pollsters, who once again got it wrong. Every survey of Kentucky showed Conway ahead, which meaningfully altered perceptions of the race.

— But, but, but: Turnout was VERY low across the country. Republicans could over interpret the results at their own peril. The presidential election, exactly one year way, will have dramatically larger and more diverse turnout, which works against the GOP. Serious structural problems persist: the Grand Old Party is still too white, too male and too old. Hillary Clinton’s political director, Amanda Renteria, tweeted a photo of a “Vote Here” sign overnight and wrote: “Wish more people did this today.”

There were also some bright spots for the left on an otherwise dark night:

–In a stinging rebuke of Chris Christie, undercutting one of his rationales for seeking the presidency, New Jersey voters ousted at least three Republicans from the state Assembly. Alexander Burns in the New York Times: “Republicans had hoped to build on Mr. Christie’s political successes and cut into the Democratic majority in the chamber, where Democrats currently hold 48 of the 80 seats. Instead, the election became a sharp reality check for allies of the governor, who only two years ago won re-election by a towering margin. Democrats battered Republicans for their affiliation with Mr. Christie, sending paid political mail accusing them of aiding the governor’s presidential ambitions at their constituents’ expense. Perhaps mindful of his diminished popularity, Mr. Christie appeared at private events to raise money for Republican candidates, but he never hit the campaign trail as a public spokesman for his party.” Dems now have their biggest majority since the 1970’s.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

— The Supreme Court halted a Missouri execution in the 11th hour. Mark Berman: “Ernest Lee Johnson was sentenced to death for killing three people with a claw hammer in 1994. Johnson’s attorneys wrote in filings asking the Supreme Court to stay the execution that Johnson had brain surgery in 2008 to remove a tumor, but that part of the tumor could not be removed. He is missing between 15 and 20 percent of his brain, the attorneys wrote. As a result, Johnson has brain damage and a doctor cited as a medical expert believes he could suffer seizures due to the lethal injection. The office of Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster argued in court filings that the execution should proceed, writing that Johnson waited too long to make his argument. In an unsigned order, the justices said they were granting the stay request pending an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit.”

— Bill Simon, one of Jeb Bush’s most prominent boosters, is okay after parachuting out of his crashing private airplane. The former U.S. CEO of WalMart crash-landed the single-engine plane in Fayetteville, Arkansas. “The Fayetteville police reported that the plane experienced oil pressure problems during its flight from Bentonville to Waco, Texas,” per NBC. “The plane hit a truck that was traveling on the road. The plane’s passengers (there were two others onboard) and the truck driver were transported to a local hospital with minor injuries.” Simon texts our Ed O’Keefe: “We were all very fortunate.”

WAPO HIGHLIGHTS:

— “Uneven Justice,” by Marc Fisher, Scott Higham and Derek Hawkins: “Two bad shootings, two guilty cops. One family sues and gets a million dollars; the other sues and collects not a penny. … Though the spread of smartphone cameras has turned police-civilian confrontations into fodder for popular analysis, society remains reluctant to send police officers to prison for killing people. For the grieving families of the victims, civil lawsuits have proven far more likely to produce results. But the system dispenses uneven justice. As part of a year-long investigation of fatal shootings by police, The Washington Post examined the cases of 59 officers who were charged over the past decade for fatally shooting someone while on duty, allegedly crossing the line between enforcing the law and breaking it.”

In criminal court, 11 of the officers were convicted and served time.

But when 46 families of those shot and killed by police sought justice in the civil system, 32 received monetary awards. Settlements ranged from $7,500 to $8.5 million. The median settlement was $1.2 million. Seven families have not filed suit.

When officers were criminally convicted, families won settlements in all but one case, The Post found. But when the officers were acquitted or had criminal charges dismissed, families were just as likely to win civil settlements.

The review also found that families collected more money if they settled before the criminal cases were resolved. When families accepted settlements before criminal charges were resolved, they received a median award of $2.2 million. When the settlement came after criminal proceedings ended, the families received $500,000.

— “The Republican field has a new target: Marco Rubio,” by Jenna Johnson and Sean Sullivan: “The freshman Florida senator has seen small but steady gains in the polls, attention from major donors and a growing collection of endorsements, especially after a well-received performance in last week’s GOP debate. That has quickly made him a prime target for criticism from his rivals, especially Trump and Bush.

Trump called Rubio ‘overrated,’ accused him of being ‘a disaster with his credit cards’ and attacked him as ‘very weak’ on immigration. “During a news conference Tuesday in Manhattan called Rubio ‘overrated,’ accused him of being ‘a disaster with his credit cards’ and attacked him as ‘very weak’ on immigration.

“At the same time, Bush — whose campaign has disparagingly labeled Rubio as a ‘GOP Obama’ — doubled down on criticizing Rubio for missing more than a third of his Senate votes this year. ‘People that are serving need to show up and work,’ Bush said on CNN. ‘Period. Over and out.'”

Jeb got just 7 percent of Florida GOP primary voters in a new poll , 30 points behind Trump and less than half of Rubio’s support.

“For months, Rubio has avoided direct confrontations with his rivals. His top aides have long worried about peaking too early, preferring to crest just before the first nominating contest on Feb. 1 in Iowa. The latest attacks bring a new level of attention and scrutiny to the 44-year–old senator’s below-the-radar campaign that could throw off his timeline.”

— The Tampa Bay Times looks back on Rubio’s lavish spending with a GOP credit card, noting that some transactions remain secret. Marco’s murky financial history while holding political office emerged when he was a Senate candidate in 2010, but questions still remain about his spending over a two-year period when he was a member of the Florida House. Rubio’s campaign has yet to release those records, despite multiple requests from the Tampa Bay Times. Some of the transactions Rubio made with a GOP credit card, as noted by reporter Alex Leary:

Big picture: This will become a problem for Rubio. The question is A) when? and B) how big? While it may seem like old news to those of us who covered his 2010 race or know Florida, it’s certainly new information to 99.9 percent of Iowans. And it is easy to imagine pretty brutal TV ads using some of the spending as fodder, especially if connected to the broader frame that Rubio is bad at managing money.

GOOD READS FROM ELSEWHERE:

— Pew Research Center study finds “U.S. Public Becoming Less Religious”: “An extensive new survey of more than 35,000 U.S. adults finds that the percentages who say they believe in God, pray daily and regularly go to church or other religious services all have declined modestly in recent years. The recent decrease in religious beliefs and behaviors is largely attributable to the ‘nones’ – the growing minority of Americans, particularly in the Millennial generation, who say they do not belong to any organized faith.”

“The share of U.S. adults who say they believe in God, while still remarkably high by comparison with other advanced industrial countries, has declined modestly, from approximately 92% (in 2007) to 89%.”

A growing share of Americans are religiously unaffiliated, including some who self-identify as atheists or agnostics as well as many who describe their religion as “nothing in particular.” Altogether, the religiously unaffiliated (also called the “nones”) now account for 23% of the adult population, up from 16% in 2007.

Fewer people say their religion is “very important” to them. And, in 2007, 71% said they were “absolutely certain” that God exists. That’s dropped to 63 percent now.

— New York Times, “Neuropolitics, where campaigns try to read your mind,” by Kevin Randall:

“In the lobby of a Mexico City office building, people scurrying to and fro gazed briefly at the digital billboard backing a candidate for Congress in June. They probably did not know that the sign was reading them, too. Inside the ad, a camera captured their facial expressions and fed them through an algorithm, reading emotional reactions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. With all the unwitting feedback, the campaign could then tweak the message — the images, sounds or words — to come up with a version that voters might like better. All over the world, political campaigns are seeking voter data and insights that will propel them to victory. Now, in an increasing number of places, that includes the contentious field known as neuromarketing — or in this case, neuropolitics. Technologies like facial coding, biofeedback and brain imaging have long been used by companies in the hope of pushing the boundaries of marketing and product development. But their use by political parties and governments is a growing phenomenon, evoking futuristic scenes from the movie ‘Minority Report,’ in which eerily well-informed billboards scan commuters’ eyes and call out to them by name.”

— Yahoo, “Being married to Bernie,” by Lisa Belkin: Bernie Sanders was the only one on stage at the last Democratic debate who didn’t give a bio of any kind in his opening statement. “He started right in with the ‘series of unprecedented national crises’ that prompted his candidacy, and he never spoke of his 27-year marriage, nor the blended group of five children he and his wife consider theirs. Sitting in the audience with two of those children, Jane O’Meara Driscoll Sanders was not the least bit surprised. Accomplished in her own right — she is, among other things, a former president of a Vermont college — she is the people person to his curmudgeon, the one who lives on the ground while he lives in his head. … She remains his closest adviser, and part of her advice, on debate night as always, was that he stay focused on why he decided to run this race in the first place.

Telling quote from his wife that suggests Bernie is not in this to actually win: “He’s doing what he aimed to do… The last election the candidates didn’t talk about inequality, they didn’t talk about fairness, they didn’t talk about climate change. He’s setting the agenda. That’s what it’s about.”

— The Atlantic, “Can Washington’s most interesting egghead save the Senate?” by Molly Ball: Ben Sasse has been quiet for the first year in the Senate, but now that he’s voiced his opinion, he does not plan on letting up. He gave his maiden floor speech yesterday. “I’m a historian by training,” Sasse explained. Until a few decades ago, he said, it was traditional for new senators to wait a year to speak. That that’s no longer the case, he suspects, speaks to the pathology of the modern Senate, where lawmakers deliver stale talking points for the benefit of the C-SPAN2 cameras, often with nobody else in attendance. … “I ask if he’s been biting his tongue all year, listening to speeches without giving any of his own. ‘Oh, for heaven’s sake,’ he says. Since he is 99th in seniority, he’s often tasked with presiding over the floor, which in practice means hoping the C-SPAN2 cameras don’t catch him munching on chocolate-covered pretzels while another senator drones away in the otherwise empty chamber. ‘I sit in this chair all the time, and it just feels like Charlie Brown’s mom talking all the time,’ he says.”

McConnell praised Sasse for being the last of the freshmen to speak:

HOT ON THE LEFT

FBI agent guilty of assault in an incident caught in cellphone video remains on duty. From Dan Morse: “The cellphone video — which would be played repeatedly for jurors — showed a rapidly deteriorating situation outside a high-rise apartment building in Chevy Chase, Md. In the middle of the turmoil was FBI agent Gerald Rogero. He was off duty at the time, wearing civilian clothes, and had just struck a teenager in the chest, sending him backward onto the pavement. The teen got to his feet. Rogero moved to place him under arrest. ‘If I have to shoot you, I will,’ he said. ‘Don’t make me shoot you.’ The video and the audio that went with it were at the heart of the prosecution of Rogero, 46, an agent for nearly 20 years who serves as a chief in the FBI’s counterterrorism division.” He was found guilty last week of second-degree assault. An FBI spokesman confirmed Tuesday that Rogero remains on active duty and said that the bureau is conducting an internal review.

http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/05/politics/bush-biography-nyt/index.html",0,"It’s long been a mystery what President George H.W. Bush thought of President George W. Bush’s response to the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent invasion of Iraq. Bush 41, of course, had stopped short of ousting Saddam Hussein in the Persian Gulf War; Bush 43 had gone ahead and done just that. But what was said behind closed doors in Crawford or Kennebunkport?

In his book about his father, published last year, the younger former president said he made his decisions on his own.

“I never asked Dad what I should do,” he wrote in “41: A Portrait of My Father.” “We both knew that this was a decision that only the president can make. We did talk about the issue, however. Over Christmas 2002, at Camp David, I gave Dad an update on our strategy.”

H.W.’s response? “You know how tough war is, son, and you’ve got to try everything you can to avoid war,” he said. “But if the man won’t comply, you don’t have any other choice.”

But now, a new biography of Bush 41 reports that he had a lot more on his mind, perhaps left unsaid.

Jon Meacham’s “Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush,” due out later this month, offers the nonagenarian’s candid, critical comments about his son’s closest advisers, including former vice president Dick Cheney and secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld, according to news reports prior to its formal release.

Bush Sr.’s toughest talk was reserved for Rumsfeld, whom he called “an arrogant fellow.”

“I think he served the president badly,” Bush told Meacham, Peter Baker of the New York Times reported, quoting the book. He added: “I’ve never been that close to him anyway. … There’s a lack of humility, a lack of seeing what the other guy thinks. He’s more kick ass and take names, take numbers. I think he paid a price for that.” (Rumsfeld resigned as secretary of defense in 2006 after conditions in Iraq deteriorated. He declined comment about the biography to Fox News.)

Bush also said Cheney as vice president was very different from Secretary of Defense Cheney. Cheney served under Bush 41 for four years, including during Operation Desert Storm.

“He just became very hard-line and very different from the Dick Cheney I knew and worked with,” Bush reportedly told Meacham, speculating that 9/11 had affected Cheney’s views. “Just iron-ass. His seeming knuckling under to the real hard-charging guys who want to fight about everything, use force to get our way in the Middle East.”

Bush said Cheney, pushed to be more conservative by his wife and daughter, “had his own empire and marched to his own drummer.” Whose fault was this?

Bush 43’s, Bush 41 said.

The National Archives released photos showing former president George W. Bush and former vice president Dick Cheney after the attacks of September 11, 2001. (Video: Reuters)

“The big mistake that was made was letting Cheney bring in kind of his own State Department,” Bush told Meacham. “… But it’s not Cheney’s fault. It’s the president’s fault.” He added: “The buck stops there.”

Bush 43 stands by both Cheney and Rumsfeld, despite his father’s criticism.

“I am proud to have served with Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld. Dick Cheney did a superb job as Vice President, and I was fortunate to have him by my side throughout my presidency,” Bush 43 said in a statement released Thursday morning. “Don Rumsfeld ably led the Pentagon and was an effective Secretary of Defense. I am grateful to both men for their good advice, selfless service to our country, and friendship.”

In the biography, Bush Sr. also took a dim view of some of his son’s talking points.

Share this article Share

“I do worry about some of the rhetoric that was out there — some of it his, maybe, and some of it the people around him,” Bush said. “Hot rhetoric is pretty easy to get headlines, but it doesn’t necessarily solve the diplomatic problem.”

So: What did the son think of the broadside? The biography’s author asked him.

“It is true that my rhetoric could get pretty strong and that may have bothered some people,” he told Meacham. “Obviously it did, including Dad, though he never mentioned it.”

Bush 43 added that his father wouldn’t give him such explicit advice.

Bush 41 “would never say to me, ‘Hey, you need to rein in Cheney,'” George W. Bush said. “‘He’s ruining your administration.’ It would be out of character for him to do that. And in any event, I disagree with his characterization of what was going on. I made the decisions. This was my philosophy.”

Cheney, meanwhile, seemed tickled by Bush 41’s view of him as an “iron-ass.”

“I took it as a mark of pride,” Cheney told Fox News. “The attack on 9/11 was worse than Pearl Harbor, in terms of the number of people killed, and the amount of damage done. I think a lot of people believed then, and still believe to this day that I was aggressive in defending, in carrying out what I thought were the right policies.”

Cheney also said his family’s influence on his notions of national security was debatable.

“We smile about it, we laugh about it,” Cheney said of Bush 41’s views. “Same with my daughter, with Liz. It’s his view, perhaps, of what happened, but my family was not conspiring to somehow turn me into a tougher, more hardnosed individual. I got there all by myself.”

Bush 41’s critical comments about Bush 43 should not be interpreted as a lack of support, the former president told his biographer.

“He’s my son, he did his best and I’m for him,” Bush said. “It’s that simple an equation.”

Meacham, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of many presidential biographies and sometime Washington Post contributor, said Bush 41 was trying to clarify his views for history.

“He likes Cheney, respects him, but he clearly believed and wanted the historical record to reflect that he had objections to how Cheney had conducted his vice presidency,” he told Fox. “… President Bush 41 believed that Cheney embodied an image of the 43 administration that was in some ways counterproductive around the world.”

Partly based on Bush 41’s diaries, “Destiny and Power” also includes Bush’s revelation that he contemplated not running for president again in 1992 and juicy nuggets about White House rivalries (“Nancy does not like Barbara”).

“The diary’s fascinating, because you can see how he felt at various key moments of his life,” Cheney said. “So I’m enjoying the book. I recommend it to my friends. And proud to be a part of it.”"

The two-hour debate spotlighted the rift between the outsider candidates and establishment governors over how strictly to enforce immigration laws and whether to provide a pathway to legal status for the country’s more than 11 million undocumented immigrants or deport them.

It also revived a long-simmering dispute over the size and role of the U.S. military, with Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) warning of the potential adverse fiscal effects of increased defense spending and Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Ted Cruz (Tex.) advocating a more muscular American military presence in the world.

Overall, however, it was a relatively cerebral affair. In a marked departure from the three previous debates, Tuesday’s questions prodded the candidates to explain their positions on such substantive issues as tax policy, the minimum wage and trade treaties, rather than draw contrasts with one another.

Little attention was paid to the personal attacks that have shaped the race in recent weeks. On the campaign trail, billionaire Donald Trump has harshly assailed Ben Carson as the retired neurosurgeon rose in the polls, but Trump refrained from hitting his fellow front-runner on the debate stage.

The top quotes from the fourth GOP presidential debate + 10 Eight Republican candidates faced off in Milwaukee.

Similarly, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, whose attack on Rubio backfired at the Oct. 28 debate, did not strike his onetime protege on Tuesday night. Instead, he focused his rhetoric on President Obama and Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton, delivering a few punchy answers in a performance that was not dominant but was more energetic than his earlier lackluster showings.

A lengthy discussion of immigration stood out as a proxy for a debate over how Republicans can win back the White House after eight years in the wilderness: under the banner of pure and principled conservatism, or with a moderated platform designed to broaden the GOP’s appeal to Latinos and other minorities.

Trump forcefully defended the controversial proposal that has ­fueled his candidacy since summer, in which he would deport all undocumented immigrants and construct a wall along the border with Mexico to keep them out.

“We are a country of laws, we need borders, we will have a wall, the wall will be built, the wall will be successful, and if you think walls don’t work, all you have to do is ask Israel,” said the former reality-television star. “The wall will work, properly done. Believe me.”

That drew a quick retort from Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who had been spoiling for a fight and repeatedly interrupted the questioning of other candidates to give his opinions.

“For the 11 million people, come on, folks, we all know we can’t pick them up and ship them across the border,” Kasich said. “It’s a silly argument. It’s not an adult argument.”

Trump then interjected with a taunt at Bush: “You should let Jeb speak.”

And the former Florida governor did just that, arguing that deporting illegal immigrants is in conflict with American values and would tear families and communities apart. Bush warned of the electoral consequences should the GOP nominee campaign with Trump’s position.

“They’re doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this,” Bush said. “That’s the problem with this. We have to win the presidency, and the way you win the presidency is to have practical plans.”

Soon after, Brian Fallon, a Clinton campaign spokesman, tweeted, ""We actually are doing high-fives right now.""

Cruz, however, sided with Trump. “If Republicans join Democrats as the party of amnesty, we will lose,” the senator from Texas said.

Cruz said that for many voters, illegal immigration is “a very personal economic issue,” and he added: “We’re tired of being told it’s ‘anti-immigrant.’ It’s offensive. I am the son of an immigrant who came legally from Cuba to seek the American Dream, and we can embrace legal immigration while believing in the rule of law.”

Tuesday’s debate, the fourth so far in the Republican race, was hosted by Fox Business Network and the Wall Street Journal before a live audience at a historic theater in downtown Milwaukee.

There were eight candidates in the main debate — the smallest group to share the big stage so far — as national polling averages winnowed the top tier. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee were relegated for the first time to an earlier undercard debate, where both faced sharp attacks from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal over their records on fiscal policy and other issues.

For the moderators, the event brought added scrutiny in the wake of the Oct. 28 debate in Boulder, Colo., which was a chaotic affair. CNBC’s moderators were sharply criticized for the tone and personal nature of their questioning, and the candidates felt they were being baited to attack one another rather than asked about substance.

From the outset of Tuesday night’s debate, the moderators sought to set a different tone. Co-moderator Neil Cavuto said the focus of the debate would be “the economy and what each of you would do to improve it. No more, no less.”

The first questions were about Democratic proposals to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. There are varying views within the Republican Party about the minimum wage, with 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney among those supporting an increase, which polls show is widely popular.

But Trump and Carson said they would not raise it, arguing an increase would inhibit job growth.

“Taxes too high; wages too high,” Trump said. “We’re not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum.”

Carson said, “Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases,” especially among black people. He said the better question is: “How do we allow people to ascend the ladder of opportunity rather than how do we give them everything and keep them dependent?”

Kasich, who has raised the minimum wage in Ohio, took a more moderate approach. “Economic theory is fine,” he said, “but you know what? People need help.”

Later in the evening, an extended series of questions about the candidates’ tax plans sparked a fight between Rubio and Paul over the size of the military and defense budget.

“I know Rand is a committed isolationist. I’m not,” Rubio said, earning loud cheers from the crowd. “. . . I know that the world is a safer and better place when America is the strongest military power in the world.”

Advertisement

Paul persisted, warning that the country could ill afford to spend more money on the military: “I want a strong national defense. But I don’t want us to be bankrupt.”

Cruz interjected, siding with Rubio: “You think defending this nation is expensive? Try not defending it. That’s a lot more expensive.”

Former business executive Carly Fiorina also delivered tough lines about the military and the United States’ role in Syria, but she also accused Trump of bluster when he talked about his past associations with Russian President Vladi­mir Putin.

At one point, Trump snapped: “Why does she keep interrupting everybody?”

The crowd booed loudly, but unlike in previous debates, Fiorina did not respond to Trump.

Meanwhile, Carson — who has built a powerful following among grass-roots conservatives with his soft-spoken approach — faced virtually no scrutiny from the moderators or fellow candidates over the veracity of his personal narrative, which has been the subject of recent media investigations.

When Cavuto asked Carson whether the scrutiny was engulfing his campaign, Carson seemed pleased to have the chance to clear the air.

“Thank you for not asking me what I said in the 10th grade,” Carson said. “We should vet all candidates. I have no problem with being vetted. What I do have a problem with is being lied about and then putting that out there as truth.”"

The calls for a crackdown came as French prosecutors confirmed Thursday that the accused ringleader of the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris was killed in a massive pre-dawn police raid Wednesday. The death of Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian militant of Moroccan descent, did little to calm European unease about the specter of more attacks.

In Italy, officials said the FBI had warned of a specific threat in Vatican City, Rome and Milan.

In an ominous address — echoing the debate in the U.S. Congress after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks — French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said authorities must imagine that the grimmest threats are possible.

In five attacks from 2012 to 2015, alleged attackers were homegrown and ideologically motivated. (Video: The Washington Post)

“We know and bear in mind that there is also a risk of chemical or biological weapons,” Valls told Parliament during debate on extending the country’s state of emergency. The temporary measure was enacted immediately after the deadly multi-pronged attacks on Paris that killed at least 129 people and wounded more than 350.

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve warned that now “it is necessary to move fast and hard.”

He said that “all Europe must work together to defeat terrorism” and called for an emergency meeting of the continent’s interior ministers Friday.

Some European leaders seemed prepared to sweep aside cherished traditions that protect rights to privacy and civil liberties.

In Belgium, Prime Minister Charles Michel pressed Parliament to pass tough measures to imprison citizens returning home from fighting in Syria and to broaden law enforcement’s ability to tap phones and detain suspects for three days without charges. He called for shutting down Web sites that advocate for jihad, or Islamic holy war.

The moves came as fears ratcheted up across Europe of more hidden terrorist cells preparing similar strikes.

Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said Italian security forces were “working to identify five people” who may be planning attacks on St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City, Milan’s Duomo or the La Scala opera house.

The U.S. State Department issued a travel warning to American citizens visiting Italy, calling those landmarks “potential targets” but also flagging possible threats to “churches, synagogues, restaurants, theaters and hotels” in Rome and Milan.

Gentiloni told the Italian state television network RAI that the FBI provided information about the five possible suspects.

The three-month extension of emergency laws would grant the French government powers to conduct stops and searches, ban large gatherings in public places, and put suspected extremists under house arrest.

The measure, approved in the National Assembly on Thursday, now goes to the French Senate for expected final backing Friday.

In Belgium, police searched at least eight homes in connection with Bilal Hadfi, 20, one of the suicide bombers in the Paris attacks, and Salah Abdeslam, 26, a fugitive believed to have been involved in the attacks but who slipped away amid the chaos.

Nine people were arrested, including friends and family of Hadfi, who blew himself up outside the Stade de France north of Paris during a soccer match between France and Germany. He and six other assailants died in the series of attacks on multiple targets, which also included the Bataclan concert hall and several restaurants and bars.

Michel, the Belgian prime minister, asked Parliament for new measures that would require immediate jailing for citizens returning from presumed militant activity in Syria, where the Islamic State has some of its main strongholds. Under the request, those on terrorist watch lists — about 800 residents in Belgium currently — would be forced to wear ankle bracelets to track their movements.

Further proposed measures called for the deployment of 300 troops and more leeway in conducting house raids. Michel also called for stronger border controls — an appeal that highlights wider debates across the European Union on how to reconcile its policies of control-free travel with demands to combat the Islamic State and other militant factions.

Some of the proposed rules, including mandatory registration of all passengers boarding high-speed trains and planes, would affect a significant portion of the population.

Share this article Share

In Brussels, a top magistrate, Karel Van Cauwenberge, said he was concerned that the new measures could be abused by law enforcement. “I understand in the fight against terrorism, people want to go far, but we still have to be cautious,” he said. “Depriving people of their freedom for three days is extreme.”

The E.U. planned an extraordinary meeting Friday to focus on how to stem the traffic in firearms, much of it coming from the formerly ­conflict-ridden Balkans, and on setting common standards for deactivating old guns.

E.U. officials will also discuss ways to enable border police to check passports against a police database. Another issue for the bloc is whether to allow security services to have access to passenger lists, as they do in the United States.

In Germany, where the threat of a terrorist attack forced the cancellation of an international soccer match Tuesday, politicians studied plans to deploy the army to aid the police and protect possible terrorist targets, including train stations and stadiums. The proposal was dividing the German government.

The police raid Wednesday north of Paris was in part a response to what French officials thought was a plan to stage a follow-up terrorist attack in La Defense, a financial district northwest of Paris, two police officials and an investigator close to the probe said. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief members of the media.

President Obama, during a ­visit to the Philippines, spoke by phone with French President François Hollande, the White House said. The two leaders plan to meet next week in Washington to review strategies against the Islamic State.

http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/20/africa/mali-shooting/index.html",0,"Several gunmen seized a luxury hotel in Mali's capital on Friday, killing at least 20 people in an attack that raised fresh concerns about security in a country that has battled Islamist insurgents for years. Even after a multinational campaign to defeat them, militants have proved capable of targeting prominent locations like the city’s Radisson Blu Hotel, where the seven-hour standoff took place.

Security forces swept through the Radisson on Friday afternoon, freeing the last hostages and pursuing the gunmen, who had charged through the hotel yelling “Allahu akbar!” — or “God is great!” As the troops cleared the hotel, they found the floors littered with the bodies of Malians and foreign visitors, including a Belgian government official.

The State Department said a U.S. citizen was among the dead. A department spokesman had reported earlier that no Americans were killed or injured.

An al-Qaeda affiliate based in Africa claimed Friday’s attack. It was the latest in a year of deadly Islamist-led assaults across sub-Saharan Africa, where a patchwork of conflicts has sometimes been overshadowed by Islamic State violence in other parts of the world. From al-Shabab in Somalia to Boko Haram in Nigeria, the continent is host to a profusion of violent extremist groups, with a range of local and transnational goals, seeking to execute large-scale attacks against civilians.

In Mali, Friday’s attack underscored how vulnerable the West African country remains, even after French forces and a small number of U.S. troops helped unseat Islamists from their northern stronghold in 2013. Before that campaign, militants appeared to be gaining ground, moving closer to the capital, seizing on the chaos caused by a 2012 military coup. The current government still has only tenuous influence in parts of the country, and the remaining French forces in particular are considered targets.

The gunmen stormed the hotel early Friday, sending some of the 170 guests and staff members fleeing in panic and prompting others to seek hiding places. One witness said the attackers freed some captives who were able to recite verses from the Koran. By late Friday afternoon, Mali’s security minister, Col. Salif Traore, said the remaining hostages were safe.

At least 20 people were killed, Traore said. The Reuters news agency, citing U.N. officials, said at least 27 bodies were seen. Authorities worked through the evening to identify the dead.

Three U.N. staff members in the hotel during the attack were safely evacuated, said Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. U.N. peacekeepers helped secure the perimeter and provided medical aid and forensics assistance, Dujarric said.

The United Nations has envoys in Bamako as part of Mali’s reconciliation efforts — what has become the deadliest peacekeeping mission of the past three years, with 53 U.N. peacekeepers killed since 2013.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said three Chinese nationals were among the dead and four were rescued.

Meanwhile, security forces tried to pin down the attackers in the heart of Bamako. Officials said that four gunmen were holed up Friday night in a hotel room but that there were no hostages with them.

A group affiliated with al-Qaeda, al-Mourabitoun, said its followers were behind the attack — similar to a smaller assault on a hotel in August that was claimed by the same group. Mali has faced repeated attacks from insurgents linked to al-Qaeda and other factions, but the Islamic State does not have major footholds in the region.

One Senegalese guest, Aissatou Gueye, was in her room when the attackers entered. Like many other guests, she was there to attend a large mining conference. “They were asking people to recite the Koran, and if they do, nothing will happen to them,” she said outside the hotel. Gueye saw one person shot dead before she ran to safety.

About a dozen Americans were rescued from the hotel, including several employees of the U.S. Embassy in Bamako, said State Department spokesman John Kirby.

The American victim was identified by her family as Anita Datar, an international development worker from Takoma Park, Md. The U.S. ambassador to Mali called the family late Friday afternoon to inform them, Datar's mother said. Datar, the mother of a young son, worked for Palladium, an international development firm with offices in Washington.

A member of a U.S. Special Operations unit helped to escort guests evacuated from the hotel, the Pentagon said. About 22 U.S. Defense Department personnel were in Bamako when the hotel was attacked.

President Obama, speaking to business leaders at a summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, expressed condolences to the people of Mali. “Mali security forces and our own diplomatic and security agencies rushed in to save lives,” Obama said. “This barbarity only stiffens our resolve to meet this challenge. We will stand with the people of Mali to rid the country of terrorists and strengthen their democracy.”

Authorities drew no direct links to last week's terrorist attacks in Paris. But Mali — home to the ancient city of Timbuktu — has been at the center of a French-backed effort to drive back Islamist rebels who once controlled large portions of the country.

Security had been reinforced in Bamako — specifically around locations popular with foreigners, including the Radisson — after the Paris attacks, Traore said. He added that the attackers entered the hotel through a side entrance, “which makes us believe that they were familiar with the hotel.”

Foreigners are often targeted in Mali. Yet militants had never seized a target as prominent as the 190-room Radisson Blu, where foreign business people and diplomats are known to stay and dine.

Earlier this month — before the rampage in Paris — the leader of Ansar Dine, one of Mali's main Islamist groups, released a statement encouraging attacks that would ""push away the aggression of the French Crusader assailant"" in the former French colony, which stretches from tropical West Africa to desert regions bordering Algeria.

A contingent of French troops is stationed in Mali, and President François Hollande on Thursday had praised the campaign against the Islamist insurgents.

""France is leading this war with its armed forces, its soldiers, its courage,"" he said. ""It must carry out this war with its allies, its partners giving us all the means available, as we did in Mali, as we are going to continue in Iraq, as we will continue in Syria.""

One of the rescued hostages, popular Guinean singer Sékouba “Bambino” Diabate, told reporters that he hid under his bed and heard two assailants speaking in English as they searched an adjacent room.

“I stayed still, hidden under the bed, not making a noise,” he said. “I heard them say in English: ‘Did you load it? Let’s go.’ ”

Extremist violence has hit Mali repeatedly. In March, attackers reportedly shouting “Allahu akbar” fired on a popular bar in Bamako. Three Malian civilians were killed, along with a Belgian security officer working for the European Union and a French national.

Two months ago, more than a dozen people — including five U.N. contractors — were killed in a 24-hour hostage siege at a hotel in Sevare in central Mali. Responsibility for that attack was claimed by al-Mourabitoun, led by Algerian Mokhtar Belmokhtar.

Belmokhtar, an infamous one-eyed militant, had also orchestrated the bloody seizure of an Algerian gas facility in 2013 in which at least 100 workers were held hostage and dozens were killed. He was targeted in a U.S. airstrike in June in Libya, and Libyan authorities said he was killed. But the Islamist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb rejected that claim.

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/obama-climate-change-paris-216251",0,"President Obama joined leaders from 150 nations on Monday in pledging action against climate change, kicking off a historic two-week gathering that Obama called a ""turning point"" in the battle against one of humanity's gravest threats. Heads of state from industrial powers and tiny island nations assembled in a heavily guarded conference center north of Paris, where negotiators hope to forge a treaty to dramatically reduce emissions of greenhouse-gas pollution blamed for warming the planet.

Obama, speaking a few miles from the site of the Nov. 13 terrorist attack in the French capital, called for urgent action against a challenge that he suggested was greater even than the fight against terrorism.

“The growing threat of climate change could define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other,” Obama said in a speech at the Le Bourget conference center in Paris’s industrial outskirts. “What should give us hope that this is a turning point, that this is the moment we finally determined we would save our planet.”

Obama, who has staked his legacy on the fight against climate change, struck an ominous tone in describing the ravages of a warming planet, declaring that “no nation large or small, wealthy or poor, is immune.” He urged the leaders to take action even if the benefits were not evident for generations.

Citing Martin Luther King Jr., he warned that “there is such a thing as being too late.”

The remarks came during a day of ceremonial fanfare as well as substantive progress in marshaling resources to speed the shift to cleaner energy. U.S. officials formally announced the formation of a 20-nation initiative to spur funding on energy research, in tandem with a similar undertaking led by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and 27 of the world’s wealthiest private investors.

But there were also signs of discord as negotiators prepared to haggle over details of a complex treaty that requires all nations — even the poorest ones — to make a contribution to cutting greeenhouse-gas pollution. Some developing countries have insisted on compensation for economic and environmental damage stemming from decades of industrial emissions that came mostly from Western industrial powers.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius opened the conference by calling on all governments to back an ambitious treaty.

“The stakes are too high and the menace of climate change is too great for us to be content with a minimalistic agreement,” he said.

Obama has already aligned most of the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters behind substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, but over the next dozen days international climate negotiators must still nail down the details of an agreement that would strengthen existing commitments and introduce a way for countries to review and expand their commitments in the near future.

The negotiations have been slowed by delegates from developing countries who believe that, for all of Obama’s efforts, the United States should do even more to help them grapple with the effects of climate change and lower global emissions.

Obama said that “the United States not only recognizes our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it.” But he stressed that all nations must act “right now.”

More than two weeks after terrorist attacks rocked this city and shocked the world, Obama described the gathering of world leaders here as “an act of defiance” and asked: “What greater rejection of those who would tear down our world than marshaling our best efforts to save it?”

With so many world leaders present, the summit also opened chances for top-level dialogue on other fronts.

Sideline talks included a meeting between Obama and Russian President Vladi­mir Putin to discuss Syria’s nearly five-year civil war and peace efforts in Ukraine between the Western-supported government and Moscow-backed rebels.

The two leaders agreed to continue talks among global stakeholders that began this fall in Vienna to forge a political solution to the fighting in Syria. But the two sides remain far apart on some key issues, and no clear progress appeared to have been made in Paris.

Russia says its military intervention in Syria seeks to cripple the Islamic State — a mutual enemy of Washington and its allies. But Moscow has heavily targeted rebel factions seeking to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a key Russian partner. In Paris, Obama repeated U.S. demands that Assad must eventually step down as part of any political transition.

Obama kicked off his day meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, hailing their mutual work on climate change but urging greater Chinese cooperation on cybercrime and “maritime” issues that include China’s military construction on disputed reefs in the South China Sea.

Putting China first on the schedule was an indication of China’s central role on global issues such as climate change.

It was just a year ago that Obama and Xi vowed to set definite limits on greenhouse gas emissions, laying the foundation for other countries to follow suit. On Monday, Obama said: “Our leadership on this issue has been absolutely vital.”

Other highlights included a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose government has been pressing for more financing and technology transfer. U.S. officials expressed frustration that Modi had not pledged to do more to avoid sharp increases in coal-fired electricity to help the 240 million Indians who lack electricity. They hoped to make progress in the coming days.

Obama also attended the formal unveiling of an initiative to boost research and development spending on new technologies, led by Gates. The Microsoft founder, in an interview with The Washington Post, warned that the climate threat is too serious to allow technology to evolve at the usual slow pace.

“Historically, it takes over 50 years before you have a substantial shift in energy generation, but we need to do it more quickly,” Gates said. “We need to move faster than the energy sector ever has.”

Obama expressed belief that a breakthrough was needed in addition to current technologies, something some critics say is too optimistic. “We don’t know exactly what’s going to work best but we know if we put our best minds behind it and put our dollars behind it we’ll discover what works,” Obama said.

Some countries believe solutions lie closer. A group of countries — France, Canada, Chile, Ethiopia, Germany and Mexico — proposed putting a worldwide price on carbon to discourage the use of carbon intensive fuels, such as coal.

The chances of getting such a proposal through the Republican-controlled Congress, however, are remote. It is also unclear whether Congress will provide the additional research dollars Obama pledged as part of the Gates “innovation” initiative.

The summit will also feature a goal, heavily promoted by India and including 121 countries, of a massive investment in solar power in countries with the greatest amounts of sunlight.

“We have broken the old arguments for inaction,” Obama said at the plenary session Monday. “We have proved that strong economic growth and stable investment no longer have to conflict with one another.”

Obama is one of about 150 world leaders at the Paris summit — formally known as the 21st Conference of Participants. Those leaders also delivered speeches.

“A political moment like this may not come again,” said U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. “We have never faced such a test. But neither have we encountered such great opportunity.”

In the wake of terrorist attacks that left 130 dead, the conference, taking place in a center located at an old airport in Le Bourget, has become a major security headache, and traffic has been blocked in Paris until Tuesday.

After arriving in Paris on Sunday, Obama’s motorcade glided along the Seine through largely deserted streets before stopping in front of Le Bataclan, the concert hall where scores of people were killed in the terrorist attacks.

Flanked by French President François Hollande and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, Obama placed a white rose on the street in front of the concert hall, making a small addition to the mound of flowers and candles there. After standing for a minute of silence with his hands folded before him, Obama walked away, briefly placing a hand on the shoulders of Hollande and Hidalgo.

The United States announced that it will contribute $51.2 million to a $248 million Least Developed Countries Fund to help the world’s poorest countries adapt to climate change. Germany is the largest of 11 donors to the fund.

“We know the truth — that many nations have contributed little to climate change but will be the first to feel its most destructive effects,” Obama said.

But U.S. officials said they would resist calls by many small island states and other countries vulnerable to climate-change effects that developed nations pay reparations or damages because of their historic emissions. Those nations also favor setting a goal of limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius instead of 2 degrees. Obama will meet with leaders of island nations Tuesday.

Other countries used the conference to announce new details. Norway, Germany and Britain said they would provide $1 billion a year until 2020 in payments for verified emissions reductions from forests and land use in other countries.

http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/03/us/syed-farook-tashfeen-malik-mass-shooting-profile/index.html",0,"SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — Authorities were still trying Thursday to establish a motive for the deadliest U.S. mass shooting in nearly three years, even as they revealed that the two attackers had amassed a large stockpile of explosives and ammunition. The rampage killed 14 people, wounded 21 and locked down a swath of Southern California for much of the day Wednesday as investigators scrambled to determine whether they were looking at a terrorist attack or an extremely unusual and lethal case of workplace violence.

The killers were a young husband and wife who welcomed the birth of a daughter just six months ago and showed no outward sign of Islamist radicalization, psychological distress or a desire for mayhem. The couple were slain in a wild police shootout on a residential street four hours after the massacre.

The FBI, which has authority to investigate potential terrorism, announced Thursday that it had taken over the investigation. Authorities were carefully picking through three crime scenes: the Inland Regional Center, where the mass shooting occurred; the San Bernardino street where the couple died in the gun battle with police; and the couple’s rented home in Redlands, Calif., where robots helped investigators root out an arsenal of pipe bombs and thousands of bullets.

Police identified the shooters as Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, a county health worker born in Chicago, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, his Pakistani wife, who was in the United States on a visa.

Farook, who had a college degree in environmental health and a steady job as a health inspector, traveled to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan last year and returned with Malik, whom he had met online. They were married in the United States, police said.

Authorities have said the two were not on any watch lists. A senior U.S. law enforcement official said that Farook was in contact with persons of interest with possible ties to terrorism but that these were not “substantial” contacts.

Farook’s supervisor, Amanda Adair, who also went to college with him at California State University at San Bernardino, said he “got along with everybody, but he kept his distance.” She said that she “can’t imagine [the shooting] was about work” and that she had no inkling that Farook had the capacity for such violence.

Without a firmly established motive, authorities said Thursday that they could not determine whether they were dealing with terrorists, a disgruntled worker who had enlisted his wife in his cause, or some kind of hybrid of those two scenarios.

“We do not yet know the motive,” David Bow­dich, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles office, said at a news conference. “It would be irresponsible and premature for me to call this terrorism.”

The case doesn’t fit any familiar template. If it was terrorism, why would the shooters target co-workers in a small city that many Americans couldn’t find on a map, rather than some more spectacular target? If it was workplace violence, why build up an arsenal of bullets and pipe bombs?

“It is possible this was terrorist-related, but we don’t know,” President Obama said Thursday in somber remarks in the Oval Office. “It is also possible this was workplace-related.”

Mark Pitcavage, director of the Center on Extremism for the Anti-Defamation League, said that “based on what is known now about the case, it certainly is unusual and does not fit neatly into any of the traditional models of violence that we’re familiar with.”

Police said Farook and Malik were dressed in tactical gear and armed with rifles, handguns and multiple ammunition magazines when, at about 11 a.m., they strode into a conference room where about 80 people were gathered for a staff training session that was transitioning into a holiday party.

They opened fire, spraying 65 to 75 rounds and hitting more than a third of the people. A bullet struck a sprinkler head, and the sprinklers began soaking the room as the fire alarms went off. The shooters fled in a rented black Ford Expedition, leaving behind a bag with three pipe bombs designed to be triggered with a remote-control device from the SUV. The device malfunctioned.

San Bernardino police Lt. Mike Madden, the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the center, described the fresh scent of gunpowder and a horrifying scene for which years of training had not fully prepared him.

“The situation was surreal,” Madden said Thursday. “It was unspeakable, the carnage we were seeing.”

Farook had been with his colleagues at the party earlier in the morning, police said. Authorities could not say conclusively whether there had been a dispute that led Farook to leave the party. But police said a survivor of the shooting told them that Farook slipped away before the massacre.

That tip led police to check Farook’s name, which led to the discovery that he had rented an SUV that matched the description of the getaway car.

Soon, authorities were staking out the couple’s home in Redlands, a suburb 15 minutes to the east. Several hours after the shooting, the SUV rolled by and then sped away, and police gave chase.

The SUV stopped on San Bernardino Avenue, a few miles from the massacre. Cellphone videos captured the furious gun battle that followed. Police said the couple fired 76 rifle rounds; police fired 380.

Farook and Malik died at the scene. Two officers were injured, but the wounds were not life-threatening. The SUV, so riddled with bullets that it looked as if it had been hit with a bomb, was due back at the rental agency that day, police said.

Police found more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition on or near the couple, suggesting that they were prepared for a long siege. Police recovered two assault rifles and two 9mm pistols, all legally purchased, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Two of the weapons were traced to one of the assailants, said Dannette Seward, an ATF spokeswoman, while the other two were traced to another person who has not been publicly identified.

“The FBI is chasing down any contacts these two may have had and whether those contacts are indicative of radicalization or external plotting or are purely incidental,” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

Schiff, who was briefed Thursday on the attack, said that “on the basis of what I heard and where the [FBI] was, I wouldn’t conclude that there was radicalization here.”

The congressman said the shooting also did not appear to be “an act of spontaneous workplace violence.” But, he said, it could have been the culmination of a longer-term grievance.

“There appears to be a degree of planning that went into this,” San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said. “Nobody just gets upset at a party, goes home and puts together that kind of elaborate scheme or plan.”

At a morning news conference, authorities said they had gathered a number of items that were being analyzed to investigate the couple’s digital trail, including thumb drives, computers and cellphones. But the two had left behind remarkably little in the way of a digital record — no apparent criminal record, no Facebook page, no Twitter account.

Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, co-workers who knew Farook described him as a quiet, polite man who held no obvious grudges­ against people in the office. The office had recently held a shower for the couple’s baby, and the two seemed to be “living the American Dream,” Patrick Baccari, a fellow inspector who shared a cubicle with Farook, told the Times.

A number of families in this city were shattered by Wednesday’s violence. On Thursday, officials released the names of the 14 people slain at the holiday party. The eight men and six women ranged in age from 26 to 60. One ran the coffee shop in the building. Twelve of the 14 were county employees.

Shaken, too, were Muslims in Southern California. At the Islamic Society of Corona-Norco, Ray Abboud said Muslims were horrified by the shooting. He said he fears people will paint Muslims with one brush.

“It breaks our hearts to see 14 people die,” Abboud said. “We feel sorry for everything that happened, but we can’t blame ourselves for being Muslim.”

He said people in the community were keeping a close watch on their children “to make sure they don’t fall into any crazy stuff.”

Before the attack, Farook and Malik dropped off their 6-month-old daughter with Farook’s mother, saying they had a doctor’s appointment, according to Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Los Angeles. The council organized a news conference late Wednesday featuring Farhan Khan, who is married to Farook’s sister.

“I have no idea why he would do something like this,” Khan said of his brother-in-law. “I cannot express how sad I am today.”

The nationwide campaign, to be carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as soon as early January, would be the first large-scale effort to deport families who have fled violence in Central America, those familiar with the plan said. More than 100,000 families with both adults and children have made the journey across the southwest border since last year, though this migration has largely been overshadowed by a related surge of unaccompanied minors.

The ICE operation would target only adults and children who have already been ordered removed from the United States by an immigration judge, according to officials familiar with the undertaking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because planning is ongoing and the operation has not been given final approval by DHS. The adults and children would be detained wherever they can be found and immediately deported. The number targeted is expected to be in the hundreds and possibly greater.

The proposed deportations have been controversial inside the Obama administration, which has been discussing them for several months. DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson has been pushing for the moves, according to those with knowledge of the debate, in part because of a new spike in the number of illegal immigrants in recent months. Experts say that the violence that was a key factor in driving people to flee Central America last year has surged again, with the homicide rate in El Salvador reaching its highest level in a generation. A drought in the region has also prompted departures.

The pressure for deportations has also mounted because of a recent court decision that ordered DHS to begin releasing families housed in detention centers.

Although Johnson has signaled publicly for months that Central American families not granted asylum would face deportation, the plan is likely to trigger renewed backlash from Latino groups and immigrant advocates, who have long accused the administration of overly harsh detention policies even as Republicans deride President Obama as soft on border security.

Advocates have not been briefed on the plans and on Wednesday expressed concern. They cited what they called flaws and abuses in the government’s treatment and legal processing of the families, many of whom are fleeing danger or persecution in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

“It would be an outrage if the administration subjected Central American families to even more aggressive enforcement tactics,” said Gregory Chen, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “This administration has never acknowledged the truth: that these families are refugees seeking asylum who should be given humanitarian protection rather than being detained or rounded up. When other countries are welcoming far more refugees, the U.S. should be ashamed for using jails and even contemplating large-scale deportation tactics.”

Groups that have called for stricter immigration limits said the raids are long overdue and remained skeptical about whether the scale would be large enough to deter future illegal immigration from Central America.

“I’ll believe it when I see it,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “What share is this going to be?. . . It’s a drop in the bucket compared to the number they’ve admitted into the country. If you have photogenic raids on a few dozen illegal families and that’s the end of it, it’s just for show. It’s just a [public relations] thing, enforcement theater.”

Marsha Catron, a DHS spokeswoman, would not comment on any possible ICE operations but pointed out that Johnson “has consistently said our border is not open to illegal immigration, and if individuals come here illegally, do not qualify for asylum or other relief, and have final orders of removal, they will be sent back consistent with our laws and our values.”

The raids could become a flash point on the 2016 campaign trail, where GOP presidential contenders, including front-runner Donald Trump, have made calls for stricter border control a central issue. Trump’s rise has come as he has promised to deport all undocumented immigrants and bar entry to the United States for Muslim refugees in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., policy prescriptions denounced by Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton.

U.S. Border Patrol agents capture undocumented immigrants in Texas + 9 The number of unaccompanied minors and families crossing the border from Central America has surged in recent months.

The immigration issue has often bedeviled Obama, who came into office under pressure from supporters to end the George W. Bush administration’s post-Sept. 11, 2001, crackdown on illegal migrants. Instead, the administration increased deportations in its early years, drawing repeated fire from Latino groups and immigration advocates. Then, in summer 2014, came the surge of children flocking across the southwest border.

Share this article Share

While most public attention focused on minors who were crossing the border alone, the number of children who came with a family member — known as “family units’’ in DHS parlance — also spiked dramatically.

With the government overwhelmed at first, many of the families were simply released and told to appear at later immigration court dates to determine if they would be granted asylum.

Advertisement

Some never showed up or had their asylum claims rejected and were ordered deported by immigration judges, officials familiar with the process said. That population is among those expected to be targeted in the upcoming raids, they said.

Immigrant rights advocates and legal experts say the families and minors were in many cases not granted adequate representation and were confused by the asylum procedures in court.

DHS, meanwhile, reacted to the surge by opening family detention centers, two in Texas and one in Pennsylvania. Those centers now house more than 1,700 people, DHS officials said Wednesday. But even as DHS officials have long vowed that the migrants will be treated humanely, their advocates have said conditions are crowded and inhumane in the centers, which often house women with children.

As the administration wrestled with how to handle the families, Johnson in November 2014 issued a set of new immigration enforcement priorities. Much of the attention focused on his public statements that undocumented immigrants who had been in the country for years should be integrated into society rather than deported. And Obama, on the same day, announced an executive action intended to shield up to 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation.

But Obama’s action has been blocked in the courts. And Johnson has also made clear that families, children and others who had illegally crossed the border recently and did not obtain asylum status — and anyone ordered deported starting on Jan. 1, 2014 — would be subject to removal.

DHS “will also continue to expedite, to the greatest extent possible, the removal of those who are not eligible for relief under our laws,’’ Johnson said in a September statement about the family detention centers. “We take seriously our obligation to secure our borders.’’

In August, a federal judge in California ordered the administration to begin releasing in October children and family members from the detention centers. The judge said DHS had violated a 1990s consent decree that said minors taken into custody, whether accompanied by an adult or not, had to be treated humanely and allowed to quickly contest their incarcerations.

The administration has said it is complying with the ruling, but it has also filed an appeal with a federal appeals court, and officials said the decision left them feeling hamstrung. “It doesn’t allow us to hold onto people, to detain them until we can deport them,’’ said one person familiar with the internal debate.

Then, in recent months, the flow of families crossing the border suddenly shot up again. The numbers of family units apprehended rose 173 percent in October and November, compared to the same period last year, according to DHS data analyzed by the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank."

http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/29/us/affluenza-teen-ethan-couch-detained-in-mexico/index.html",0,"Ethan Couch, the Texas teenager who prompted an international search after he vanished earlier this month, appeared set to return to the United States after his Monday night capture in a Mexican resort city. Couch, 18, made national headlines after a 2013 drunken-driving incident that left four people dead. A psychologist testified for his defense, saying that the teen, from a wealthy Dallas area family, suffered from “affluenza,” which contributed to his reckless decisions.

Couch was eventually sentenced to a drug- and alcohol-free probation but disappeared this month, along with his mother, Tonya. The search for the pair ended this week in Puerto Vallarta, a city of beaches and lavish resorts on Mexico’s Pacific Coast, officials said at a Tuesday news conference in Texas.

The mother and son are expected to be sent back to Texas, where Couch will likely face a maximum of several months jail time, according to Tarrant County District Attorney Sharen Wilson.

She told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that, since Couch’s case is in the juvenile justice system, any sentence for violating his probation would expire at his 19th birthday in April. A hearing to transfer his case to an adult court will be held in January; a change to adult status could extend his probation and include a 120-day stay in jail.

A glimpse into the Mexican resort town where ‘affluenza’ teen was captured + 9 Ethan Couch and his mother were traced to a condo in Puerto Vallarta through an order they placed at Domino’s Pizza, according to the AP. Couch received probation after a drunken-driving incident that left four dead in 2013, his defense arguing that he had “affluenza” because of his wealthy upbringing.

Officials said Tuesday that the Couches’ escape appeared to have been planned; Anderson said investigators learned of “something that was almost akin to a going-away party.”

At a news conference, Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson didn’t provide many details about the gathering but said authorities were told it happened before Couch and his mother disappeared.

“As we were trying to determine if this was premeditated, as we believed it was, a statement was made that they basically had a gathering before they left, and you know, kind of characterized it as more or less a going-away party,” he said. “Which, to us, meant that what we suspected had happened. That it was carefully planned and timed to get out of the country.”

Couch was wanted by the U.S. Marshals Service for allegedly violating his probation. He failed to turn up for a routine probation meeting on Dec. 10, according to the Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office, and when an officer went to check on him, he was nowhere to be found.

Authorities issued a warrant for his arrest the following day.

“The Mexican authorities have them in custody as we speak, we are working — the marshals are working — to get them back here, to the States,” Anderson said.

According to CBS Dallas-Fort Worth, the pair fled to Mexico earlier in the month and initially stayed at a high end resort called Los Tules in the tourist zone near the beach. After a while, though, they moved to a small condo in the quiet neighborhood where they were ultimately arrested.

But the Couches also gave themselves away, the AP reported. A police report issued by the the Jalisco state prosecutor’s office in Mexico said the Couches used one of their phones to order Domino’s Pizza to their room at a condominium. A U.S. Marshal’s Service agent let Mexican authorities know about the location of the phone Monday, and they were able to track the mother and son down later that evening.

The police report says that the Couches claimed to be carrying no identification and gave inconsistent stories about their names, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The pair was taken into custody and handed over to immigration officials.

As of Tuesday night, they were being held in Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco state.

The exact travel plans for mother and son remained somewhat unclear. U.S. Marshal Rick Taylor said the duo would probably be expelled.

“We still don’t have a lot of details yet about his return, as well as the mother. We’re still working through that with the Mexican government,” he said, adding that “we are very happy and pleased that they are in the custody of the Mexican authorities, and they’ll be returned to the United States here shortly.”

The search reignited discussion of the teen’s light sentence two years ago. In December 2013, Couch pleaded guilty in juvenile court to manslaughter and assault while intoxicated. He had valium and a high level of alcohol in his blood and was speeding down a road on the outskirts of Fort Worth when he careened into a group of people fixing a broken-down car. Four were killed, and several of the passengers in Couch’s car was thrown from the vehicle; one remains paralyzed from a traumatic brain injury.

Although prosecutors pushed for a 20-year prison term, Couch was sentenced to 10 years of probation and no jail time. During the trial, psychologist G. Dick Miller attributed Couch’s reckless behavior to “affluenza,” saying that Couch had an unhealthy relationship with his millionaire parents, who didn’t teach him that dangerous actions have consequences.

“Instead of the golden rule, which was ‘do unto others as you would have them do unto you,’ [Couch] was taught we have the gold, we make the rules at the Couch household,” Miller testified in court, according to ABC News.

But during a hearing in February 2014, State District Judge Jean Boyd, who issued the sentence, told families involved that her decision had nothing to do with the “affluenza” argument, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. She said Couch, not his parents, was responsible for what happened.

When the mother and son return to the United States, officials will push to transfer his case from the juvenile system to the adult courts, Tarrant County District Attorney Sharen Wilson told reporters. Tonya Couch is expected to be charged with hindering apprehension, Wilson said.

“I think that she deserves to be incarcerated,” Wilson said.

The process of transferring the case had already started before Ethan Couch went missing, said Sam Jordan, a spokeswoman for the Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for January.

If the case remains in the juvenile system, Couch’s probation could be revoked, and under that scenario, the maximum penalty he could face would be serving time in a juvenile facility until his 19th birthday in April, Jordan said.

If it transfers to adult courts, however, the picture becomes a bit more murky. The probation would not be revoked, because Couch went missing when he was still in the juvenile system. A judge in the adult courts would set new probation guidelines and rules and could make a 120-day stint in prison a term of his probation.

After those 120 days, Couch would complete his probation period as an adult.

“The juvenile sentence is not sufficient,” Jordan said. “We’re looking for more accountability in the adult court.”"

They bought ""Make America Great Again"" hats, put on campaign T-shirts and passed through a security checkpoint.

The West Des Moines couple, who have two grown children, had never been to a political event before. Bonnie works in a mailroom; Randy is a press operator. They don’t live paycheck to paycheck, but it would take just one small catastrophe to push them there.

“In the end, everything that he’s saying might not happen if he is elected — but I’m willing to give it a shot,” said Randy Reynolds, 49, who used to vote for Democrats but switched to Republicans a decade ago. “I will give him 100 percent. . . . It would be amazing if the majority of things that he said would actually happen. That would be amazing.”

So, obviously, the couple plan to caucus for Trump on Feb. 1?

“We’re going to see,” Reynolds said. “With kids and grandkids and all this, it’s kind of hectic. . . . We’ll look into it. If our time is available, then yeah, maybe we’ll do it. Maybe. We’ll have to see.”

Trump’s unexpected and sustained popularity has, at least in part, been fueled by his appeal to a voting bloc that seems to be emerging: blue-collar workers without college degrees who are slightly younger than the traditional Republican voter. Many say they haven’t cared about politics until now, as they flock to Trump rallies like groupies to a rock concert, read his books, buy his products, quote his jokes and follow his social-media accounts.

But is their devotion to Trump deep enough to vote?

For those who don’t regularly vote in primaries, doing so for the first time is a hurdle — especially in Iowa, which uses a caucus system that can intimidate first-timers.

In states with early primary contests, Trump's staffers are trying to teach their supporters how to vote and get a commitment that they actually will. Before each rally here, Trump's state co-chairs walk the crowd through how the caucuses work and urge them to attend. But they are also hoping word will spread through social media and in conversations after church, at the school bus stop, during coffee breaks and over holiday dinners.

Bonnie Reynolds, 47, said she didn't know much about caucusing until her co-worker explained it to her and encouraged her to get involved. When the couple showed up at Trump's rally on Dec. 11, a campaign volunteer asked them to sign a sheet committing to caucusing. Reynolds signed them up, although she's not sure whether she will follow through.

In the past few weeks, Trump himself has started talking about the importance of voting in early states. At a rally in western Iowa in early December, Trump said there’s no excuse not to vote.

“You’ve got to get there,” he said. “Even if you’re not feeling good, if you’re feeling horrible, if you had a horrible fight with your wife or your husband. . . . If you caught your husband cheating the night before, you’ve got to go to the caucus.”

Trump's campaign strategy is far from traditional, although his ground game in early voting states has followed a relatively standard playbook in some respects. Over the summer, he hired 10 staffers in Iowa, who traveled around the state in a Trump-branded bus to hand out T-shirts, bumper stickers and hats in exchange for contact information.

But just as Trump doesn’t spend money on pollsters or focus groups, the campaign has yet to purchase databases of potential voters, a key organizing tool used by most campaigns. Instead of buying such a tool from a private contractor, the campaign has compiled its own database using contact information from every rally attendee, either when they registered online or showed up at the door.

With just five weeks until the Iowa caucuses, other Republican candidates have started to flood the state with more staffers and volunteers. Trump’s campaign now has an Iowa staff of 15, who organize at least one large rally per week in addition to continuing to recruit “caucus leaders” who can be the voice of the campaign at caucus locations.

Trump’s Iowa team remains confident that his rally crowds will serendipitously translate into caucus support. Sam Clovis, Trump’s Iowa co-chair, pointed to a rally Trump held in Clay County in northwest Iowa in early December. Only 16,500 people live in the county, but 1,500 showed up at the rally in Spencer, and Clovis said he asked the crowd how many had never caucused before.

Share this article Share

“Twenty percent of the hands went up,” Clovis said. “And I said: How many of you are going to caucus this time? Same 20 percent of hands went up, because he has done something. This is something that’s not reflected in the polls. It’s not reflected in any of the ways that you go out and count things.”

There are few gauges right now to measure which candidate might do better in Iowa among the most likely voters. Nationally, a Washington Post-ABC News poll released this month found that 38 percent of registered Republicans support Trump. Among those who said they are certain to vote, 41 percent said they would pick Trump.

Unlike a general election or traditional primary, only a small fraction of Iowans attend the caucuses. In 2012 and 2008, roughly 20 percent of registered Republicans caucused. In low-turnout elections like this, voters tend to be older people who vote regularly and are more likely to have a college degree — not necessarily the group Trump seems to have fired up.

It takes a higher level of commitment to caucus. In traditional primaries, voters have most of the day to show up at the polls. To caucus, Iowans have to be in line at their local precinct by 7 p.m. and will spend most of their evening there, listening to speeches and casting their vote.

Feb. 1 is a Monday night, likely to be cold, perhaps snowy or icy. The caucuses have to compete with the logistics of everyday life: evening work shifts, children who have after-school activities or need help with their homework, making dinner and preparing for the week ahead. And campaigns only have one shot at getting supporters through the door — there's no early voting and a limited time to monitor who has yet to show up.

“This is a struggle for all of the candidates, because a caucus is different from voting. . . . A caucus is very inconvenient,” said Craig Robinson, a former Iowa GOP official who now runs the blog TheIowaRepublican.com. “It takes a commitment of time.”

But Robinson noted that it also takes a commitment of time to attend a Trump rally, and thousands of Iowans have already done that, while other campaigns struggle to attract a couple hundred. He attended a Trump rally in eastern Iowa this fall and was surprised to see so many fans show up already wearing campaign T-shirts, suggesting a level of planning that could translate into the willingness to caucus.

“There is a committed base of support that no doubt will caucus for him,” Robinson said.

At Trump’s rally in Des Moines on Dec. 11, a couple in their early 30s said they have no plans to caucus, even though they hope Trump will be president and wanted their two young sons to see the candidate speak. A 25-year-old graduate student said he would probably caucus for Trump, but he just moved to the state and has no idea how to do so. A group of high school students said they won’t be old enough to vote. A retiree who said he’s “not a political sort of guy” is still surveying his options.

Linda Stuver, 61, said Trump is her top pick, although she also likes Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. During the last election cycle, she went to a rally for Mitt Romney, her first political event. The Trump rally was her second.

“This is only my second time I’ve ever been to one of these — that’s how annoyed I am with what’s happening to our country,” said Stuver, who lives in Des Moines and says she raised four children by cleaning houses and working other low-level jobs. “I can’t even have Obama be on TV anymore — I have to shut it off, that’s how irritated I am. Us old folks have seen a lot, and what’s happening in our country is not right.”

Is she annoyed and irritated enough to caucus?

“I don’t know,” she said, shaking her head. “I never have.”

As Stuver waited for the rally to start, Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer” blared and a Trump staffer with a clipboard stopped by the small section of bleachers where she was sitting.

“Is there anybody up here that’s 100 percent sure that you’re caucusing on February 1 for Trump?” the staffer asked, then waited, holding the clipboard over his head. “Anybody? No?”

With no takers, the staffer moved on to the next section of cheering fans eagerly awaiting Trump’s arrival."

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/hillary-clinton-trump-no-response-217060",0,"THE MORNING PLUM: Donald Trump continues to rage against Hillary Clinton over her suggestion during the Democratic debate that Trump has become “ISIS’s best recruiter.” Clinton argued that terrorists are using videos of Trump insulting Islam to “recruit more radical jihadists,” and Trump has demanded an apology. The Clinton camp has since walked back the video comment, though her advisers continue to point to social media evidence of the broader claim that Trump’s rhetoric has become a terror recruiting tool. The Clinton camp has refused Trump’s demand for an apology.

Make no mistake: Both Trump and Clinton must be very happy to be embroiled in this spat. Indeed, the Clinton camp has cheerfully fed the flames of this fight, in what appears to be a concerted effort to boost Trump among GOP voters. The theory may be that Trump benefits among those voters if he is perceived as a chief antagonist of Clinton, thus helping him spread more intra-GOP damage.

Advertisement

Here’s the latest on this: Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta told a conference call of Clinton supporters that the Clinton camp takes the possibility of a Trump nomination “very seriously.” The Wall Street Journal reports on the call:

One person on the call mentioned the extent to which Mr. Trump’s name came up in the Democratic debate Saturday and asked if that represented a “shift” in the Clinton campaign’s view of his “viability” as a candidate. Mr. Podesta said that Mr. Trump has “demonstrated to be a serious” candidate for the Republican nomination, and that he is “someone who could very well be successful in their nominating process. People have come around to the conclusion that this isn’t just…going to go away at some point.”

It’s hard to know whether the Clinton camp really believes this. But one obvious possibility is that the Clinton camp is signaling to top supporters that they should publicly make the case that Trump now looks like a genuinely viable candidate to win the GOP primary. If so, this takes the Clinton camp’s trolling of GOP voters to another level: Hillary is attacking Trump because Democrats are afraid that he’ll become the nominee!!!

But there may be a deeper rationale here, too. As I reported the other day, Democrats plan to increasingly make the case that Trump’s simplistic bluster and belligerence are forcing the other GOP candidates to dumb down their rhetoric to match his, thus revealing Clinton to be more prepared to lead in complicated and dangerous times than any of the GOP candidates.

Advertisement

This is a political and policy argument: Democrats are claiming that Trump’s rhetoric has become a threat to national security, which in turn makes the other GOP candidates’ efforts to match it — or at least, fail to condemn it in a full-throated fashion — more consequential, and reveals Clinton to be a steadier, more reliable presence. (The bet is that, while all the bluster may appeal to GOP primary voters, it will taint the party in the eyes of the general election audience.) Clinton’s increasing efforts to highlight Trump’s reckless anti-Muslim demagoguery not only gives Trump a way to boost himself among Republican voters, by arguing that he has emerged as Clinton’s chief foe; it’s also designed to advance that larger argument.

* TRUMP STILL LEADS, BUT CRUZ IS CLOSING IN: A new Quinnipiac poll finds that Donald Trump still leads with 28 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents nationally, while Ted Cruz is a close second at 24 percent. Marco Rubio has 12 percent and Ben Carson has 10 percent.

Notable details: Trump leads Cruz among non-college voters (another sign that’s where his base of support lies) while Cruz dominates Trump among Tea Partyers and white evangelicals, suggesting his assiduous courting of that demographic might be working. Also: Where’s that Rubio-mentum?

* CLINTON HOLDS VAST LEAD OVER SANDERS: The new Quinnipiac poll also finds that Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by 61-30 among Democrats and Dem-leaning independents nationally. Clinton leads among those who self describe as “very liberal” by 52-42, and among those who are “somewhat liberal” by 60-31, suggesting her campaign may be in the process of patching up whatever problems she had with the Democratic Party’s left flank.

Indeed, only 10 percent of “very liberal” Dems say they definitely won’t support Clinton.

* AMERICANS WOULD BE ‘EMBARRASSED’ BY PRESIDENT TRUMP: One last fun nugget from the Quinnipiac poll: 50 percent of Americans say they would be “embarrassed” by having Donald Trump as president, while only 23 percent say they would be “proud” and another 24 percent say they would be neither.

But a plurality of Republicans, 44 percent, say they would be “proud” to have President Trump in the Oval Office, while only 20 percent of them would be embarrassed by it.

* TALK RADIO CONSERVATIVES RALLY TO CRUZ: Politico reports on all the conservative talk radio hosts who are rallying to Ted Cruz’s defense, fending off attacks on the Texas Senator from Trump and Marco Rubio. Notably, radio conservatives are defending Cruz against Rubio’s false claim that Cruz once supported legalization, as Rush Limbaugh does here:

“At the end of the day when people go vote, people are gonna remember, of the two, it was Marco Rubio that was a member of the Gang of Eight and Ted Cruz that wasn’t, and that’s as complicated or simple as it’s gonna end up being.”

Conservative radio is determined not to let GOP voters forget Rubio’s heinous support for comprehensive immigration reform, which could give a big boost to Cruz over the long haul.

* SANDERS HITS HILLARY OVER WALL STREET: At Saturday’s Dem debate, Clinton said she wants to be loved by everyone, including Wall Street. On the campaign trail in Iowa, Sanders went after Clinton over this:

“In the real world, if we’re going to transform America, if we’re going to stand up to the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street…and the greed of corporate America, I accept their not liking me….I don’t need to be loved by everybody.”

Clinton has not embraced as robust a Wall Street reform agenda as the Sanders/Elizabeth Warren wing of the party has wanted. But Paul Krugman, for one, has argued that Clinton’s plan for Wall Street is better than the one Sanders has offered.

* CLINTON ROLLS OUT PLAN TO FIGHT ALZHEIMER’S: CNN reports:

Hillary Clinton will roll out a plan to combat Alzheimer’s disease in Fairfield, Iowa, on Tuesday, pledging to spend $2 billion annually to fight the disease and research a cure, according to a Clinton aide….The proposal would be paid for by tax reform proposals and other savings, the aide added.

It will be interesting to how the GOP candidates attack this. It’s likely they’ll blast the plan for hiking taxes.

* AND THE TRUMP VULGARISM OF THE DAY: At a rally in Michigan, the Donald deconstructs Hillary Clinton’s debate bathroom break:

“I know where she went — it’s disgusting, I don’t want to talk about it,” Trump said, screwing up his face, as the crowd laughed and cheered. “No, it’s too disgusting. Don’t say it, it’s disgusting.”"

The tactical shift on the part of the candidates and their allies reflects a long-standing assumption as to how this crowded nomination battle is likely to play out.

Many believe the race will come down to a one-on-one contest between an “outsider” who channels the angry Republican base and a candidate more in line with the wishes of the party hierarchy. The establishment pick has almost always prevailed in the past, though it is far from certain that will be the case in 2016.

The insurgent faction of the party appears likely to rally around either front-runner Donald Trump or the ascendant Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). The leading possibilities on the establishment side include three sitting or former governors and a Florida senator — all of whom are running far behind Trump. But before any of them can get a shot at taking him on, they must deal with one another.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on Tuesday found his record of Senate absences under attack from two directions: a blistering ad in Iowa by a super PAC supporting former Florida governor Jeb Bush and a taunt by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

“Dude, show up to work,” Christie said during a town-hall meeting in Muscatine, Iowa.

Rubio was making his own swing through Iowa, which is set to hold the first contest of the primary season on Feb. 1. He responded at a news conference hours later in the town of Clinton.

“You know, Chris has been missing in New Jersey for half the time,” Rubio said. “But candidates, I think, as we get down the stretch here, some of them get a little desperate and a little nasty in their attacks, and that’s fine.”

He dismissed the attack ad by the pro-Bush super PAC Right to Rise USA as “par for the course. I mean obviously you’ve seen that as we get closer to Election Day and millions of dollars of spending have not changed [Bush’s] fortunes, he’s become increasingly negative in his attacks.”

Meanwhile, Right to Rise USA also launched a spot in New Hampshire contending that the gubernatorial records of Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich do not stack up against that of Bush. The ad was gentler in tone than the super PAC's assault on Rubio, but it attempted to draw a contrast on the experience that all three of the candidates consider to be their greatest asset.

New Day in America, a super PAC supporting Kasich, responded: “What Team Jeb has failed to address is the political baggage dragging behind Bush and Christie. The country doesn’t have an appetite for another Bush, or another Clinton, for that matter. As for Governor Christie, his mishandling of his state budget and the ‘Bridgegate’ scandal have earned him a 60 percent unfavorable rating from those who know him best — the people of New Jersey.”

Trump’s most insulting jabs at other presidential candidates + 11 Republican Donald Trump has made incendiary comments — many of them directed at his opponents — that keep him in the spotlight.

The crossfire, said GOP political consultant Alex Castellanos, is beginning to look like “a ‘Fistful of Dollars’ gunfight,” referring to the 1964 spaghetti western that launched Clint Eastwood to stardom.

“It’s now down to the last five weeks here,” Christie told reporters in Muscatine. “We need to make distinctions between candidates, not just on issues but on experience, so I’ll be talking about it. I think it’s an important distinction to make.”

The young and charismatic Rubio is regarded by many as potentially the strongest contender running in the establishment lane — if he can find an opening.

“It’s pretty clear in this race that Marco Rubio is the candidate of the future. If he ever breaks through the line, he’s got a lot of running room,” said Castellanos, who is not working for any of the 2016 candidates. “The only one who everyone fears for his explosive potential is Rubio.”

Right to Rise USA said it plans to spend $1.4 million on the new ad in Iowa, in which an announcer says: “Over the last three years, Rubio has missed important national security hearings and missed more total votes than any other senator. Politics first — that’s the Rubio way.”

Christie sounded a similar theme during a town hall in Muscatine, where he noted that Rubio had announced his opposition to a $1.8 trillion, year-end spending bill and tax package, but then failed to show up to vote against it. It passed the Senate 65 to 33.

“Just show up to work and vote no,” Christie said. “And if you don’t want to, then quit.”

Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said his campaign is unfazed, noting that Rubio’s skill at dealing with barbs during the candidates’ debates has only increased his stature.

“Obviously, we feel very good about our campaign, and where we’re at. With success comes scrutiny,” Conant said. “We’ve been taking some incoming for several months now, and we’re not worse for the wear.”

Rubio does have the worst attendance record of all the senators, including the five who have run for president this year — a fact he does not dispute. A C-SPAN analysis released last week found that Rubio cast votes for just 219 of the 339 recorded Senate roll-call votes in 2015 — a 65 percent attendance record. He spoke on the Senate floor eight times — just 5 percent of the days that the Senate was in session, C-SPAN said.

“I’m running for president, because I want to change the direction of this country, and it will require me, for the time being, to miss some votes in the U.S. Senate, because I want those votes to matter again,” Rubio said.

Before Tuesday’s exchanges, the most high-profile attack on Rubio’s attendance record had been launched by Bush during an October Republican presidential debate. Rubio shot back with a response that threw Bush off balance.

“Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,” Rubio told Bush, and then recounted how other senators who ran for president had equally bad attendance records that had not drawn much comment.

In his own appearances recently, Bush has been focusing most of his attacks on Trump and Hillary Clinton.

By law, candidates are not allowed to coordinate with the super PACs that support them; however, Right to Rise USA is run by political consultant Mike Murphy, who has been one of Bush’s closest political advisers for most of his political career."

Nearly a decade later, an exhaustive inquiry by a British judge concluded on Thursday that the dying former KGB operative was probably right. For the first time, the Russian president was officially implicated in a murder that seemed plucked from the pages of a Cold War spy novel but actually played out in the bar of a posh hotel in 21st-century London.

The victim: an outspoken Kremlin critic who had defected to Britain, joined the payroll of British intelligence and accused Putin of vices­ including corruption and pedophilia. The killers: a pair of assassins who, the report found, were almost certainly acting on orders from the Russian spy service, the FSB, and who left a trail of radioactive evidence strewn across London. The weapons of choice: one teacup and one massive dose of a rare nuclear isotope, polonium.

The conclusions instantly set off a furious diplomatic row, with British and Russian officials accusing each other of treachery and deceit. British Prime Minister David Cameron called the findings of “state-sponsored” murder in his capital city “absolutely appalling.” A Kremlin spokesman, without apparent irony, said the report would “further poison the atmosphere.”

But there was a limit to how much damage the report could do to relations that are already badly frayed. The inquiry's findings come at a highly sensitive time, as the West seeks Russian cooperation in ending the Syrian war. The British government's response to the report reflected that delicate dynamic, with officials lashing out verbally but backing away from the sort of retaliation that could truly bite in Moscow. Cameron acknowledged as much, saying that Britain needed to engage with Russia on Syria but would do so ""with clear eyes and a very cold heart.""

Britain immediately summoned the Russian ambassador to express “profound displeasure” at what Home Secretary Theresa May called Moscow’s “blatant and unacceptable breach of the most fundamental tenets of international law.”

But speaking from the floor of the House of Commons, May beat back suggestions from opposition lawmakers that the government go further. She argued that Britain had already retaliated against Moscow in 2007 when preliminary inquiries into the killing suggested the hand of the Russian state.

“It is in no sense business as usual” between Britain and Russia, she said, adding that Cameron would discuss the matter with Putin “at the next available opportunity.”

That cautious stance is likely to disappoint Litvinenko’s wife, who called Thursday for Britain to expel Russian intelligence officials and enact new sanctions in response to the killing of her husband. Speaking before the government’s response became public, Marina Litvinenko said her husband’s dying belief had been vindicated.

“I am, of course, very pleased that the words my husband spoke on his deathbed — when he accused Mr. Putin of his murder — have been proved true,” she told reporters outside the Royal Courts of Justice in central London.

But it is highly unlikely that his killers will face justice any time soon for an assassination that a British parliamentary committee has described as “a miniature nuclear attack on the streets of London.”

British officials on Thursday reiterated requests for Russia to extradite the two alleged killers, Andrei Lugovoi and Dimitry Kovtun. Yet even with the new findings, Russia does not extradite its citizens, and Lugovoi has been rewarded in the years since the killing with a seat in parliament.

Lugovoi, a former KGB officer, on Thursday called the allegations against him “absurd.”

“These are lies, total lies, nonsense,” he told the Ekho Moskvy radio station.

Kovtun, now a businessman, described the charges as based on “falsified and fabricated evidence,” the Interfax news agency reported.

Britain announced Thursday that it had seized the assets of the two men, although that was believed to be a largely symbolic gesture. Ben Emmerson, the attorney for Litvinenko’s wife, acknowledged that the two would not stand trial until “the final fall of Vladimir Putin.”

The inquiry into Litvinenko’s death was led by retired High Court judge Robert Owen and was set up at the direction of the British government. The final report, the product of more than three years of work and set out over 328 pages, suggests that Putin had a personal motive for wanting Litvinenko dead because the defector had become such a fierce critic.

Although the inquiry stops short of conclusively blaming Putin — noting the opaque nature of Kremlin politics — it finds that there is “strong circumstantial evidence that the Russian State was responsible for Mr. Litvinenko’s death.” And citing the high-stakes nature of an operation to assassinate a former KGB officer on British soil, it finds that the operation would probably not have gone ahead without Putin’s direct approval.

Share this article Share

“The FSB operation to kill Mr. Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr. [Nikolai] Patrushev [then head of the FSB] and also by President Putin,” the report concludes.

In Moscow, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “such quasi-investigations, as we have today, can only further poison the atmosphere of our relations.”

Having worked in counter­intelligence for the KGB and its successor, the FSB, Litvinenko was fired in 1998 after holding a news conference in which he was sharply critical of the agency and, by implication, its then-director: Putin.

He defected to Britain two years later and spent years on the payroll of its main foreign intelligence agency, MI6. Litvinenko also assisted Spanish intelligence agencies with their investigations into Russian crime networks.

In addition to his covert work, Litvinenko was a prolific writer, publishing books and articles that were unsparing in their criticism of Russia's security services generally and of Putin in particular. One article even accused the Russian president of pedophilia.

Litvinenko had become a British citizen just weeks before his death, a move that he had told friends would protect him from the reach of his jilted former Russian comrades. “Now they will not be able to touch me,” he told one, according to Thursday's report.

But in fact, Litvinenko remained very much in the sights of Russia’s security services. Troops even used a picture of his face for target practice, the report found.

Lugovoi and Kovtun have long been suspected of carrying out Litvinenko’s killing. But Thursday’s report lays out a comprehensive case linking them to his death. According to the report, the two men lured Litvinenko to the Pine Bar at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair on Nov. 1, 2006, ostensibly to discuss a business deal, and served him a cup of cold green tea.

Traces of polonium 210 were later found in many of the places the alleged killers had visited: the bar’s bathroom, their hotel rooms, a boardroom where they conducted an earlier meeting, a soccer stadium where they watched a game and the plane that ferried them back to Russia. But the highest concentrations were discovered at the table where the three men were sitting, and in and around the teapot.

The polonium, the inquiry finds, was manufactured in a nuclear reactor, suggesting the role of a government rather than criminal networks.

The report conclusively rules out suggestions that Litvinenko poisoned himself, or that he was poisoned by others, as Russian officials have suggested.

“The scientific evidence,” Owen, the judge, said at a Thursday new conference, “demonstrates conclusively that Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned by Andrei Lugovoi and Dimitry Kovtun.”

But Owen said the two killers had no “personal reason” to kill Litvinenko. “All the evidence points in one direction, namely that when they killed Mr. Litvinenko, they were acting on behalf of someone else.”

Litvinenko became seriously ill later on the night of Nov. 1, 2006, the sixth anniversary of his arrival in Britain. He died at a London hospital 22 days later.

Ted Cruz (Tex.) came to an end on the debate stage here Thursday. The two Republican presidential candidates, locked in a tight race to win the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, argued over whether Cruz meets the constitutional requirements to serve as president and whether Trump is a trustworthy conservative or is tainted by what Cruz called “New York values.”

Theirs was far from the only battle that broke out in the sixth GOP debate of the 2016 campaign season. Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) had intensely personal clashes with both Cruz and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Rubio and Christie are both hoping to emerge from the crowded Republican field as the establishment’s champion against the forces of insurgency that Trump and Cruz represent.

Until recently, it was in both Trump’s and Cruz’s interest to avoid a direct confrontation. Cruz was leery of alienating Trump’s supporters — who might come to him, if the incendiary billionaire were to self-destruct. Trump, for his part, did not consider Cruz much of a threat.

On Thursday, they went so far as to question each other’s fitness to govern.

Trump contended that Cruz’s birth to a U.S. citizen in Canada might disqualify him from becoming president because the Constitution decrees that only a “natural born citizen” may hold the office.

“There’s a big question mark on your head. And you can’t do that to the party. You really can’t,” Trump told Cruz.

The senator from Texas retorted that Trump was motivated more by his political prospects than any constitutional concern.

“I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa,” Cruz said. “But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under long-standing U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.”

Then it was Cruz’s turn to go on offense.

Repeating something he first said in a radio interview, Cruz charged that Trump had “New York values” — invoking that city’s reputation, particularly in red-state America, as the bastion of the liberal elite.

“I can frame it another way,” Cruz said. “Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I’m just saying.”

Top quotes from the sixth Republican presidential debate + 14 The candidates shared these comments in North Charleston, S.C. in the year’s first debate.

Trump responded with indignation, saying New York City is home to “loving people, wonderful people.” He recalled the fall of the World Trade Center towers on Sept. 11, 2001, noting the “smell of death” that pervaded the city for months.

“I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York,” Trump said. He added, “That was a very insulting statement that Ted made.”

As Trump and Cruz argued over the latter’s constitutional qualifications to be president, the other candidates struggled to get a word in. Rubio drew applause when he interjected, “I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV, but I think we have to get back to what this election ought to be about.”

However, when Rubio and Cruz got their chance to go at it, theirs turned out to be an esoteric back-and-forth over the consistency of their Senate votes, particularly on immigration.

After Rubio ticked through votes that he described as flip-flops and political opportunism on Cruz’s part, the Texan said: “He had no fewer than 11 attacks there. I appreciate you dumping your oppo research folder on the debate stage.”

Rubio insisted: “No, it’s your record.”

At that point, former Florida governor Jeb Bush interjected: “This latest back-and-forth between two backbench senators, it explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C.”

Christie, who has often dismissed the Senate as nothing more than a debating society, interrupted another argument between Cruz and Rubio over taxes, saying: “You’ve already had your chance, Marco. You blew it.”

The disputes that broke out during the debate, which was sponsored by Fox Business Network and included the GOP’s seven leading presidential hopefuls, have been simmering on the campaign trail in recent days. The event gave the candidates a chance to confront one another face to face, rather than through their stump speeches, surrogates and allied super PACs.

Among the Republicans, several battles are going on at once. Where Trump and Cruz are each looking to win the caucuses by claiming to be the one who can slay the old order, the field also includes a host of current and former governors and senators.

Nearly as important as which candidate comes in first place is the question of which will emerge from what is being called the “establishment lane.”

Rubio repeated his charge that Christie, the governor of a heavily Democratic state, has a record too liberal for a conservative party. He noted that Christie once supported Common Core educational standards, backed some gun-control legislation and supported Obama’s nomination of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

“Our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country,” Rubio said. “It cannot be someone that agrees with his agenda. . . . Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports.”

Turning to face Rubio, Christie accused the senator of being loose with his facts and manufacturing indignation because Christie has emerged as a political threat. He reminded Rubio that he had once called him “a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed,” but that “he’s changed his tune.”

Christie recalled October’s debate, when Rubio responded to an attack from Bush by saying someone had convinced him that Bush had to hit his onetime protege. “It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco’s ear, too,” Christie said.

As the leading candidates feuded, Ben Carson — the mild-mannered retired neurosurgeon who briefly topped the polls — urged civility. “We have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves and we lose the next election and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it,” he said.

The call did not stop Bush from going after Trump, describing his rival as “unhinged” for his policies on immigration and Muslims and misguided in his plans for high tariffs on Chinese imports.

“This would be devastating for our economy. We need somebody with a steady hand being president of the United States,” Bush said.

Trump responded with an attack on Bush’s personality.

“We don’t need a weak person being president of the United States,” Trump said, returning to an old insult that Bush is ­“low-energy.” “We don’t need that. We don’t need that.”

Trump brushed off criticism of his demeanor, saying, “I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.”

“Our military is a disaster,” he said. “Our health care is a horror show. Obamacare, we’re going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry.”

The debate came just 48 hours after President Obama delivered the final State of the Union address of his presidency, which included sharp condemnation of the angry GOP rhetoric over Muslims, immigration and other issues. At the debate, the candidates flung zinger after zinger in an attempt to outdo one another in delivering the most visceral condemnation of both Obama and Clinton, his first-term secretary of state and the leading Democratic presidential candidate.

Christie called Obama “a petulant child” and likened his State of the Union to “storytime” because it painted, in Christie’s view, too rosy a picture of the country.

“We are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall,” Christie said of Obama.

The language was just as strident in discussing Clinton. Bush suggested that she “might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse” because she is under FBI investigation for her email practices. Then Rubio stepped up the rhetoric and charged that Clinton was “disqualified from being commander in chief.”

When co-moderator Maria Bartiromo asked Cruz about a New York Times report Wednesday that he failed to properly disclose loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank during his 2012 Senate campaign, Cruz used the moment to slam “the mainstream media.”

“Yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other,” Cruz said. “But if that’s the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.”

Although Ohio Gov. John Kasich did not figure in the more contentious exchanges, he sought to appeal directly to frustrated middle- and working-class families.

“People are upset,” he said. “You’re 50 or 51 years old and some kid walks in and tells you you’re out of work and you don’t know where to go and where to turn. Do we have an answer for that? We do.”"

http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/donald-trump-sarah-palin-218000",0,"The escalating feud between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz has expanded into a fight for the backing of the GOP’s anti-establishment establishment, with both seeking validation from figures with immense influence on the right. Trump unfurled a highly anticipated endorsement from former Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin while campaigning in Iowa on Tuesday, giving him a jolt among the party's restless base. Palin's endorsement came a day after Trump received the effusive praise of evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr., whose views could help Trump among religious voters.

But other conservative voices, many of whom had cheered Trump in recent months, have rallied to Cruz's side. On talk radio, Mark Levin and Glenn Beck have fumed over Trump's recent questions about Cruz's Canadian birth. In Cruz, they see a movement leader who champions their values, whereas they say Trump is an interloper who lacks an ideological core.

The frenzied courting of conservatives is testament to their power in shaping a contest that is being dominated by two Washington outsiders. Neither has won the backing of a single governor or senator — and it’s unclear that either man even wants to. In this race, it is the media titans, personalities and activists who have long stood on the GOP’s fringe who now have all the cachet.

“You need a scorecard to keep track,” said Craig Shirley, a conservative historian. “Talk radio and bloggers — anyone outside of the system is at the center of the party, and we’re witnessing in real time the shift away from the Republican establishment in deciding who the nominee will be.”

Palin on Tuesday described Trump as someone who could change the status quo in American politics, and she praised his values as a father and community leader.

“He builds big things, things that touch the sky,” she said as Trump looked on, glowingly. “He has spent his life looking up.”

Of the GOP leadership and critics of Trump, she said: “They are so busted. . . . What the heck would the establishment know about conservatism?”

After Palin finished, Trump waved and put his arm around her. “We’re going to give them hell,” he said as the crowd roared.

The value of Palin’s endorsement was hotly debated Tuesday, with Trump supporters saying her popularity in Iowa will give the reality-TV star a significant lift and Cruz backers playing down her impact.

Barry Bennett, Ben Carson’s former campaign manager, sided with those who thought it was consequential. “I think Sarah Palin actually helps Trump a lot because she’s showing them that it’s okay,” Bennett said. “Whatever lack of credentials he has, he’s making some inroads into places where we didn’t think he’d play.”

One key Cruz ally said Palin could help Trump win over women. “He’s a thrice-married, non-churchgoing billionaire, and she gives him credibility with conservative women,” said Kellyanne Conway, who manages a Cruz super PAC. “It’s a net positive.”

Palin’s move came as a surprise to some in her orbit, given her friendly rapport with both Trump and Cruz. In 2011, she dined with Trump at a pizza shop in New York as she mulled her own White House bid, and, according to Republicans familiar with her thinking, she has been increasingly enthusiastic about Trump as he has surged in the current race. Their circles also overlap: Trump’s political director, Michael Glassner, is a former Palin aide.

Aside from Palin, Trump's campaign is backed by prominent conservatives such as activist Phyllis Schlafly and radio host Michael Savage. Willie Robertson, a star of the ""Duck Dynasty"" ­reality-TV show, is with Trump, too.

Last week, it was Cruz who won the support of another ""Duck Dynasty"" star, when Phil Robertson signed on. The senator from Texas is also backed by longtime activists such as L. Brent Bozell III and Richard Viguerie, social conservative leader James Dobson, and actor James Woods.

It is on talk radio, especially, where Cruz has built support, which has proved critical now that Trump has taken to attacking him relentlessly. Most of these drive-time and lunch-hour heroes to rank-and-file Republicans were initially complimentary of Trump’s focus on illegal immigration last year, but they have since soured.

“I’m sick and tired of stupid talk!” Levin said Monday on his program. “This is why I’m sick and tired of stupid issues! I didn’t spend 40 years of my life — 45 to be exact — to reach a point where we actually might take back the White House with somebody who is conservative, whomever that is, to be discussing birther issues!”

On Saturday, Beck will appear in Waterloo, Iowa, at a rally hosted by a pro-Cruz super PAC. Those who are planning to be with Beck onstage attest to Cruz’s strength on the right in the state: Rep. Steve King, conservative author David Barton and Christian organizer Bob Vander Plaats. Cruz is banking on that deep goodwill, carefully built up over the course of the 2013 government shutdown and the 2014 elections, to sustain him.

Trump and Cruz had spent most of the campaign praising each other, but they have switched to attack mode ahead of the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.

Trump’s case against Cruz is more temperamental than ideological. He has called the Texan “nasty” and disliked by his Senate colleagues, and has wondered aloud, repeatedly, whether Cruz’s birth in Canada leaves him vulnerable to lawsuits over his citizenship.

“When you talk about temperament, Ted has got a rough temperament,” Trump said Tuesday in Winterset, Iowa, ahead of the Palin event. “You can’t call people liars on the Senate floor, when they are your leader.”

Cruz has a more understated approach. He mostly avoids taking personal shots at Trump and keeps his emphasis on the policy differences between them, pointing out where the businessman has sided with Democrats, in particular.

“If you’re looking for someone who’s a dealmaker, who will capitulate even more to the Democrats and give in to Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi, then perhaps Donald Trump is your man,” Cruz told reporters Tuesday at a stop in Barnstead, N.H.

Palin’s endorsement, which came after days of teasing by Trump’s campaign and widespread speculation on cable TV, riled the right in the hours before it was made official.

Appearing Tuesday morning on CNN, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler called Palin’s expected nod a “blow” to her reputation because “she would be endorsing someone who’s held progressive views all their life.”

“I think if it was Sarah Palin — let me just say, I’d be deeply disappointed,” he said.

Supporters of Palin and Trump responded with fury. In a blog post, Palin’s eldest daughter, Bristol, wrote that Tyler’s remark “makes me hope my mom does endorse Trump.”

By the afternoon, after Sarah Palin’s endorsement, Cruz felt compelled to clarify that Tyler’s view did not reflect his own. “I love Sarah Palin. Sarah Palin is fantastic,” he told reporters. “I will always remain a big, big fan of Sarah Palin’s.”

The drama Tuesday was not limited to the right. Fault lines were beginning to be drawn by members of the GOP leadership as they grappled with the possibility of having the race come down to Trump or Cruz, rather than a candidate who is a more natural fit with donors and party brass.

Speaking at an Iowa energy summit, Gov. Terry Branstad (R) called Cruz an “opponent of renewable fuels” who should be defeated.

Trump reacted gleefully on Twitter: “Wow, the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that ‘Ted Cruz must be defeated.’ Big shocker! People do not like Ted.”

Branstad’s position reflects a broader unease with Cruz among Republican leaders. In Trump, most party leaders see a candidate who is unpredictable and controversial, but far less ideological than Cruz and, therefore, more likely to work with them. Several have reached out to Trump in recent weeks as their preferred candidates have stalled in the polls.

Cruz was dismissive of Branstad and said the development signals his own stature as the race’s only true conservative outsider. “It is no surprise that the establishment is in full panic mode,” Cruz told reporters Tuesday.

Rush Limbaugh, who has not picked a side in the Trump-Cruz standoff, said on his program Tuesday that “Trump is trying to position Cruz as angry, unstable, can’t get along with anybody, and thus will not be able to do deals. . . . Cruz is trying to highlight Trump’s past liberalism, ‘New York values,’ what have you. . . . Now, we’ll see if this works.”"

http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/29/opinions/iowa-republican-debate-opinion-roundup/index.html",0,"Seven of the eight leading Republican presidential candidates gathered in Iowa on Thursday night for the seventh debate of the race. Donald Trump, the race's clear front-runner, was less than 10 miles away from the debate site — holding his own counter-rally after deciding not to participate for decidedly vague reasons.

I watched the whole thing. (We also annotated it!) Below is my take on the best and the worst from the night that was.

Winners

• Rand Paul: Maybe the senator just needed to take a debate off. After not making the main stage in the sixth debate (and refusing to appear in the undercard debate), Paul was a major player in this one. He showed off his trademark willingness to needle the other candidates — he went after Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz at various points — but also offered nuanced thoughts on racial profiling and abortion. This was the Paul whom many political observers — myself included — thought we might see in this campaign: A candidate willing and able to speak to issues his party has struggled to address in recent years. Too little, too late. But, at least he had a moment.

• Megyn Kelly: There has rarely been a debate moderator who has come under as much scrutiny as Kelly has during the course of this campaign. Despite all of that negative attention, Kelly showed on Thursday night why she is the face of Fox News. She was pointed, tough and well-versed on the issues. And, more important to me? She showed her sense of humor and a willingness to not take herself too seriously. That she performed so well with so many eyes on her speaks incredibly highly of her abilities.

• Jeb Bush: If you had any doubt about how much Donald Trump is in Bush's head, this debate should have cleared it up. The former Florida governor was, from the get-go, more relaxed and more forceful in this Trump-less debate than he has been in the previous six debates where Trump was included. He owned his family's political legacy unapologetically. He fought Rubio to a draw in an immigration back and forth. He regularly was the only candidate — aside from Paul — who answered the questions asked of him. Bush is still a somewhat (okay, very) awkward candidate — his halting closing statement was painful — who doesn't really like going on the attack. But, without Trump looming over him, Bush looked positively presidential.

• Video reels of past candidate statements: Fox ran video clips of both Rubio and Cruz saying things in the past that they have run away from in this campaign. And it was great! This is what debates should be about. Holding candidates accountable. Asking them to explain why what they said four years ago isn't what they are saying now. I only wish Fox did this for all of the candidates.

• Commercials: Thank you, Fox News! A commercial every 30 minutes or so worked nicely both with my bathroom needs and my desire to consume somewhere between 100 and 120 Oreos. #blessed

Losers

• Ted Cruz: He did the thing I hate the most in debates — complain about the rules — when he tried to game a bit more talking time and got shut down by moderator Chris Wallace. The senator's joking threat that if he kept taking incoming from the other candidates he might leave the stage (Trump reference!) fell flat. He was on the wrong end of a scolding by Paul over his conservative righteousness. And, time and time again, Cruz found himself insisting that on a panoply of issues — military spending, immigration etc. — everyone was either wrong about his position or didn't understand it well enough. That's too much defense for Cruz to play — especially in a debate without Trump.

• Ben Carson: Whoa boy. Carson swung from barely being asked any questions to providing answers that often bordered on incoherence. His response to a question about how to deal with Russia simply made no sense — further adding to the narrative that he is far, far out of his depth on foreign policy. At one point, he seemed stunned to even get a question, which isn't the best look for a guy running to be the leader of a 300-million-person country. Carson looked out of his league tonight.

• Chris Christie: The New Jersey governor felt a little like a Johnny One-Note tonight. For every question he was asked, the answer was how terrible Hillary Clinton is, was and will be. Okay, I get that bashing Clinton is never a bad idea in a Republican primary, but the strategy made Christie look very two-dimensional and brought to my mind memories of Rudy Giuliani's campaign in 2008. And not in a good way.

* Fox News Channel: The simple fact is that from an entertainment perspective, this debate was less interesting than virtually all of the previous six. The reason? Trump wasn't there. That, of course, is not entirely (or even mainly) Fox's fault. But, my guess is that the ratings for this debate will be significantly lower than the other Republican debates on major cable channels. And, if you don't think ratings are the way networks judge success, I have a whole mess of compact discs — they're the future of music! — to sell you."

As they huddled that day last March in the converted barn that serves as her home office in Chappaqua, N.Y., Robby Mook thought he ought to call the presumed Democratic front-runner’s attention to a rumor that was starting to go around.

“Bernie Sanders is going to be a real contender if he gets in,” Mook recalls warning his new boss. Mook grew up in Vermont and knew what happened to those who underestimated Burlington’s onetime mayor.

“I’ve seen this guy in action,” he said.

Clinton, he said, had the same uneasy feeling about her ex-colleague from the Senate.

Sanders turned out to be more dire a threat than either could have anticipated.

Advertisement

Not only did Sanders live up to Mook’s assessment of his political skills, but in Iowa, he fit the moment and the passions of a Democratic base that put him in position to pull off one of the biggest upsets in the history of the caucuses.

Clinton was determined not to repeat the mistakes of 2008, when her seeming inevitability melted in Iowa like a snowman in April.

This time, she accepted the state and its quirky caucus system on their own terms, building a formidable army of operatives and volunteers. Staffers at the Brooklyn headquarters were instructed to cater to the needs of state-level organizers.

The meticulous work proved crucial as Clinton’s wide lead began to evaporate over the summer. She had to grapple with a Republican onslaught over her handling of the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. And she endured the controversy over her use of a private email server.

In Sanders, Clinton came up against a challenger who lacked her organizational firepower but campaigned as a repudiation of the front-runner’s establishment credentials. Sanders’s vow to blow up the big banks effectively painted Clinton as an ally of Wall Street.

What it looked like on the ground in Iowa for the caucuses + 40 A few hundred thousand Iowa residents gather in a couple thousand caucus sites and finally, finally kick-start the presidential nomination process.

The mood in Iowa proved unwelcoming to another establishment candidate, former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley. His record of achievements checked just about every box on the liberal wish list but never found traction. He quickly fizzled despite early expectations that he would have his moment, too.

Sanders’s rise in Iowa exposed weaknesses that could haunt the Democratic front-runner.

A self-described democratic socialist who was running 30 points behind her in the polls as recently as November, Sanders drew support from young people, liberals and independents.

The photo finish showed that Republicans are not the only voters looking for qualities beyond experience and electability.

Building on a message

The reality of what was happening dawned on Sanders when he got stuck in traffic on a Sunday morning.

The senator from Vermont had launched his long-shot bid five days before. He was headed to a May 31 rally at the American Indian Center in Minneapolis, his first big campaign event outside his New England home turf.

But Sanders was still blocks away — and the car he was in was not moving.

“Is there a wreck ahead?” Sanders anxiously asked his field director, Phil Fiermonte.

“No,” Fiermonte replied, “they’re here to see you.”

More than 3,000 of them, many standing outside because the hall was full.

“It never occurred to me in a million years that line was for us,” Sanders recalled in a telephone interview Sunday, as his campaign bus chugged between Marshalltown and Ames on the eve of the Iowa caucuses. “I said, ‘Whoa.’ That was the first inkling that I had that this campaign was catching on.”

And the crowds kept growing — in Denver, in Madison, Wis., even red-state bastions such as Dallas and Houston. At the Phoenix Convention Center in mid-July, he drew upward of 11,000, more than double the number who had shown up there for Republican Donald Trump the week before. The biggest was in Portland, Ore., where 28,000 came to hear him in August.

Still, Sanders barely registered in the national polls. His organization was starting from nothing. Clinton had hired most of the name-brand political talent and had all the big endorsements. Many of those who hadn’t joined her were leery of crossing her.

In the early days of the Sanders campaign, “there was a guy. There was a message. That was it,” said political consultant Tad Devine, who had worked for a couple of Sanders’s congressional campaigns and signed on for his presidential one.

But Sanders had been thinking about doing this for a long time. He had been traveling the country venting his outrage over income inequality, the excesses of Wall Street and the corruption of the campaign finance system. His speeches found receptive audiences, but he did not seem to be resonating beyond them.

In March 2014, he sought out Bill Press, a liberal radio talk-show host who had been chairman of the California Democratic Party in the mid-1990s.

“He told me that he had come to the realization that the only way people take you seriously and listen to your ideas is if you run for president,” Press recalled. “He thought that was kind of silly, but that’s the way it was.”

For his own part, Press said: “I didn’t want to see a coronation. I thought the party would fall asleep, and Hillary is at her best with a challenge.”

Press put together two dinners for Sanders with about a dozen people at his house on Capitol Hill. One was in April, the other in November.

Among those who attended one or both: Susan McCue, a former chief of staff for Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.); Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.); Brad Woodhouse, a former Democratic National Committee spokesman who now heads the liberal super PAC American Bridge 21st Century; Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.); and Alyssa Mastromonaco, former deputy chief of staff in the Obama White House who had answered phones in Sanders’s congressional office back when she was a college student in Vermont.

At the first dinner, “Bernie gave his ideas. We all kicked it around,” Press said. “The main thing that came out of the first meeting was there was a possibility and a need for somebody to raise those issues, but if he ran, he should definitely run as a Democrat.”

Devine led the discussion at the second dinner, and “basically laid out a plan of how to get from here to there,” Press said. “It was much more focused and much more real. Bernie took that, and off he goes. It was only a matter of when, not if, he announced.”

That this would be an unconventional, no-nonsense operation was clear from the outset.

Sanders made his April 30 announcement at a 10-minute news conference on a grassy spot near the Capitol parking lot known as the Senate Swamp. With tourists and congressional staffers wandering in the background, he opened: “We don’t have an endless amount of time. I’ve gotta get back.”

A month later would come the camera-ready formal launch. Sanders — standing against glittering, sun-washed Lake Champlain, and with his hair combed this time — promised a cheering crowd of 5,000: “Today, with your support and the support of millions of people throughout our country, we begin a political revolution to transform our country.”

Weathering the crises

At Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters, Mook had scribbled a message on a whiteboard: “What have you done for Iowa today?”

Occasionally, someone would erase it, and Mook would write it again.

The line was a reminder of how different the campaign operation was from 2008, when Clinton’s team had debated internally whether to even compete in Iowa.

Nationally, however, the opening months of her presidential campaign were a deluge of bad news for Clinton.

First came the revelation that she had been using a private email account, rather than a government one, for conducting business as secretary of state. Then a spate of stories about the finances of the Clinton Foundation and her six-figure speaking fees. Then came the news that Vice President Biden was considering a late entry into the race — in part because some Democrats worried that Clinton was starting to look like a weak general-election candidate.

In October, it was coming to a head, with the added tests of the first Democratic debate and her grilling before the House Select Committee on Benghazi.

The day before she was to testify, Clinton and her aides were holding a prep session at her dining room table in Washington when communications direction Jennifer Palmieri got a text message telling her to turn on CNN.

Biden was heading for the Rose Garden, with President Obama in tow. That choice of venue could mean only one thing, they knew: Biden was not running.

One crisis was averted. But another one was brewing. While the Benghazi hearing was a chance for Clinton to shine while fending off attacks from political enemies, aides knew that any mistake or gaffe could prompt more doubts about her strength.

The next morning, as Clinton was preparing to leave home for Capitol Hill, she got a jarring call from longtime aide Cheryl Mills. With just an hour to go before the start of the hearing, the Republicans had just dropped a binder full of hundreds of documents they intended to use in their questioning — documents that Clinton had not prepared for.

Among them, Clinton aides say, was an email she had sent to her daughter, Chelsea, on the night of the attacks in which the secretary blamed “an Al Q[a]eda-like group.” GOP lawmakers saw it as a smoking gun, evidence that the Obama administration knew the attack had been terrorism even though officials initially said the incident had been sparked by an anti-Muslim video.

But Clinton lawyer David Kendall had negotiated to prevent something that could have been more damaging. They feared that committee Republicans would have Clinton raise her right hand and be sworn in at the opening of the hearing, which would have produced an image that would be a GOP admaker’s dream. Instead, she signed an oath before the hearing started.

A spokesman for the House committee said the leadership offered Clinton the chance to be sworn in privately to avoid a political spectacle. In addition, said the spokesman, Jamal Ware, the committee does not typically give witnesses advance information but provided the additional documents to Clinton as a result of negotiations with Kendall. Because Clinton had decided which emails to disclose, Ware said, her surprise reflected a “failure on the Clinton team’s part to prepare her with the materials they knew they had turned over to the committee.”

Clinton emerged from October with her poll numbers on an upward swing. Meanwhile, Mook was preparing for the long game. He had already moved organizers into Colorado and Minnesota, which like Iowa are caucus states, set to hold their contests on March 1. In other words, they were just the kind of place where a political movement like the one that Sanders had ignited could run up the delegate score.

As voting day in Iowa drew near, former president Bill Clinton hit the trail for his wife, calling Mook frequently to ask him questions and advice. He urged the campaign to focus more on her biography — which it has.

“Have we told people about how she reformed the educational system in Arkansas?” Bill Clinton would say, according to Mook. “Have we told people about the pre-K work she did? Have we told people about the Children’s Defense Fund?”

Mook added of the former president: “He’s also a junkie. He just likes to talk shop.”

‘The surprise campaign’

Sanders recruited a trusted former aide, Jeff Weaver, to be his campaign manager.

Weaver had left as Sanders’s chief of staff to open a comic book and gaming store in 2009. He had been reluctant to be drawn back into politics, especially for a quixotic venture, but Sanders convinced him it was not. “It became clear to me from the beginning that he was running to win,” Weaver said. “This was not just a speaking tour.”

Sanders also made clear what kind of organization he wanted.

“It had to be a modern campaign, with all the modern tools of running, without becoming a corporatized environment,” Weaver said.

The money came quickly. Devine had told Sanders that he had to raise at least $40 million — and preferably $50 million — if he wanted to be competitive by the Iowa caucuses. By the end of last year, they had raised $73 million. In January, an additional $20 million poured in, almost all of it from contributions that averaged about $27.

That was enough for Sanders to put an additional 139 organizers in Iowa in January, more than doubling the total the campaign was saying publicly. As the political world focused throughout the summer on the gains Sanders was making against Clinton in New Hampshire, his campaign was building an Iowa operation earlier, and with more resources, than was generally recognized

Weaver called it “the other campaign . . . the surprise campaign.”

Sanders’s first Iowa rally, which was in late May in Davenport, drew 700 people — the largest Iowa crowd any candidate had seen at that point. Volunteers were stationed there an hour and a half early to collect information about the attendees.

Typically at that early stage, voters are just starting to shop around for a candidate. But to the surprise of the embryonic Sanders campaign, one-third of those who attended that rally arrived ready to sign up as committed to the candidate.

‘There was this organic thing happening,” said Pete D’Alessandro, the Iowa director. “That’s where Senator Sanders knew it from the beginning. His message — this was something people were waiting to rally behind.”

Although there was no doubt about the enthusiasm, marshalling it into 1,681 precinct caucuses presented a challenge.

The campaign estimated that as many as 40 percent of the supporters it identified had never been to a caucus before. At meetings of his precinct captains, D’Alessandro would ask which of them would be attending their first; sometimes, half the people in the room would raise their hands. And then there was the occasional volunteer who would tell him: “Yeah, I haven’t done this since McGovern,” referring to the Democrat who ran in 1972.

The campaign made an intense effort to train organizers and volunteers on how to canvass and phone-bank. Staffers sent out regular math exercises for them to do over the instant-messaging system Slack, to make sure they understood the calculations they would have to make under the arcane rules on caucus night.

Sanders’s operation tried to seize on opportunities presented by the unlikely sensation that the gruff 74-year-old senator was creating among young voters. Organizers got a list of 25,000 high school seniors to target, aware that anyone who would be 18 or older in November is eligible to caucus.

In the tiny hamlet of Underwood outside Council Bluffs, the campaign signed up 35 12th graders — potentially enough to tip the balance on caucus night in a town of only 932 people.

All of it was a bet on turnout. By the day before the caucuses, the campaign’s internal models showed that it would take 170,000 or more, second only to the record 240,000 that showed up in 2008, for Sanders to win.

“The thing that keeps me up at night — What if we are wrong? What if everyone’s right, and these people have just been coming to rallies?” D’Alessandro said as he headed into the final weekend.

For most of the early months, Sanders continued to shun many of the trappings of a big-league political campaign. He did not hire a pollster or set up a voter modeling operation until October.

In retrospect, his campaign manager, Weaver, said, “If I had known the money would be there, I would have scaled up bigger earlier.”

There were rough patches that showed how hard it was to go from running for office in a small, ethnically homogeneous state to a national campaign. Sanders seemed to be taken off balance when Black Lives Matter protesters began showing up at his events. And pundits wondered whether he had blundered at the first debate when the biggest controversy surrounding Clinton came up and he declared, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!”

But the fact that whether he could beat Clinton in Iowa was even a question became an accomplishment in itself, given how far back Sanders had started.

And now, a party that expected a coronation is settling in for a marathon.

Still, the race for the top spot was not the big news of the night — or, in Clinton's case, far into the following day, when the Associated Press finally called the race for her. The real winners were Marco Rubio, with his remarkably strong third-place finish, and Bernie Sanders, with his virtual tie.

In the short term, Donald Trump was the biggest loser — true of any front-runner but even truer of a candidate whose campaign raison d’etre is that he is a winner. Yet in the longer term, if the legacy of Iowa is that it helps propel Rubio to the nomination — and, sure, that’s a big “if” at this point — the even bigger loser could be Clinton, facing a general-election challenger far more daunting than Trump or Cruz.

On the Republican side, the Iowa results put Rubio in a strong position to break away from the crowded middle-of-the-GOP-road pack and claim the mantle of establishment alternative to Cruz and Trump. The best evidence of that new reality? Chris Christie unloading on Rubio the morning after, as ""the boy in the bubble . . . who's constantly scripted and controlled because he can't answer your questions.""

Not to take away credit from Cruz for being the Trump-slayer, or at least the Trump-wounder. Cruz upended last-minute polling expectations and demonstrated the power of dogged organization. The elaborate network of evangelical Christian support and intensive voter contact and analytics he constructed outdid the swaggering hold-a-rally-and-they-will-caucus approach of Trump.

But in addition to the impressive Cruz ground game, Monday’s results illustrate the limitations of Trump’s appeal. All week in Iowa, I interviewed undecided Republican voters. They were torn — except when it came to Trump. He had been crossed off almost all their lists, as too big a blowhard, too politically inexperienced, too ideologically untrustworthy. Their choices, for the most part, came down to Cruz and Rubio.

That Rubio came within a percentage point of passing Trump is the most significant fact of the night. Rubio’s overperformance is bad news for Christie, Jeb Bush and John Kasich. New Hampshire is not obviously fertile territory for Cruz; it is better suited to Rubio.

There, he can dial down the heavy-handed appeals to evangelical voters and amp up his moving life story. I left the Rubio events I attended in Iowa with a revived sense that Clinton should be very nervous about the prospect of facing him in a general-election campaign.

Assuming, as I continue to do, that she gets there. Still, don't be fooled by the Clinton campaign crowing about ""winning"" Iowa. Pause for a caucus reality check here: Judging the victor by differences of tenths of a percentage point is ridiculous when counting delegate numbers, not tens of thousands of individual votes.

A win is a win when you’re talking about Florida’s electoral votes — not when you’re measuring state delegate equivalents. Sanders’s performance offered concrete electoral proof of the power of his anti-establishment appeal and demonstrated his capacity to compete on par with Clinton, whose organization had far more time and resources on the ground in Iowa. This isn’t the blow the state inflicted on Clinton in 2008, but it’s not a victory either.

A functional tie in Iowa and the likelihood of a Sanders win in New Hampshire do not augur the end of Clinton’s candidacy — far from it. This was not the triumphant start Clinton once imagined, but the post-New Hampshire calendar is far more favorable to her demographically and, despite Sanders’s efforts to catch up, organizationally.

Nonetheless, Sanders — how amazing is this? — could turn out to enjoy a huge fundraising advantage. Clinton has more cash on hand, but Sanders's army of small-dollar donors is a replenishing well on which he can repeatedly draw.

It was telling that Clinton campaign officials diverted her, days before the caucuses, to a fundraising event in Philadelphia — incurring the predictable criticism from Sanders that she was once again raising money from financial interests.

In short, Sanders is not disappearing anytime soon. Trump is not running away with the nomination. For both parties, the Iowa results reinforce the likelihood that both nomination battles will stretch well into the spring, if not beyond."
2995,2995,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/03/rand-paul-suspends-presidential-campaign/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_paul-915am%3Ahomepage/story
http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/rand-paul-dropping-out-of-white-house-race-218675",0,"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced Wednesday that he is suspending his presidential campaign, bringing an end to a bid that began with aspirations of expanding the libertarian base that his father, Ron Paul, built into a powerful national coalition. ""It's been an incredible honor to run a principled campaign for the White House,"" Paul said in a statement. ""Today, I will end where I began, ready and willing to fight for the cause of Liberty.""

The low-key senator, as apt to quote a philosopher as to quote Pink Floyd, struggled in a year dominated by hard-line outsiders such as Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and businessman Donald Trump. In a call with reporters, his campaign strategists bemoaned that the mogul had sucked the ""oxygen"" out of the race, and admitted hat his non-interventionist views on foreign policy were not embraced by Republicans as terrorism and unrest raged abroad.

Paul, a first-time candidate for national office, also found it difficult to persuade the supporters of his father — a former congressman from Texas who sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012 — to back him with enthusiasm. Although popular among libertarians, purists in that wing of the conservative movement questioned whether Paul was too mainstream.

“His decision to move to the middle and support a number of moderate Republicans in the 2014 elections, that sent us a real signal about the application of his ideology,” said Drew Ivers, Ron Paul’s 2012 Iowa chairman, who did not endorse Rand Paul.

“He muddled on his message, tried to get the left, and I told him it would backfire… I just saw someone trying to do too much and be too many things to too many people. His name is Paul, I told him. You can’t defy gravity.""

Paul, a 53-year-old ophthalmologist, was elected to the Senate in 2010 as part of the GOP's tea party wave. He will return to his work in the chamber and to his Senate reelection campaign, where he remains a top target of Democrats as they try to retake the majority this year.

According to Paul's campaign aides, the candidate decided to drop out after a disappointing finish in Monday's Iowa caucuses, where his father had placed a strong third in 2012.

Thanks again to the people of Iowa. It was great getting to meet you & I am especially grateful for the enthusiasm of students! Fight on! — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) February 2, 2016

Over the past day, Paul began to inform his key aides and donors that he would leave the race, then returned to Washington, D.C. to resume his work in the Senate. In his statement, Paul expressed confidence that his campaign, while unsuccessful, offered Republicans an alternative by focusing on issues he thinks are crucial to attracting minorities and young people to the party.

""Across the country thousands upon thousands of young people flocked to our message of limited government, privacy, criminal justice reform and a reasonable foreign policy,"" he said. ""Brushfires of Liberty were ignited, and those will carry on, as will I. Although, today I will suspend my campaign for President, the fight is far from over, I will continue to carry the torch for Liberty in the United States Senate and I look forward to earning the privilege to represent the people of Kentucky for another term.""

Longtime associates of Ron Paul framed Rand Paul’s departure from the race as a stumble rather than a crippling defeat in the younger Paul’s career — and for their movement. Paul ally Trygve Olson said that libertarians and other conservatives probably would consider Paul in a future presidential cycle that was less crowded and driven by a celebrity front-runner.

“Rand Paul remains the best advocate those conservative have in the United States Senate,” Olson said. “Even if he didn’t have the kind of success he wanted, he’s an important voice on a whole set of issues. Assuming he’s reelected, he will continue to be that voice and be the person putting them at the center of the radar.”

Olson said Ron Paul’s star turn in the 2008 race was driven as much by the national political environment as it was by the candidate’s performance. “When Ron ran then, he was able to tap into the angst that was out there about the war and foreign policy,” he said.

Paul's method of campaigning echoed his father's. He favored small gatherings where he could make lengthy speeches and preferred orations that cited Montesquieu. While he was accessible to the media, he did not relish banter with reporters or the glad-handing demands of the campaign. Some candidates used every spare minute to meet potential voters; reporters who ran into Paul at an airport usually caught him reading a book.

But his ambitions were grand. Two years ago, he became the first Republican to assemble a network in all 50 states as a precursor to a presidential run — a sign that he was looking to build a coalition that wasn't as ad hoc as his father's.

Magazine covers proclaimed Paul to be one of the party’s brightest and most interesting voices — a hemp-wearing, curly-haired maverick, who could, in his words, spread the Republican message to ""voters with tattoos and without tattoos.""

He began courting Wall Street titans and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who had donated to the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, attending elite conclaves in Utah and elsewhere. His pitch combined his antagonism toward the National Security Agency’s surveillance programs with what he called “crunchy conservatism,” a prioritization of drug-sentencing reform, the environment and civil liberties.

In 2013, as the Republican Party was casting about for new leadership, Paul filibustered the nomination of the new FBI director and only quit the floor ten and a half hours later, after the White House put out a letter clarifying whether American citizens could be targeted by drone attacks. He got mixed reviews for a speech to black students at Howard University, but then, hunkering down, he reached out to black political leaders in Kentucky and began talking more about criminal justice reform. Republican Party chapters tapped Paul to open offices in poverty-stricken parts of Louisville, Chicago, and Detroit.

“I’ve been to Ferguson, and I've been to the south side of Chicago,” he told a largely white audience of Republicans in Baltimore, after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody sparked two days of rioting. ""Until we've walked in someone else's shoes, we shouldn't say we can't understand the anger of people.""

Few Republicans talked like that. In early 2014, Paul was consistently leading — or close to leading — national polls. A CNN/ORC International survey in March of that year found that 16 percent of Republicans and independents who lean Republican were likely to support the senator, putting him at the front of the Republican field, and giving him unusually strong support from black voters. At home in Kentucky, Paul loaned strategist-turned-nephew-in-law Jesse Benton to the re-election campaign of now-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, signaling that he had bridged a gap between the ""liberty movement"" and the Republican elite. Some pundits, like The Atlantic's Peter Beinart, suggested that Paul was really the frontrunner to win a changing party's nomination and challenge presumed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on traditionally liberal turf.

“Right now I'm the only one that beats Hillary Clinton in certain purple states,” Paul told Fox News host Megyn Kelly shortly before his launch. “I'm the only one that also scores above all the other Republicans in whether or not I can beat her.”

Paul’s May 2015 announcement tour started in Lousiville, and swept into the first four primary states, finding sizable crowds. His campaign, led by Republican strategist Chip Englander, had a plan to finish at least second or third in all of the early states, then take advantage of the long-stirring Paul organizations in the Midwest and Mountain West to collect delegates.

That never happened. Donald Trump, who entered the primary one month after Paul, charged ahead in polls and captured the “outsider” energy Paul had claimed for years. Weak poll numbers scared off possible megadonors who had donated to Ron Paul, like the venture capitalist Peter Thiel. In August, right before the first Republican presidential debate, Benton was indicted over a 2012 scheme to flip an Iowa state senator's endorsement to Ron Paul. (Benton was later acquitted.)

Another, more strategic challenge came from a man Paul had endorsed in his bid for a Senate seat in Texas: Ted Cruz. Talking openly about winning the “liberty lane” of the Republican primary, Cruz lobbied supporters of Ron Paul to switch over and back a better-funded campaign.

As he struggled, Paul barely concealed his resentment for Cruz's wrangling. Paul secured a standalone vote on defunding Planned Parenthood; Cruz vacuumed up the attention by calling to cut funds in the must-pass spending bill. Paul won a New Hampshire straw poll of libertarian-leaning Republicans; Cruz claimed victory with his own vote count. Paul told audiences that Cruz had been “nowhere to be found” on a vote to audit the Federal Reserve; voters did not seem to care. This past Sunday, when the elder Paul joined his son for a “revolution”-themed rally on the University of Iowa campus, most of the press seats were empty; only C-Span bothered to film a teleprompter-delivered closing message.

Paul's early exit calmed Republicans who worried that his race for the White House was risking control of his Senate seat, which is on the 2016 ballot. Paul had worked hard to protect his day job, paying $250,000 from his campaign account to fund a March presidential caucus, which he now will not contest. At the “revolution” rally, early Paul endorser Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said he was likely to pay for a poll of the state, expecting it to show that Paul could campaign through the next primaries without any risk to his Senate seat.

In a Wednesday radio interview, Cruz praised Paul and reminded listeners that he had always been an ally of the liberty movement. Speaking to reporters in New Hampshire, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a staunch critic of Paul’s foreign policy positions, commended his Senate colleague for running “a good race” and wished him luck in his reelection bid.

“Rand is someone I disagree with on a lot of issues, but as I said the other night at the debate ... he believes strongly in what he stands for, and I respect that,” said Rubio. “He’s a true believer on issues of limited government and the liberty issues and I respect it for him for it.""

Asked if he planned to ask Paul for his endorsement, Rubio replied: “Sure. I mean, I’d love to have Rand’s support.”

In a conference call with reporters Wednesday morning, Paul strategist Doug Stafford reiterated that the senator would make no endorsements -- not even of Cruz. It did not matter especially that Paul had endorsed the Texan in his upstart 2012 Senate primary.

""Rand endorsed many people for Senate,"" he said.

The debate turned fiery only in the closing minutes, when the two clashed over foreign policy and over comments by Sanders critical of President Obama.

“I couldn’t disagree more,” Clinton said, accusing Sanders of leveling the kind of attacks on the president usually heard from Republicans.

“That is a low blow,” Sanders said, saying he had worked with the president throughout the past seven years. “Have you ever disagreed with the president?” he asked.

Overall, the debate highlighted anew the fundamental fault line between the two candidates for the Democratic nomination, with Sanders standing his ground on behalf of a big and bold agenda that has energized progressives across the country and Clinton expressing her support for many of her rival’s goals but arguing that she has the preparation to make real progress in a divided country.

After a pair of heated contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two Democrats spent much of their two-hour debate in relatively civil disagreement. They disagreed over the size and scope of government and traded views on topics including race and criminal justice, immigration and Social Security.

In her closing statement, and without Sanders having an opportunity to reply, Clinton opened up a new argument against her rival, implying that Sanders’s focus on the corrupting influence of political money on government is too limited. “I’m not a single-issue candidate, and I don’t believe we live in a single-issue country,” Clinton said.

The debate probably changed few minds in the Democratic race. Nor did it answer some of the key questions that will be at the heart of the campaigning in the weeks ahead. For Sanders, it is a question of whether he can expand his appeal from a largely white base of supporters and attract votes of African Americans and Hispanics.

Advertisement

For Clinton, it is whether she can retool her message to counter the enthusiasm behind Sanders’s candidacy.

Among the sharpest exchanges came over the role of money in the political system, with Clinton seeking to deflect criticism that she has benefited from contributions from Wall Street and financial institutions and Sanders suggesting that anyone who doesn’t think big contributions influence government actions isn’t being realistic.

“Let’s not insult the intelligence of the American people,” Sanders said.

“Why in God’s name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?” he asked rhetorically. “I guess just for the fun of it. They want to throw money around.”

With an eye to upcoming contests in Nevada and South Carolina, both used their opening statements to appeal to minority voters, who will play a far more significant role in those states than they did in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Clinton sought to put Sanders on the defensive early in the debate when he was asked how much more government would cost under a Sanders administration. When Sanders was told he had not answered the question, he said there of course would be a limit. He offered a ringing defense of his philosophy.

“In my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living,” he said.

Clinton answered the question Sanders was asked, saying that her best estimate of the price of his plans would raise the cost of government by 40 percent. She then pivoted to an attack on his call for a Medicare-style, single-payer health-care system.

Sanders said again that middle-class Americans would pay about $500 more in taxes for his government health-care plan but would save about $5,000 in health-care costs.

Clinton, calling that “a promise that can’t be kept,” said, “Based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don’t add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.”

Sanders shot back, “That is absolutely inaccurate.” But Clinton continued to press her case.

When Clinton was asked what her proposals would cost, she priced them at about $100 billion a year, all of which she said were paid for by tax increases. “And I think once I’m in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.”

To which Sanders caustically replied, “Well, Secretary Clinton, you’re not in the White House yet.”

Clinton’s challenges appealing to women voters came under the spotlight. In New Hampshire, Sanders carried women voters by 11 points. Clinton was hardly helped when, during a campaign event, former secretary of state Madeleine Albright scolded younger women who didn’t support Clinton by using an oft-repeated line: that women who don’t support each other are destined to a “special place in hell.”

Asked whether she agreed with Albright, Clinton said: “I think that she’s been saying that for as long as I’ve known her. It doesn’t change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decision in their minds that they can make.”

With three women on the debate stage — Clinton and debate moderators Judy Woodruff and Gwen Ifill, co-anchors of the PBS NewsHour — Sanders was outnumbered, as Clinton noted with a smile: “We’ll take all the progress wherever we can find it.”

Clinton also nodded to her endorsements from abortion rights women’s health groups such as Planned Parenthood as evidence that she was deemed the superior candidate on health issues that are important to women.

But Sanders declined to take the bait, instead training his fire on Republicans, whom he accused of hypocrisy when it comes to government’s role. “By the way,” he said, “when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.”

With the South Carolina primary looming at the end of the month, both Clinton and Sanders highlighted need to reform the criminal justice system. Their tone was far less acrimonious than the sharp rhetoric coming from Clinton’s African American surrogates this week, who accused Sanders of being “absent” on these and other issues that are important to black voters.

“We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system,” Sanders said. “I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African Americans, shot by police officers.”

Clinton, who had invited the mother of a young black, mentally ill man who was killed by police as her guest to the debate, added that reforms needed to go beyond the justice system.

“I completely agree with Senator Sanders,” Clinton said. “When we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing and other ways of helping communities.”

The debate came just two days after Sanders won a decisive victory over Clinton in the New Hampshire primary. Sanders’s 22-point margin was one of the largest in the history of non-incumbent presidential primaries in the Granite State.

The New Hampshire results reset the Democratic race, putting pressure on both candidates as they look to the next two contests — the Feb. 20 Nevada caucuses and the Feb. 27 South Carolina primary.

For Clinton, the huge margin in New Hampshire brought new concerns about weaknesses in her candidacy. The former secretary won the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, but by less than a percentage point. Her defeat in New Hampshire can only be described as a drubbing and, despite energetic campaigning, she appeared to have made up no significant ground in the final days — unlike in 2008 when she scored a come-from-behind victory over then-Sen. Barack Obama.

Clinton remained out of public sight after the resounding loss to Sanders in New Hampshire, but her campaign whirred into action. Campaign officials announced a slew of new endorsements among African American leaders and deployed them in an aggressive campaign to discredit Sanders’s record on civil rights issues important to African American voters

The latest effort came Thursday, when the Congressional Black Caucus PAC endorsed Clinton. At the Capitol Hill event, Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a renowned civil rights leader, harshly criticized Sanders and discounted the senator’s civil rights activism in the 1960s.

“I never saw him. I never met him,” Lewis said. “I was chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for three years, 1963 to 1966. . . . I met Hillary Clinton. I met President Clinton.”

The Clinton campaign has turned its focus squarely on African American voters, who constitute more than 55 percent of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina and who, polls show, overwhelmingly support her.

Meanwhile, in Nevada, where Hispanic, African Americans, and Asian and Pacific-Islander voters made up 35 percent of the Democratic electorate in 2008, Sanders is gaining ground. Despite having established a campaign in Nevada since early summer 2015 — months ahead of Sanders — Clinton’s aides have begun playing down expectations for the state, suggesting that the demographics of the likely caucus electorate still favor Sanders."

“Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them,” it continued. “But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.”

The Justice Department sought the order “in the hopes of gaining crucial evidence” about the Dec. 2 shooting rampage, which killed 14 people and injured 22.

The order, signed Tuesday by a magistrate judge in Riverside, Calif., does not ask Apple to break the phone’s encryption but rather to disable the feature that wipes the data on the phone after 10 incorrect tries at entering a password. That way, the government can try to crack the password using “brute force” — attempting tens of millions of combinations without risking the deletion of the data.

The order comes a week after FBI Director James B. Comey told Congress that the bureau has not been able to open the phone belonging to one of the killers. “It has been two months now, and we are still working on it,” he said.

The Silicon Valley giant has steadfastly maintained that it is unable to unlock its newer iPhones for law enforcement, even when officers obtain a warrant, because they are engineered in such a way that Apple does not hold the decryption key. Only the phone’s user — or someone who knew the password — would be able to unlock the phone.

The FBI’s efforts may show how impervious the new technology is to efforts to circumvent it. According to industry officials, Apple cannot unilaterally dismantle or override the 10-tries-and-wipe feature. Only the user or person who controls the phone’s settings can do so.

However, U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym said in her order, Apple can write software that can bypass the feature. Federal prosecutors stated in a memo accompanying the order that the software would affect only the seized phone.

In the statement , Cook said such a step would dangerously weaken iPhone security.

“Once created,” he wrote, “the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks — from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable.”

The Apple CEO said that “opposing this order is not something we take lightly. We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government.”

The phone, an iPhone5C, was used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire at a holiday party at the Inland Regional Center, a county facility. The couple, who pledged loyalty to the Islamic State terrorist group, died a few hours later in a shootout with police.

FBI investigators recovered a number of electronic devices, including thumb drives, computer hard drives and Farook’s cellphone. His phone belonged to the county public-health department, where he was an inspector. Prosecutors noted that the county consented to allow the phone to be searched and to have Apple’s assistance in the matter.

Data that would be encrypted on the device includes contacts, photos and iMessages. Having access to that material could shed light on why the couple picked the target they did, whether they were planning other attacks and whether they received any direction or support from overseas.

FBI Supervisory Special Agent Christopher Pluhar stated in a declaration that he was able to obtain from Apple all the data backed up to its iCloud servers from the phone. That data showed that Farook was in communication with individuals who were later killed. Significantly, Pluhar said, the most recent backup took place on Oct. 19, 2015, indicating that Farook may have intentionally disabled the backup feature.

Pluhar, who is director of the Orange County Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory, said he believes there may be ""relevant, critical communications and data"" on the phone from around the time of the shooting. Former National Counterterrorism Center director Matt Olsen, who recently co-authored a paper that asserted that the government had other ways to obtain data without creating a backdoor into devices, said the public interest in this case supports the government getting access to the data.

“This is the kind of case where companies like Apple need to demonstrate that they’re good corporate citizens and comply with lawful court orders,” said Olsen, who was also a general counsel at the National Security Agency.

New York Police Department Commissioner William J. Bratton issued a statement Wednesday saying, “No device, no car, and no apartment should be beyond the reach of a court ordered search warrant.”

But Kevin Bankston, director of New America's Open Technology Institute, said what the court is ordering Apple to do is ""custom-build malware to undermine its own product's security features."" He said it is not clear whether Apple can do that technically. But if a court can compel Apple to do it, then it can compel other software providers to do so as well.

""This isn't just about one iPhone, it's about all of our software and all of our digital devices,"" he said. ""If this precedent gets set, it will spell digital disaster for the trustworthiness of everyone's computers and mobile phones.""

The phone ran on Apple's iOS 9 operating system, which was built with default device encryption. When a user creates a password, that phrase generates a key that is used in combination with a hardware key on a chip inside the phone. Together, the keys encrypt the device's data.

If the autowipe function is suspended, the FBI can run a massive number of combinations of letters, symbols and numbers until the right combination is found.

But there's a complication.

If the combinations are run on the phone itself, the process can be painfully slow, taking, according to Apple, 5 ½ years for a six-digit lower-case password mixing numbers and letters.

If run on a supercomputer, it can be done many thousands of times faster. But to do it that way, the FBI would need the hardware key, which is built into the phone. Apple says it does not keep a copy of that key. To get that key, one could use a number of techniques, including melting the plastic off the chip and hitting it with bursts of lasers or radio frequencies to recover bits of the key.

Matthew D. Green, a cryptography expert at Johns Hopkins University, said the FBI could crack a six-digit numeric code in about 22 hours.

""But once there's numbers and letters, that's when things get interesting,"" he said. ""It might take 10 years to crack a strong password on the phone, which means they might be stuck till 2026.""

The government requested the order under the All Writs Act, a law dating to the colonial era that has been used as a source of authority to issue orders that are not otherwise covered by a statute. Though Apple has previously complied with court orders under that statute to retrieve data from iPhones running earlier versions of its operating system, it is now resisting such an order in a separate iPhone case in Brooklyn. That case, unlike the one in California, involves a phone with software that allows the firm to extract data.

The government contends that courts over the years have issued orders based on that law for the unencrypted contents of computers, for credit card records and for security camera videotapes. It noted that the Supreme Court in 1977 held that the law gave courts the authority to direct a phone company to execute a search warrant for numbers dialed by a particular customer.

Some legal scholars, however, said the use of the All Writs Act in the California Apple case presents a slippery slope issue. “If the writ can compel Apple to write customized software to unlock a phone, where does it end?” said Ahmed Ghappour, a professor at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law. “Can the government use it to compel Facebook to customize an algorithm that predicts crime? It’s not clear where the line will be drawn, if at all.”

On Wednesday, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said the government’s request would “create a dangerous precedent.

“Companies should comply with warrants to the extent they are able to do so, but no company should be forced to deliberately weaken its products,” said Wyden. “In the long-run, the real losers will be Americans’ online safety and security.”"
3033,3033,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/29/on-the-eve-of-super-tuesday-donald-trump-just-got-his-best-poll-yet/,0,"On Feb. 29, 2012, Mitt Romney finally retook the lead in Real Clear Politics' average of polling of the Republican nomination contest that year for the final time. Months of ups and downs, and -- four years ago Monday -- Romney finally had a clear path to the nomination. In the 2004 Democratic and 2008 Democratic and Republican contests as well, the person leading on Feb. 29 in the polling average went on to win his party's nomination.

Even without the new CNN/ORC poll released on Monday, the 2016 field's leading candidates are clearly identifiable: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

But the new poll also moves Trump and Clinton further away from the people they're leading. On the Democratic side, Clinton's once-shaky lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont looks much firmer, even before her blow-out victory in South Carolina on Saturday. But on the Republican side, the shift since January has been truly amazing.

Remember: In the middle of January, when CNN/ORC last polled, the GOP survey included Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee. It included Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. When those candidates dropped out, their support had to go somewhere, and the establishment has been banking on it going to anyone but Trump.

And so:

Trump leads at 49 percent -- his highest numbers in any poll tracked by Real Clear Politics this cycle. The number suggests that the theory that he had a ceiling of support -- that he could never get to 50 percent -- was ... flawed. With Tuesday's numerous contests looming, Trump has the support of about half of his party, in a field with five candidates.

And that consolidation theory is revealed as a consolation theory. As we noted over the weekend, if Ohio Gov. John Kasich were to drop out and every single one of his supporters were to migrate to Sen. Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida would go from trailing by 33 to trailing by 27.

Share this article Share

Looking deeper into the polls, we see two shifts from what we thought we knew about the race. First, Trump's no longer just the candidate preferred by poorer, less-educated voters (though that was always a bit overplayed). His strength among college graduates has spiked since January. Second, you can see very clearly how he's eaten into Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's base of support among evangelicals and tea party supporters.

There are some reasonably high margins of error in there; we're talking about subsets of a subset of the full poll. But a 40-point lead, as Trump enjoys over Cruz with tea partiers, is not one that falls into any gray area.

What's more, Republicans generally feel pretty okay with a Trump nomination. He has a much more enthusiastic base of support than Rubio or Cruz.

CNN notes that a quarter of Republicans said they probably or definitely wouldn't support Trump in November -- but also noted that about the same share of voters say that of Rubio and Cruz.

One of the stumbling blocks Trump was expected to face as voting finally rolled around was that less-partisan voters would gravitate toward a candidate they thought could win in November. Who is that? Why, it's Donald Trump, who 63 percent of Republicans think has the best shot in a general election.

Interestingly -- and with the critical caveat that general election polling this far out is still not very useful -- Trump does worse against possible Democratic opponents than Rubio or Cruz in CNN's polling."

http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/04/politics/republican-debate-analysis-takeaways/index.html",0,"It’s highly questionable whether anyone emerged as the winner in Thursday’s Republican presidential debate in Detroit, though the candidates’ spinmeisters would all quibble with that. There was one clear loser: the Grand Old Party. The 11th debate of the Republican campaign tested the patience and the limits of viewers and voters. Insults and interruptions overwhelmed sober discussion. The raucous audience, now a staple of the GOP debates, only added to the sense of game-show politics.

Can anyone credibly suggest that the Republicans put their collective best face forward Thursday night? At a time when the party is in crisis over the possibility that Donald Trump will become the nominee, the debate did next to nothing to make Trump or his three remaining rivals look or sound presidential.

Designed to define candidates’ differences, the debates have become tedious and repetitious rather than enlightening or illuminating. No new information was imparted Thursday, no truly new arguments advanced. Even the insults were tiresome.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who drew criticism earlier for trying to limit the number of debates, must be wishing he had pushed for even fewer, given the tone and tenor of Thursday’s forum in Detroit and last week’s mud bath in Houston.

Top quotes from the eleventh Republican presidential debate + 14 The candidates shared these comments during the Fox News GOP debate in Detroit.

Thursday’s debate came at the end of an extraordinary day in the Republican campaign — the kind of day no one can remember ever seeing — when the party’s 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, delivered a scathing attack on the 2016 front-runner as unfit to be president and unworthy to lead the party.

Romney did what none of Trump’s rivals for the nomination has done. He set out a slashing and coherent attack on the New York billionaire. He described Trump as a fraud and a phony, as a failed businessman, and as an aspiring politician with no ideological moorings. Trump’s policies, Romney warned, would be disastrous domestically and dangerous internationally.

It was left to Trump’s rivals — Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich — to drive home those arguments Thursday night. At times Cruz and Rubio tried, attempting to unmask Trump on immigration and foreign policy. Meanwhile, Kasich continued his strategy of trying to stop Trump by declining to criticize him.

But then, as if to take a hammer to their own arguments that Trump is not the kind of candidate Republicans need to lead them into the fall campaign, Rubio, Cruz and Kasich closed out the evening by saying, however grudgingly, that they could support him if he won the nomination.

Throughout the debate, Trump only helped reinforce the substance of some of Romney’s criticisms. He deflected virtually every question about policy by launching personal attacks on his rivals or resorting to generalities and broad promises. He struggled to defend contradictory statements he had made in the past.

In an extended exchange with Fox News anchor and his onetime nemesis Megyn Kelly, he tried to talk away a class-action lawsuit brought against Trump University, dismissing it as minor and predicting that after a few more years of litigation, he will win the argument with the dissatisfied students.

Trump dominated the evening in terms of time spent talking, but he also dominated in time spent on the defensive. Given the pattern of the campaign and of the past three debates, he probably did nothing to undermine the support he already has.

It’s questionable, however, whether he added new voters to his coalition — voters he might need if the field narrows further. It’s equally questionable whether Kasich, Cruz or Rubio came out of the debate enhanced or standing above the other candidates.

The Republican Party is in terrible turmoil over Trump, with members of what passes for the establishment frantic to find a way to slow his march to victory. But winning the nomination outright by accumulating delegates in the primaries and caucuses now seems exceedingly difficult for any of Trump’s rivals. The course that seems to have emerged is a collective hold-the-line strategy that would throw the decision to the national convention in July.

Cruz once thought a victory in South Carolina and a big night on Super Tuesday would put him in the driver’s seat. That plan crumbled when Trump won South Carolina and carried seven of the 11 contests this week. Cruz salvaged the night by winning his home state of Texas, plus Oklahoma and Alaska. But he has yet to show that he can truly consolidate conservatives in the way he needs to.

Rubio has tried to play the long game, but it’s become a much longer game than first envisioned. The senator finally picked up his first victory Tuesday, in the Minnesota caucuses. But on a night when he said the key was accumulating delegates, he fell far behind both Trump and Cruz. In delegate-rich Texas, he managed to come away with just three of the 155 at stake. If that isn’t a failure of his strategy, what is?

Kasich came close in tiny Vermont on Tuesday and finished second in Massachusetts, a whisker ahead of Rubio. In the South, he cratered, scoring in single digits. In some of those states, he trailed Ben Carson, who has since gone to the sidelines with all the other candidates who began the race last year. The lone governor left in the campaign is still looking for his first victory.

A viable — perhaps tenuous is a better term — strategy for stopping Trump requires all three to win their home states. Cruz has delivered. Rubio and Kasich will be tested in Florida and Ohio on March 15, when delegates can be awarded on a winner-take-all basis. If either loses at home, the pressure will mount to get out.

It seems they all need one another now to keep gathering enough delegates collectively to deny Trump a first-ballot victory at the convention. Under that strategy, chaos awaits the party in Cleveland, just as it was chaos that seemed the order of the night in Detroit. The debates, a proxy for the nomination battle itself, have ceased being the GOP’s friend."

SALT LAKE CITY — Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, delivered a sweeping point-by-point indictment of Donald Trump on Thursday and implored Republicans to reject the businessman’s candidacy in an election ""that will have profound consequences for the Republican Party and, more importantly, for the country.""

""Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud,"" Romney told nearly 700 people at the University of Utah. ""His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's playing members of the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat.""

Trump fired back a few hours later at a rally in Portland, Maine, bemoaning Romney's ""nasty"" remarks and dismissing him as a ""choke artist"" and ""failed candidate"" who was eager for Trump's endorsement in 2012.

""You can see how loyal he is,"" Trump said. ""He was begging for my endorsement. I could’ve said, 'Mitt, drop to your knees,' and he would’ve dropped to his knees. He was begging. True. True. He was begging me.""

There was little precedent for Romney’s remarks: Never before in modern political history has the immediate past nominee of a party delivered an entire speech condemning the current front-runner. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) – the party’s 2008 nominee – later said he shared Romney’s concerns.

Most boldly, Romney called for a scenario that likely would lead to a convention floor flight, recommending that voters cast ballots for Sen. Marco Rubio in his home state of Florida, for Gov. John Kasich in Ohio, and everywhere else, for the candidate best positioned to deny Trump a win.

From issues domestic and foreign to those of moral character and temperament, Romney called Trump ill-qualified to serve as president. His remarks to the university’s Hinckley Institute of Politics called out Trump for his many failed businesses, including airlines, vodka and a mortgage company. He raised concerns about Trump's sexual exploits, his three marriages and his taunts toward the disabled, Mexican immigrants and female journalists and politicians.

“But you say, ‘Wait, wait, wait, isn’t he a huge business success? Doesn’t he know what he’s talking about?’ ” Romney said. “No, he isn’t. And no, he doesn’t.”

The 18-minute address was unlike anything other GOP presidential candidates have delivered. It served as a public airing of concerns Romney has shared in brief spurts on social media or privately to friends and supporters. The speech came at a critical juncture for the Republican Party, with Trump's seemingly unstoppable march to the nomination setting off panic this week among party leaders fearful that the New Yorker’s ascendance could cost them the general election, spoil the chances for down-ballot candidates and irreparably tarnish the party’s brand.

The auditorium was packed mostly with college students, but two of Romney’s grown sons, Josh and Ben, were in the audience, as was Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, Lt. Gov. Spencer J. Cox and their spouses. At least four Trump supporters were also in the crowd and taunted Romney from their seats.

“Donald Trump tells us that he is very, very smart,” Romney said at one point.

“Smarter than you!” someone shouted from the back of the auditorium.

When Romney concluded, a man wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat stood to leave, waving a Trump campaign sign. Another shouted at Romney as he shook hands with fans in the front row.

Here are key moments from the Republican candidates' Super Tuesday speeches. (Video: Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)

Romney briefly considered running again before announcing early last year that he would take a pass. His speech in Utah, where he has a home, neither launched a fresh campaign nor served as an endorsement of any candidate.

""Instead, I’d like to offer my perspective on the nominating process in my party,"" he said.

Dozens of national media outlets descended on the college campus to hear from the former presidential contender. The speech garnered national television coverage, with cable news channels devoting hours to the governor’s remarks. Even local television stations preempted regular programming to broadcast the words of a famous resident who led the city’s 2002 Olympic organization.

""In 1964, days before the presidential election, Ronald Reagan went on national television and challenged America that it was a 'Time for Choosing,' "" Romney said. ""He saw two paths for America, one that embraced conservative principles dedicated to lifting people out of poverty and helping create opportunity for all, and the other, an oppressive government that would lead America down a darker, less-free path.

""I'm no Ronald Reagan and this is a different moment, but I believe with my heart and soul that we face another time for choosing,” he said.

He faulted Trump for offering “very few specific economic plans” and said that “what little he has said is enough to know that he would be very bad for American workers and for American families.”

On national security, Romney said that Trump’s “bombast is already alarming our allies and fueling the enmity of our enemies.”

“The only serious policy proposals that deal with a broad range of national challenges that we confront today come from Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich,” Romney said, referencing the other remaining GOP candidates.

“I know that some people want this race to be over,” he added. “They look at history and say a trend like Mr. Trump’s isn’t going to be stopped. Perhaps. But the rules of political history have pretty much all been shredded during this campaign.”

Romney urged Cruz, Kasich and Rubio to “find some common ground” and help the party “nominate a person who could win the general election and who will represent the values and policies of conservatism.”

Throughout the speech Romney repeatedly dismissed Trump’s personal behavior: “Think of Donald Trump’s personal qualities. The bullying. The greed. The showing off. The misogyny. The absurd third-grade theatrics.”

“Watch, by the way, how he responds to my speech today,” he added. “Will he talk about our policy differences? Or will he attack me with every imaginable low-blow insult?”

What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail + 42 Businessman Donald Trump officially became the Republican nominee at the party’s convention in Cleveland.

True to form, Trump mocked Romney's failed 2012 bid against President Obama and called him a “choke artist.” Trump also spent several minutes telling supporters that he is wealthier than Romney.

“He is a failed candidate. He failed horribly. That was a race, I have to say folks, that should have been won,” Trump said.

""With Mitt, I just wanted to tell you that he came out and he was very nasty. I thought he was a better person than that,"" Trump added later.

Romney never mentioned in his speech that he had eagerly sought and received Trump’s endorsement in 2012. Ultimately, Romney traveled to Trump’s lavish Las Vegas hotel to hold a news conference and accept his support.

“Being in Donald Trump's magnificent hotel and having his endorsement is a delight,” Romney said the day of the endorsement.

Aides said at the time that Romney embraced Trump, however reluctantly, to keep him in the fold and from bolting the party. Trump emerged as a vocal Romney surrogate, recording more than 30 “robo-calls” and doing more than 50 radio interviews in states that held early primaries. Trump and his wife, Melania, also hosted a lavish 63rd birthday party for Ann Romney that doubled as a campaign fundraiser. More than 400 supporters paid at least $1,000 to attend the event at Trump Tower in New York.

But on Thursday, Romney left no doubt about Trump: “He has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president. And his personal qualities mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill.”

Afterward, McCain agreed.

“I want Republican voters to pay close attention to what our party's most respected and knowledgeable leaders and national security experts are saying about Mr. Trump, and to think long and hard about who they want to be our next Commander-in-Chief and leader of the free world,” McCain said in a statement.

But House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), Romney’s 2012 running mate, declined to back Romney’s remarks, telling Fox News, ""I'm gonna keep my powder dry"" to respect his role as chairman of the Republican National Convention.

""People who are in the party are going to be speaking their minds while we are selecting a nominee, and so everything is fair game on the way to the nomination,"" he said.

http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/ben-carson-endorses-donald-trump-220629?lo=ap_a1",0,"MIAMI — Former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson threw his support behind Donald Trump on Friday, saying the billionaire front-runner has two sides: the combative campaign persona and a ""very cerebral"" approach in private. The endorsement by Carson, who last week suspended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, is perhaps the most high-profile nod for Trump since New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie backed his former rival.

At a news conference at a Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago luxury club in Florida, Carson said there are “two Donald Trumps” — including a measured side of someone who “considers things carefully.”

The remarks appeared aimed at moderating Trump's image, which has been defined by bluster, belligerence and belittling comments against opponents, including Carson. Trump said the two have ""buried the hatchet.""

Carson, however, acknowledged that the country is greatly divided and ""hating each other"" -- rifts that have been amplified by the current presidential race.

He also issued an apparent message to GOP establishment leaders who have raised deep concerns about Trump's possible push toward the nomination.

Carson warned that it is “extremely dangerous” if political parties seek to “thwart the will of the people” and must let the ""voice of the people be heard.""

Trump said Carson will a ""big, big part"" in the campaign, but gave no specifics on possible roles.

During a Republican presidential debate aired on CNN on Thursday night, Trump confirmed Carson's backing. He said they discussed Carson’s ideas on education and other topics earlier in the day.

Share this article Share

""We spoke for over an hour on education. And he has such a great handle on it,"" Trump said. ""I'm going to have Ben very involved with education, something that's an expertise of his.""

The support of Carson, a famed retired neurosurgeon and author, will likely give Trump a boost with GOP base voters and evangelicals, who embraced Carson’s campaign in its early days and fueled his brief rise to the top of Republican primary polls.

Carson’s decision may surprise some of his backers since Trump made blistering critiques over the past year of stories from Carson’s past. But according to people close to him, Carson has gradually come to see Trump as the GOP’s best chance of winning a general election and turning out droves of disengaged voters.

Appearing Thursday on Fox News Radio, Carson spoke highly of Trump.

“There’s two Donald Trumps. There’s the Donald Trump that you see on television and who gets out in front of big audiences, and there’s the Donald Trump behind the scenes,” he said. “They’re not the same person. One’s very much an entertainer, and one is actually a thinking individual.”

Carson halted his campaign this month, telling supporters he saw “no path forward” for his bid. He then officially dropped out of the race in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference.

Ever since, Carson has been based at his winter home in West Palm Beach, not far from Mar-a-Lago, which made Thursday’s quiet get-together convenient for the former candidate.

It is not out of the question that Donald Trump could sweep all five states that vote on this second Super Tuesday: Florida, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Illinois. But a split decision of some kind seems more likely. John Kasich is closing strong and considered the favorite to prevail in his home state.

It is a win-or-drop-out situation for Kasich and Marco Rubio. But the stakes are also high for Ted Cruz, who needs to prove that he would be a worthy street fighter in a head-to-head match-up with Trump.

“Cruz, who has been boxed out of some news cycles by the media's focus on Trump, is looking to set low expectations, then blow past them,” Dave Weigel reports from Columbus. “He is looking to strong performances in Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, the lightly polled megastates lost in recent coverage, to cut any delegate lead Trump might build Tuesday. The first two states border the parts of Iowa that gave Cruz his first victory.”

There are 367 Republican delegates at stake. By this time tomorrow, more than half of the total delegates to the convention in Cleveland will have been awarded.

-- The question for Democrats: How much of an aberration was Michigan? One of Hillary Clinton’s problems last Tuesday was the complacency of her supporters. This week, polls in every state but Illinois and Missouri again show her with pretty sizable leads. And the action is mostly on the Republican side. The risk again is that her people stay home or take GOP ballots.

Even if Sanders does well, how many delegates does he get? “Multiple polls (show) Sanders closing in on Clinton in three states in the industrial Midwest — Missouri, Illinois and Ohio. But polls also show Clinton far ahead in Florida and in North Carolina, setting up the possibility of an outcome parallel to last week’s contests, when Sanders scored a narrow and surprising victory in Michigan, yet Clinton came away with a widened lead in the delegate count because of her resounding victory in Mississippi,” John Wagner and Jose A. DelReal report. “In other words, Clinton appears poised to continue her progress toward the Democratic nomination, but ever more bloodied by her battles with Sanders.”

-- FLORIDA is today’s biggest prize for Republicans, offering 99 delegates in a winner-take-all primary. Though a surprise should not be ruled out, Trump must be recognized as the heavy favorite. He’s led every single poll there this year.

A big Trump win here would be a big loss for the anti-Trump efforts, throwing into question the effectiveness of their attacks. Anti-Trump forces have now spent $15.7 million going after him in the Sunshine State, Anu Narayanswamy tabulates from FEC filings.

Will Rubio drop out tonight? Unlike Kasich, the senator has not publicly said he will quit if he loses his home state. His super PAC, which has spent about $10 million in Florida, has not put any money behind ads in the forthcoming primaries, not exactly a show of confidence… (CNN)

The Post’s Ed O’Keefe, who is following Rubio now after spending a year chasing Jeb full time, relays from Miami that Rubio is “exhausted” and “a funeral mood” has set in at his events, similar to what cloaked the Bush campaign in its waning days.

One data point on why you shouldn’t count out Rubio: Rubio allies are pointing to heavy early voting in Miami-Dade to argue that their turnout operation is better than Trump’s. Nearly 2 million early and absentee ballots have been cast in Florida, including more than 1.1 million Republicans. Those totals include more than 100,000 Republican ballots cast in Rubio’s home county, the Wall Street Journal notes.

Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who wants to run for governor in 2018 (and could thus potentially face Rubio in a GOP primary), endorsed Trump. She previously backed Jeb Bush, who has stayed conspicuously neutral ahead of today’s primary. (The former governor still blames Rubio for ruining his presidential hopes, and he likely does not believe that weighing in could save his one-time protégé.)

Will Trump make inroads with unlikely demographics? The Miami Herald reports that he is faring surprisingly well with Hispanic Republicans: “Cuban Americans in South Florida have the rare opportunity to vote for two of their own for the U.S. presidency. Yet some are making a different choice: They’re backing Trump … There is anecdotal evidence of support among Miami-Dade’s staunchly Republican Cuban-American voters even as most back Rubio — the son of Cuban immigrants — whom many Cuban-American voters helped elect to the U.S. Senate in 2010.” The paper says Cubans don’t care as much about deportation and the border wall. “I don’t think Cuban. I think American. … The worst problem the U.S. has is the economy,” said former Hialeah Mayor Julio Martinez, who convinced his wife who once lived in the U.S. illegally to vote for Trump.

-- Does the recent violence scare away any Trump voters?

Early evidence suggests not: A Monmouth University poll published yesterday found that two-thirds of likely Florida GOP primary voters say the events in Chicago have no effect on their view of Trump. The same survey showed Trump leading Rubio by 17 points (44-27), compared to an 8 point lead last week (38-30).

Trump’s rivals continued to seize on the drama at his events as they fanned out across the battlegrounds.

Rubio framed the election as “a choice between optimism and fear.”

“I don’t think there’s anyone in the history of American politics that compares to the vulgarity of a Donald Trump candidacy,” he told reporters. “In the history of American politics!” (Sean Sullivan)

Cruz responded gamely when he was heckled in Peoria, Illinois. ""See sir, one difference between this and a Donald Trump rally is I’m not asking anyone to punch you in the face,"" he said.

Trump said there’s a double standard and even denied that there’s been tension. “It’s a love fest. These are love fests,” Trump said at one of his events. Sarah Palin, campaigning for Trump in Florida, decried “petty, punk-ass little thuggery.” She accused the protesters of endangering the First Amendment rights of Trump’s supporters and accused the mainstream media of “being on the thugs’ side.”

Meanwhile, a North Carolina sheriff’s office said it will not charge Trump with “inciting a riot” after his raucous rally there last week (where a supporter punched an African American protestor), saying the events do not meet the lawful requirements to support a conviction.

OHIO—Kasich’s last stand?

The Buckeye State has 66 delegates at stake in its winner-take-all primary. A final Monmouth poll shows Kasich up 40-35 over Trump, with Cruz at 15 and Rubio at 5.

How the final day is playing in the Cleveland Plain Dealer: “Kasich, the state's popular two-term governor, takes the stage at a high school about a mile from his home. There's Mitt Romney by his side … who, when he was the Republican nominee in 2012, received little help or enthusiasm from Kasich. But the former Massachusetts governor didn't join the campaign trail with Kasich out of personal loyalty or because Kasich was his favorite candidate. Romney was trying to save the soul of his party by dragging Kasich across the finish line ... At this moment, he is the GOP establishment's last best hope. And yet it's not the most confident pose for Kasich. He is fighting – harder than he ever thought he would have to – to win Ohio.” Across town, Trump spoke to a few hundred at an aircraft hangar in Youngstown: “The rally was announced less than 24 hours earlier, after the Trump campaign changed its schedule to focus on Ohio.”

Does Romney have any juice? Mitt stopped short formally of endorsing Kasich when they campaigned together yesterday at an airplane museum in North Canton. “You’re the ones who are going to decide if he becomes the next president of the United States,” Romney said. “You look at this guy, and unlike the other people running, he has a real track record. He has the kind of record that you want in Washington. That’s why I’m convinced that you’re going to do the right thing tomorrow.”

The Columbus Dispatch reports on a surge in Ohio voters who are switching party affiliations: “Through Friday, Franklin County had about 39,000 requests for absentee ballots, and roughly 17,000 came from voters changing their registration. Most of the tide represents unaffiliated voters requesting a partisan ballot. About 5,700 of those so-called independents wanted to vote in the Republican primary while almost 10,000 asked for a Democratic ballot.”

-- How potent is the trade issue for Sanders and Trump? It was a big factor in their wins in Michigan last week. The Rust Belt has been hit hard by outsourcing and the decline of manufacturing. Both populists emphasized their opponents’ support for “bad trade deals” yesterday while campaigning in Ohio.

""He signed NAFTA -- NAFTA destroyed Ohio,"" Trump said of Kasich in Youngstown. ""It destroyed Ohio! And now he wants to sign TPP! That is going to be worse. I have studied it so carefully. It's going to be worse for Ohio. It’s going to take all of your car business out. Your car business is going to be destroyed by TPP. He wants it, and nobody knows why he wants it, including himself. Maybe one of his lobbyists is demanding it. Maybe one of the other countries that's going to benefit is demanding it. Who knows? It is completely crazy.""

""Kasich cannot make America great again,"" Trump added. “If you didn't hit oil -- and he didn't have anything to do with that -- this (state) would have been as bad as any of 'em. Oil has gone way down, and yet our budget’s gone up 35 percent, more than any other state in the United States. That means you're gonna have a big, big problem.""

“You in Ohio and in the Midwest know about the disastrous trade policies,” Sanders said in Akron, where a once-thriving tire industry has experienced a major decline. “It took me about 13 seconds to figure out that NAFTA was written by corporate America, that its goal was to shut down factories and plants in America, to move abroad to find cheap labor, and bring those products back into America. It didn’t take a PhD to figure that out.”

-- ILLINOIS is shaping up to be the marquee contest for Democrats today. It’s a Midwestern state (good for Sanders) and racially diverse (great for Clinton). FiveThirtyEight, which gave Hillary a 99 percent chance of winning Michigan, complains that the polls are skewed, which makes it harder to forecast: A recent Chicago Tribune poll gave Clinton a 42 point lead, while last week’s YouGov poll put Sanders at a 2 point advantage.

Watch Chicago. Sanders returned to the Windy City for a late-night election-eve rally – stumping there just a few hours after Clinton and trying to score another in her home state.

Did Sanders make the primary a referendum on Rahm Emanuel? The mayor and former White House chief of staff is toxically unpopular, and he’s been on the sidelines. The Vermont senator has aggressively tried to link him with Clinton, Politico reports.

The Chicago Sun-Times looks at the last-minute efforts to stop Bernie from catching up: “Bill Clinton hit two black churches— in west suburban Maywood and South Shore — to spur crucial African-American voter turnout. The Clinton campaign sent a team of high-profile surrogates to fan out across the Chicago area after two new polls pointed to the potential of a Sanders’ win in Illinois, turf long seen as solidly for Clinton.”

-- NORTH CAROLINA is looking very good for Clinton. If she wins in Florida and North Carolina, Hillary will have won every Southern state.

The Charlotte Observer notes that three presidential candidates descended on the city Monday: Sanders rallied supporters at PNC Music Pavilion near UNC Charlotte, while Clinton made a late-night appearance at Grady Cole Center just outside uptown. Though the latest polls put Clinton way ahead of Sanders (56-37), the Vermont Senator hopes to pull another Michigan-style upset by pressing his differences with Clinton over trade.

She has racked up endorsements in the Tar Heel State: Clinton has the backing of 44 of the General Assembly’s 61 Democratic lawmakers, including all the Democratic women. And she’s counting on heavy support from African-Americans, who are likely to make up at least a third of the Democratic primary electorate.

A record (for a primary) of 56,752 people cast early or absentee ballots in Mecklenburg County, the Observer reports: “Turnout could rival the county’s recent high of 34 percent, set in 2008.”

-- Sanders campaigned yesterday in four of the five states that vote today. Florida is the only one he skipped, and it’s because the primary is closed, which means independents won’t be able to vote for him, and there are too many retirees for him to be viable. Clinton has consistently won seniors.

-- MISSOURI might be today’s biggest wildcard. It’s hard to know exactly what’s going on in the Show Me State, which offers 71 Democratic delegates and 52 Republican delegates. The state’s lack of polling – coupled with its hard-to-predict open primary system – has kept pundits from making accurate predictions.

From the story in this morning’s Post-Dispatch: “The St. Louis area saw Monday appearances by both former first daughter Chelsea Clinton, addressing supporters at a Clayton restaurant; and Sanders, who had a large crowd in St. Charles, his third big rally in the region in the past two weeks. A Post-Dispatch poll last week indicated that Missouri voters in both parties slightly favor the front-runners — Clinton and Trump. But their leads over Sanders and Cruz, respectively, were within the poll’s margins for error, making the races potential nail-biters.”

-- Missouri is Cruz’s best shot at a win today. Cruz has done extremely well in the Midwest (think Iowa and Kansas), and he has netted key endorsements from political figures in the state. Rubio’s descent means Cruz will get an even clearer shot at Trump in the state. BUT Missouri’s open primary could make it easier for Trump to win. Independent voters break almost overwhelmingly in support of the populist candidates, and a strong independent turnout would likely boost his campaign to success.

Can Cruz consolidate the Stop Trump movement? Trying to be conciliatory, he said yesterday that Kasich and Rubio could both have spots in his cabinet. From Katie Zezima in North Carolina: “As Cruz hopes to narrow the primary to a two-man race, he is increasingly trying to appeal to very different groups: working-class voters who may be drawn to Trump, and political establishment voters who want to stop him. The fit is not a natural one for Cruz, who pillories the establishment … But with Rubio’s candidacy sputtering and Kasich far behind, the establishment is warming to him … ‘It comes down to the reality of a Trump nomination,’ said a [Bush-turned-Cruz] supporter. ‘Trump would be a disaster and an embarrassment for the nation. Ted is the best chance to defeat Trump.’”

Funny color: Cruz is bragging on the trail about finishing “dead last” in Saturday’s D.C convention. Fewer than 3,000 voted; Rubio got 10 delegates to nine for Kasich. ""The Washington lobbyists looked at this field and said goodness gracious, give us anybody but Cruz,” he says. It always gets cheers.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- Hillary was picked up on a hot mic speculating about why Christie endorsed Trump. From Abby Phillip: During a commercial break while taping an MSNBC town hall, Clinton asked host Chris Matthews: ""Why did he support him? ... Did he have a debt?"" Matthews explained that Christie and others who support Trump ""want a future"" politically. He added that Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) ""isn't going anywhere,"" which leaves Christie ""nowhere"" to go. ""I don’t think he would win right now,"" Clinton chimed in. Then they chatted and chuckled about how Clinton's young staff does not get some of her cultural references.

Listen to a three-minute audio recording from the chit-chat between Matthews and HRC:

Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s microphone caught her chatting with host Chris Matthews about Chris Christie’s support for GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. (Video: The Washington Post)

-- During the town hall itself, Clinton said Trump is evoking the kind of mob violence “that led to lynching."" The full quote: “When you are inciting mob violence, which is what Trump is doing in those clips, there’s a lot of memories that people have. People remember mob violence that led to lynching. People remember mob violence that led to people being shot, being grabbed, being mistreated.”

-- Reporters who are following Clinton believe that she is fatigued, and they're portraying three gaffes over three days as evidence that the unexpectedly competitive contest has taken a physical toll on the 68-year old. From The Post's main day story, anchored by John Wagner and Jose A. DelReal: ""Friday morning, the day of Nancy Reagan’s funeral, Clinton mistakenly praised the former first lady for 'starting a conversation' about HIV/AIDS. Clinton quickly apologized, but the backlash from the LGBT community was intense ... The next day in St. Louis, Clinton suggested that Sanders had been absent during her 1993 push for health-care reform. On Twitter, a Sanders aide quickly blasted out an archival video showing the senator standing right behind Clinton during a news conference about the effort. Twenty-four hours after that, Clinton answered a question about coal country with a cringe-worthy response: 'We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, right?' On Monday, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tried to clean up...""

GET SMART FAST:​​

THE EXODUS CONTINUES: Three more Breitbart News staffers announced their resignations to protest the conservative site's fealty to Trump even after his campaign manager allegedly assaulted one of their colleagues. National security correspondent Jordan Schachtel and associate editor Jarrett Stepman joined others.

A telling window into how Breitbart operates: Yesterday morning, after The 202 went out, the site published a column attacking Ben Shapiro for leaving. The story began: “Former Breitbart News editor-at-large Ben Shapiro announced Sunday evening via left-wing Buzzfeed that he is abandoning Andrew Breitbart’s lifelong best friend, widow, hand-picked management team and friends in pursuit of an elusive contributorship at the Fox News Channel. Friends of Hamas could not be found for comment.”

""It ran under the byline of William Bigelow,"" Manuel Roig-Franzia and Paul Farhi explain in a broader piece about the chaos at Breitbart. ""Bigelow, it turns out, is the pseudonym of David Shapiro, the father of Ben Shapiro. The elder Shapiro, who is a musician and also a writer at Breitbart, had chosen the name as an homage to the character Billy Bigelow in the musical 'Carousel,' his son said in an interview. The column was later removed from the site. ... Nonetheless, David Shapiro has resigned as well. Breitbart officials said the column was meant as a joke and was not intended for publication.""

Politico reports that Breitbart chairman Stephen Bannon made disparaging remarks about Michelle Fields on conference calls after she was injured at Trump's press conference. (He denies this.)

Former Breitbart spokesman Kurt Bardella, who resigned Friday, went on Fox News to to call the site a ""Trump Super PAC."" (Watch here.) He also wrote a first-person account of his resignation for CNN.

-- “Trump’s staff and advisers have expressed concerns about campaign manager Corey Lewandowski’s quick temper and heavy-handed leadership, and some even planned a coup against him last month,” Politico reports. “In interviews with more than 20 sources who have dealt with Lewandowski during his nearly year-long tenure with the Trump campaign and in his previous job with the Koch brothers-backed advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, complaints emerged about Lewandowski being rough with reporters and sexually suggestive with female journalists, while profanely berating conservative officials and co-workers he deemed to be challenging his authority.”

WAPO HIGHLIGHTS:

-- Three Prince George’s County brothers are being held in connection with the fatal shooting of Officer Jacai Colson. Police say Colson was likely killed by friendly fire. And the gunman, 22-year-old Michael Ford, intended to die in the shooting. “Ford recorded his last will and testament in a cellphone video before heading to the Landover police station,” report Lynh Bui, Peter Hermann and Justin Jouvenal. “Ford fired randomly at an ambulance and the doors of the station, pinning down officers who poured from the station to confront him.” His two brothers stood nearby, recording the ambush on their cellphones. Amid that barrage, Colson arrived to visit another officer. The off-duty detective ""sprang from an unmarked police car and ‘heroically’ drew Ford’s fire as he exchanged shots with the gunman. The move allowed officers to overcome Ford, but in a chaotic moment, a shot probably fired by one of Colson’s fellow officers struck him and ultimately took his life. Colson was an undercover narcotics detective and was wearing street clothes. It is unclear whether the officer who shot Colson confused him with an assailant or whether Colson was wounded accidentally amid the chaotic gunfire.”

Deep-dive feature on a die-hard Trump supporter --> “Finding purpose in the Trump crusade: ‘This is bigger than big’” by Stephanie McCrummen: “On a Friday a year ago, he might have been fixing a gutter. On this Friday, he was setting up a phone bank in a former North Canton (Ohio) tanning salon, becoming part of something that felt every day more like an important, even historic, struggle. It was the moment that Ralph Case had been waiting for since June, when the single father with a one-truck renovation business saw Trump announcing his presidential bid. As Trump spoke of an America that doesn’t ‘have victories anymore’ he felt something stirring– ‘like something hit me in my gut.’ He made the first of dozens of unreturned calls to Trump’s headquarters. He used his own money to rent a defunct tanning salon and plastered its windows with Trump signs. ‘That Ralph guy in Ohio’ was how Trump’s campaign began referring to Case. ‘Chair of Stark County’s Trump campaign,’ was how he referred to himself. ‘This is big,’ Ralph said. ‘This is bigger than big.’”

-- “Zika is the latest battle in a long war between humans and mosquitoes,” by Nick Miroff and Brady Dennis: “Ever since a physician proved that mosquitos transmitted yellow fever, humans waged a war on the tiny disease carriers. They drained swamps and cesspools, waged door-to-door campaigns to hunt down breeding sites, and dumped an ocean’s worth of pesticides on multiple continents. But always, through resiliency and adaptability, the mosquito roared back [and] people grew complement. Political willpower faltered. And chemicals lost killing potency … Now comes Zika. Countries are once again calling for massive spraying efforts and r public education. Some are considering new tactics such as genetically engineered mosquitoes that cannot survive to adulthood; the WHO wants such unproven weapons evaluated with ‘particular urgency.’ Relatively few Americans may realize how central such work once was to the nation’s identity. Because these insects carried disease, their extermination became an essential government service, another chapter in the long campaign to tame the wilderness. But the war wasn’t over …. and may never be, as the Zika virus is making clear.”

GOOD READ FROM ELSEWHERE:

-- “How to Steal a Nomination From Trump,” by Bloomberg’s Sasha Issenberg (the author of “Victory Lab”): Here’s a timeline for how the months leading up a contested convention would likely play out and what practical steps can be taken to rob Trump of the nomination, even if he technically has the delegates needed to win on the first ballot.

In March, the hunt for double agents: A large number of delegates can be recruited throughout the spring as double agents—arriving in Cleveland pledged to Trump, while working in cahoots with his opponents.

In April, party bosses can gut Trump’s primary wins: 31 states have Republican executives – de facto party bosses that can freely stack an at-large slate with cronies, expecting a rubber-stamp from a subservient party committee.

May: Those plotting the theft must convince supporters to stick with it, despite any backlash – nothing in the RNC’s rules prohibits delegates from cutting the deal.

June: Anti-Trump forces could challenge results of questionable state contests (Nevada caucus-site irregularities, anyone?), putting all of the state’s delegates back into play.

In July, party officials can begin squeezing out a candidate it does not want to see nominated. All eyes will be on the Standing Committee on Rules, which sets qualifications for candidates to appear on convention ballots.

HOT ON THE LEFT Trump surrogate says Sanders needs to 'meet Jesus.' From Mother Jones : ""A Trump surrogate said during a campaign event Monday morning that Sanders needs to find Jesus. Sanders, of course, is Jewish. Many of his Polish relatives on his father's side were killed during the Holocaust. The comment came at a rally in Hickory, North Carolina, on Monday morning, as Pastor Mark Burns warmed up the crowd ... 'Listen, Bernie gotta get saved, he gotta meet Jesus. I don't know, he gotta have a coming to Jesus meeting.'"" HOT ON THE RIGHT Official behind Pentagon's transgender push to resign. From the Washington Examiner : ""The Pentagon official who proposed including transgender individuals and women in the military announced he will resign from his post next month. Brad Carson ... had been charged with making controversial changes to military policies. He ran into other problems last month when the Senate Armed Services Committee ruled Carson had violated the federal Vacancies Act by taking on responsibilities of the job prior to his confirmation.""

DAYBOOK:

On the campaign trail: Fewer events today as candidates watch the returns roll in. Here's the rundown:

Clinton: West Palm Beach, Fla.

Sanders: Phoenix

Trump: Palm Beach, Fla.

Cruz: Houston

Rubio: Miami

Kasich: Westerville, Ohio

The AP moves this guidance on when to expect results: “Poll close at 7:30 p.m. EDT in North Carolina and Ohio. North Carolina has lots of early absentee voters, so close to half the ballots could be counted and reported in the first half-hour. Ohio also is a big absentee-vote state, so expect a fast, early count there as well. At 8 p.m., final polls close in Florida, Illinois and Missouri. Since most polls in Florida close at 7 p.m., there will be a lot of votes ready to report right at 8 p.m., allowing for possible early calls on both sides. Illinois and Missouri are slower counting states.”

At the White House: President Obama holds a bilateral meeting with Taoiseach Kenny of Ireland, attends a Friends of Ireland luncheon on Capitol Hill and delivers remarks at a reception for St. Patrick's Day. Vice President Biden attends these events, and meets with First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Northern Ireland in the afternoon.

On Capitol Hill: The Senate meets at 10 a.m. The House meets at noon to consider the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act, along with other measures.

QUOTE OF THE DAY: In Rockford, Ill., Cruz laid out a scenario in which he could not support Trump as the GOP nominee: “If, for example, he were to go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, I would not be willing to support Donald Trump.”

http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/16/politics/obama-supreme-court-announcement/index.html",0,"President Obama nominated Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday, calculating that the highly regarded jurist might blunt some of the expected political attacks and ultimately embarrass Senate Republicans into dropping their fierce opposition to the nomination. Amid a swirl of speculation about whether Obama would use the vacancy to expand ethnic or gender diversity on the court, Obama picked Garland, the 63-year-old chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A moderate who has been on the appellate bench for almost two decades, Garland has served presidents from both parties and was confirmed by the Senate 19 years ago. He is the grandson of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, not a “first” in the way an Asian American or black female nominee would have been.

But Obama decided that it might be more politically difficult for Republicans to deny Garland a hearing and a vote after he has been the subject of effusive bipartisan accolades for decades.

“I hope they’re fair,” the president said of Senate Republicans during his Rose Garden announcement. “That’s all. I hope they are fair.”

Although Obama was composed and even a bit defiant in his remarks, Garland choked up as he thanked the president. “This is the greatest honor of my life — other than Lynn agreeing to marry me 28 years ago,” Garland said. He mentioned his mother watching on television and “crying her eyes out” and his two sisters, “who have supported me in every step I have ever taken. I only wish that my father were here to see this today.”

Inside Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland’s crucial role in the Oklahoma City bombing investigation + 8 Before Merrick Garland was announced as President Obama’s nominee to the Supreme Court, he was a prosecutor and the linchpin in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing investigation and ultimate convictions of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.

In private conversations with aides and political allies in recent days, the president emphasized that although he might have disappointed some supporters who were lobbying for a woman or a person of color, he picked someone with whom he has a personal affinity and someone whose record was, in Obama’s words, “unassailable.”

White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said in an interview that Obama “was looking for someone whose values he shares, who’s committed to public service” and could serve as “a consensus builder” on the court.

“There is a humanity to his character that touched the president, as well,” she added.

Garland was on a list of three finalists that also included Sri Srinivasan, a 49-year-old Indian American who also sits on the D.C. Circuit, and Paul Watford, a 48-year-old California judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.

After the announcement, Senate Republican leaders reiterated their intention not to vote on the nomination, arguing again that they think the next president should fill the vacancy because it comes in the middle of a presidential election season and so late in Obama’s final term. But they refrained from attacking Garland directly. Half a dozen said they would meet with him, and a couple said they would consider holding a vote during a lame-duck session, especially if a Democrat won the White House in November.

Garland, who was appointed to the D.C. federal appeals court by President Bill Clinton in April 1997, was confirmed on a 76-to-23 vote and became chief judge three years ago. Seven current Republican senators voted to confirm Garland to the federal bench in 1997: Daniel Coats (Ind.), Thad Cochran (Miss.), ­Susan Collins (Maine), Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), James M. Inhofe (Okla.), John McCain (Ariz.) and Pat Roberts (Kan.).

Senators of both parties settled in Wednesday for what all expect to be an extended political siege around the nomination. Democrats will seek to pressure vulnerable Republican incumbents in tough reelection campaigns — and by extension, GOP leaders who are hoping to preserve their Senate majority — into abandoning the blockade.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) vowed that will not happen.

“It seems clear that President Obama made this nomination, not with the intent of seeing the nominee confirmed, but in order to politicize it for purposes of the election,” he said. “The American people are perfectly capable of having their say — their say — on this issue. So let’s give them a voice.”

But several other GOP senators, including some who are up for reelection, said they would meet with Garland. “I meet with people; that’s what I do,” said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a Judiciary Committee member.

Several Democrats said they did not think that Republicans would be able to maintain their opposition over the long term, especially as Donald Trump continues his march toward the GOP presidential nomination. At the very least, several postulated, they would be forced to relent in a lame-duck session if a Democrat wins the presidency in November.

“Republicans are underestimating how awful it is going to be when they go back home for their recess,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). “If you’re here in Washington for too long, you might be mistaken and misled into thinking this is a partisan issue. When they go back home, they’re going to get an earful.”

While Democratic-aligned activist groups had pushed for a more uniformly liberal nominee — and one who would make the court more diverse — virtually all Democratic senators who addressed Garland’s nomination said they were pleased by the choice.

“Nobody questions this man’s qualifications,” said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), the top Judiciary Committee Democrat.

Ed Whelan, a former Republican aide to the Senate Judiciary Committee who is now president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and is advising conservative groups opposed to the Obama nomination, said Garland’s nomination seemed calculated to “crack the Republican line.”

“Most justices are able to time their departure from the court so that someone of similar ilk replaces them,” he said. “My guess is the White House decided that rolling the dice, that they had the best chance of getting action on the Garland confirmation.”

By Wednesday evening, there were cracks in the GOP wall, but only a few.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) did not mention Garland by name, but in a lengthy statement he defended the Senate’s right to withhold its consent. “The American people shouldn’t be denied a voice,” he said.

After an afternoon call with Garland, he did not rule out a meeting but said if one were scheduled, he would only reiterate his determination to save the nomination for the next president.

After making his formal announcement, Obama met with the leaders of 23 progressive advocacy groups representing issues including labor, civil rights, abortion rights and the environment in the Roosevelt Room. Participants in the meeting with the president, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak frankly, said Obama emphasized that he did not pick a nominee with an eye to pleasing a specific political constituency. He said he thought many Americans would see the inherent unfairness of Republicans’ denying Garland a hearing.

Obama said that despite “a political season that is even noisier and more volatile than usual,” he hoped lawmakers would take the nomination seriously. “I chose a serious man and an exemplary judge,” he said.

Democrats on the campaign trail are hoping to leverage the court nomination as part of a broader narrative about Republican resistance to the president’s policies.

Both Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, and her rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, called on the Senate to vote on Garland. Clinton hailed Garland as “a brilliant legal mind” with a long history of “bipartisan support and admiration.” Refusing to consider the nomination would be “entirely unacceptable,” she said.

If the Senate declines to take up Garland’s nomination before Obama leaves office, or votes it down, the next president will have the option of resurrecting the nomination or choosing someone else to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Either way, the process would begin anew with the next Congress.

Sixty-three percent of Americans said the Senate should hold hearings on Obama's nominee to replace the late justice Antonin Scalia, while 32 percent said it should not hold hearings and leave it to the next president, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released last week.

Administration officials are hopeful that the GOP senators who are most vulnerable this November — Sens. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), Ron Johnson (Wis.), Mark Kirk (Ill.) and Pat Toomey (Pa.) — may lobby their leaders for a vote if they come under fire back home for blocking the nominee."

http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/23/europe/brussels-investigation/index.html",0,"The four men — two of them brothers — who turned ordinary morning commutes in Brussels into blood-soaked nightmares may have been spurred into action by fears that authorities were closing in on them, according to a note left by one of the attackers that was described by a prosecutor Wednesday.

Days before the attacks on Tuesday, counter­terrorism police had raided their Brussels safe houses. An ally who took part in November’s Paris carnage was shot and captured by authorities. And Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, a 29-year-old Belgian with a thick rap sheet, wrote that he did not want to wind up in a prison cell, Belgian federal prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said Wednesday.

The men — at least two of whom had direct ties to the Islamic State attacks in Paris — knew they had to act decisively. So they set out with explosives that ripped open a Brussels subway car and shattered the city’s main airport terminal, killing at least 31 people and injuring 300 in the bloodiest attack on Belgian soil since World War II.

Bakraoui detonated a suitcase full of nails, screws and powerful explosives at the airport, killing himself in the process, Van Leeuw said. So did Islamic State bombmaker Najim Laachraoui, 24, who is also believed to have prepared explosives for the Paris attacks, according to an Arab intelligence official and a European intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

An unidentified man who left an even larger suitcase of explosives at the airport is believed to still be at large, he said. That suitcase did not immediately detonate, sparing Belgium even more casualties.

The country held a national minute of silence Wednesday led by Prime Minister Charles Michel, who laid a wreath at the Maelbeek metro station in honor of the victims. Thousands of Belgians gathered in a somber ceremony in front of an ornate 19th-century stock exchange building to light candles and lay flowers.

The missive, contained in a computer that had been chucked into a garbage can near Bakraoui’s Brussels apartment, does not specifically cite recent raids across Belgium, including one that netted a key suspect in the Paris attacks. But its tone suggests a sense that the noose was tightening, Van Leeuw said.

The computer message also gives apparent insight into the organization and motivation of militants who apparently turned their attention to Brussels after pulling off the Paris attacks that killed 130 people.

In the note, Bakraoui described feeling pressure bearing down. He wrote that he was “in a hurry, no longer knowing what to do, being searched for everywhere, no longer secure,” according to Van Leeuw’s description of the message, which was not made public.

Laachraoui’s involvement draws the boldest line yet between the Paris attacks and those in Brussels. His DNA was found on explosives in the Paris attacks, and authorities believe that he was versed in the Islamic State art of assembling powerful explosives from ingredients that are readily available. His participation in two attacks suggests that the Islamic State is increasingly able to strike on European soil — although his death may also mean that he feared imminent capture by European authorities.

Terrorism experts regard bomb­makers, especially those trained in handling sensitive explosives, as among the most valuable and protected members of a terrorist organization. It is highly unusual for them to participate in suicide attacks themselves.

Laachraoui’s DNA was found in a Brussels apartment raided last week. The discovery of a militant cell there eventually led to the arrest of Salah Abdeslam on Friday. Abdeslam was the final at-large direct participant in the Paris attacks and is believed to have been the logistics mastermind.

The computer file that prosecutors cited Wednesday does not mention Abdeslam by name, but it says the attackers feared that if they did not strike quickly, they risked winding up in prison alongside “him.”

“If they drag on, they risk finishing next to him in a cell,” Van Leeuw said, paraphrasing the contents of the file.

Van Leeuw described the file as a “will” discovered on a computer. He did not explain why authorities believed the computer belonged to Bakraoui.

Bakraoui’s younger brother, Khalid el-Bakraoui, 27, is believed to have been the suicide bomber on a Brussels subway car that blew up as it sped out of a station underneath the heart of the European Union quarter of Brussels, an area packed with embassies and international organizations. That attack came 73 minutes after the one at the airport, meaning that commuters were already reading the news of the first explosions when the carnage reached them.

Khalid el-Bakraoui appears to have been a kind of surreptitious real estate broker for the plotters, according to a European security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case. Using assumed names, he rented an apartment in the Forest area of Brussels where Abdeslam’s fingerprints were found and an apartment near Charleroi, Belgium, where Paris attack mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud stayed as he plotted the violence.

Both Bakraoui brothers served prison time for violent crime, the European security official said. The announcement on Wednesday that two of the attackers were brothers highlighted another emerging tactic from the militant group: They would be the third pair of brothers involved in an Islamic State attack in Europe in the past 15 months.

European security leaders planned to gather Thursday in Brussels to discuss whether to pursue new policies that would better pool information to counter terrorism.

French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, visiting Brussels on Wednesday to extend his condolences, repeated past calls for sweeping new powers to be given to European intelligence agencies. “In the years to come, the [E.U.] member states will have to invest massively in their security systems,” he said.

Van Leeuw, the Belgian prosecutor, said the brothers had not previously been suspected of ties to terrorism.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that Turkey had deported one of the attackers to Europe in July and warned European counter­terrorism officials that it believed the man was a militant, suggesting a serious lapse by Belgian authorities. Interpol had also issued a “red notice,” effectively an international arrest warrant, for one of the suspects at the request of Belgian authorities. It was not immediately clear when that notice had been issued.

There were signs that an even bigger attack had been forestalled. Authorities found large stockpiles of bomb-building materials at Ibrahim el-Bakraoui’s apartment in the Schaerbeek area of Brussels, the prosecutor said: 33 pounds of TATP explosives, nearly 40 gallons of acetone, 8 gallons of hydrogen peroxide, detonators, and a suitcase full of nails and screws. Both acetone and hydrogen peroxide are easily obtainable; together they can be used to make potent explosives.

It remained unclear Wednesday how many Americans had been killed in the blasts. In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said that ""approximately a dozen"" Americans were injured but that ""a number"" of U.S. citizens remained unaccounted for on Wednesday — without providing more specific figures. He said that U.S. diplomatic missions in Brussels were working to account for all of their own staff.

Secretary of State John F. Kerry plans to visit Brussels on Friday on his return from a trip to Moscow.

http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/24/europe/brussels-victims-missing-dead/index.html",0,"Belgian authorities missed a chance to press a key terrorism suspect for intelligence in the days ahead of the suicide bombings that struck the capital, prosecutors said Friday, acknowledging a significant security lapse that may have allowed his allies to attack unimpeded. Even as the men involved in Tuesday’s attacks were racing to strike, fearful that authorities were closing in on them, investigators did not ask the attackers’ jailed ally, Salah Abdeslam, about his knowledge of future plots, Belgian federal prosecutors said Friday.

Abdeslam, believed to be the logistics chief of the Islamic State’s November attacks in Paris, was apprehended March 18, apparently spurring one of the Brussels attackers to write that he feared capture by the police. But after Abdeslam’s arrest, investigators concentrated solely on the Paris attacks. Abdeslam was questioned for two hours last Saturday, the day after he was captured in a raid at a Brussels safe house — and then no other discussions were held until after Tuesday’s attacks, when he refused to speak further, prosecutors said.

The failure to push Abdeslam for concrete intelligence — even as close associates were known to be on the loose — adds to an emerging picture of intelligence agencies, police forces­ and criminal investigators that repeatedly failed to take advantage of opportunities to avert the attacks on Tuesday, the worst single day of violence in Belgium since World War II.

“We cannot exclude that, if everybody had been perfect, this could have gone differently,” Belgian Justice Minister Koen Geens told a special session of Parliament convened Friday to question top security officials about the lapses.

The acknowledgment from the prosecutors came as authorities conducted raids across Brussels and in France and Germany, an indication that they were still hotly pursuing terrorist plots and that the network may spread across a wide stretch of Europe.

Two Belgian Islamic State fighters threatened that “this is just the beginning of your nightmare,” in a video released Friday. “Know we have other targets and we are determined,” said a man identified as Abu Abdullah al-Beljiki, according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist propaganda.

Belgian commandos and bomb-disposal units on Friday swept through a district at the heart of the Brussels attack probe. The raids followed police operations in France and Germany that displayed the expanding crackdowns that increasingly connect the last two terrorist blows in Europe: November’s bloodshed across Paris and Tuesday’s twin-site suicide bombings in Brussels that killed at least 31 people — including at least two Americans.

Among those arrested in the latest roundups was a French suspect who officials believe was directing a plot for an impending attack in France. The investigation touched off a series of related police raids in Belgium on Friday.

The police actions came as Secretary of State John F. Kerry touched down in Brussels to discuss strategies about how to combat the Islamic State with top European leaders. Kerry met with Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel before joining a Europe-wide security meeting to examine ways to counter militant reach into the continent. Officials have raised alarms about potential threats from citizens returning after fighting with the Islamic State and other groups.

Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Michel, Kerry defended Belgium’s security efforts. He said that it appeared to him at first glance that the Brussels attackers were moved to act because they feared being apprehended by authorities.

“That tells you the dragnet is closing in. It tells you law enforcement is in fact having an impact,” Kerry said. “It may not have worked out as everyone might have wished here, but if that is true . . . it tells you a lot about what’s beginning to become effective.”

But even Abdeslam’s attorney has suggested that his client may possess knowledge that could avert future terrorist attacks on European soil, further highlighting the lapse by Belgian investigators not to press Abdeslam for intelligence ahead of the Brussels attacks. The prosecutors said that they were slowed by the doctors’ treatment of the gunshot wound to the leg that Abdeslam suffered in the raid before his capture.

Abdeslam was not “up to date” about the Brussels attacks, his attorney, Sven Mary, told the Europe 1 radio network on Thursday.

But, Mary said, “I would not want him to stop talking for lots of reasons. To stop talking could face us again with other Zaventems and other Bataclans, and I would perhaps like to avoid that.”

He was referring to Brussels Airport in Zaventem, where two suicide bombers struck on Tuesday, and the Bataclan nightclub in Paris that was a target of the November attacks.

In raids across Brussels on Friday, police detained three people, including in a large operation in the Schaerbeek area, which has become a focal point of investigations into Tuesday’s attacks. Dozens of black-clad security officers swarmed a wide avenue to detain one person, setting off fears in a city still on edge from the recent violence.

Belgian TV aired amateur footage of the detention that appeared to show a man who had been shot in the leg being dragged away from a tram stop by counterterrorism police while a bomb-disposal robot waited nearby. Belgian prosecutors said the man was arrested in connection with a French raid a day earlier.

In Germany, authorities held a man who was deported from Turkey in July alongside Brussels suicide attacker Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, 29, over suspicions of trying to fight in Syria. A German official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said it was not immediately clear whether the man detained Thursday had direct ties to Bakraoui.

Both Bakraoui and his 27-year-old brother, Khalid el-Bakraoui, who also blew himself up on Tuesday, were on a U.S. terrorism watch list ahead of the attack, according to a U.S. official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.

It was not clear whether they had been on the U.S. “no-fly” list.

Neighbors said Friday that the Bakraoui family appeared unexceptional in the diverse Laeken area of Brussels. The brothers’ father was a butcher and their mother is a housewife. As for the siblings themselves, “they seemed very nice people, never the thugs with the caps who make people scared. Absolutely not,” said Fatima, 31, a family friend and neighbor who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used.

Belgium’s federal prosecutor said Friday that the suspect detained in a raid the previous night in the Paris suburb of Argenteuil is believed to have connections to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the deceased ringleader of the November attacks that left 130 dead.

Reda Kriket, a 34-year-old French citizen, had been convicted in a Belgian court in July of participating in the activities of a terrorist group, the prosecutor said. French authorities said that he had been planning an imminent attack on their country.

Meanwhile, the list of the Brussels victims became clearer.

At least two Americans were killed, a U.S. official said Friday, but their names were not disclosed.

Also among the dead from the airport bombings: a Dutch brother and sister who lived in the United States. They were Alexander Pinczowski, 29, and Sascha Pinczowski, 26, said a representative for their family, James Cain.

Cain, the father of Alexander Pinczowski’s fiancee and a former U.S. ambassador to Denmark, said the siblings had hoped to become U.S. citizens.

The Belgian Foreign Ministry announced that André Adam, a former ambassador to the United States, died in the attacks.

Britain, China and France also confirmed at least one citizen each among the fatalities, while the Netherlands confirmed one citizen in addition to the Pinczowskis.

http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/trump-is-in-trouble-in-wisconsin-221552",0,"THE BIG IDEA: -- Assuming Ted Cruz wins the Wisconsin primary tonight, expect most of the media coverage to focus on the increasing likelihood of a contested Republican convention. -- Cruz is trying to win a clean sweep of all 42 delegates from the Badger State. Last-minute attack ads against John Kasich are part of an effort to run the table. Delegates are apportioned by congressional districts, and there are one or two (of eight total) where the Texan believes he’s within the margin of error with Trump.

Polls show most of Kasich’s supporters in Wisconsin would pick Cruz over Trump as their second choice. “Kasich’s folks would be inclined to go with Cruz,” says Marquette pollster Charles Franklin. “There’s very little evidence that they’d go over to Trump.”

Kasich wants to win some delegates to show that he’s running a credible campaign. He’s eyeing the district that includes the liberal college town of Madison – which is represented by Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan.

-- The Ohio governor has begun to argue that it is “mathematically impossible” for Cruz to win a delegate majority. “He needs 102 percent of the delegates going forward,” Kasich said of Cruz at a short press conference outside Theodore Roosevelt’s old home on Long Island last night.

Advertisement

The 102 percent numbers came from a Wall Street Journal story, with more nuance than Kasich offered. The Journal also said Trump needs to get 66 percent of the remaining bound delegates left to be awarded, which will become a heavier lift after Wisconsin.

“Cruz has been awarded 463 delegates and must take 102 percent of remaining bound delegates to reach 1,237,” Reid Epstein writes in the Journal, “though his campaign believes its total is higher because of private commitments made by unbound delegates and delegates now tied to candidates who have suspended their campaigns.”

-- There are other counts that show Cruz could technically still win outright, but it’s hard to imagine anyone pulling away decisively with the race as muddied as it has become:

There are 802 delegates left that cld be bound. Trump is 468 delegates away from having 1237 bound; Cruz is 768 away from having 1237 bound. — Taniel (@Taniel) April 4, 2016

“The hope of putting Cruz out of outright contention for the first ballot comes in New York, where 95 delegates wait to be assigned, and an average of polls collected by RealClearPolitics puts Trump 32 points ahead of the field,” David Weigel, who is traveling with Kasich, explains. “A result like that would end Cruz’s ability to reach 1,237 in pledged delegates, unless a deal were worked out with a defeated candidate whose delegates are currently adrift.”

-- Trump and Cruz each believe they are hurt most by Kasich staying in the race.

Trump thinks the Ohio governor could siphon off enough delegates to prevent him from securing the nomination.

Cruz believes that he can win a two-man race because Trump has a ceiling of support that is somewhere under 50 percent, and polls show most Kasich voters would settle for him over Trump.

Kasich believes that, if he dropped out, Trump would probably get enough delegates in the upcoming Northeastern primaries to clinch the nomination.

-- Kasich also thinks that neither of his rivals could win a general election and that anything could happen in a contested convention. (Even if he’s very likely to come into Cleveland having only won his home state of Ohio.) “Cruz is saying ‘he's taking my voters.’ Trump is saying ‘he’s taking my voters.’ Yeah, they’re right. They’re both right,” Kasich said. “I’m taking both of their voters, because we’re going to continue to do well.”

-- After staying out of the fray for months, the Ohioan has shown a new willingness over the past week to hit Trump and Cruz more directly and forcefully. This could make him a much more consequential player during the three months leading up to the convention. Yesterday in New York, for instance, he called Cruz “a smear artist.”

""We have one guy with no experience and the other guy whose experience amounts to shutting down the government and calling the majority leader a liar,"" said Kasich. ""How do we go to a convention and we pick somebody that can't beat Hillary?”

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- A game for the ages: Villanova beat North Carolina in the NCAA title game. Forward Kris Jenkins hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer in the last sixth-tenths of a second, bringing the score to 77-74. ""With 4.7 seconds left, an almost equally dramatic, hanging, three-point shot from North Carolina senior Marcus Paige had tied the game at 74-74,"" Chuck Culpepper reports from Houston.

-- Trump finally outlined how he would force Mexico to fund his 1,000 mile border wall as president. In a two-page memo written to The Post’s Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, “Trump says he will threaten to cut off the flow of billions of dollars in payments that immigrants send home to Mexico, an idea that could decimate the Mexican economy and set up an unprecedented showdown between the U.S. and a key diplomatic ally … Entitled ‘Compelling Mexico to Pay for the Wall,’ the memo is the latest attempt by Trump to offer more specifics about his proposal at a time when he faces tough head winds. The memo includes rationales for a number of potential intimidation tactics, including increased trade tariffs, the cancellation of visas, and higher fees for border-crossing cards.”

-- Trump’s national lead dipped only slightly after a rough week, according to the NBC News/SurveyMonkey tracking poll. While the real estate mogul still leads the Republican field, his national lead dropped by three points, from 48 percent to 45 percent. Cruz is at 28 percent, and Kasich is at 18 percent. Trump also fell four points with voters who identify as conservative, dropping 50 to 46. Cruz, meanwhile, only moved up 2 points from last week. Meanwhile, Clinton continues to lead the Democratic contest nationally by 9 points.

-- Maryland’s Democratic Senate primary remains very much up for grabs, with voters sharply divided across racial lines, according to a new Washington Post/University of Maryland poll. Among all likely Democratic primary voters, Donna Edwards leads Chris Van Hollen 44 percent to 40 percent. But likely black voters favor Edwards by a nearly 3-to-1 margin. And more than twice as many white voters support Van Hollen as back Edwards. “While Edwards leads among women, that split has racial underpinnings as well: Van Hollen leads by 23 percentage points among white women, whereas Edwards holds a 51-point lead with black women,” Rachel Weiner and Scott Clement report.

Sanders reported $125,843 in total income … The publication’s scathing article notes that Sanders had dismissed the idea of charities in his early days as mayor — and that view was confirmed in his 1995 tax return, which showed Sanders donated just 1 percent of his income ($1,369) to charity.""

-- Actor Tim Robbins, stumping for Sanders in Wisconsin, said Clinton’s victory in South Carolina was “as significant as winning Guam"" because no Democrat will ever carry the state in a general election. Philip Bump explains why this is a bad argument: “Robbins's real point -- the real frustration of the anti-Clinton left – is, ‘why do these victories have so much significance?’ In other words: Why are these lopsided wins in the South so important, when Clinton and Sanders have played to ties in so many other places?""

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TODAY'S PRIMARY IN WISCONSIN (Polls close at 8 p.m. CT/9 p.m. ET.):

-- The Narrative: Both front-runners are playing defense. “A loss for Trump in particular could reset a Republican contest that has been dominated by his outsider candidacy and outsized media presence,” write Jose A. DelReal, John Wagner and Anne Gearan. ""Sanders winning Wisconsin win would give him fresh momentum and credibility for his claim that he can catch Clinton in the delegate count.”

-- The Upshot’s Nate Cohn argues that Trump’s struggle in Wisconsin is more the result of demographics than momentum. “All considered, the model-based estimates make Mr. Trump a five-point underdog, with a 40-35 edge for Mr. Cruz,” he writes in today’s Times. “To get a sense of whether Mr. Trump really lost ground after his controversial remarks, the key number to watch is 35 percent: the expected share of the vote for Mr. Trump based on the results so far. If he falls short, he has lost ground because of momentum, not demographics.”

-- Local newspapers are urging residents to be prepared for record voter turnout, despite forecasts for rain and snow. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports the state issued 214,500 early voting ballots as of Friday – more than double the 94,000 ballots issued in 2012.

The higher turnout is expected to benefit Sanders, who continued to add last-minute stops. “If there is a large turnout, we win,” he said at a Monday rally, according to The Capital Times. “If there is a low turnout, we will likely lose.”

-- Things are looking good for Sanders in Janesville, Paul Ryan’s hometown, after he hosted a series of last-minute campaign stops there. The Gazette Extra says Sanders has support from voters of all ages in the area. “I know I'm an older white woman. I should be for Hillary,” said former judge Judy Robson, who added “Sanders appeals to me more.”

-- “No longer a candidate, Scott Walker's presence still looms large in both party's contests,” by John Wagner and Jose A. DelReal: “Walker’s endorsement of Cruz appears to have bolstered his prospects against Trump in the Republican race … Meanwhile, the two Democrat rivals are using Walker as a punching bag, criticizing his anti-union policies and spending priorities. ‘When you want to think about a [Sanders administration], think about Walker in reverse,’ Sanders said. ... What’s more surprising is that Trump has repeatedly attacked Walker … ‘People are saying, 'He shouldn't be fighting the governor, the governor's popular,’ said Trump. ‘First of all, he's not popular … I think I made him unpopular in the state. And the fact is, [he’s] doing very mediocre.’”

-- In his closing argument, Sanders hit Clinton pretty hard on labor and trade. “I am not a candidate who goes to the unions, goes to workers, then leaves and goes to a fundraiser on Wall Street,” he said. “I’m glad that she’s going around the country talking about the need for more manufacturing. Well that’s a great idea, but maybe she should have been there 20 or 30 years ago when we started hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs in this country largely because of the disastrous trade policy.” (John Wagner)

-- Demonstrating her nervousness about the tightening race in New York, Hillary sharpened her attacks on Bernie's gun record. She told a group of Empire State legislators that many criminals get their guns from Vermont. Clinton is trying harder than ever to cast Sanders as a gun-loving NRA ally. ( Capital New York) -- Meanwhile, trying to save his wife from getting blown out in Wisconsin, Bill Clinton campaigned in Milwaukee. He spent the final day urging voters to appreciate his wife’s brand of pragmatism. “You've got to do the stuff that works,"" the 42nd president said. ( Journal Sentinel) -- Clinton manager Robby Mook pre-spins the campaign's expected Wisconsin loss in a memo that says Hillary still has ""a nearly insurmountable lead among both delegates and actual voters."" (Medium)

Clearest sign the campaign thinks they will lose WI: Clinton will not have a campaign event tomorrow night while Wisconsin results come in. — Dan Merica (@merica) April 4, 2016

-- Interesting historical context: The Badger State primary has been a very good bellwether since 1972. “No state in the nation can match Wisconsin’s record in backing the eventual Republican and Democratic nominees in the modern primary era,” the University of Minnesota’s Eric Ostermeier writes on his Smart Politics blog. “Wisconsin is one of nine states to back every Republican presidential nominee since 1972 and one of just four states to back all but one on the Democratic side.”

The only instance in which the Wisconsin primary winner did not go on to win the nomination since 1972 was in 1984, when Gary Hart narrowly defeated Walter Mondale in the primary.

“Despite Wisconsin holding its primary during the middle of the calendar in recent decades, it has hosted several meaningful, closely decided contests. Five Democratic winners were victorious by single digits (George McGovern in 1972, Jimmy Carter in 1976, Gary Hart in 1984, Bill Clinton in 1992, John Kerry in 2004) as well as two Republicans (Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Mitt Romney in 2012).”

MORE ON THE REPUBLICAN RACE:

-- “Cruz leans on allied super PAC as nomination fight rolls on,” by Matea Gold and Sean Sullivan in Green Bay: “The only inkling that this was not an ‘official’ Cruz event were staffers wearing ‘KTP’ badges. They worked for Keep the Promise, a Cruz-allied super PAC that has effectively served as an extension of Cruz’s official campaign … Cruz has appeared at nearly 20 KTP-organized rallies as a ‘special guest,’ in an arrangement that takes advantage of federal rules governing how campaigns and PACs interact. KTP’s move into event production shows how super PACs allied with 2016’s presidential candidates have expanded portfolios beyond television campaigns. The big-money groups, which are not allowed to coordinate paid strategies with candidates, have taken on policy research and field organizing, seeking new ways to bolster their favored candidates.”

-- This could be fatal in a general --> Madison Capital Times, “Cruz in Wisconsin: Roe v. Wade not settled, ban abortion with no exceptions,” by Jessie Opoien: “Cruz took questions from Fox News host Megyn Kelly and audience members at a town hall event Monday ... Early in the event, a woman who described herself as a moderate, pro-choice Republican told Cruz she's afraid if he becomes president he will outlaw abortion entirely. Cruz said he wants to see people's hearts and minds changed on the issue. He argued laws should be changed at the state level, not through judicial decisions. He also said he believes the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision is not settled law, calling it an example of judicial activism. Kelly then noted that Cruz doesn't favor exceptions to allow abortion in cases of rape or incest.”

Full quote from Cruz: ""When it comes to rape, rape is a horrific crime against the humanity of a person, and needs to be punished and punished severely. But at the same time, as horrible as that crime is, I don't believe it's the child's fault. And we weep at the crime, we want to do everything we can to prevent the crime on the front end, and to punish the criminal, but I don't believe it makes sense to blame the child.""

-- “The GOP’s (other) convention nightmare,” by Politico’s Alex Isenstadt: “Republicans, already girding for their most tumultuous convention in decades, now have another fight brewing: a divisive battle over gay marriage on the party’s official national platform. … Both sides are mobilizing in anticipation of a bitter clash over whether the party should embrace a more moderate approach against same-sex marriage or maintain a hard line against it. Some of the GOP’s biggest financiers are helping bankroll the American Unity Fund, who launched a behind-the-scenes effort to [promote same-sex marriage among convention delegates], asking them to adopt language supporting it. Social conservatives, alarmed at what they view as an effort to topple a central tenet of their movement, are also gearing up. Last week, Family Research Council president Tony Perkins secured one of Louisiana’s slots on the platform committee. Perkins is expected to take the lead in litigating efforts to change the party’s position. ‘We’re prepared for the fight,’ said Ed Martin, president of a leading evangelical group. ‘It’s hand-to-hand combat.’”

-- Trump met privately with leaders from nearly a dozen interest groups during his trip to D.C. last Thursday. “Former lobbyist and Bush staffer Nicholas E. Calio was in attendance, [who] is now the president and chief executive of Airlines for America, a large trade group,"" the New York Times reports. ""There was also Juanita Duggan, the president and chief executive of the National Federation of Independent Business, who served in the first Bush and Reagan administrations … Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said that the candidate’s adviser, Senator Jeff Sessions, had arranged a meeting with people for whom he has ‘great respect.’”

-- Trump has assembled a privately funded security and intelligence force with a far wider reach than other campaigns’ private security operations: tracking and rooting out protesters, patrolling campaign events and supplementing Secret Service protection, Politico reports. From Kenneth P. Vogel and Brianna Gurciullo: “Dozens of activists marched into a Janesville hotel, demanding a Trump event set for the following day be cancelled. Within minutes, members of Trump’s advance security team were in the lobby, circling the room and filming protestors. As they chanted ‘build communities, not walls,’ former FBI agent Don Albracht ripped a sign out of one protester’s hands, jutting his phone within inches of her face … The Janesville fracas is only one example of aggressive tactics Trump's security has been using to tamp down protests.""

WAPO HIGHLIGHTS:

-- “Chuck Grassley sticks to Republican script on Supreme Court nomination,” by Kelsey Snell in Rock Rapids, Iowa: “Despite massive pressure from Democrats, the Judiciary Committee chairman is sticking steadfastly to his vow not to hold hearings or a confirmation vote on Garland before November’s elections. … For Grassley, 82, the political calculus is pretty simple … Conservatives have posed a problem for Grassley in the past. Six years ago, when he was last up for reelection, he faced an uprising from the right for trying to craft a bipartisan health-care plan with then-Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.). Grassley abandoned those plans in summer 2009 and is not keen on facing another conservative insurrection in 2016. ‘I’m not surprised with the pressure I’m getting now. But it’s a lot more fun to have it come from the Democrats than it is from Republicans,’ Grassley said Tuesday as he headed for his car at the end of one of nine meetings with Iowa voters in two days.”

Right-leaning groups are backing up the senator more than left-leaning groups are attacking him: The anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony List is buying television and radio ads and the Judicial Crisis Network has spent over $750,000. … On the other side, liberal group Justice Not Politics, led by a group of female Iowa politicians, intends to spend about $100,000 on ads that urge voters to call Grassley and demand he hold hearings.

-- Be vigilant and careful --> “The strange seasonality of violence,"" by Michael S. Rosenwald: “Mass-murder researchers and terrorism experts do not like turning their calendars to April. For them, it marks the beginning of what one calls ‘the killing season.’” April is the month of the Oklahoma City bombing, the Boston Marathon bombing, the shootings at Columbine and Virginia Tech in 2007, as well as Waco’s attack and a stabbing in Pennsylvania. But why would April, with cheerful tulips and spring sunshine, trigger so much extreme violence?""

Some say warm temperatures could actually be a contributing factor, “stirring action” among the depressed and socially isolated. “You have these people coming out of hibernation with anger peaked and ready to go,” said Professor Adam Lankford, adding that rage may build [by seeing] people out in groups. “That highlights discrepancies between socially healthy individuals and those who aren’t.”

Another factor is the desire to pay “homage” to other violent anniversaries: On April 19, 1992, the FBI stormed a compound to capture the Branch Davidians sect leader, [killing] 76 people … And two years later, Timothy McVeigh blew up a federal building in Oklahoma City on the same day. “Terrorists consider dates to be very important and symbolic,” said Lankford. “The more attention you bring to a certain date, the more it can snowball. Columbine shooters Harris and Klebold plotted their attack for April 19, saying they wanted to carry out an attack ‘bigger than Oklahoma City.’”

Imogen Wilson, 22, was subject to a ‘safe space complaint’ over her supposedly ‘inappropriate hand gestures’ during a student council meeting. Wilson spoke out against safe space rules becoming ‘a tool for the hard left to use when they disagree with people’ … According to association rules, student council meetings should be held in a ‘safe space environment,’ defined as ‘a space which is welcoming and safe and includes the prohibition of discriminatory language and actions.’ This includes ‘refraining from hand gestures which denote disagreement.’

Speaking in an overwhelmingly African American neighborhood of Philadelphia, the city that will host this summer’s Democratic National Convention, the former president offered a spirited defense of his record on civil rights, his signature crime bill and his wife.

One of the protesters held a sign that declared, ""Black youth are not super predators.” That’s a reference to when Hillary Clinton spoke in 1996 of “the kinds of kids that are called ‘super-predators’” and said “we have to bring them to heel.”

Clinton pointed to the signs. “This is what’s the matter,” he said. “I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-olds hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other African American children. Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn't! … You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter! Tell the truth! You are defending the people who caused young people to go out and take guns.”

The 69-year-old went on an extended riff about why he and his wife are the ones who have really fought to make black lives matter:

""Because of that [crime] bill we had a 25-year low in crime, a 30-year low in the murder rate, and because of that and the background-check law, a 46-year low in deaths of lives by gun violence,” he said. “And who do you think those lives were that mattered? Whose lives were saved that mattered?""

Bill noted that Hillary, unlike Bernie Sanders, did not vote for the crime bill. ""She was spending her time trying to get health care for poor kids,” he said. “Who were they? And their lives matter!”

He also highlighted the Democratic front-runner's work for the Children's Defense Fund as a young attorney in Alabama and her work to stop the spread of HIV in Africa as secretary of state. ""I'll tell you another story about a place where black lives matter: Africa,"" he said.

Watch the full exchange here:

-- In a year when the drama has mostly been on the Republican side, it made for great political theater. And it gave Bill Clinton another unforgettable “Sister Souljah Moment.” In May 1992, the hip-hop artist suggested that killing white cops might not be so bad in the wake of the Los Angeles riots. Speaking at a convention organized by Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow Coalition, the then-governor of Arkansas ripped into her. ""If you took the words ‘white’ and ‘black’ and reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech,” he said. “We have an obligation, all of us, to call attention to prejudice whenever we see it.” (C-SPAN’s archive has the video.)

Calling her out became legendary and helped Clinton pivot from the Democratic nominating contest he was wrapping up, when he needed base voters, to the general election, when he needed independents. Twenty-four years later, we are at a very similar phase in the campaign cycle.

-- Yesterday’s showdown in Philadelphia quickly became a Rorschach Test. Republicans and liberal activists inclined to dislike WJC called it evidence of him being out of touch and over the hill, while Clinton loyalists said it was the Big Dog at his best. The majority of the crowd of 400 cheered Clinton as he made the protesters his foils.

-- Most mainstream media outlets are covering the comments as another off-message embarrassment for his wife’s campaign, but let’s dispense once and for all with the fiction that Bill Clinton does not know what he’s doing. He knows exactly what he’s doing.

FROM CONTRITE TO DEFIANT:

-- A year ago, most D.C. pundits would have bet that the 2016 general election would pit Hillary versus Jeb, and that Democrats could win by making the campaign about whether voters wanted to give Bill or W. a third term. The Bushes are now long gone. Indeed, both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz criticize the former president to varying degrees. Because the Democratic primaries turned out to be more competitive than anticipated, it’s been hard for the Clintons to lean on nostalgia for the 1990s. Instead the former president and first lady have been pressed constantly from the left on everything from NAFTA to DOMA.

Advertisement

-- Bill’s comments about the Black Lives Matter movement suggest that a major pivot in the campaign’s messaging is on the way.

Smarting from the 2008 defections of African Americans to Barack Obama and recognizing that securing the Democratic nomination this time would depend on running up the score among minority voters, the Clintons set out in the spring of 2015 to inoculate themselves from criticism over the crime bill. “We overshot the mark,” Bill wrote in the foreword to a book on mass incarceration that came out exactly one year ago. The same month, Hillary gave a speech at Columbia University -- in the wake of the Baltimore riots – to promise that criminal justice reform to end sentencing disparities -- which were made worse by her husband’s bill – would be a top priority as president.

Last July, the former president told the NAACP convention that he deeply regretted sending minor criminals to prison “for way too long.” ""I signed a bill that made the problem worse, and I want to admit it,"" he said.

Advertisement

Yesterday, the former president instead blamed congressional Republicans for the parts of the law that have increased mass incarceration. He said then-Sen. Joe Biden told him it could not pass if the tough-on-crime provisions were not added in.

After Hillary was confronted this February by a protester about the “super predator” comment, she expressed regret. “Looking back, I shouldn’t have used those words, and I wouldn’t use them today,” she said in a statement.

-- Now, as the general election looms, polls show that his wife is badly underperforming with white voters in key battleground states compared to 2008. But Bill’s strategy is not without risk. Hillary needs high African American turnout to beat Bernie in New York on April 19 and in the Pennsylvania and Maryland primaries on April 26. She also needs to keep the Obama coalition activated through November.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- Bernie Sanders is going to speak at the Vatican next week, John Wagner scoops. He'll leave for Rome immediately after his debate with Clinton on April 14 for a conference on social, economic and environmental issues.

-- Sanders turned his stump speech into comedy on “The Late Show with Seth Meyers”: The Vermont senator offered a comedic twist on his disdain for the billionaire class, roasting the “one percenters” alongside Meyers on a segment called “Ya Bernt.” “One percent -- what do you need all that money for?” Sanders asked. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d think you were trying to compensate for something.” As for the big banks, Sanders had this to say: “My advice is the same advice I give to a couple contemplating an open relationship. It’s time to break up.” (John Wagner)

-- Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper -- who could be a contender in the veepstakes -- hosted Hillary for a fundraiser at his home in Denver last night. Isaac Slade, lead vocalist for The Fray, performed for the 530 attendees. A white noise machine was set up to prevent reporters standing across the street from hearing Hillary's comments in the governor's back yard, according to the local CBS affiliate.

-- Seven in 10 Americans now view Trump unfavorably, according to an AP-GfK poll. And the negativity transcends typical “voter blocs” of age, race and ideology: “It's an opinion shared by majorities of men and women; young and old; conservatives, moderates and liberals; and whites, Hispanics and blacks … a devastatingly broad indictment of [Trump]."" The numbers also suggest Trump could be losing his core base: ""In the South – a region where Trump has decisively won many primary contests – close to 70 percent of voters view him unfavorably. And among white voters without a college education, 55 percent have a negative opinion.""

-- Not ready to make nice: Ted Cruz refuses to apologize to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for publicly calling him “a liar” last year. “That ain't gonna happen,"" the Texas senator said on CNN last night. “And if the Washington lobbyists want to see that happen, they can hold their breath a long, long time."" So much for trying to win over his Senate colleagues...

-- American Idol is finally over. ""Less than two months after the curtain went down on #OscarsSoWhite — at least until 2017 — it seems that 'American Idol' may be too white as well. Or, more specifically, too deferential to 'generic' white guys, often wielding guitars. This was the consensus on social media after Trent Harmon, a self-described white 'dude from Mississippi,' defeated La’Porsha Renae, a black single mother from the same state."" (Justin Wm. Moyer)

GET SMART FAST:​​

TRUMP SHAKES UP CAMPAIGN AFTER GETTING CAUGHT FLAT-FOOTED IN DELEGATE HUNT:

-- Trump announced yesterday that he is reorganizing his campaign, giving an expanded role to veteran strategist Paul J. Manafort. From Karen Tumulty and Dan Balz: ""Manafort, who joined the Trump operation on March 29 as its convention manager, will now have broader responsibilities, and will 'oversee, manage and be responsible for all activities that pertain to Mr. Trump's delegate process and the Cleveland convention,' the campaign said in its announcement. Manafort, working from a new D.C. campaign office, will also be in charge of outreach efforts to members of Congress, the Republican National Committee and think tanks. While the campaign insisted there had been no reduction in the role of embattled campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, it was nonetheless seen that way in Republican circles. Manafort's new portfolio is the operation that could be most crucial to Trump's success in the coming months. Said one GOP strategist who has worked with Manafort, and who declined to be identified: 'I can assure you that Lewandowski should be looking for new employment at this point. He's half wiped out already.'""

“Trump is not a dumb man,” Chris Cillizza writes. “He didn’t get to where he is … by not grasping when things are slipping away from him … [T]he writing appears to be on the wall. Manafort will run things going forward.”

-- Smart frame --> “The strategist vs. the showman: Cruz and Trump run very different campaigns,” by Katie Zezima: “Cruz is the disciplined strategist who stays relentlessly on message and runs a by-the-book organization filled with aides and state chairs … Trump, by contrast, runs what amounts to a DIY presidential campaign. … While the approach has left Trump with little established infrastructure as the race turns into a brawl for delegates, it has also allowed him to be nimble … Cruz’s advance work will be on display this weekend in Colorado, one of five states that leave it up to party members to elect the state’s 37 delegates to the national convention. Organizers said much of the work has been done with little input from Cruz [headquarters in Houston]. ‘There are 50 different states with 50 different speeds,’ said Ken Buck, the senator’s Colorado state chairman.”

-- Trump and Cruz face their first test in the Virginia delegate fight tomorrow: “A few hundred Republicans are set to gather in Wytheville, a town of 8,000 in the state's southwest corner, to elect three delegates to the Republican convention,” the AP reports. “At first glance, the 9th Congressional District's local convention appears to be fertile ground for Trump … But the Cruz campaign is counting on a superior advantage with party insiders, both in Virginia and around the country, to get its preferred delegates elected. Political watchers say these types of party insiders who take the time to register for and attend regional party meetings are more likely to back Cruz. ‘The issue is who is going to these convention,’ said Terry Kilgore, a Republican state House delegate ... ‘The Cruz people understand the game a little bit better.’”

-- Trump leads Cruz by 7 points in California, according to the Field Poll. The front-runner has 39 percent, with Cruz at 32 percent and Kasich at 18 percent. Trump leads in the Bay Area and in the Southern California region outside of Los Angeles. Cruz is preferred over Trump in L.A. proper and among voters in the Central Valley and Sierra mountains, whereas supporters for Kasich are somewhat evenly dispersed across the state. The primary in June will award delegates by congressional districts. Former supporters of Arnold Schwarzenegger prefer Trump: Voters who backed his gubernatorial bid in the recall prefer Trump over Cruz by a three to one margin.

-- “Trump has more than math to worry about in Cleveland,” by Politico’s Kyle Cheney: “Every aspect of the Republican National Convention is a potential tripwire that motivated anti-Trump forces could deploy to waylay the mogul.” Five tactics Cruz could use to try denying Trump the nomination.

Disqualifying delegates: Even if Trump wins the necessary number of delegates, campaigns can “pepper” delegates with eligibility challenges meant to keep his supporters out of Cleveland.

Naming a chairman: The chairman is selected by delegates and wields great authority to direct the proceedings. “Campaigns are eyeing a hostile takeover of the chairmanship, which could occur only with the delegates’ blessing — to ensure that the process works in their favor.”

Working the rules: “The Convention Rules Committee could theoretically set the calendar in certain ways …” said one veteran delegate. “The committee’s proposals must be ratified on the [convention floor], but if one candidate has a disproportionate edge on the committee, it likely reflects a similar edge in the convention writ large.”

Delay, delay, delay: “When delegates get hungry and homesick, they’re more than likely to make rash decisions,” said one state party chairman. “I’ve seen that throughout the years at conventions. I think the longer it goes, the more likely it is that something crazy happens.”

Exploiting logistics: Candidates will wrangle for speaking slots and housing supportive state delegations inside the surrounding Secret Service perimeter. “The biggest problem if you went to [the 2012 GOP convention in] Tampa, was the Secret Service lockdown,” said one RNC member. “If you’re inside [the perimeter], it’s great. But outside was a nightmare.”

-- Ben Carson proved again to be a terrible Trump surrogate. When asked on CNN if Lewandowski should be running the show after being charged with battery, he responded that “a lot of people have been charged with various things … You’ve probably been charged with things.” (The interviewer replied that he has not.)

-- Jeff Sessions, Trump's only supporter in the Senate, said he does not think Trump will pick him as VP. “I think that would not happen,"" he said. “Don’t bet any money on me.” (The Hill)

-- Rudy Giuliani told the New York Post that he will vote for Trump, hitting Cruz for his comments on ""New York values."" He quipped, “I can make fun of New York. But you can’t!""

MORE ON THE DEMOCRATIC RACE:

-- There is widespread and growing concern among Democrats that the Clinton-Sanders rivalry is doing lasting damage to the party and the eventual nominee. ""With both candidates launching 10-day sprints ahead of New York’s April 19 primary, the strain and resentment of a hard-fought and unexpectedly long contest boiled over repeatedly in interviews, speeches and other public appearances,"" John Wagner, Abby Phillip and Anne Gearan report. ""The senator from Vermont refused to retract his assertion that Clinton is not qualified to be president. Clinton dismissed that claim as 'silly' and countered that Sanders has repeatedly made promises he can’t keep. ... Sanders continued to blame Clinton for going on the attack and said he has simply been defending himself. And while he expressed regret for the tenor of the campaign over the previous 24 hours and said the acrimony will make it harder for Democrats to unite in the fall, he also said he does not regret his own statements. Clinton had raised questions in a television interview about whether Sanders was prepared to be president, but she repeatedly stopped short of saying he was unqualified.""

""President Obama, who has sought to stay out his party’s nominating contest, weighed in Thursday though a spokesman. Traveling with Obama on Air Force One, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Obama believes that Clinton 'comes to the race with more experience than any non-vice president' in recent campaign history. Schultz emphasized that Obama feels 'fortunate' that Clinton, whom he defeated in a sometimes nasty battle for the 2008 nomination, served as his secretary of state.""

-- In an interview with The Post's John Wagner, Sanders stood by his view that Clinton is not qualified — but he also pledged to support her if she is the nominee. Three highlights:

On whether he thinks the feuding will make it harder to unify Democrats in the fall : “I do, and I regret it. I have tried throughout this entire campaign to run an issue-oriented campaign … I have rejected time and time and time again a request, in a sense, from the media, to attack Clinton. I have not said one word about her email situation. I have not said one word about the Clinton Foundation, and I don’t intend to.”

On whether the negative tone will continue: “This is not my style. It is not what I want. I don’t think it’s good for the party or for the country … but let me make it very clear … we will not accept lies and distortions of my record or personal attacks lying down. We will respond accordingly.”

On whether he regrets calling Clinton “unqualified”: “No. When somebody says that I am unqualified to be president and gives her reasoning, I think it is totally appropriate for me to respond as to why I think she may not be qualified as well.”

-- Congressional Democrats expressed hope that the dust-up over whether Hillary is ""qualified"" serves as a warning for both candidates to tone things down and keep the party more cohesive than the Republicans. “It’s really important that everybody take a pause, that everybody calm down,” said North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. “At this point in campaigns, people get tired, say things they don’t mean to, emotions get raw. I think a lot of this will dissipate with a couple good nights’ sleep.”

-- “Panama financial scandal blows up into Democratic skirmishing over trade,” by David Nakamura:

“ Trade critics lambasted the administration as failing to heed their prior warnings and win sufficient financial reforms from Panama before signing a landmark free-trade deal in 2011 , missing a chance to disrupt the elaborate financial arrangements disclosed"" in the Panama Papers.

Obama allies forcefully defended the trade pact as an instrument that brought greater transparency to the country's shadowy offshore banking system: “Although trade deals do not typically address tax issues, U.S. officials said, the Obama administration won a separate agreement that gave financial regulators greater access to information on Panamanian bank accounts. 'We fought time and time again,' said Rep. Sander M. Levin, who supported the deal. 'I was personally involved in making clear to [Panama’s government] that no matter what else was in the free-trade agreement’ it would not win support from Congress without additional transparency rules.”

SCOTUS NOMINATION BATTLE:

-- President Obama took pains to describe Merrick Garland as a unifying figure during a speech at The University of Chicago Law School. Juliet Eilperin and Mike DeBonis: ""In a carefully-orchestrated question and answer session with students and faculty – including several of Garland’s family members, the president said failure to confirm his court nominee would make the courts “just an extension of our … elections and our politics. And that erodes the institutional integrity of the judicial branch.”

One questioner pressed Obama about the lack of diversity on the bench and asked why he picked a white man. Obama said “that’s just not how I’ve approached it"": “At no point did I say: ‘Oh, you know what? I need a black lesbian from Skokie in that slot. Can you find me one?’” (The Skokie Review notes that this comment sent the suburb north of Chicago trending online...)

-- Minority Whip Richard Durbin said Democrats are ""actively considering"" legislative maneuvers to push a vote on Garland. ""Democrats have thus far refrained from holding up legislation or other Senate business to gain leverage on the court fight. An ultimate step would be to force a floor vote on Garland without committee action — a move that would almost certainly fail but would attract attention and put those vulnerable Republican incumbents on the spot. A Democratic leadership aide said that is being considered as a last resort, one that would not be deployed for months.""

-- Lindsey Graham said he will meet with Garland, reversing course on his earlier pledge not to. Spokesman Kevin Bishop said it was a “courtesy” meeting, and the South Carolina senator “remains opposed to moving forward with the nomination.”

WAPO HIGHLIGHT:

-- “Why a Va. senator told a teacher: ‘You do not know better than the parents,’” by Jenna Portnoy: “Sen. Richard H. Black doesn’t think of himself as squeamish. But the Northern Virginia Republican said he was so stunned by the ‘moral sewage’ in … Toni Morrison’s ‘Beloved’ that he did something he professes to never have done [in office]. He abandoned all diplomacy and told a constituent exactly what he thought. Black called the book ‘profoundly filthy’ and ‘smut.’” The screed is part of an extraordinary email exchange between Black and Loudoun County teacher Jessica Berg, who “wrote to Black to protest his vote for a bill that would have required teachers to give parents advance notice if they planned to assign material with sexually explicit content in class [allowing parents to ‘opt out’ their children from reading the offending books]. ‘It’s ridiculous that you are trying to control education when you have no idea what it entails,’ she wrote. ‘You do not want free thinkers.’ ‘I want teachers who won’t teach such vile things,’ he responded. ‘You do not know better than the parents.’” (Read the full back and forth here.)

GOOD READS FROM ELSEWHERE:

-- Bloomberg, “McCain-Linked Nonprofit Received $1 Million From Saudi Arabia,” by Bill Allison: “A nonprofit with ties to Senator John McCain received a $1 million donation from the government of Saudi Arabia in 2014, according to documents filed with the [IRS]. [McCain] has strictly honorary roles with the McCain Institute for International Leadership, a program at Arizona State University, and its fundraising arm, the McCain Institute Foundation, according to his office. But McCain has appeared at fundraising events for the institute and his Senate campaign’s fundraiser is listed in its tax returns as the contact person for the foundation. Though federal law strictly bans foreign contributions to electoral campaigns, the restriction doesn’t apply to nonprofits engaged in policy, even those connected to a sitting lawmaker … The Saudi donation to the McCain Institute Foundation may be the first congressional instance of that trend coming to light ‘The extent of this practice is difficult to gauge, of course,’ Holman said, ‘because we only know about it when a nonprofit or foreign government voluntarily reveals that information.’” (We missed this story when it came out last week but it's caused a stir in Arizona, where McCain is up for reelection.)

The Post’s Fact Checker givers McCain ""Two Pinocchios"" for saying he has nothing to do with the foundation: “He has a symbolic role with the nonprofit, attends fundraisers and he and his wife are supportive of its efforts. So his role clearly goes beyond [simply being a namesake] … But McCain should be held accountable for his inaccurate claim, because it ultimately misled the public to believe he had no ties to the institute that he helped create.” He has a symbolic role with the nonprofit, attends fundraisers and he and his wife are supportive of its efforts. So his role clearly goes beyond [simply being a namesake] … But McCain should be held accountable for his inaccurate claim, because it ultimately misled the public to believe he had no ties to the institute that he helped create.”

HOT ON THE LEFT “One-Third Of Iraqis Believe America Supports Terrorism,” from HuffPost: “Nearly 1 in 3 Iraqis believe that America supports terrorism overseas. It’s just one of a handful of damning poll numbers showing waning United States-Iraqi relations as part of a U.S. State Department Inspector General’s Office evaluation of the American embassy in Baghdad. America’s popularity has plummeted since it reentered the country in 2014 to help Iraq battle the self-described Islamic State. The report states that the ‘Iraqi public [is] already keenly aware of ISIL’s (also called ISIS) true nature’ and, at the same time, Iraqis’ image of the U.S. has ‘fallen from 38 percent favorable in December 2014 to 18 percent in August 2015.’” HOT ON THE RIGHT “3 former defense secretaries slam White House 'micromanagement',” from Washington Examiner: “The military has suffered under Obama, according to all three of his former Pentagon leaders, because of problems ranging from ‘micromanagement’ to ‘35-year-old PhDs who love to talk.’ ‘It was the operational micromanagement that drove me nuts, of White House and [National Security Council] staffers calling senior commanders out in the field and asking them questions …’ former Defense Secretary Robert Gates said … ""I told my combatant commanders and field commanders … if you get calls from … the president, that's one thing,"" Gates said. ‘But if you get a call from some White House or National Security Council staffer, you tell them to call me instead, and then tell them, by the way, go to hell … directly from the secretary of defense.’”

He threatened to sue the Republican National Committee. He called its nominating system ""rigged,"" ""deceptive"" and ""a disgrace."" And he has suggested he might try to depose the party chairman.

But as RNC members gathered at a palatial beach resort here this week, Trump’s aides launched an urgent effort aimed at rebranding the mogul’s persona and thawing hostilities with the skittish party elite.

“We need unity as soon as possible,” said Ed Cox, the New York party chairman and a Trump supporter.

Yet while the charm offensive has made some progress, interviews with dozens of GOP officials here showed that the celebrity billionaire still has to overcome a host of lingering concerns — both about his loyalty to the party as well as his discipline and electability as a candidate.

“We’re the ones that built this party,” said Jonathan Barnett, a national committeeman from Arkansas. “You see so many states where they have never reached out or built an organization. . . . Remember, we’re good people. We’re the grass roots. We’ve been around a long time. And Trump needs us.”

Trump’s top campaign aide, Paul Manafort, assured RNC members here that Trump views the party leadership as “partners,” both in raising money and crafting a state-by-state strategy, and that his hot rhetoric has been “a part that he’s been playing” and will soon give way to a more presidential demeanor.

“He gets it,” Manafort told RNC members in a closed-door briefing Thursday.

Some members were skeptical of Manafort’s pitch.

“Trump keeps saying that he’s going to be so presidential that he’ll put you to sleep,” said José Cunningham, chairman of the District of Columbia GOP. “He loves to say that. His people say he’ll do that, have that demeanor. I’d still like to see that because, well, we haven’t.”

Trump himself is taking steps to repair relations. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus called the billionaire mogul on Wednesday to congratulate him on his blowout victory in the New York primary.

“We had a great talk, no problem,” Priebus said in an interview. “Donald Trump is conciliatory. You notice he hasn’t been saying ‘RNC’ lately. He hasn’t been saying that lately. He certainly hasn’t been talking about me lately.”

The Fix's Chris Cillizza breaks down what's at stake for Democrats and Republicans in the upcoming April 26 primaries. (Video: Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)

Priebus acknowledged that there probably are political benefits for Trump to rail against the process and use the RNC as a foil.

“They’ve made a calculation somehow that it works, ginning people up over accusations that the delegate selection process is rigged,” Priebus said. “I don’t think they would be doing it on a lark.”

Priebus said that the process is not skewed against Trump: “Nothing’s rigged, just like nothing was rigged in New York when the top vote-getter got 60 percent of the vote but received 90 percent of the delegates.”

Trump’s rhetoric fits into his broader playbook to run against what he sees as corruption across the economic and political spectrums. Manafort said in an interview that Trump’s portrayal of the GOP nominating rules “is no different than the rigged economy, the rigged banking system.”

“It fits into the whole narrative of the system is broken and certain types of establishment situations don’t meet the expectations of people,” he said.

For much of the campaign, the Trump operation seemed to alienate, even shun party officials who are accustomed to courtship by candidates.

Many officials took particular umbrage at Trump’s on-and-off public flirtation with ousting Priebus.

“Stop the attacks on Reince and the RNC leadership,” South Carolina GOP Chairman Matt Moore said. “Reince is the best chairman, I think, in the party’s history, and there is no question that he is the guy to lead us into the general election. Any discussion about a new chairman is completely stupid.”

Advertisement

On that point, Manafort said, “This discussion over the last few weeks has not been an anti-Reince campaign.”

Trump has been outfoxed by his chief Republican rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, at state conventions and other gatherings where delegates to the national convention are selected. Manafort said Trump is not seeking to upend the existing rules but believes the system lacks transparency and is trying to lay the groundwork for changes in future years.

Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich addressed the RNC this week. Also present were leaders of Our Principles PAC, an anti-Trump super PAC, who huddled privately with some members Friday. The group’s chairwoman, Katie Packer, distributed a memorandum urging party leaders to do everything possible to stop Trump from locking up the nomination.

“It is not too late,” Packer wrote. “You are under no obligation to wrap your arms around a candidate who has not won a majority of GOP votes, or a majority of delegates, and perhaps wouldn’t even be the frontrunner had the original field been much smaller.”

Yet in hallway chatter here, there was a growing sense of resignation about Trump as the nominee.

“I sense that everybody has come around to the position that what we choose is what we choose and that to have an opponent to Hillary Clinton, you take what you got and you run with it as fast as you can,” said David Norcross, a former RNC general counsel.

The conversations in Florida come amid a revamping of Trump’s campaign. Manafort said Trump is assembling teams of communications specialists, schedulers, policy advisers, speechwriters, researchers and liaisons to Capitol Hill, think tanks and other GOP power centers — all traditional campaign elements that had been lacking in Trump’s shoestring structure.

""We couldn't run a general election with eight people,"" Manafort said.

Manafort suggested that the individuals who have been appearing on cable television shows as Trump representatives will begin playing smaller roles as he asserts control over what he called ""the narrative.""

Advertisement

""Now we're transitioning,"" Manafort said. ""He's trying to be the nominee, and people want to see the entire package.""

Among the newest members of Trump’s team is Rick Wiley, who is well known to RNC members, serving as the committee’s political director in 2012. When he addressed RNC members on Thursday, Wiley sought to emphasize those connections and went out of his way to praise the work of the committee’s staff under Priebus.

Wiley said the party and its nominee would be fully committed to waging a successful fall national campaign. Arguing that the RNC had adapted the organizing model developed by the 2008 Obama campaign, he added, “We are going to inherit a field program second to none.”

In his presentation, Wiley addressed worries among many Republicans that Trump as the nominee could lead the party to a catastrophic defeat in the fall, one that could put its Senate majority at risk and cost Republicans House seats.

“You’re going to see this map expand,” he said, contending that Trump’s potential appeal to Reagan Democrats — working-class white voters — could make states in the upper and industrial Midwest that long have been in the Democrats’ column competitive in the fall."
3149,3149,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/25/cruz-and-kasich-may-align-to-stop-trump-but-the-math-isnt-that-simple/,0,"Sunday night's public proclamation that Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich had reached a truce aimed at ceding states to one another was not predicted but also entirely predictable. With his failure to gain any delegates in New York, Cruz is no longer able to win enough pledged delegates to clinch the nomination — a position in which Kasich has found himself for weeks. So the only viable path to the nomination for each is a contested convention — which necessitates that Donald Trump not win enough delegates to clinch it himself.

And so, on Sunday, the public revelation that the two candidates would split upcoming states. Cruz will be cleared to win Indiana — with Kasich canceling upcoming events in the state — and Cruz will allow Kasich to win in Oregon and New Mexico. Each needs Trump to fall short of the 1,237 delegates it would take for him to win the nomination, with Cruz poised to potentially win on the second ballot and Kasich, in a more nebulous set of circumstances, to win somewhere else down the line. Allowing for Cruz to gobble up as many of Indiana's 57 delegates as he can and for Kasich to scoop up Oregon and New Mexico's 52 would put a dent in the 391 delegates Trump still needs to hit 1,237.

But the plan isn't as foolproof as it might seem.

The two made it public in part so that the various super PACs supporting each candidate would get the message. As our Matea Gold notes, Kasich's announcement was explicit in suggesting to his super PAC supporters that they should allow Cruz to win Indiana, writing in his statement that the campaign ""would expect independent third-party groups to do the same and honor the commitments made by the Cruz and Kasich campaigns."" But the announcement was also meant to present a united Not Trump front, of the kind that Trump opponents have been seeking for a while (though usually by virtue of hoping either Cruz or Kasich dropped out).

The problem, though, is that the math is much trickier than simply handing one state to Cruz and another to Kasich.

Let's start with Indiana. It was one of the four states that we identified in March as being key to the Republican contest by virtue of the number of delegates it offers. Two of those four, New York and Pennsylvania, will have voted by Wednesday morning, with Trump almost certainly winning over 100 of the pledged delegates the two have to offer. (Most of Pennsylvania's delegates are unpledged, meaning they could vote for Casper the Friendly Ghost, if inclined to do so.) The fourth state still outstanding is California, which we'll get to.

A Fox News poll released Friday showed Trump with an eight-point lead over Cruz in Indiana. But FiveThirtyEight's forecast, including factors besides polls, has Cruz as a slight favorite. Trump has won most of the states around Indiana (save Ohio) by small margins, and Cruz should similarly be close in the state. Getting Kasich out of the picture means that the state's delegates — given out to whoever wins the state or its nine congressional districts — are much more likely to go to Cruz. Indiana has 8 percent of the delegates left to acquire and 15 percent of the delegates Trump needs to clinch. Handing them to Cruz would be a big win for those who want a non-Trump nominee.

Share this article Share

The delegates in Oregon and New Mexico, though? Ehh. There hasn't been good polling in either state recently, but each state allocates its delegates proportionally. Meaning that if Trump would get, say, 33 percent against Kasich's 33 and Cruz's 33, consolidating behind Kasich so that he gets 66 percent of the delegates doesn't really subtract from Trump's total at all.

Where the two really need to stop Trump is in winner-take-all states such as New Jersey (where Trump currently has the support of a majority of the state's Republicans). That's 51 delegates — 13 percent of what Trump still needs — that Cruz and Kasich want to disrupt. And the big prize, California, where the winner of the state gets 13 delegates and the winner of each of its 53 congressional districts gets three. The idea, apparently, is that Kasich and Cruz might target specific congressional districts? That's optimistic.

After all, Cruz tried to target specific districts in New York and still got goose-egged. Those Fox polls released Friday showed Trump with a wide lead in the state, making the task for Kasich and Cruz trickier. Kasich had only about $1.1 million on hand at the end of March, meaning that his ability to campaign anywhere, much less in specific congressional districts, is limited. (It's part of the reason that his pulling out of Indiana helps his campaign.)

This also raises the question of how much of an effect the will of the candidates might actually have on the outcomes. There's a lot of talk about strategic voting, particularly from surrogates, but there's not much evidence that voters really care. Here are the apparent talking points for Cruz's campaign, via the Wall Street Journal's Reid Epstein:

That's political finger-crossing. Primary voters are more engaged than your average voter, but will thousands of Cruz supporters in Oregon mark their ballots for Kasich simply to help fulfill the campaigns' grand strategies? If I were a betting man, which I am, I'd probably take the under.

What's at the heart of this plan is the simple fact that Trump's got a narrow path to those 1,237 delegates. There are a number of scenarios where he hits the mark and perhaps more where he doesn't. Cruz and Kasich have little choice but to try to keep him from getting there and have few options for doing so beyond trying to parcel out states like poker chips.

But as the Republican Party has learned repeatedly since the Iowa caucuses Feb. 1, voters are impressively immune to the whims of party poobahs. Cruz and Kasich need Trump to fail in his push for delegates. This could theoretically help. It could also be another few strands of spaghetti, clinging tenuously to the wall for a brief instant, but then, like so many strands before them, dropping to the ground, impotent. At least, Cruz and Kasich can say they tried."

http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/01/politics/donald-trump-indiana-primary-ted-cruz/index.html",0,"Inside Ted Cruz's second-floor campaign office here on a recent afternoon, there were telltale signs of an operation in overdrive: dozens of volunteers calling voters and re­fueling with Mountain Dew, coffee and snacks; staffers busily working on laptops; and an ambitious message on a whiteboard: ""Our Goal Today = 20,000 Calls.""

But there were also indications of trouble. Volunteers said they were hearing misgivings from voters — many rooted in insults that front-runner Donald Trump had hurled at Cruz.

Most people who express reservations, explained Megan Kerr, 17, of Fishers, Ind., “are concerned with the nickname he’s been given — ‘Lyin’ Ted.’ ” Frank Cerrone, 68, of Perry Township, Ind., also said “there is some idea that Ted Cruz is rigging the system,” another Trump attack.

Cruz came to Indiana to try to resuscitate his flagging campaign at a pivotal moment in the Republican presidential race. But with just one day of campaigning left until Tuesday’s vote — and after a series of desperation measures — the freshman senator from Texas is on the verge of a defeat that would ravage his campaign and raise new questions about whether his mission to stop the mogul has become futile.

Ted Cruz recreated a scene from the movie ""Hoosiers"" at his April 26 rally in Knightstown, Ind. Here's how his reenactment compares to the original movie scene. (Video: Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)

An NBC News-Wall Street Journal-Marist poll released Sunday showed Trump leading Cruz by 15 points in Indiana. Other recent public polls have shown Trump leading by narrower margins.

Supporters hoped that Indiana, which has similarities to other Midwestern states Cruz has won, would be able to heal the deep wounds left by Cruz’s blowout losses in six straight states. But it has been very difficult for Cruz to gain traction in the face of relentless attacks from Trump and hiccups in his own effort.

Nevertheless, Cruz is waging an aggressive final push in the state, including three stops on Sunday. He also appeared on all five Sunday-morning news shows.

“It is an incredibly important state. We are competing hard. I hope we do well here,” Cruz said on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos.” “I can tell you I’m barnstorming the state. We’re in a bus with my family. We’re doing everything we can.”

A Trump win in Indiana would not only move the mogul closer to the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination, it also would leave Cruz without a primary win in four weeks heading into the final stage of the campaign.

Trump plans to contest the Hoosier State vigorously in the final hours of the contest, scheduling two rallies for Monday. He has zeroed in on Indiana’s manufacturing job losses at rallies and has accused Cruz of being dishonest and trying to wrest the nomination away from him unfairly by seeking to install loyal delegates to the Republican National Convention even in states where Trump won.

Moments when Ted Cruz was more surprising than Donald Trump + 6 Although Trump has voiced myriad eyebrow-raising positions, Ted Cruz has at times taken more surprising stances.

“Right now after this show, I’m going to Indiana. We’re going to have Bobby Knight. We’re going to have other people that are unbelievable,” Trump said on “Fox News Sunday,” mentioning the popular former Indiana University men’s basketball who is campaigning for him.

Cruz’s Indiana strategy is both urgent and unconventional. On the campaign trail, he has en­couraged Republicans to reject Trump’s brash style in favor of a steadier and more positive approach — a jarring argument for someone who has built his political career on fighting with Republican leaders and creating turbulence in his party.

“It is the common sense and good judgment of the Hoosier State that is the one thing that stands between us and plunging over the cliff,” Cruz said at a convention-hall rally in South Bend, Ind., on Thursday.

He continued: “The people of Indiana will make a choice: Do we want to get behind a campaign that is based on yelling and screaming and cursing and insults? Or do we want to unify behind a positive, optimistic, ­forward-looking conservative campaign?”

At Cruz’s campaign office here in Indianapolis last Tuesday, animosity toward Trump was on clear display. “Hillary beats Trump very bad — double digits,” said one volunteer making the case for Cruz over the phone.

Cerrone said that when he talks to Trump backers, they are generally impolite.

“Most of the Donald Trump supporters are really rude,” he said. “And that’s not surprising, because so is Donald Trump.”

Cruz named former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina as his vice-presidential running mate last week, the kind of decision not typically made so early in a campaign. Fiorina clashed with Trump during her own campaign for president and has been helping Cruz cast him as a bully in Indiana.

The two have also sought to tie Trump to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Cruz released a pair of TV commercials over the weekend arguing that Trump and Clinton are ""two sides of the same coin"" on taxes, transgender rights, health care and other issues.

Cruz is hoping his deal with Ohio Gov. John Kasich to effectively take on Trump one-on-one in Indiana will swing voters toward him. But both sides have muddled the arrangement, and the NBC poll out Sunday showed that 58 percent of GOP voters disliked the bargain. (Kasich is also pulling 13 percent of the vote.)

Even a surprise Friday endorsement from Gov. Mike Pence (R) was not without a snag. The governor prefaced his Cruz endorsement with praise for Trump and an assertion that he was not against any candidate.

“I think he gave me more of an endorsement than he gave Cruz,” Trump said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Cruz is trying to make the most of Pence's stamp of approval. He released a radio ad over the weekend with a clip of the governor praising him for taking on his party's leaders in Washington.

Undecided voters such as Frank Swiss of Carmel, Ind., illustrate part of Cruz’s challenge. Swiss, who said he was “interested” in Kasich and opposes Trump, spoke to Cruz at an Indianapolis restaurant last Wednesday. He said he found the senator “charismatic” and “down to earth.” But not enough to commit to voting for him."

https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2016/05/04/why-now-john-kasich/",0,"John Kasich will end his bid for the presidency Wednesday afternoon in Columbus, according to multiple reports. Kasich had planned to hold a press conference at Dulles Aiport near Washington Wednesday morning, but he never took off—perhaps an apt metaphor—staying home and scheduling a press conference for 5 p.m., where he is expected to make his announcement.

The Ohio governor’s exit leaves Donald Trump as the last man standing in the Republican field. Though he’d already assumed the mantle of presumptive nominee with Senator Ted Cruz’s exit Tuesday night—after Trump trounced both of them in the Indiana primary—Kasich’s exit seals the deal. Kasich has been mentioned for weeks as a potential vice-presidential candidate for Trump, who will need to shore up his policy and political credentials ahead of the general election.

While hardly anyone predicted Trump’s success in the Republican campaign, few expected Kasich would get this far either. In a crowd of young, charismatic GOP figures, Kasich was the odd man out, a somewhat more grizzled figure who had run abortively for president in 2000, and a comparatively moderate figure in a party trending increasingly to the right. Somehow, Kasich managed to hold on to the bitter end, the final challenger to Trump.

That’s not to say that his campaign was especially successful. Many observers felt Kasich was pursuing a replay of former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman’s failed 2012 bid for the Republican nomination. Huntsman and Kasich even shared a campaign architect, the heterodox GOP strategist John Weaver. The playbook may have gotten Kasich farther than it did Huntsman, but that still wasn’t enough to win the nomination, or even to come close. (As for Huntsman, he now backs Trump.)

For a time, before Trump’s ascendancy became inevitable, Kasich’s plan seemed plausible. In New Hampshire, the nation’s first primary and second nominating contest, he placed (a distant) second to Trump, and hoped to portray himself as the reasonable alternative to the entertainer. But having placed a huge bet on the Granite State, Kasich had little infrastructure in place for the rest of the campaign, and was a non-entity in the South Carolina primary. By the time the campaign reached his home state, Kasich was effectively out of the running. Ohio turned out to be the only state that he won. He closes out the campaign with fewer delegates than Senator Marco Rubio, who dropped out on March 15.

Kasich’s sell to voters was that amid a sea of volatile, unpredictable characters like Trump and wild-eyed radicals like Cruz, he was an old-style true conservative who could also win swing states like Ohio. To the extent that his campaign had a policy theme, it was his advocacy for a balanced-budget amendment—a vague promise, tethered to his work on balancing the national budget while in the U.S. House in the 1990s. (Opinions about just how central Kasich had been in that work differed widely.)

But some of his other policy stances were at odds with much of the Republican Party. As governor, he had circumvented the GOP-led Ohio legislature to accept Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. As though that were not bad enough, he compounded his offense in the eyes of conservatives by justifying his choice by faith. “Now, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he’s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small,” he said. “But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer.’”

Many of Kasich’s former colleagues viewed his image as a soft, cuddly, friendly politician with skepticism—they remembered a more irritable, angry Kasich—it seemed to take with many voters. The problem was that Republican primary voters didn’t want a sane, rational nominee in 2016. They wanted a Trump."

These GOP figures are commissioning private polling, lining up major funding sources­ and courting potential contenders, according to interviews with more than a dozen Republicans involved in the discussions. The effort has been sporadic all spring but has intensified significantly in the 10 days since Trump effectively locked up the Republican nomination.

Those involved concede that an independent campaign at this late stage is probably futile, and they think they have only a couple of weeks to launch a credible bid. But these Republicans — including commentators William Kristol and Erick Erickson and strategists Mike Murphy, Stuart Stevens and Rick Wilson — are so repulsed by the prospect of Trump as commander in chief that they are desperate to take action.

Their top recruiting prospects are freshman Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), a conservative who has become one of Trump’s sharpest critics, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who withdrew from the Republican presidential race May 4. Romney is among those who have made personal overtures to both men in recent days, according to several people with knowledge of the former Massachusetts governor’s activities.

This summer's political conventions could get heated – but it certainly wouldn't be the first time. (Video: Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)

Earlier prospects included former senator Tom Coburn ­(R-Okla.) and retired Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis. Former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and retired Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal have been bandied about as potentially potent political outsiders.

The recruiters also delved into the world of reality television for someone who might out-Trump Trump: Mark Cuban, the brash billionaire businessman and owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team.

Again and again, though, these anti-Trump Republicans have heard the same tepid response: Thanks, but no thanks.

“I don’t see it happening,” ­Cuban wrote in an email.

Cuban, a cast member on “Shark Tank,” the ABC reality series in which entrepreneurs pitch investors about their business ideas, said his pursuers — he declined to name them — have told him that his “bluster and volume, combined with substance and the ability to connect with voters on a more personal basis,” could make him a winning candidate.

“He could come after me all he wanted, and he knows I would put him in his place,” Cuban said of Trump. “All that said, again, I don’t see it happening. There isn’t enough time.”

To many political professionals, the notion of winning the presidency from outside the two-party system is pure fantasy. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg spent considerable time and money studying his chances­ for an independent run only to conclude in March that there was no plausible path.

These Republicans refuse to vote for Donald Trump + 11 And they’ll tell you why.

Further tempering the current talks on the right are fears that an independent conservative candidate could forever be a pariah by splintering the Republican vote and ensuring victory for the Democratic nominee.

“The career of the individual would come to an end, and he would have a difficult spot in history for being responsible for putting Hillary Clinton in the White House,” said Patrick J. Buchanan, a conservative who unsuccessfully ran for president in 2000 on the Reform Party ticket.

Buchanan was dismissive of the current efforts. “These are the mice trying to bell the cat — only they can’t get one mouse to go out and do it,” he said.

Draft promoters have been telling potential candidates that 2016 already has proved to be an unpredictable cycle and that anything could happen, such as Trump’s candidacy shriveling under the expected Democratic advertising assault. What’s more, they tell them, you would have no bigger platform to promote your ideas than in a three-way general election that would attract global attention.

Pollsters have been conducting private surveys over the past week to measure the plausibility of an independent candidate, said three people working closely on the project.

There are formidable logistical hurdles. The deadline to get on the ballot in Texas, which has the second-largest trove of electoral votes, already passed, but organizers said they think a legal challenge there could be successful. Other state deadlines are fast approaching, and many require petitions with thousands of signatures.

Some anti-Trump Republicans are downsizing their ambitions to a more focused, state-specific effort. Murphy, who ran a super PAC for former Florida governor Jeb Bush in his failed 2016 bid, is pushing one such proposal. Murphy envisions an independent candidate on what he termed “an honorable mission” in Colorado, New Hampshire and Ohio — three battleground states with relatively lax ballot-access rules.

“Running an anti-Trump protest candidate in a handful of swing states really appeals to me,” Murphy said. “You could deny Trump the presidency and perhaps help important Senate and other down-ballot races­ by giving another choice to Republican voters who abhor Hillary Clinton and can’t cross the moral line to vote for Trump.”

One related objective is to prevent both Clinton and Trump from clinching a majority in the electoral college and thus throwing the presidential election to the House of Representatives, under the provision of the 12th Amendment of the Constitution. This scenario played out in 1824, when Andrew Jackson won a plurality of electoral and popular votes but was defeated in the House by John Quincy Adams.

Whether wealthy donors would fund a candidate with such long odds is unclear. Dan Senor, a former Romney adviser and a confidant of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), has been informally briefing high-level GOP donors opposed to Trump on how an independent campaign might work and has found them to be willing to invest if the right candidate stepped forward, according to people involved.

Spencer Zwick, who was Romney’s 2012 national finance chairman, said: “If this was just a ‘Never Trump’ option and there’s no hope of actually winning — in other words, a kamikaze mission — I’m not sure there’s enough money. If there were a real alternative, it changes­ the dynamic. But who’s going to do that?”

An obvious possible contestant is Kasich, who portrayed himself in the GOP primaries as a pragmatist with crossover appeal. Since he dropped out, Romney and other Republicans have tried to persuade him to forge an independent run.

Share this article Share

But Kasich’s advisers dismissed the idea. “The governor is not entertaining nor will he run as an independent,” spokesman Chris Schrimpf said.

John Weaver, Kasich’s chief strategist, said of the governor’s courters: “They had plenty of time and opportunity to influence the [GOP] nomination battle in a constructive way, and they didn’t for whatever reason. The idea of running someone as a third party, particularly the way they’re going about it, is not going to be effective and is not practical.”

A Romney representative declined to comment. The former nominee has been stinging in his public critiques of Trump, and, in a Facebook post on Wednesday, he tried to shame the business mogul into releasing his tax returns.

Romney also has communicated with Sasse, 44, who has become a favorite of elite conservatives since joining the Senate last year. Sasse spokesman James Wegmann declined to comment on Sasse’s private conversations.

As an ardent defender of conservatism, Sasse is seen by some party leaders as a future national candidate. He stirred a political storm by declaring on social media that he could not support Trump and wanted ""some third candidate — a conservative option, a Constitutionalist.""

But any hunger for Sasse as that candidate seems limited. Fans launched an unofficial ""Draft Sasse"" committee May 4, but a week later, it counted less than 700 followers on Twitter and 49 on Facebook.

Advertisement

Publicly, Sasse has also repeatedly ruled out the idea of running — “The answer is no,” Wegmann reiterated — but Republicans who have discussed the possibility with him think he has not closed the door entirely.

Nor is Sasse shying away from the attention. He will deliver a keynote speech Monday on economic opportunity at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. Speaking out about Trump could position him favorably in a field of ambitious rivals should Trump lose in November and as the GOP searches for new stars to help it rebuild.

One of Sasse’s boosters is Stevens, Romney’s former chief strategist. As with many people discussing an independent effort, Stevens sees Sasse as an optimist who could be the ideal antidote to the deeply polarizing Trump and Clinton.

“I’ve never met Ben Sasse, and I don’t have a connection with him, but I’m really moved by what he says,” Stevens said. “He has a wonderful tone, and he’s exactly right. . . . If Ben Sasse ran, I’d guarantee that he’d have higher favorability at the end than any other national politician.”

The third-party plotters represent only a sliver of what in the primaries became known as the “Never Trump” movement. Many Republicans opposed to him — from former Texas governor Rick Perry to Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) — now are lining up behind the presumptive nominee, if not always enthusiastically.

“You’re talking about a very shallow group,” said Ed Cox, chairman of the New York Republican Party and a Trump supporter. He criticized most of the organizers as conservatives who care more about “their own intellectual constructs” than the “voice of the people.”

Two central figures in the draft talks are Kristol, who edits the Weekly Standard, and Erickson, a talk-radio host. While Kristol acts as a lone operator and has huddled privately with Romney and other Republicans, Erickson leads an organized group with former Senate staffer Bill Wichterman and others called Conservatives Against Trump, which has been meeting regularly for months.

Coburn, known for his fiscal conservatism, and Sasse have been atop the group’s recruit list for some time. Wichterman is among those who have reached out to Coburn. Friends of the 68-year-old former senator said he is listening but is unlikely to pull the trigger, in part because of health concerns.

Earlier this spring, Kristol had his eyes on Mattis, who is revered by conservatives for his public break with the Obama administration. The general, now a fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, met for several hours in mid-April with Kristol, Wilson and GOP consultant Joel Searby at the Beacon Hotel in Washington to go over how a campaign could work.

But soon after, Mattis backed away from the idea because he wasn’t ready to risk politicizing his reputation with a campaign that had little hope for success, according to two people familiar with his deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss those conversations. Through a spokesman, Mattis declined to be interviewed.

Kristol then reached out to Romney, asking for a meeting to request his assistance. The two met May 5 at the J.W. Marriott hotel in Washington, where they talked about possible contenders. Kristol detailed their discussion the next day to The Washington Post, which irked some Romney associates.

When asked this week to comment on further developments, Kristol declined.

“These conspiracies for the public good are time and labor intensive!” he wrote in an email. “In any case, things are at a delicate stage now, so I really should keep mum. Suffice it to say that serious discussions and real planning are ongoing.”

One option off the table is McChrystal."

On Tuesday, Donald Trump announced that he'd given away the last of the $5.6 million that he raised four months ago, at a benefit for veterans' causes in Iowa. In a bitter, combative press conference, Trump made clear that he'd been pressured into giving up these details by the news media, including The Washington Post.

And he was not at all happy about it.

""Are you ready? Do you have your pen?"" he said to the media he'd called to the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. Then, before he actually gave out the names of the groups he'd donated to, Trump reversed course to bash the media another time. ""My opinion of the media, it's very low. I think the media is, frankly, made up of people in many cases, not in all cases, are not good people.""

When the press conference was over, Trump had answered several of the big questions that had lingered after his Jan. 28 benefit, which he staged as counterprogramming to a GOP debate he had decided to skip.

Here's what we know now:

How much, in total, did Trump raise at that fundraiser?

$5.6 million.

Trump gave that figure on Tuesday, and backed it up by listing gifts to 41 different veterans' charities that totaled $5.6 million.

On the night of the fundraiser, Trump had told the crowd “We just cracked $6 million! Right? $6 million.” He repeated the figure for several days afterward, both at rallies and on TV morning shows. On Tuesday, Trump did not explain why the final total had fallen short of $6 million, but he said he believed that more donations would come in later and that the total might eventually top $6 million after all.

How many new donations were announced on Tuesday?

By The Post's count, 18 new gifts, totaling about $1.5 million.

In each case, Trump was giving away other people's money. Other donors, both large and small, had entrusted this money to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, on the understanding that Trump would then distribute it to veterans. The list included:

— Achilles International received $100,000 last week. It also received a $100,000 check, also derived from the Iowa fundraiser, a few weeks ago. This group helps wounded veterans train to compete in athletic events. One of its leaders, Mary Bryant McCourt, knows Trump because she is a member of his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. A few years ago, she persuaded Trump to help the group by stopping him once on the exclusive resort's grounds. ""When I saw Donald, I said, 'Donald, they’re coming, they’re going to be here this weekend, I wanna give 'em hamburgers at the pool,'"" McCourt recalled. Trump's foundation has since given several donations to the group. ""He’s been just generous and wonderful and caring,"" she said.

— Racing for Heroes uses auto racing to help veterans with brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder. It received a $100,000 donation in the first weeks after the Iowa fundraiser. Last week, the group reported that it received another ""large"" check from the Trump Foundation, but it declined to specify the amount.

— The Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund received a $75,000 check last week. It had previously received a $100,000 check in the first weeks after the Iowa event, sent directly by a donor who supported Trump's effort. This fund has paid for new centers for rehabilitation and treatment of injured military personnel.

— The Boston Wounded Vet Run received $75,000 from Trump's foundation. This group holds an annual motorcycle ride and raises money to help disabled veterans. Its founder served in Iraq with the son of one of Trump's bodyguards. It had not previously received a donation from the money raised in Iowa.

— The Bob Woodruff Foundation received a $75,000 check last week. This foundation, founded by the ABC News anchor who suffered a traumatic brain injury while on assignment in Iraq, funds better care for wounded veterans. This group has no obvious connection to Trump and had received no funds from his Iowa fundraiser. ""We were a bit surprised,"" the foundation said in a message to The Post.

Did Trump give any of his own personal money?

Yes. He gave $1 million, last week. But only after The Post and other media organizations pressured Trump to explain where his money had gone.

On the night of the fundraiser, Trump said he ""gave"" $1 million of his own. Earlier this month, Trump's campaign manager said this money had already been distributed (though he would not say to whom). But this was false. Trump had not given the money. Then, on May 23, The Post made inquiries on Twitter — Trump's preferred social-media platform — seeking anyone who had received a piece of this (nonexistent, as it turned out) $1 million.

That night, Trump moved to give the money away, in one single large donation, to a charity he knew well. The money went to the Marine Corps - Law Enforcement Foundation, a group that provides educational grants to the children of fallen Marines and federal officers. The same group gave Trump a leadership award at a gala last year. When The Post asked if Trump had made the gift only because the media was asking about it, Trump said, “You know, you’re a nasty guy. You’re really a nasty guy.""

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he raised $6 million for veterans groups at a January fundraiser. The Washington Post’s accounting, based on interviews with charities, only found $3.1 million in donations to veterans groups. In addition, almost four months after promising $1 million of his own money to veterans’ causes, Trump moved to fulfill that pledge. (Video: McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post)

When did Trump give away the rest of the other donors' money, which was under his control?

In many cases, on May 24.

The Associated Press surveyed the recipients of Trump's donations on Tuesday and found that many of them had received checks dated May 24, the same day that Trump told The Post he'd given his $1 million.

Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, told the AP that questions from The Post and other outlets did not push Trump to make the donations when he did. ""Mr. Trump's team worked very hard to complete this lengthy process prior to Memorial Day Weekend,"" Hicks told the AP.

Why did it take four months to distribute the last of this money?

Vetting, Trump says.

On Tuesday, Trump said these weeks were needed to scrutinize the potential recipients, so Trump could be certain that they were worthy.

""I had people, teams of people reviewing statistics, reviewing numbers and also talking to people in the military to find out whether or not the group was deserving of the money,"" he said Tuesday. Several of the groups reported receiving no requests for financial documents from Trump's team. In some cases, there was only a phone call, and a simple request: Trump's people asked for their official nonprofit number, issued by the IRS.

How well did Trump's vetting process work?

Well, it wasn't perfect.

Many of the charities Trump selected seem to be legitimate and deserving. But one of the charities that Trump chose — after it had been vetted by Trump's ""teams of people"" — was the Foundation for American Veterans. It received $75,000.

But the Foundation for American Veterans has an ""F"" rating from Charity Watch, a nonprofit watchdog, because it spends so little of its donations on work that actually helps veterans. Indeed, an examination of the group's tax filings shows that the foundation spent just $2.4 million of its total $8 million budget on helping veterans directly in 2014. The group spent the rest of the money in 2014 on fundraising, on salaries and on other overhead costs.

The same foundation was the subject of an ""alert"" from the Better Business Bureau in January, which cited ""a pattern and high volume of complaints and customer reviews"" about the Foundation for American Veterans. The BBB said customers received ""a high volume of what they consider to be harassing phone calls"" from the group's solicitors. The BBB said the group had blamed the problem on its telemarketer. The BBB's St. Louis branch also warned residents to ""be cautious when dealing with representatives of Foundation for American Veterans,"" warning that its telemarketers might ""pressure and mislead them into making donations.""

Hicks, the Trump spokeswoman, did not respond to questions about why Trump's vetting process had not detected these problems.

These problems shouldn't have been hard to find. On a recent Google search for the foundation's name, three of the first four search results were websites raising questions about the foundation's practices."

http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/sen-chris-murphy-starts-talking-filibuster-over-gun-control-224369",0,"The Senate is expected to vote Monday on a series of competing gun-control measures that will highlight the continuing divide between Democrats and Republicans over how Congress should respond to mass shootings. All are likely to fail as the two parties largely retreat to their respective corners on gun control after attempts to craft a compromise frayed almost as soon as they began.

Senators are expected to vote on four proposals, according to Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). Two of them, backed by Democrats, would seek to prevent suspected terrorists from acquiring guns and explosives and impose mandatory background checks for firearms sold at gun shows and through online dealers.

Republicans are expected to offer two competing proposals, including one that would keep guns away from suspected terrorists if authorities can prove they have probable cause to do so within three business days of the attempted sale, said Cornyn, the author of that legislation.

Those measures have all failed to pass the Senate before, a point that frustrated many senators Thursday.

“Instead of trying to find a solution that would work and still protect people’s constitutional rights, we’re going to battle to a draw on Monday night,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said. The votes, he continued are “an intentional way to keep this as an issue; it’s not a way to solve this problem.”

Even if the Senate were to strike a deal, it’s unclear such a proposal would be able to get through the House. Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) was non-committal on the issue Thursday.

“We want to make sure that something like this doesn’t happen again.” he told reporters. “Everybody wants that. But as we look at how to proceed, we also want to make sure that we’re not infringing upon people’s legitimate constitutional rights. That’s important.”

How to prevent terrorists from getting guns has become a subject of intense debate in Congress in the wake of the deadly attack in Orlando on Sunday in which 49 people were killed. The shooter, 29-year-old Omar Mateen, had been on the FBI’s terrorist watch list, but he was removed in 2014 because of a lack of evidence that he would commit an immediate crime.

What the investigation into the Orlando mass shooting looks like + 22 Officials are scouring the site and others in the area for information about the June 12 massacre.

Democrats have been angling for votes on a measure written by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would deny firearms and explosives to anyone the attorney general suspects of being a terrorist. They also want a vote on a proposal drafted by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) that would expand background checks by requiring them for guns purchased at gun shows and online.

Murphy staged a near-15-hour filibuster on the Senate floor over the past two days to secure a vote on those measures and credited his blockade with pressuring Republican leaders to commit to holding the votes.

“We still have to get from here to there, but we did not have that commitment when we started,” Murphy said early Thursday, though he noted that there was “no guarantee that those amendments pass.”

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) celebrated Murphy’s efforts, calling his display “inspiring” and saying all 46 Senate Democrats are united behind him.

“I hope he got the attention of the Senate Republicans,” Reid added.

But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) derided Murphy’s filibuster as “a campaign talkathon out here on the Senate floor which also prevented us from moving forward.”

GOP leaders say they have maintained since Tuesday there would be votes on amendments, though they had not specified which Republican- or Democrat-backed proposals would be considered.

“Of course no one wants terrorists to be able to buy a gun,” McConnell said. “If Democrats are actually serious about getting a solution on that issue, not just making a political talking point, they’ll join with us to support Senator Cornyn’s” bill.

But there are signs Republicans are growing uncomfortable with the Cornyn alternative.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who is not up for reelection until 2020, on Wednesday criticized the measure — which she supported last year — saying it isn’t strong enough and “doesn’t do the job.”

Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) said he thought “the Cornyn approach doesn’t give the AG the opportunity that an AG needs to make a case against someone who is actually a terrorist.”

Neither was ready to support Feinstein’s legislation. But both have been working on potential alternatives to the Cornyn and Feinstein bills.

Collins said Thursday that she was working with “a group of Republican senators” on a measure that would give the attorney general full authority to deny the right to buy a gun to anyone on the No Fly or Selectee lists – subsets of the FBI’s consolidated terrorist watchlist of 800,000 names.

It would also include a five-year look back provision ensuring that the FBI would be alerted whenever someone who used to be on one of those lists, like the Orlando shooter, purchased a gun.

Someone like Mateen “wouldn’t be denied the ability to buy a gun because he’s no longer on the list, but the FBI would be pinged that he had purchased a gun,” Collins explained, concluding that sequence of events “would undoubtedly put him back on the list.”

Toomey was also in talks Wednesday with a gun-control advocacy organization backed by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg to craft a measure that Republicans could live with to prevent terrorists from obtaining firearms.

“This is not rocket science to figure this out,” Toomey said on the Senate floor Wednesday, adding that he had been speaking to “several” senators about a compromise.

But by the day’s end, leading Democrats were deriding the specifics of the Pennsylvania Republican’s proposal, and a spokeswoman for Bloomberg’s organization, Everytown for Gun Safety, said, “We’re not there yet.”

On Wednesday, Toomey proposed his own language, in which a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court would annually vet a list from the attorney general of potential terrorists, who could be prevented from purchasing a firearm or explosive if the court agreed.

Meanwhile, other attempts at compromise fell short.

Feinstein approached Cornyn to try to reach a deal Wednesday, but those talks appeared to have frayed.

“I don’t think it’s going to work out,” Feinstein told reporters late Wednesday of her efforts to find a middle ground with Cornyn.

Both the Cornyn and Feinstein measures failed to pass the Senate in December following the shootings in San Bernardino, Calif. Republicans argue Feinstein’s legislation doesn’t do enough to protect the Second Amendment rights of individuals who might be labeled suspected terrorists by mistake.

Democrats say the time frame in Cornyn’s bill is too narrow and would make it functionally impossible to prevent anyone, even a terrorist, from getting a gun.

“It’s a way for them to say they’re doing something when they are doing nothing,” Schumer said.

The Justice Department on Thursday formally announced its support for the Feinstein amendment.

Previous efforts to pass gun-control legislation in the wake of recent mass shootings have been unsuccessful. The closest the Senate came to making headway in recent years was in 2013, when the Senate voted on a measure written by Toomey and Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) to require criminal and mental background checks at gun shows and for online gun sales following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

But only 54 senators, including four Republicans, supported that bill then — six votes shy of the 60 votes supporters needed.

Manchin called the substance of his and Toomey’s measure “the fundamental building block” of gun-control legislation on Wednesday.

“You can’t do a no-fly bill, you can’t do a terrorist watch list, and then leave a loophole,” Manchin told reporters. “That loophole must be closed.”

Murphy said early Thursday that the votes on the Democratic-backed amendments to keep guns from suspected terrorists and expand background checks were just the beginning of a bigger agenda.

“We want to start with these two common-sense measures,” Murphy said early Thursday, adding that Democrats had “carefully selected” the proposals “as the most likely to get bipartisan votes” because “they are as noncontroversial as you get.”

Looming over the debate is where presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump stands. On Wednesday morning, he tweeted that he would be meeting with the NRA to express his views that those on the terrorist list should not be allowed to purchase weapons.

Several Republican senators said on Thursday that they aren’t sure what Trump’s position is on the specific proposals being considered by the Senate and shrugged off whether they had to be on the same page as their party’s presumptive nominee.

“I can’t comment on where he’s going on that issue,” said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump’s top ally in the Senate. “He’s been a staunch supporter of the second amendment, and there is a huge divide between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. “

Gun-control advocates are braced for another policy defeat in the Senate, but they are also claiming a victory of sorts.

“After Sandy Hook it took four months for the U.S. Senate to vote. After Orlando it took four days,” said Everytown spokeswoman Erika Soto Lamb. “Make no mistake that this is another sign of the sea change in gun politics.”

The real estate mogul's meager cash flow spotlighted the urgent need for him to dramatically ramp up the fundraising he is doing in conjunction with the Republican National Committee, a task he has fitfully embraced.

Trump's small haul came as presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton continued to stockpile money: She raised more than $28 million in May and started June with $42 million in cash. Clinton brought in nearly a third of her campaign funds last month through the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee with the Democratic National Committee and 32 state parties.

The billionaire developer has now loaned his campaign $45.7 million and given it $400,000 more, while collecting $17 million in contributions. In late May, Trump set up two joint fundraising committees with the RNC, a move that was supposed to help him and the party tap into a gusher of cash. But GOP fundraisers have said it has been difficult to line up donors to bundle checks from their friends and family.

Amid criticism from fellow Republicans about his tone and provocative statements, Trump suggested over the weekend that he would ""just keep funding my own campaign"" if GOP leaders did not rally behind his candidacy. But it is unclear whether he could access the hundreds of millions needed to finance a national campaign. He suggested in May that to do so, he would have to ""sell a couple of buildings.""

Trump's limited cash meant that he spent just $6.7 million in May, down from $9.4 million in April. Nearly $1 million went to purchase hats and other campaign merchandise, while $838,000 was spent on travel. The campaign spent just $150,000 on media buys.

Clinton's spending also ratcheted down last month after an intense buildup through the Democratic primaries. After shelling out nearly $29 million in March and almost $24 million in April, her presidential campaign committee spent just $13.7 million in May. The bulk of the money went to pay for the 683 staffers on payroll for the month, a cost of $3.8 million. The campaign spent $1.6 million on ad production and air time and $1.6 million on travel."

Some who voted in favor of a British exit have said they merely wanted to lodge a protest vote and hadn't expected the ""leave"" camp to actually win. Others said they had no idea that the implications of such a vote would be so dire.

But one of the biggest reasons for regret may end up being that promises made to ""leave"" voters by leading Brexit proponents are being walked back by those very leaders. On talk shows over the weekend, three of them in particular were confronted by flabbergasted hosts over their playing down of integral elements of the Brexit campaign.

Nigel Farage was perhaps the loudest voice calling for Britain's exit from the European Union, though he wasn't officially part of the ""Leave"" campaign. As leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, he represented the isolationist, anti-immigration core of the Brexit movement. Speaking to the host of ITV's ""Good Morning Britain,"" Farage called one of the ""leave"" campaign's biggest promises a ""mistake,"" though he distanced himself from the decision to make the promise in the first place.

Host: ""The 350 million pounds a week that we send to the E.U., which we will no longer send to the E.U., can you guarantee that's going to go to the NHS [Britain's National Health Service]?""

Farage: ""No, I can't, and I would never have made that claim. It is one of the mistakes that, I think, the 'leave' campaign made.""

Host: ""Hold on a moment. That was one of your adverts.""

They then sparred over whether it was the ""leave"" campaign's advertisement or Farage's in particular, before moving on. The advertisement was the campaign's, not Farage's.

Host: ""That's why many people voted.""

Farage: ""They made a mistake doing that.""

Host: ""You're saying after 17 million people have voted for 'leave,' based — I don't know how many people voted on the basis of that advert, but that was a huge part of the propaganda —you're now saying that's a mistake?""

On ""The Andrew Marr Show,"" another leading ""leave"" campaigner, Iain Duncan Smith, said that the £350-million figure was ""an extrapolation"" and that the campaign had never said that all of that money would go to the NHS, just a good portion of it. Many were quick to point out that the ""leave"" campaign had a bus emblazoned with the monetary figure and at least strongly implied that the money would be reallocated to the NHS. Smith is pictured below alongside the bus.

Host: ""Control it by bringing it down, Nigel?""

Evans goes on to offer some background on how the ""leave"" campaign's immigration promises were made, but the host cuts him off.

Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, who died in the attacks along with three other Americans, told then-Deputy Chief of Mission Gregory Hicks in July 2012 that Clinton wanted to visit Libya again, perhaps in October, according to Hicks’s testimony to the committee. Stevens told Hicks that he wanted to have a “deliverable” to announce if and when Clinton came to Libya, namely that the temporary U.S. mission to Benghazi would be made into a permanent U.S. diplomatic facility.

The detail, which Hicks also told another House investigation in 2013, is one of the key issues Republicans are focusing on in the several-hundred-page report the Benghazi committee is releasing Tuesday. After spending the better part of two years and more than $7 million, the panel headed by Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) is under pressure to show that its investment of time and taxpayer money was not wasted. Following several other investigations into the attacks, there's not much left to know, but Republicans plan to highlight whatever new nuggets of information they can.

For Clinton, all news about the Benghazi attacks is bad news. The report details Clinton’s actions on the afternoon and night of the attacks, and Republicans plan to argue that she, along with other top Obama administration officials, failed to mount a robust and coordinated response while terrorists stormed the Benghazi mission and a nearby CIA annex. Though these are allegations that Clinton has fended off several times before, their resurgence with some new information will uncomfortably bring her worst night as secretary of state back to the fore of the presidential campaign.

Republicans see the revelation that Clinton was planning a trip to Libya and that Stevens wanted to make the Benghazi mission permanent as evidence that she was trying to cement her legacy as a major proponent of the intervention to topple Moammar Gaddafi, but ignored several signs that the facility was unsafe.

“It remains unclear why a State Department presence in Benghazi was so important,” two Republican committee members, Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Mike Pompeo (Kan.), wrote in their own summary of the lengthy report. “No matter how important a presence was — to Secretary Clinton, to the State Department, to the United States — it should have become very clear that the risks of staying without more security outweighed any possible benefit.”

Clinton has said many times that she did not personally deny any requests for more security in Benghazi; those decisions were made by lower-level State Department personnel. Republicans on the Benghazi committee argue that given Clinton’s keen interest in Benghazi and her plans to visit Libya, she should have taken action to respond to the dangerous conditions there.

Jordan and Pompeo point to an Aug. 17, 2012, memo from Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Beth Jones, sent to Clinton, which warned of deteriorating security conditions and overall “lawlessness” in eastern Libya, including a spike in bombings, abductions, assassinations and carjackings.

When Clinton was asked about the Jones memo by the committee, she said: ""There was no recommendation based on any of the assessments, not from our State Department experts, not from the Intelligence Community, that we should abandon either Benghazi or Tripoli.""

That perceived lack of response to the growing dangers in Benghazi, set against Clinton’s desire to travel to Libya and make Benghazi a permanent facility, makes Clinton culpable in the tragedy that followed, according to Jordan and Pompeo.

“She had the last, clear chance to order an immediate closure of the Benghazi facility yet she did nothing, and four Americans died,” they wrote.

Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren join forces at rally + 7 The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and the Massachusetts senator electrified a crowd by locking arms and excoriating Donald Trump, the GOP presumptive nominee.

The Clinton campaign did not respond to requests for comment about the report.

The Benghazi report will also seek to lay out a timeline of interactions among Clinton, President Obama, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and CIA Director David Petraeus that Republicans say shows a lack of communication and coordination at the highest levels of government while the attacks were underway.

Donald Trump’s claim that Clinton was sleeping when the call about the attacks came through is not accurate, the committee confirms in its investigation. But the panel does report that although the first attack began at 3:42 p.m. Eastern, Clinton did not speak to President Obama until over six hours later.

Clinton did not talk directly with Panetta even once on the night of the attacks, according to Jordan and Pompeo’s summary of the committee report. Panetta met with Obama at about 5:30 p.m. for half an hour and had no further contact with the president. Clinton spoke with Petraeus at 5:38 p.m., but only once.

Jordan and Pompeo wrote that senior officials should have been in the same room dealing with the ongoing crisis, as they were during the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound in 2011. “Benghazi should have merited the same level of urgency,” they wrote.

The Democratic members of the Benghazi committee dealt with the allegation that Clinton wasn't active and engaged on the night of the attack in their own 300-plus-page report, released Monday. They laid out a timeline of Clinton's other activities that night, beyond just her calls with other top officials.

Clinton was engaged in near-constant calls and other interactions with a host of U.S. and foreign officials, including several calls with national security adviser Susan Rice, the Libyan president, and officials on the ground, including Hicks. She was the only Cabinet official to participate in a secure video conference call in which representatives from various agencies discussed the response in the early evening.

“Senior officials have uniformly testified that they were doing everything possible to provide emergency assistance to those under the attack,” Democratic committee member Adam Schiff (Calif.) told me. “The most Republicans can do is try to critique the secretary’s actions on that day because they have nothing else left to go after.”

Schiff also rejected another supposed revelation that Republicans on the committee will focus on this week. The Republican report purports to reveal that no military assets were sent toward Libya until the attacks had ended. Although Panetta ordered the deployment of a Marine Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team, or FAST, those assets were sent to Tripoli and no military assets were sent to Benghazi, the report alleges.

“Nothing in the Republican spin changes the underlying facts,” said Schiff. “Nothing has disturbed the conclusions of the bipartisan House Armed Services Committee investigation that no military assets could have gotten there in time.”

The Republican committee report will also seek to reaffirm long-standing accusations that Clinton lied about there being protests in Benghazi.

Though the Benghazi committee did find some new details, it failed to unearth anything so damning as to change many minds about the events of that tragic night, or who is to blame for them."

Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement Saturday that Clinton “gave a voluntary interview this morning about her email arrangements while she was Secretary,” and added, “She is pleased to have had the opportunity to assist the Department of Justice in bringing this review to a conclusion.”

Asked if the interview, which took place at FBI headquarters, was businesslike and civil, Clinton told MSNBC that it was “both.”

“It was something I had offered to do since last August,” she said, according to a transcript provided by the network. “I’ve been eager to do it, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a conclusion.”

As she has in the past, Clinton asserted that she “never received nor sent any material that was marked classified,” although she said that some might have been retroactively branded classified during the process to prepare it for public release. She said she had “no knowledge” of the investigators’ timeline.

The investigation is not over: Agents and prosecutors will now have to compare what the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said Saturday to other evidence they have gathered, including from interviews with Clinton’s aides. They will also have to analyze how the facts of the case apply to various laws that might have been violated.

But officials familiar with the probe and legal analysts have said a meeting with Clinton would be reserved for the end of the investigation.

“That’s certainly a signal that they’re wrapping things up,” said Justin Shur, a former deputy chief of the Justice Department’s public integrity section who is now in private practice at the MoloLamken firm.

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the Clinton interview.

The past week has been tumultuous for Clinton and the government’s investigation into whether her email system might have compromised classified information. On Monday, former president Bill Clinton had an impromptu meeting with U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch aboard Lynch’s plane at an airport in Phoenix. Lynch asserted they did not discuss any pending investigations, but the conversation sparked an uproar — with some Republicans and Clinton rivals calling for a third party to be appointed to handle the case.

Referring to that meeting, Hillary Clinton told MSNBC that “hindsight is 20/20” and said her husband, like the attorney general, would probably not do it again.

Takeaways from Hillary Clinton’s e-mails + 6 Clinton has come under fire for using a private email address during her time as secretary of state. The emails are being screened and released in batches. Here are some things we’ve learned from them.

On Friday, Lynch announced that she would accept recommendations from career prosecutors and FBI agents leading the probe — a decision that she said had been made before her meeting with Bill Clinton, but one that was surely meant to quiet criticism about the independence of the probe. While Lynch did not formally recuse herself from the investigation involving Hillary Clinton's email — saying that ""would mean I wouldn't even be briefed on what the findings were"" — she seemed to promise she would not veto whatever decision came from federal prosecutors handling the case.

It is not clear who precisely will be the ultimate decision-maker, if Lynch will serve as more of a rubber stamp. The attorney general said FBI Director James B. Comey would be among those involved.

The investigation is focused on whether classified information was mishandled because Clinton used a private email account when she was secretary of state. The State Department's inspector general has already issued a report highly critical of Clinton's email practices, asserting that she failed to seek legal approval to use a private server and that staffers would not have assented if they were asked. The inspector general also found that Clinton's email setup was ""not an appropriate method"" for preserving public records.

A Washington Post analysis of Clinton’s publicly released correspondence found that Clinton wrote 104 emails that she sent using her private server while secretary of state that the government has since said contained classified information. But the review also found that using non-secure email systems to send sensitive information was widespread at the department and elsewhere in government and that Clinton’s publicly released correspondence included classified emails written by about 300 other people inside and outside the government.

People familiar with the case have said previously that charges against Clinton seemed unlikely and that there was a particular void of evidence showing she intended to mishandle classified information, although they asserted investigators were still probing the matter aggressively. The interview with Clinton was always seen as critical. If the former secretary was untruthful with investigators, she could be charged with making false statements. That charge was contemplated in the case against retired Army general and former CIA director David H. Petraeus, although he ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information.

With the Republican and Democratic conventions looming later this month, timing has also become a complicating factor. Justice Department guidelines specifically warn prosecutors against selecting the timing of investigative steps for the purpose of affecting an election or helping a particular candidate or party."

A handful of governors and other lawmakers are scheduled to give addresses, including former primary opponents Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

“There’s going to be a unified convention,” Trump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters Thursday, adding that the announced agenda was only a partial list of speakers. “People are going to be united behind Mr. Trump.”

The unusual collection of nonpolitical speakers seems designed to broaden Trump’s appeal. Roster names include retired astronaut Eileen Collins, the first female space-shuttle pilot and mission commander; Mark Geist and John Tiegen, two survivors of the 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi; and Antonio Sabato Jr., a former Calvin Klein underwear model, soap-opera actor and reality-television star.

Some sports figures will take the stage here, including pro golfer Natalie Gulbis and Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White.

Tim Tebow, a 28-year-old former National Football League quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner, was expected to speak at the gathering, according to GOP officials. Tebow is admired by many conservatives because of his outspoken evangelical Christian beliefs.

But Tebow said Thursday night in a Facebook video that he would not be speaking: “It’s amazing how fast rumors fly. And that’s exactly what it is, a rumor.”

These Republican leaders won’t be going to the convention in Cleveland + 8 Some will be campaigning. Some will be mowing their lawn.

But some sports heroes of decades past whom Trump has said he would like to see at the convention — such as former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight and boxing promoter Don King — are not listed as speakers.

Also notably absent from the list of speakers was Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who was identified by Trump allies Thursday as the candidate’s likely vice presidential pick. If chosen, Pence would deliver an acceptance speech after being formally nominated for vice president.

Two other vice-presidential finalists, Christie and former House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.), are listed on the program, as is Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), who also was vetted as a vice-presidential prospect.

Not speaking in Cleveland are the GOP’s past two presidential nominees, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), as well as its only two living former presidents, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush. None will be in Cleveland for the week-long festivities.

Also excluded from the speakers list are many of the party’s more diverse rising stars, including South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Tim Scott (S.C.), and Rep. Mia Love (Utah).

By contrast, the Democratic National Convention the following week in Philadelphia is expected to feature a full assortment of party stars — past, present and future — including President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Biden, former president Bill Clinton, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.).

The disparity in political star power between the conventions speaks volumes about the state of the two parties, with Republicans divided over their controversial new standard-bearer.

Looking ahead to Philadelphia, Republican strategist Rick Wilson said of the Democrats, “Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Elizabeth Warren — they’re all going to be out there swinging for the fences. But the Republicans, it’ll be like a hostage video of people forced on stage.”

The Cleveland convention will be orchestrated to help expand Trump’s appeal to the general electorate. To that end, several members of his family are expected to give speeches, including his wife, Melania, and his four oldest children: Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany.

In addition, other speakers who have known Trump and his family through the years plan to take the stage. They include Haskel Lookstein, a rabbi in New York who converted Ivanka Trump to Judaism; Tom Barrack, a wealthy California-based investor who has worked with Donald Trump on real-estate deals; and Kerry Woolard, the general manager of Trump Winery in Virginia.

With the public on edge following a spate of shootings by police and last week’s killing of five officers in Dallas, Trump has sought to brand himself as the law-and-order candidate. Some speakers at the Cleveland convention could help him make that case, including Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, a Democrat who is an outspoken critic of the Black Lives Matter movement and is a frequent Fox News Channel guest; former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani; and two female attorneys general, Pam Bondi of Florida and Leslie Rutledge of Arkansas.

Several early Trump backers are being rewarded with convention speaking slots, among them Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University, a college founded by his late televangelist father. Falwell campaigned frequently at Trump’s side leading up to the Iowa caucuses.

But one especially prominent Trump surrogate is not listed as a speaker: Sarah Palin, a former Alaska governor and 2008 vice-presidential nominee, who has garnered mixed reviews for her campaign-trail appearances supporting Trump.

Here in Cleveland, the Republican National Convention’s Rules Committee convened early Thursday and met late into the night to review the 42 rules governing the party structure and the selection of a presidential candidate. The big undecided issue remains whether or not to continue binding convention delegates to the results of caucuses and primaries or to unbind delegates and allow them to vote however they want.

Another subject of talks, which eventually collapsed with no resolution, centered on whether to return the party to closed contests — meaning that only Republicans could vote in presidential caucuses and primaries. A group led by Ken Cuccinnelli, the former Virginia attorney general, also wanted to make other changes to party operations.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and several members of the party’s leadership generally support the idea of reverting back to closed contests by awarding more convention delegates to states that hold closed contests.

Cuccinnelli said he proposed giving 20 percent more delegates to states that opted to hold a closed contest. Priebus and his team considered the offer, cut ultimately declined, according to people familiar with the talks."

http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/15/europe/nice-france-truck/index.html",0,"A petty thief and brawler who plowed a mile-long path of horror through Bastille Day celebrations on Nice's seafront had no known connections to terrorist groups, a French prosecutor said Friday as investigators scrambled to piece together whether the attack that claimed 84 lives was directed by Islamist militant networks.

The scale of the carnage wrought by a man authorities identified as 31-year-old Tunisian immigrant Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel came into grim focus Friday, with 10 children among the dead and 202 people injured. Among the wounded, 50 were ""between life and death,"" according to French President François Hollande.

The attack with a 19-ton rented Renault truck — the third mass- casualty assault to hit to France in 18 months — shocked the nation and sparked questions about whether authorities had done enough to safeguard a country that is an obvious target of terrorist groups. Many witnesses said Friday that the packed corniche had been only lightly guarded by police during fireworks on the gently warm night. Bouhlel, a truck driver, was easily able to drive around police fences blocking Nice’s famous Promenade des Anglais before jamming on the accelerator and zigzagging his way through the crowds in a method that seemed calculated to generate maximum bloodshed.

The identities of the victims testified to France’s diverse society and to the international appeal of the tony French Riviera. A vacationing father and his 11-year-old son from Lakeway, Tex. A headscarf-wearing Muslim woman who came to celebrate Bastille Day with her nieces and nephews. A French high school teacher, his wife, daughter and grandson. Others from Russia, Switzerland, Germany, Australia.

There were so many victims early Friday that survivors grabbed tablecloths from seaside cafes to cover the bodies strewn across the asphalt. The dead were marked by rectangular orange and white traffic-control barriers that stood like rows of tombstones.

‘A war waged on us’

Prime Minister Manuel Valls on Friday drew a strong link to terrorism, despite the fact that no militant group had claimed responsibility for the attack and Bouhlel had no known ties to such organizations.

“The threat of terrorism, as we have now been saying for a long time, is weighing heavily on France, and it will continue to do so for a long time yet,” Valls said after an emergency meeting in Paris. “We are facing a war waged on us by terrorism.”

French citizens are clearly reaching their limit. Valls and Hollande — whose popularity is scraping record lows — were booed when they visited the seaside scene of the attack Friday, in an apparent sign of anger over security lapses.

France was shaken by a terrorist attack in January 2015, when militant Islamist attackers took aim at the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher grocery store in Paris. Attackers struck again in November in a popular nightclub district of the capital, setting off bombs and raking the area with gunfire.

This time, the French population had just relaxed after living for weeks on heightened alert during European soccer championships that concluded Sunday. Hours before the violence in Nice, Hollande had announced that he planned to allow a state of emergency to expire at the end of the month. On Friday, Hollande said it would be extended for three months instead, and he said he would boost France’s role in the Islamic State strongholds of Syria and Iraq.

The attack was a “barbaric act,” Hollande said after meeting with top officials in Nice. “An individual who took a truck and murdered people with it.”

Belgium, Germany and Italy stepped up security along their borders on Friday, in a measure of fears that the violence in France could spill into neighboring countries. Belgium — which was struck by a bomb attack at the Brussels airport and a subway station in March — is particularly nervous ahead of its own national day Thursday.

As investigators struggled to understand whether Bouhlel had acted alone, they offered a first account of his path toward the murderous drive that concluded in a hail of bullets from police officers who forced the truck to a stop outside the grand Palais de la Mediterranee, a hotel.

Bouhlel was a Tunisian citizen who had lived in Nice since at least 2010, when he first ran afoul of authorities by engaging in petty theft, according to Paris Prosecutor François Molins. Most recently, he had been given a suspended six-month prison sentence related to a January assault, Molins said.

Bouhlel is divorced and has three children, neighbors said. The prosecutor said the suspect’s ex-wife was taken in for questioning.

Truck’s deadly path

As fireworks lit up the sky Thursday in celebration of Bastille Day, Bouhlel drove the rented truck toward its fatal destination, Molins said. In the cab he carried an automatic pistol, two fake assault rifles, a non-working hand grenade and a phony pistol. He swerved around a police barrier blocking the Promenade des Anglais just next to a children’s hospital, then sped through the crowds, leaving carnage in his path. More than a mile later, three police officers traded fire with him, Molins said. Authorities think the truck kept going 300 yards after he had been shot. Police found him dead in the passenger seat.

Bouhlel was “entirely unknown” to anti-terrorist units, the prosecutor said. “Yesterday’s attack has not yet been claimed, but I must stay that this kind of attack is in line with the type advocated by the terrorist organizations in various videos,” he said.

Witnesses described confusion and chaos Thursday night as hundreds of panicked bystanders ran to try to escape the deadly truck.

After the fireworks, Adrien Dobrescu, 54, who was visiting from Romania, heard more sharp bangs. “Someone was screaming, and I saw gunfire,” he said. He ran with a crowd as fast as he could off the promenade. “I had waited two, four minutes, I would be dead, too.”

Survivors were left to deal with the wounded and dead.

“There were so many injured, and dead bodies,” said Fiona Le Goff, 27, a concierge at an apartment building facing the Promenade des Anglais. “The worst was a woman whose body was just stuck to the street.”

Later, she surveyed the area as forensic teams moved in. “There were people just covered with white cloths,” she said. “It was horrible.”

After the bodies of victims had been hauled away Friday, the macabre truck remained for hours. More than 25 bullet holes riddled its front, and its doors stood open while investigators searched it. Barely 100 yards away, mourners piled flowers and remembrances at the base of a palm tree, some of them crying while they sang “La Marseillaise,” France’s anthem.

France declared three days of mourning beginning Saturday, and flags will fly at half-staff.

At a White House meeting with foreign diplomats Friday, President Obama lamented that “so many children” were killed or hurt in the “sickening attack” in Nice. He said he spoke to Hollande earlier in the day and pledged that the United States would stand with France “as we defend our nations against this scourge of terrorism and violence.”

“These terrorists are targeting and killing innocent people of all backgrounds and faiths, including Muslims,” Obama said. He vowed to “keep taking out” Islamic State leaders on the battlefield.

Among the dead were two Americans: Sean Copeland, 51, and his 11-year-old son, Brodie, from Lakeway, about 20 miles west of Austin, who were vacationing in Europe, the family said in a statement.

It did not refer to the lawyer, Corentin Delobel, by name.

http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-panic-drives-progressives-toward-clinton-225667",0,"On the eve of the two national political conventions that will shape the images of the major-party presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are in a competitive contest nationally but with the presumptive Republican nominee facing deficits on key character attributes and issues, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.

The survey shows Clinton leading Trump by 47 percent to 43 percent among registered voters. That represents a shift in Trump’s direction since last month’s Post-ABC poll, which showed Clinton leading by 12 points. In the new poll, Clinton leads by 10 points among all adults — 50 percent to 40 percent — compared with a 14-point lead among this wider group last month.

Both candidates remain highly unpopular — the two most unpopular in the history of Post-ABC polling. By about 2 to 1 (64 percent to 31 percent), Americans view Trump unfavorably. Clinton’s numbers are not quite as negative — 42 percent favorable and 54 percent unfavorable. Half of all registered voters say they have strongly unfavorable views of Trump, while 47 percent say they have strongly unfavorable views of Clinton — the highest ever in a Post-ABC poll for her.

The survey also highlights the degree to which Americans are motivated by negative impulses rather than seeing the choice in positive terms. Almost 6 in 10 say they are dissatisfied with the choice of Trump vs. Clinton. Fifty-four percent of Clinton’s supporters say they are mainly voting against Trump, while 57 percent of Trump supporters say they are mainly voting against Clinton.

Given the dissatisfaction, there is the possibility that candidates from minor parties will attract the support of disaffected voters. In a four-way matchup that also includes Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party, the poll results are Clinton 42 percent, Trump 38 percent, Johnson 8 percent and Stein 5 percent.

The new poll comes after a tumultuous two weeks that included the killings of five police officers in Dallas and deadly shootings by police in Louisiana and Minnesota. As the calling for the poll was closing came news of an apparent terrorist attack in Nice, France. All these events have added to the tensions of a country on edge and heightened the importance of security and racial issues in the choice of a president.

The poll also comes after Clinton was spared prosecution by the government for her use of a private email server as secretary of state. But while avoiding any criminal charge, Clinton received a stern rebuke from FBI Director James B. Comey, who said she and her aides had been “extremely careless” in their handling of sensitive classified material in their email exchanges.

The previous Post-ABC poll showed Clinton with a larger lead than some other national surveys taken around the same time. Whether or how much the shift toward Trump in the current survey was affected by how the FBI investigation was resolved can't be measured. Other recent polls show the difference in the race nationally to be in low single digits, with Clinton generally enjoying the advantage.

Republicans begin their nominating convention here in Cleveland on Monday and will conclude Thursday with the expected nomination of Trump, with Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana as his running mate.

The Democratic convention, in Philadelphia, will begin July 25, with Clinton poised to become the first woman nominated for president by a major party. She is still mulling her vice-presidential choice and met with several contenders Friday.

Trump hopes to produce a convention that helps to alleviate questions about his fitness to be president among many Americans, but he begins with an enormous deficit on that issue. The Post-ABC poll found that nearly six in 10 registered voters say he is not qualified to serve as president — with 49 percent saying they strongly believe that. Meanwhile, Clinton is seen as qualified to serve as president by 56 percent of voters.

Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, about 7 in 10 see Trump as qualified to be president — but almost one-quarter of that part of the electorate still questions the presumptive GOP nominee’s fitness.

The survey highlights familiar fault lines in the electorate. Trump leads among men, 49 percent to 41 percent, while Clinton enjoys an even larger margin among women, 52 to 38 percent. Voters ages 18 to 39 support Clinton 54 to 34 percent, while those 65 and older back Trump 51 to 42 percent. Those between 40 and 65 are almost evenly divided. Trump leads by 15 percentage points among white voters, while Clinton has a huge 52 percentage point lead among nonwhite voters.

At this point, the Democrats are slightly more united behind Clinton than Republicans are behind Trump. One goal of the Trump campaign is to leave Cleveland at the end of the week with the party more united and enthusiastic about the nominee. Currently, 86 percent of Democrats back Clinton, while 82 percent of Republicans back Trump.

Independent voters lean toward Trump, 47 to 41 percent, although winning independents is no guarantee of winning the presidency. Four years ago, Mitt Romney won among independents while losing to President Obama.

Clinton enjoys the support of 8 in 10 self-identified liberals, while 7 in 10 conservatives back Trump. Moderates go decisively for Clinton, 52 to 36 percent.

The contest between Clinton and Trump highlights one potential shift in the electorate that will be closely watched between now and November: the division among voters based on educational attainment.

Trump’s most important block of voters are whites without college degrees, who support Trump by a margin of 60 to 33 percent. But college-educated white voters have been shifting toward the Democrats, and the poll underscores that the competition for those voters will be hard-fought and potentially decisive in the election’s outcome. Republicans historically have carried the votes of whites with college degrees, and Romney won the group by 14 points over Obama four years ago.

The Post-ABC poll finds whites with college degrees are evenly divided — 43 percent Trump, 42 percent Clinton, with an outsize 10 percent volunteering support for “neither.” When gender is included in the analysis, the poll finds that white women with college degrees narrowly support Clinton, while white men with college degrees support Trump by a slightly larger margin.

Of seven issues tested, Clinton has double-digit advantages over Trump on three — race relations, handling an international crisis and immigration. Clinton has smaller edges on looking out for the middle class and handling terrorism, while Trump holds small edges on taxes and the economy.

Across six attributes, Trump has an 11-point margin among registered voters on the question of which candidate would do the most to bring needed change to Washington. By a margin of five points, he is seen as more honest and trustworthy. Clinton has a similar edge on empathy with people’s problems and representing people’s values and holds double-digit edges on having better judgment and having a presidential personality and temperament.

In an election that is likely to be framed as a choice of continuity with Obama’s policies vs. a change in direction led by a Washington outsider with no previous political experience, a bare majority of voters say they prefer experience in politics to someone outside the establishment. That’s a narrower margin than earlier in the year, when 59 percent said they favored a politically experienced candidate. The poll indicated there was growing support for an outsider among Republicans and independents.

Clinton’s trust deficit is highlighted on another question in the poll: whether she is too willing to bend the rules. Seven in 10 Americans (72 percent) said she is. The poll also asked whether respondents saw Trump as biased against women and minorities. On that question, 56 percent said yes. When people were asked which was the greater concern, a plurality (48 to 43 percent) cited Trump’s possible bias.

The Post-ABC poll was conducted July 11-14 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on cellular and landline phones. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points; the error margin is 4 points among the sample of 816 registered voters."

Declaring that he alone has the leadership strength to secure the homeland and rejuvenate the economy, the billionaire real estate mogul offered himself as a “law and order” candidate and made a direct appeal to blue-collar Americans who have felt left behind in the 21st century.

“The forgotten men and women of our country — people who work hard but no longer have a voice: I am your voice,” Trump said in a long address to fired-up delegates on the closing night of the Republican National Convention.

Rather than pivoting to the political middle with an uplifting address, Trump punctuated the turbulent four-day convention with a heavy speech with simple declarations. And he focused intensively on the alleged dangers posed by immigrants and refugees, showing that on the biggest stage of his campaign he would not shy away from rhetoric that many minority voters find repulsive.

Trump spoke with so much gusto it sounded much of the time as though he were screaming, and by the end his face was notably red and glistening with sweat. The address lasted an extraordinary 76 minutes, with balloons falling in Quicken Loans Arena and fireworks shooting over Lake Erie nearly an hour after scheduled.

The tone of his prepared text was hard-edged — at times severe — and echoed the dark themes of Richard Nixon’s 1968 campaign. Trump is betting that general-election voters feel so beleaguered that they will heed his call for radical change.

Trump described the country as beset by illegal immigrants, some of them killers. The crowd chanted back at him, “Send them home,” and “Build the wall.” And Trump decried an increase in homicides in some cities.

“I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: When I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me. Believe me,” he said.

Trump's relentlessly gloomy tone was a jarring contrast to the sunny introduction by his daughter Ivanka Trump, who portrayed him as a generous, magnanimous business executive who would be ""the people's champion"" and ""a fighter"" who delivers results.

She said her father has been an advocate for women in his company and would do the same as president, saying that he supports equal pay for equal work and would change labor laws to help make quality child care affordable — all priorities of presumed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Donald Trump laid out stark differences between his agenda and that of Clinton. He asserted that his rival is a “puppet” of corporations and elites, and that she would “keep our rigged system in place.”

What it looked like at the Republican National Convention on Day 4 + 47 The scene from Cleveland on the final day of the convention.

Trump blamed Clinton directly for the past decade and a half of foreign operations that have wrought turmoil in the Middle East and cast the former secretary of state as a favor-trading, self-enriching agent of overseas powers.

“This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness,” he said. “But Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy.”

As Trump attacked Clinton, the attendees chanted, “Lock her up!” as they had for previous speakers. At one point, Trump tried to shush his supporters. He gestured “no” with his hands and declared that together they should beat her at the polls in November.

Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, said in a statement: “Tonight, Donald Trump painted a dark picture of an America in decline. And his answer — more fear, more division, more anger, more hate — was yet another reminder that he is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be President of the United States.”

In virtually every policy realm, Trump vowed to put the country’s interests before any other — redirecting Washington’s gaze inward in an age of globalization.

“Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo,” he said. “As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America first, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect — the respect that we deserve. The American people will come first once again.”

Thursday’s address was the most consequential of Trump’s brief and remarkable political career. He strode onstage to the “Air Force One” theme song before an enormous screen displaying his name in huge gold letters.

The stakes were made higher by missteps and missed opportunities during the convention’s first three nights, putting pressure on the nominee to convince the general electorate that he has a credible and appealing vision for the nation’s future.

Throughout his remarks, Trump cast himself as a change agent and Clinton as a guardian of the status quo.

“I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves,” he said.

Trump directly addressed some of the more controversial policy proposals of his candidacy, including his vague, newly formulated vow to temporarily ban people from any nation connected to terrorism from entering the United States.

“We don’t want them in our country,” Trump said. He added, “I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never, ever will be.”

He also vowed, “We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS and we are going to defeat them fast,” referring to the Islamic State.

Earlier in the evening, Maricopa County (Ariz.) Sheriff Joe Arpaio, one of the most polarizing figures in the immigration debate, vouched for Trump's proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border.

He said, “Donald Trump will build the wall” — at which point the crowd chanted “Build the wall!” — “and restore law and order and keep drugs and illegal immigrants from entering our country.”

But another moment illustrated the swift evolution of some Republicans on social issues. Billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel said, “I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all, I am proud to be an American” — the first to make such a declaration at a GOP convention. Thousands of delegates rose to their feet and cheered.

When Trump later referred to the recent massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando and said he would “protect our LGBTQ citizens,” the crowd applauded loudly. Taking it in, Trump said, “As a Republican, I have to say, it is so nice to hear you cheering.”

Trump was under pressure to project unity for the fractured Republican Party, which was split anew by an extraordinary uproar Wednesday night on the convention floor. As it became clear that Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) would not endorse his former primary rival in his prime-time address, the crowd booed and jeered him until he exited the stage.

As speakers all week have done, Trump sought to rally Republicans to his cause with sharp and relentless attacks on Clinton and the Democratic Party.

“We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore,” he said to enthusiastic cheers. “So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully crafted lies and the media myths, the Democrats are holding their convention next week. But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.”

One of the loudest crowd responses came when Trump introduced his new running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who has strong support among evangelicals and other conservatives.

In a remarkable departure from past GOP conventions, Trump made no mention of God, religion or his faith. And although he thanked the evangelical community for supporting him, he sounded a rare note of self-deprecation, saying, “I’m not sure I really deserve it.”

Trump was unquestionably the star of the final evening. Throughout the night, his family, friends and employees talked glowingly about his character and leadership style. In gauzy videos as well as speeches, they described him as a compassionate visionary with a connection to the common man and a drive to fix problems and finish projects.

""I truly believe Mr. Trump is America's blue-collar billionaire,"" said Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University. ""He is down-to-earth. He loves America and the American people. He is a true patriot and a champion of the common man.""

At center stage was Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, who introduced herself as nonpartisan. ""Like many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat."" She spoke passionately about her father's competitive drive. ""I have seen him fight for his family,"" she said. ""I have seen him fight for his employees, I have seen him fight for his company, and now I am seeing him fight for our country. It's been the story of his life and, more recently, the spirit of his campaign.""

And she said her father ""cannot stand to see"" empty main streets and boarded-up factories, college graduates who are crippled by student debt and mothers who cannot afford the cost of child care.

""Other politicians see these hardships, see the unfairness of it all, and say, 'I feel for you,' "" she said, evoking former president Bill Clinton's legendary displays of empathy. ""Only my father will say, 'I'll fight for you.' ""

Donald Trump picked up from his daughter by saying he is ready to go to work for the country.

“It’s time to deliver a victory for the American people,” he said. “We don’t win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. . . . America is a nation of believers, dreamers and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics and cynics.”

He continued with an appeal to voters: “To every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I’m with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.”"

Wasserman Schultz's tenure at the head of the DNC has been rocky almost since the moment she took over the job in 2011.

Interviews with a variety of pro- and anti-Wasserman Schultz Democrats — and there are plenty of both — suggest that the Florida House member's problems were both personal and structural, and that she retains a relatively bright future even if this chapter of her political life left much to be desired.

Where to start when it comes to the ""why"" behind Wasserman Schultz's struggles depends on who you believe is to blame for them.

Several people I talked to put the blame — or at least a large portion of it — on President Obama and his inner circle of political advisers who never cared about the DNC in any meaningful way and, as a result, left Wasserman Schultz to wither on the vine as they worked around her time and again.

""Obama and team never accepted the DNC or cared very much about it, and it showed,"" said one senior Democratic strategist granted anonymity to speak candidly. ""Obama was not into party building, or party anything. He never integrated his political operation into the DNC so she was in a very tough position always.""

From the start, Obama was never a big ""party"" guy. He explicitly ran against the party infrastructure and elites in 2008 — Hillary Clinton was their candidate — and once he got into office was openly disdainful of many of the traditional apparatus of the party.

Obama installed his loyal ally Tim Kaine — name ring a bell? — as the DNC chair. But, once Kaine decided to run for an open Virginia Senate seat in 2011, it was clear to anyone paying attention that the next DNC chair wouldn't be a member of the Obama inner circle as he began positioning himself for his reelection bid.

Enter Wasserman Schultz, a Jewish woman from Florida who had a reputation as a dogged fundraiser and willing attack dog on TV. For what Obama imagined that job to be, she was a natural fit.

""She wasn't anyone's first choice for chair,"" a veteran Democratic operative said. ""But I think most people thought she'd be fine.""

The counter to that story line is that Wasserman Schultz, from the jump, seemed dead set on using the perch to promote her own political interests rather than put what was best for Obama first.

Even some of Wasserman Schultz's harshest critics acknowledge that part of that problem was structural: She was in elected office while also serving as the party chair. She was looking to move up the ladder in House leadership and saw the DNC job as a way to do that. Period.

She was far from the only elected official who has struggled to balance the demands of the party chair job with more provincial interests. ""It wasn't great with [then Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd] or [then Philadelphia Mayor Ed] Rendell, and it wasn't great with her,"" said one leading Democratic consultant. ""There are always concerns about whose agenda gets put first, tensions between official duties (particularly votes) and political party duties.""

But, Wasserman Schultz's emphasis on her own political future — and the need to make sure she was front and center when it came to media attention and interviews — rubbed lots and lots of people the wrong way.

""She ignored infrastructure, instead focusing on why she wasn't getting more media hits,"" noted a longtime Democratic strategist familiar with the inner workings of the party committee. ""

""Fundraising was anemic.""

On and on it went. For much of the past two years, rumors of Wasserman Schultz's demise came across the transom with remarkable regularity. And yet, she persevered — occasionally via means that left made her detractors even more convinced that she needed to go.

What her increasingly large enemies list could never find was a spark that could set all of the tinder they had gathered aflame. That long-awaited moment came late last week when a hacker group released more than 20,000 hacked DNC emails. The emails cast Wasserman Schultz and her senior staff in not only an unflattering light but also as abettors of Clinton's march to the Democratic presidential nomination — in effect confirming the suspicions of Sanders and his supporters.

Within days, years of bad blood with Wasserman Schultz had been unleashed and she had been pushed out.

What does the future hold for the Florida Democrat? She faces a primary from a Sanders-backed candidate but most political observers say she will win it. Beyond that, few people I talked to had any real sense for where she might go next although Dave Beattie, a Florida pollster and Wasserman Schultz ally, was optimistic.

""I have worked with her a long time,"" he said. ""She is loyal, works hard, is a staunch advocate for Democrats and is not afraid to raise money.""

Time will tell. But, it's hard to see Wasserman Schultz's time at the head of the DNC as anything short of a major disappointment for all involved."

Having spent the first two nights of the Democratic National Convention trying to unify the party behind Clinton, a procession of leading party figures made a sharp pivot to GOP nominee Donald Trump. Over the course of the evening, they questioned his character, his judgment, his business acumen — even his sanity.

Obama offered an American ideal against that bill of particulars against Trump: ""Our power doesn't come from some self-declared savior promising that he alone can restore order. We don't look to be ruled.""

About the onetime rival who became his secretary of state and whose election would burnish his legacy, Obama said: “There has never been a man or a woman more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America.

“She will finish the job — and she’ll do it without resorting to torture or banning entire religions from entering our country,” he added.

On Wednesday, the convention also formally nominated Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (Va.) as the Democratic vice-presidential pick. Noting that his eldest child is a Marine who deployed to Europe on Monday, Kaine said: ""I trust Hillary Clinton with our son's life.""

It was the first night in which the Democratic speakers focused heavily on the themes of national security and foreign policy — and their most concerted effort to undermine Trump on issues where he has relentlessly pummeled Obama and Clinton.

Vice President Biden described Trump as ""a man who confuses bluster with strength"" and someone who ""doesn't have a clue about the middle class.""

A president of resurgent popularity, Obama offered a counterpoint to the near-apocalyptic portrait of the country on display during last week’s Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where Trump accepted his party’s nomination.

“The America I know is full of courage and optimism and ingenuity. The America I know is decent and generous,” Obama said.

He nodded toward the country’s worries and the trauma of recent tragedies.

“We’ve still got more work to do,” the president said. “More work to do for every American still in need of a good job or a raise, paid leave or a decent retirement; for every child who needs a sturdier ladder out of poverty or a world-class education; for everyone who hasn’t yet felt the progress of these past seven-and-a-half years.”

But Obama, echoing some of the upbeat themes that first lady Michelle Obama sounded on the convention's opening night, gave an address focused on progress, both economic and social, and ""a younger generation full of energy and new ideas, unconstrained by what is, and ready to seize what ought to be.""

Clinton took the stage unannounced at the end of the Obama’s remarks, and the two engaged in a prolonged embrace before walking around arm in arm waving to a boisterous crowd.

All of it amounted to a reversal of the two parties’ traditional orientations. Republicans typically claim the upbeat mantra of Ronald Reagan, who famously talked of the United States as a “shining city upon a hill,” echoing the words of Puritan John Winthrop’s famous 1630 sermon, which paraphrased Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount.

The Democrats, on the other hand, often have come across as the party more focused on the nation’s woes and flaws — or as then-U.N. Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick put it contemptuously at the 1984 GOP convention, the “blame America first crowd.”

Midway through Wednesday evening’s speeches, Tony Fratto, a deputy press secretary in the George W. Bush White House, tweeted: “Watching Democrats talk about America the way Republican candidates used to talk about America.”

For any party to hold the White House for three consecutive terms is a difficult feat, even in rosy times.

Democrats have not done so since before World War II, and only twice since 1828, at the dawn of the modern two-party system. The GOP has done it four times, most recently when Vice President George H.W. Bush won the 1988 election to succeed Reagan.

But it is all the more of a challenge when the vast majority of voters think the country is headed in the wrong direction.

The latest Real Clear Politics average of polls shows that the share of Americans who think the country is on the wrong track is nearly 46 percentage points greater than those who think it is on a favorable course.

That has fueled the anti-establishment mood that delivered the GOP nomination to Trump and made Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) a formidable challenger to Clinton for the Democratic nomination.

As the evening wore on, scattered anti-“TPP” signs popped up around the arena, signaling opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pending trade deal championed by Obama but opposed by most congressional Democrats and labor unions.

Kaine has supported the deal in the past but is expected to modify his position to conform with that of Clinton, who as secretary of state called it the “gold standard” of trade deals but is now opposed.

Speeches and videos Wednesday aimed to reinforce Clinton’s governing credentials, particularly on national security. This followed Democrats’ efforts to unify the party on Monday and both humanize and attest to their nominee’s character on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Democrats were given fresh fodder Wednesday for their argument that Trump is unprepared and temperamentally unsuited to be president.

At a news conference in Florida, Trump pleaded directly with the Russian government to meddle in the U.S. campaign by finding and releasing tens of thousands of private emails from Clinton — a development that alarmed not only Democrats but also many Republican leaders and foreign policy experts.

Among those called upon to draw contrasts between Clinton’s and Trump’s foreign policy credentials was retired Rear Adm. John Hutson, one of several military leaders in the spotlight at the convention.

“Donald Trump calls himself the ‘law-and-order candidate,’ but he’ll violate international law,” Hutson said. “In his words, he endorses torture ‘at a minimum.’ He’ll order our troops to commit war crimes like killing civilians. . . . This morning, he personally invited Russia to hack us. That’s not law and order. That’s criminal intent.”

Members of the Congressional Black Caucus on Wednesday looked past the Obama era and expressed their faith in Clinton as their standard-bearer and champion. But mostly they delivered a vehement denunciation of Trump, saying he has no plan to lift African Americans.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) said Trump is simply “the least-qualified person to ever seek the presidency.” He added a bit of wordplay, saying Clinton had served as secretary of state while Trump is a “secretary of hate.”

In his remarks to the convention, Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.) chided Trump as “a hateful con man” but also blamed his Republican counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), for “setting the stage” for Trump.

New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a onetime Republican turned independent, also urged a vote for Clinton, making a special appeal to his fellow independents.

“The bottom line is: Trump is a risky, reckless and radical choice, and we can’t afford to make that choice,” Bloomberg said, calling Trump a “dangerous demagogue.”

The former New York mayor is also a leading voice for tougher gun laws, a cause that was featured in a segment of Wednesday night’s program. It included an emotional speech by Christine Leinonen, the mother of Christopher Leinonen, who was killed in the massacre last month at an Orlando nightclub.

The presentation also featured speakers with connections to the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 and at a church in Charleston, S.C., last year.

Former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (Ariz.), who was shot in Tucson in 2011, also appeared alongside her husband, Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut and Navy captain. The two have made it their mission to enact additional gun control measures.

“We have important work ahead of us, work that will determine the future of our country,” said Giffords, who argued for Clinton’s candidacy, saying, “Strong women get things done.”

Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, who dropped out of the Democratic presidential race after a dismal showing in the Iowa caucuses, noted that he had competed against Clinton and worked with Kaine when the vice-presidential nominee was governor of Virginia.

""I am here to tell you that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are as tough as they come,"" O'Malley said. ""They never give up. They never give in.""

O’Malley took aim at Trump, saying he has been “a bully his whole life.”

Kaine’s pick as Clinton’s running mate drew praise from many quarters, but the former Virginia governor faces a challenge in convincing some liberal groups that he will champion their issues. Longtime watchers of Virginia politics say the question during much of Kaine’s career there has been whether he is too liberal for the state.

“I think progressives are looking for him not only to talk about progressive issues, but to talk about them with authenticity and sincerity,” said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which bills itself as representative of the “Warren wing” of the Democratic Party, a reference to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).

“He has a real chance to introduce himself to the Democratic Party and electorate at large,” Taylor said of Kaine.

Some Sanders supporters had threatened in recent days to walk out of the hall or otherwise show their displeasure with Clinton's pick of Kaine, a former Richmond mayor, Virginia governor and chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Only a smattering of disapproval could be heard in the hall.

In his address to the convention, Kaine showed that he is warming up to the running mate’s traditional role as the presidential nominee’s attack dog.

He delighted the crowd with his mocking impersonation of Trump, focusing on his verbal tic of saying “Believe me.”

“Folks, you cannot believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump’s mouth. Not one word,” Kaine said, setting off the delegates in a chant of “Not one word.”"

Fifty of them signed an open letter warning that Trump ""would put at risk our country's national security."" Fifty more joined ""Together for America,"" a Clinton effort urging voters to ""put country over party."" Then her team began exploring whether former secretaries of state, such as Henry Kissinger, might back her.

That, liberals warned, would be a step too far. And the prospect fed a perception that, with a contentious primary behind her, the Democratic nominee has returned to her old, hawkish ways and is again taking progressives for granted.

“What does Kissinger, a veritable war criminal, do to help win over these voters?” Alex Shephard asked in the New Republic.

Wrote Greg Grandin in the Nation: “Kissinger is a unique monster. He stands not as a bulwark against Donald Trump’s feared recklessness and immorality but as his progenitor.”

Wrote Isaac Chotiner in Slate: “Clinton must exercise the judgment that will be required of her in office. The prospect of Kissinger having influence in a Clinton White House is downright scary.”

These progressives opposed the national security decisions Clinton made in the Senate and the State Department. They already felt that their questions about her were not answered in the primaries, which is why so many of them backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.). With his campaign in the rearview mirror, they see Clinton courting the sorts of Republicans they have worked against for decades — and it angers them.

“It amuses me how Democrats who once found these people appalling are now cheering them as useful weapons in their glorious battle against Trump,” said Doug Henwood, a journalist who has written extensively about why progressives should not trust Clinton. “I’ve never been a big fan of Obama’s, but I’m already getting nostalgic for him. Hillary’s into all the stupid s--- he’s somewhat tried to avoid.”

As first lady, Clinton was viewed by Republicans as the most liberal member of a dangerously left-wing political family. But as a politician, she assembled a long list of differences with progressives, starting with her 2002 vote to allow U.S. military intervention in Iraq. Her narrow loss in the 2008 presidential primary was celebrated by Democratic doves, who believed they’d defeated a political establishment that too easily veered into war.

In 2015, when it appeared that Clinton would have a lazy stroll to the nomination, neoconservatives such as Robert Kagan suggested that she would be acceptable to Republicans and hawks. The rise of Sanders made the Clinton campaign skittish about such talk and unlikely to draw attention to praise from hawks.

At a February 2016 debate in Milwaukee, Sanders shamed Clinton for writing that Kissinger was a friend who “checked in with me regularly, sharing astute observations about foreign leaders and sending me written reports on his travels.”

“I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country,” Sanders said. “I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.”

Although Trump’s romp through the Republican primaries rattled some supporters loose, the Clinton team hesitated to publicize the endorsements until Sanders’s campaign was over.

But on the final night of the Democratic National Convention, many Sanders delegates watched in agony as retired generals took the stage and endorsed Clinton. What Clinton’s campaign packaged as a popular front against a dangerous candidate, progressives saw as a needless swing to the right — one that empowered discredited foreign policy thinking.

“I don’t think Clinton will change her foreign policy because she’s receiving endorsements from Bush, Reagan and Nixon foreign policy officials,” said Glenn Greenwald, a Pulitzer Prize-winning co-founder of the Intercept. “I think she’s receiving those endorsements because they like what her foreign policy will be. That’s what worries me.”

Clinton’s post-convention polling surge may have reduced the leverage of progressive voters. According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday, Clinton is winning 11 percent of Republican registered voters, similar to 13 percent for Barack Obama in August 2008. Just 14 percent of Democratic-leaning voters who wanted Sanders to win the primary do not support Clinton in a two-way race, compared with 30 percent of Clinton supporters who did not support Obama in August 2008.

Much of that, progressives say, is because of the real threat of a Trump presidency. Since conceding the primary, Sanders has relentlessly warned his supporters not to oppose Clinton’s campaign. (He declined through a spokesman to comment for this article.) Noam Chomsky, a left-wing intellectual who has criticized Kissinger’s foreign policy interventions for decades, said it still makes sense for voters to unite against Trump.

""I don't like it, but it cannot give me pause, since the alternative is vastly worse, even on endorsements,"" Chomsky said. ""I don't see the significance of neocons endorsing Clinton, probably not because they particularly like her but because they are concerned, sometimes terrified, about Trump.""

The conservatives abandoning the GOP over Trump have the same concerns.

“I’m speaking up so that when my grandchildren come home from college and ask me what I was doing in this election, I can tell them,” said Eliot Cohen, a co-founder of the Project for a New American Century who signed the “letter of 50” and planned to write in the name of Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) for president. “What I’d say to Sanders voters is: Can’t you accept the possibility that there are people you disagree with, but who are on your side this time?”

What neither the critics nor the endorsers can know is how the cross-party endorsements will affect a possible Clinton administration. After his 2008 victory, Obama’s decision to make Clinton secretary of state and appoint Clinton ally Rahm Emanuel as chief of staff angered many on the left. A “popular front” would allow some Republicans to share credit for a Clinton win. Unions that had once opposed Meg Whitman might see her discussed as a Cabinet member; anti-war activists who wore out shoes for Sanders might see neoconservatives considered for the State Department."
3375,3375,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/06/paul-ryan-and-john-mccain-1-donald-trump-0/,0,"Donald Trump is a proud man. He rarely admits that he's wrong. He even said, at one point in this campaign, ""A lot of times, when you apologize, they use it as ammunition against [you]."" But Donald Trump effectively apologized twice on Friday -- or at least admitted he was wrong twice. And, arguably, he did it three and even four times.

First, on Friday morning, there was Trump's admission that he mistook video of the release of U.S. hostages held by Iran in Geneva as video of a transfer of $400 million from the United States to Iran. Then, on Friday night, he endorsed House Speaker Paul D. Ryan's (R-Wis.) reelection after declining to do so just three days prior.

Oh, and he also endorsed Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), whom he also conspicuously declined to back earlier this week.

""We will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory -- and very importantly, toward real change,"" Trump said of Ryan in Green Bay, Wis.

The endorsement followed plenty of uncertainty. In comments to The Washington Post's Philip Rucker on Tuesday, Trump declined to back Ryan and said nice things about Ryan's primary opponent, Paul Nehlen. The snub was particularly notable since Ryan delayed his own endorsement of Trump. But given that endorsement eventually arrived, Trump's lack of reciprocation was seen as a political faux pas -- or perhaps a signal to Ryan that his continued criticism of Trump's controversial comments wasn't appreciated.

Trump also thumbed his nose at Ayotte, citing her lack of direct support.

Share this article Share

“You have a Kelly Ayotte who doesn’t want to talk about Trump, but I'm beating her in the polls by a lot,"" Trump told Rucker. ""You tell me. Are these people that should be representing us, okay? You tell me.”

In the end, though, it looks like a GOP nominee who often says things he might regret had come to regret these comments. Trump trails in the presidential race badly in recent polls -- by as much as 15 points -- and the potential for the GOP establishment to desert him was just not something he could take on.

Ryan has set himself up as the conscience of the GOP. He withheld his endorsement of Trump for a long time before coming around, and he has regularly weighed in when the establishment saw Trump going too far.

But what's most notable here is that Ryan continued his criticism of Trump even after Trump threatened to withhold his endorsement.

""We just came out our convention, and yeah he's had a pretty strange run since the convention,"" Ryan told Jerry Bader of Wisconsin local radio station WTAQ in an interview Thursday. ""You would think you ought to be focusing on Hillary Clinton -- on all of her deficiencies. She is such a weak candidate that one would think we'd be on offense against Hillary Clinton, and it is distressing that that's not what we're talking about these days.""

Ryan reassured that his support wasn't a ""blank check"" and even sent a fundraising email that could be read to warn of a potential landslide Trump loss in November.

If Trump wanted Ryan to kiss the ring and back down, he didn't get it. But despite that, he felt the pressure to back the most significant figure in the GOP establishment. And in doing so, he also bowed to the pressure he faced to endorse two senators who would be very important to GOP efforts to hold onto the Senate."

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/15/trump-cribs-war-plan-from-isis-founder.html",0,"Donald Trump traveled to Youngstown, Ohio, to deliver what was billed as a “major” speech on how to deal with the threat posed by the Islamic State terrorist group, a.k.a. ISIS. For reasons known only to Trump, he continued to repeat false statements that have been repeatedly debunked in the past. So here’s a roundup of some of the more notable claims made in the speech. As is our practice, we don’t award Pinocchios in roundups, but readers by now should be able to tell the real whoppers.

“This summer there’s been an ISIS attack launched outside the war zones of the Middle East — hard to believe — every 84 hours.”

This number comes from IntelCenter, a private counterterrorism intelligence company, but the time frame that Trump uses is cherry-picked.

The group’s data from June 8 to July 20, 2016, have gotten attention for the number of terrorist attacks directed or inspired by ISIS: one attack every 84 hours. That’s why Trump says that’s how many attacks there have been “this summer,” though the data cover approximately six weeks of the summer so far. CNN reported that the group’s count mirrors the outlet’s tracking data, but it’s just a brief snapshot.

IntelCenter has tracked attacks since the Islamic State announced its “caliphate” in June 2014. Since then, there have been 76 attacks in 21 countries, killing 966 and injuring 2,812, the website says. Those data cover June 29, 2014, to Aug. 6, 2016. That means there were about three attacks every month over the 26 months covered by the data.

“The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton.”

This is false and facile. The terrorist group is the direct result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, as we explored in our interview with Washington Post reporter Joby Warrick, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his book on the rise of the Islamic State. (Trump, of course, supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003.) At best, one could argue that actions that Obama failed to take (over Clinton’s opposition) helped contribute to the growth of ISIS.

“Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion in cash released by the United States.”

Trump always makes it sound like this is U.S. taxpayer money — and he always uses a too-high estimate. Because of international sanctions over its nuclear program, Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe. With sanctions lifted, in theory those funds would be unlocked.

But the Treasury Department has estimated that once Iran fulfills other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. (Much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in China.) For its part, the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion, not $55 billion.

“It all began in 2009 with what has become known as President Obama’s global ‘Apology Tour.’”

Trump resurrects an old — and discredited — Republican talking point. His prepared text even cited an April 2009 article written by Karl Rove as its source. As we demonstrated more than five years ago, Rove took Obama’s quotes out of context and twisted their meaning in order to build a tendentious case. The whole notion of an Obama apology tour was a fiction from the start — and was worthy of Four Pinocchios.

“The failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clinton’s disaster in Libya. President Obama has since said he regards Libya as his worst mistake.”

First of all, Trump was a fervent advocate of intervening in Libya. On a video uncovered by BuzzFeed, Trump declared in 2011: “Gaddafi in Libya is killing thousands of people. Nobody knows how bad it is, and we’re sitting around. We have soldiers all over the Middle East, and we’re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage, and that’s what it is: It’s a carnage …. Now, we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick.”

Second, Trump misquotes Obama. In the quote cited by the Trump campaign, Obama said that intervening was “the right thing to do.” What he regretted as his worst mistake was failing to plan for “the day after.”

“I was an opponent of the Iraq War from the beginning — a major difference between me and my opponent.”

What will it take for Trump to just admit that he had supported the Iraq invasion before he opposed it, after the invasion already took place? This is yet another Four Pinocchio claim.

There is no sign that Trump made headlines about his vocal Iraq War stance in 2003, nor that Trump clearly opposed the Iraq War prior to the invasion. We compiled a complete timeline of his comments leading up to the invasion and found that his comments were not “loud,” “clear” nor in “headlines” as he repeatedly claimed on the campaign trail.

Yet Trump continues to use this line, even though numerous news outlets have debunked it. This time, Trump cherry-picked his own quote to back up his claim: “Three months before the invasion, I said in an interview with Neil Cavuto … that perhaps we shouldn’t be doing it yet. And that the economy is a much bigger problem.”

Advertisement

He was referring to a January 2003 interview on Fox Business, about two months before the invasion. During it, Trump gave a lukewarm reaction to the Iraq invasion and urged then-President George W. Bush to make a decision. Below is the context for that claim. As readers can see, Trump did not weigh in on whether the United States should attack or not (“either you attack or you don’t attack”).

Cavuto: If you had to sort of break down for the president, if you were advising him, how much time do you commit to Iraq versus how much time you commit to the economy, what would you say?

Trump: Well, I’m starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy. They are getting a little bit tired of hearing, we’re going in, we’re not going in, the — you know, whatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur. He would go and attack. He wouldn’t talk. We have to — you know, it’s sort like either do it or don’t do it. When I watch Dan Rather explaining how we are going to be attacking, where we’re going to attack, what routes we’re taking, what kind of planes we’re using, how to stop them, how to stop us, it is a little bit disconcerting. I’ve never seen this, where newscasters are telling you how — telling the enemy how we’re going about it, we have just found out this and that. It is ridiculous.

Cavuto: Well, the problem right there.

Trump: Either you attack or you don’t attack.

Cavuto: The problem there, Donald, is you’re watching Dan Rather. Maybe you should just be watching Fox.

Trump: Well, no, I watch Dan Rather, but not necessarily fondly. But I happened to see it the other night. And I must tell you it was rather amazing as they were explaining the different — I don’t know if it is fact or if it is fiction, but the concept of a newscaster talking about the routes is — just seems ridiculous. So the point is either you do it or you don’t do it, or you — but I just — or if you don’t do it, just don’t talk about it. When you do it, you start talking about it.

Cavuto: So you’re saying the leash on this is getting kind of short here, that the president has got to do something presumably sooner rather than later and stringing this along could ultimately hurt us.

Trump: Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn’t be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He’s under a lot of pressure. He’s — I think he’s doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.

“In August of 2004, very early, right after the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine in an interview [opposing the invasion].”

Trump clearly was outspoken about his opposition to the Iraq War starting in 2004, the year he reportedly considered a presidential bid. (Instead, he launched his popular TV series, “The Apprentice.”) Trump did sharply criticize the war in Iraq in the August 2004 cover story of Esquire magazine. But this was nearly 18 months after the invasion in March 2003.

Trump also has pointed several times to a July 2004 Reuters article as proof he opposed the war from the outset. The Reuters article is a preview of the August 2004 Esquire cover story. Somehow, in Trump’s mind, 2004 has turned into 2003, and Trump now says he “was against the war from the very beginning,” even prior to the March 2003 invasion.

“But I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out.”

Trump criticizes the 2011 withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq, saying Obama “got us out the wrong way.” But Trump supported rapid withdrawal as early as March 2007, saying the United States should “declare victory and leave.” So once again Trump criticizes Obama and Clinton for taking action he advocated.

“I have long said that we should have kept the oil in Iraq.”

This is nonsensical. The Bush administration invested a lot of diplomatic effort in assuring Middle Eastern allies that the United States was not invading because of Iraq’s oil fields. Moreover, oil revenue was crucial to ensuring a functioning Iraqi state — which is why insurgents often targeted the oil sector in Iraq.

In any event, seizing the oil of a sovereign nation after invading it would be considered a “grave breach” of the Geneva Conventions, one of the cornerstones of international law, as well as other international agreements. Maybe Trump’s staff should arrange a tutorial on international law.

“I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats.”

NATO has disputed Trump’s repeated claim that NATO created a new assistant secretary general for intelligence because of his critique. “There’s no connection to any national election campaign,” NATO said, noting that the post had been under consideration several years before Trump began saying the organization was obsolete. NATO first committed to increased counterterrorism activities at a summit in Wales in 2012.

“Unlike Hillary Clinton, who has risked so many lives with her careless handling of sensitive information, my administration will not telegraph exactly military plans and what they are.”

Tellingly, Trump’s prepared text offered no footnote for this claim. There is little evidence that Clinton disclosed military plans through use of a private email server for State Department communications.

There indeed was sensitive information in Clinton’s emails, as the FBI found in its investigation into her use of her private server. Some of the emails were in reference to specific drone strikes being planned, the Wall Street Journal reported. But Trump exaggerates to say they “telegraph exactly military plans and what they are.”

Rather, these were vaguely worded emails forwarded by Clinton’s aides to her private email account. The Journal reported that the emails “were written within the often-narrow time frame in which State Department officials had to decide whether or not to object to drone strikes before the CIA pulled the trigger, officials said. Law-enforcement and intelligence officials said State Department deliberations about the covert CIA drone program should have been conducted over a more secure government computer system designed to handle classified information.”

“We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year.”

Trump overstates the figure here. The number of people seeking lawful permanent resident status (“a green card”) adds up to about 76,000 people if you include the Arab countries in the Levant, Persian Gulf and North Africa, according to 2014 Department of Homeland Security figures.

You get to around 100,000 only by including Afghanistan and Pakistan, which of course are outside the traditional “Middle East.” Other Muslim countries, such as Indonesia (2,139) and Somalia (5,190), do not significantly add to the total.

“The United States subcommittee on Immigration estimates that Hillary Clinton’s plan would mean roughly 620,000 refugees from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term, assuming no cuts to other refugee programs.”

This figure stems from the unverified assumption that Clinton, who has called for 55,000 additional refugees from Syria, would continue at that pace for every year of her first term, on top of the Obama administration’s proposal for 100,000 refugees for fiscal year 2017. The committee then multiples 155,000 times four years to reach 620,000 refugees. Clinton has never proposed such a “plan,” so this is an invented figure. Clinton only has proposed an increase of 55,000 refugees for one year.

“A neighbor saw suspicious behavior. Bombs on the floor and other things, but didn’t warn authorities because they said they didn’t want to be accused of racial profiling.”

There is no evidence this was the case. There have been unconfirmed second- or third-hand reports — a friend of a friend of a neighbor — that a neighbor claimed to have noticed suspicious activity but did not report anything for fear of doing racial profiling. The religion of this supposed neighbor is unknown, but presumably a fear of racial profiling would suggest the neighbor was not Muslim.

Trump ad-libbed the phrase about “bombs on the floor.” Even the secondhand reports don’t suggest a neighbor saw “bombs on the floor” — just that they received numerous packages at their home and were in their garage late at night.

The decision comes amid mounting criticism of how the foundation operated during her tenure as secretary of state, potentially allowing donors to seek special access through her government post.

Former president Bill Clinton also announced to staff Thursday that the final meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative would be held in September in New York City, regardless of the outcome of the election.

A spokesman for the foundation confirmed the decisions, which were first reported by the Associated Press.

The moves also come amid new allegations that foundation donors may have been given favored access while Hillary Clinton ran the State Department. Republican nominee Donald Trump has been highly critical of the foundation for accepting money from foreign governments — in particular Saudi Arabia, saying the contributions undermine Clinton’s record on women’s rights.

CGI, launched in 2005, is an arm of the foundation that hosts gatherings bringing together government leaders, private companies and not-for-profit organizations to discuss ways to solve the world’s problems.

The initiative’s chief event is an annual meeting in New York City, tied to the United Nations General Assembly. The meetings provide networking opportunities for participants and a forum for private companies to make pledges to conduct charitable projects around the world, monitored by the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons have long acknowledged that significant changes would need to be made to the foundation in the event that she is elected.

“There’ll clearly be some changes in what the Clinton Foundation does and how we do it, and we’ll just have to cross that bridge when we come to it,” Bill Clinton said at a CGI event in Atlanta in June.

According to a newly released batch of emails obtained by the conservative group Judicial Watch through a public records lawsuit, a foundation aide asked State Department staff to arrange a meeting on behalf of a foundation donor, a wealthy Ni­ger­ian businessman of Lebanese descent who had donated between $1 million and $5 million, according to disclosure reports.

The official said that he never connected with the businessman and denied that anyone had asked him to meet with the man.

Following the release last week, Trump accused Clinton of breaking the law and engaging in “pay to play” practices.

Trump and his family members have donated to the foundation in the past. When asked about it on the campaign trail, he has said that he regrets doing so, accusing the foundation of mismanaging its finances.

The Boston Globe’s editorial board called on the Clintons this week to shutter the foundation if she became president, saying it would pose an unacceptable conflict, given that some donors were foreign governments and corporations.

""The inherent conflict of interest was obvious when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009,"" the Globe wrote. ""She promised to maintain a separation between her official work and the foundation, but recently released emails written by staffers during her State Department tenure make clear that the supposed partition was far from impregnable.""

The sentiment was echoed by Clinton ally and former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell in a recent interview with the New York Daily News.

“It’d be impossible to keep the foundation open without at least the appearance of a problem,” Rendell said.

The foundation, which was renamed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation after Hillary Clinton left the State Department, has operated since 1997 and expanded in subsequent years into an international charity. It has never previously restricted contributions from foreign citizens and companies or domestic corporations.

After Hillary Clinton launched her presidential campaign in 2015, she stepped down from the board, and the foundation promised to disclose its donors more frequently and limit foreign governments that could donate to a select list engaged in particular projects.

The foundation had also put in place certain restrictions on accepting donations from foreign governments while Clinton was secretary of state. It said it would seek State Department approval for any new foreign government donations or any substantial increase in donations from a preexisting government donor. But the rules did not prevent the foundation from accepting millions of dollars in foreign government donations while she was in office.

A 2015 Washington Post report also revealed a government donation that was not properly submitted to the State Department for approval.

According to a 2015 Post analysis of foundation donors, a third of contributors who had given more than $1 million were foreign governments or other entities based outside the United States."

http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/22/politics/donald-trump-clinton-foundation-shut-down/index.html",0,"A sports executive who was a major donor to the Clinton Foundation and whose firm paid Bill Clinton millions of dollars in consulting fees wanted help getting a visa for a British soccer player with a criminal past. The crown prince of Bahrain, whose government gave more than $50,000 to the Clintons’ charity and who participated in its glitzy annual conference, wanted a last-minute meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

U2 rocker and philanthropist Bono, also a regular at foundation events, wanted high-level help broadcasting a live link to the International Space Station during concerts.

In each case, according to emails released Monday from Hillary Clinton’s time as secretary of state, the requests were directed to Clinton’s deputy chief of staff and confidante, Huma Abedin, who engaged with other top aides and sometimes Clinton herself about how to respond.

The emails show that, in these and similar cases, the donors did not always get what they wanted, particularly when they sought anything more than a meeting.

But the exchanges, among 725 pages of correspondence from Abedin disclosed as part of a lawsuit by the conservative group Judicial Watch, illustrate the way the Clintons’ international network of friends and donors was able to get access to Hillary Clinton and her inner circle during her tenure running the State Department.

The release of the correspondence follows previous disclosures of internal emails showing a similar pattern of access for foundation contributors, and it comes as Republicans allege that Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, used her perch in the Obama administration to trade favors for donations. Clinton and the foundation have vigorously denied the charge.

The disclosures also cast new doubts on Clinton’s past claim that she turned over all her work-related email from her private server to the State Department for eventual release to the public.

Judicial Watch said Monday’s release from Abedin’s inbox included 20 previously undisclosed exchanges with Clinton that were not included in the approximately 55,000 pages of correspondence the former secretary gave to State. Also Monday, the State Department said the FBI had turned over nearly 15,000 emails and other documents that investigators discovered during a probe of Clinton’s email setup that she had not previously returned to State.

Clinton has said about 30,000 personal emails were deleted from the server. The FBI batch includes emails and attachments that were sent directly to or from Clinton, or that were part of email chains.

FBI Director James B. Comey has said there is no evidence that emails were purposefully deleted with an intent to conceal them, and a State Department spokesman said Monday that some of the records included emails that were purely personal.

It is not clear when the documents discovered by the FBI will become public, but attorneys for the State Department and Judicial Watch are negotiating a release that is likely to begin before the election and continue long after.

Josh Schwerin, a Clinton campaign spokesman, said in a statement Monday that Judicial Watch is a “right-wing organization that has been going after the Clintons since the 1990s” and that the group is “distorting facts to make utterly false attacks.”

“No matter how this group tries to mischaracterize these documents, the fact remains that Hillary Clinton never took action as Secretary of State because of donations to the Clinton Foundation,” he said.

State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Monday that there is “no clear sign” donors received access for their contributions.

The emails released Monday showed how requests from donors would often come through Doug Band, a longtime Bill Clinton aide who helped create the foundation, with Abedin as a primary point of contact. Band declined to comment on the newly released emails, and attorneys for Abedin did not respond to a request for comment.

There is no indication from the emails that Abedin intervened on behalf of Casey Wasserman, an L.A. sports executive who in 2009 asked Band for help getting a visa for a British soccer star trying to visit Las Vegas. Band indicated that the office of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) had already declined to help, given the player’s criminal record. A Boxer spokesman described the request to her office as “routine” but one with that Boxer did not assist, “given the facts of the case.”

“Makes me nervous to get involved but I’ll ask,” Abedin wrote to Band in May 2009 after he forwarded to her an email from Wasserman.

Band responded: “then dont.”

Share this article Share

Wasserman’s charitable foundation has given the Clinton Foundation between $5 million and $10 million. In 2009 and 2010, his investment company paid Bill Clinton $3.13 million in consulting fees.

A spokeswoman for Wasserman said the businessman never contacted Bill Clinton on the matter and the visa was never granted.

Band and Abedin also responded dismissively when asked if they had any ideas on how to help Bono get his space station transmission: ""No clue,"" they each responded in turn.

The appeal appears to have had more success in the case of Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, the crown prince of Bahrain. In June 2009, Band emailed Abedin that the prince would be in Washington for two days and was seeking a meeting with Hillary Clinton. “Good friend of ours,” he added.

Abedin responded that the prince had already requested a meeting “through normal channels” but that Clinton had been hesitant to commit. Two days later, Abedin followed up with Band to let him know that a meeting with the prince had been set. “If u see him, let him know. We have reached out thru official channels,” she wrote to Band.

Bahrain has a spotty human rights record but full relations with the U.S. government.

In a statement, the court of the crown prince said his participation at a 2005 foundation event “happened years before and was wholly unrelated to any meeting with Secretary Clinton,” adding that the prince is deputy head of state of an American ally and so he often meets with U.S. officials.

The new disclosures come as the Clinton Foundation and its international network of powerful donors have returned to the forefront of the presidential campaign.

On Monday, Bill Clinton sent an email to foundation staff and supporters outlining new steps and offering a defense of the foundation’s accomplishments. He wrote that the foundation would stop accepting corporate and foreign donations if Hillary Clinton was elected and that he would step down from the charity’s board, along with the board of a related Boston-based health organization. While he said his role would change, “the work itself should continue because so many people are committed to it and so many more are relying on it.”

The announcements did little to quell Republican attacks. The GOP nominee, Donald Trump, on Monday called for the foundation to be shut down altogether, describing the charity as “the most corrupt enterprise in political history.”

The newly released emails underscored the central role played by Abedin, a top adviser to Clinton’s campaign who has been working for her since Clinton’s time as first lady.

When S. Daniel Abraham, a major Democratic donor who had also given to the foundation, was visiting Washington in May 2009 and wanted to see Clinton, the emails showed that he placed a call to Abedin. “Do u want me to try and fit him in tomorrow?” Abedin emailed Clinton, who appeared to indicate in her response that she was willing to make time.

Abraham said in an interview Monday that he talked with Clinton about the Middle East and that his status as a donor had nothing to do with his ability to secure time with the secretary.

“It was about the issue that I have worked hard on for many, many years, Israeli-Palestinian peace,” he said. “I have been friendly with the Clintons since their White House days. As far as I am concerned it was all good. She never asked me for anything.”

Longtime Clinton friend and fundraiser Maureen White wrote Abedin in July 2009, saying that she would be in Washington three days later. “Would she have any time to spare?” White wrote.

“Yes I’ll make it work,” Abedin responded.

White went on to serve in the State Department under Clinton. White said she and her husband, Steven Rattner, gave $31,000 to the foundation before 2009 and $25,000 to the foundation in 2012. White said that she did not remember the specific exchange but that she has met often with Clinton as a longtime supporter and has worked on refugee and humanitarian issues in several capacities in and out of government.

“Usually when I told Huma I wanted to meet with Hillary Clinton, Huma made it happen,” White said.

In another email exchange, Democratic donor and activist Joyce Aboussie of St. Louis wrote to Abedin requesting a meeting between Clinton and a top executive of St. Louis-based Peabody Energy, one of the world’s largest coal producers.

“Huma, I need your help now to intervene please,” Aboussie wrote in June 2009. “We need this meeting with Secretary Clinton, who has been there now for nearly six months. This is, by the way, my first request.”

Abedin responded: “We are working on it and I hope we can make something work . . . we have to work through the beauracracy [sic] here.”"

He was the punch line. “This is a crazy election,” Johnson said, looking out at dozens of Mainers who had come out for a breakfast meet-and-greet. “You know how crazy this election is? I’m going to be the next president of the United States. That’s how crazy!”

Johnson, a two-term governor of New Mexico, has avoided the fringe label that often sticks to third-party candidates. Since announcing former Massachusetts governor William Weld as his running mate, Johnson has risen in the polls to the high single digits — and to the mid-teens in some swing states. His rallies draw hundreds of voters, bigger than anything he saw during his 2012 bid. He talks about “spoiling the party,” and voters cheer.

Despite that, Johnson is struggling to grab the prize he has eyed all year: to be invited to the televised presidential debates. He needs to close in on 15 percent in an average of polls, and he is doing what he can. Two super PACs are trying to boost him in. It’s not clear that they can pull it off.

U.S. politics has favored candidates from the Democrat and Republican parties, but here are seven examples of candidates who ran under a different mantle (Video: Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)

The support Johnson has so far is easily explained; in a year of not one, but two historically unpopular major-party candidates, voters are looking for an alternative to Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Johnson may hold particular appeal for Republicans trying to protect their majorities in Congress; he gives voters an alternative to Trump at the top of the ticket yet allows them to return to the GOP lineup down the ballot.

Relentlessly positive, bounding from event to event in black Nikes and Carhartt jeans, Johnson approaches the debate problem by talking like he has solved it. In 2012, he briefly ran as a Republican — the party he was part of in Santa Fe — and was yanked offstage after a first, flailing debate performance.

“I had 60 seconds to make my pitch, and in the 60 seconds, I was being interrupted,” Johnson said in an interview here. “Now, I can say the same thing — and I’ve got three minutes. Uninterrupted! Three people onstage, audience bigger than the Super Bowl. I don’t think they’d get away with cutting me.”

They might. The Commission on Presidential Debates, which has controlled the process since 1988, has held fast to its 15 percent threshold. A Johnson-backed lawsuit against that threshold was thrown out this month, however, and the voters filing into Johnson-Weld rallies last week were acutely aware that their man might be kept offstage.

“I’m not for either of the choices­ we have right now,” said Roy Hermann, 65, who caucused for Bernie Sanders but showed up in Portland to hear Johnson. “I’m not even sure if I’ll vote for this guy, but I have a great deal of respect for him.”

The day before, at a Johnson-Weld rally in Concord, N.H., 14-year-old Aubrey Pelletier hoisted a sign that read “15%!” Her father, Brad, 39, worried that too many voters limit the news they read and couldn’t see the point of choosing Johnson.

“People are afraid of wasting their votes,” he surmised. “On Facebook, I see Gary Johnson stuff all the time. When I talk to people, they know who he is now.”

As Johnson and Weld stumped across New England, they were recognized by voters — something new in the past three weeks, they said. Fundraising, according to the campaign, has surged in the same period.

Neither Republicans nor Democrats know which nominee that helps. The polls that show Johnson at or above 10 percent have Clinton’s lead growing if he is removed as a choice — but she has got a lead either way. At rallies in New Hampshire and Maine, voters with Bernie Sanders T-shirts stood near people wearing the “Hillary for Prison” shirts sold by far-right radio host Alex Jones. Some cheer when Johnson calls for ending corporate taxes; some cheer when he insists that “black lives matter.” All cheer when he endorses ballot measures to legalize marijuana.

Asked whether he would encourage his voters to pick Republicans or Democrats when they went down their ballot, Johnson demurred. “The wonderful thing about being a Libertarian is that you don’t have to tell anybody to do anything,” he said.

Two libertarian efforts are underway to boost Johnson past the debate commission’s 15-percent hurdle. Purple PAC, steered by former Cato Institute president Ed Crane, began a $1 million ad buy last week, with cable spots casting Johnson as an “honorable choice” who favors tolerance and free markets.

“They’re not as ideological as I would probably prefer,” Crane said of Johnson and Weld. “But on the broad issues of social tolerance, restraint in foreign policy, markets over crony capitalism, they’re very good.”

Share this article Share

Alternative PAC, launched by former FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe, is spending $50,000 to kick-start a Web campaign aimed at millennials. One ad, “Balanced Rebellion,” stars an Abraham Lincoln impersonator who promises that Johnson won’t “send you to fight wars overseas” or “tell you who to marry.”

“It’s like a two-horse race where one horse cheats and the other one eats Muslims,” the Lincoln actor says of the Clinton-Trump race.

The spot was designed by Harmon Brothers, the firm behind a viral ad in which unicorns defecate rainbow ice cream to promote a toilet aid.

Johnson is more tactful. In his campaign speech, an optimistic spiel on how free markets (“Uber everything”) and active citizens can fix the country, he tells one joke about Trump. The Republican nominee, he said, watched the Olympics to see “how high those Mexican pole vaulters could go.” Neither Johnson nor Weld is inclined to attack Clinton, something they have been trying to correct.

“You make mistakes along the trail,” Johnson said in Concord, referring to a CNN town hall — one of his highest-profile events — where he declined to criticize Clinton. “If I had to do that over again, I’d have said: She’s beholden.”

“I’ve made a mini-career of defending Mrs. Clinton on the use of the private server,” said Weld, who added that newer revelations about her email gave him pause.

That light tone has become central to the Johnson-Weld campaign. The two standard-bearers for libertarianism have become some of the least ideological candidates in America.

On the stump, Weld describes the Libertarian Party as “a six-lane highway going right up the middle between the two parties,” and Johnson talks about what can be achieved when partisans cross the aisle.

That has led to steady criticism from more traditional libertarians, who pounce on every Johnson or Weld sop to the center as a gaffe. Weld, who signed a gun-control bill as governor, struggled to win the Libertarian vice-presidential nomination. Jason Sorens, the founder of the Free State Project that encourages libertarians to move to New Hampshire, said he had seen “some demobilization of the LP ticket’s natural base over guns.”

After Johnson refused to rule out a tax on carbon — only if it were revenue-neutral and it replaced income taxes — he was criticized by libertarians on social media.

Crane, Kibbe and other libertarians knew some of this was coming. The Republican primary campaign of Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), designed to build on the support of father Ron Paul’s three ­libertarian-flavored presidential bids, made a bid for conservative voters that put the base to sleep.

“I’m still on the fence about whether I’m going to cast a write-in vote for ‘none of the above’ or myself,” said Darryl Perry, a New Hampshire voter who ran against Johnson for the Libertarian presidential nomination. “I know a few [people] who have said, ‘Well, he’s the lesser of the evils.’ The lesser evil is still evil in my eyes.”

But the dazzling possibility of the debate invite — something no Libertarian candidate has ever achieved — has kept most fellow travelers on board. Dan Fishman, the campaign’s 48-year-old New England director, has walked away from each rally with pages of new sign-ups. “It’s getting easier and easier to train people,” he said, crediting the NationBuilder software that had helped the Trump campaign convert its ­giant crowds into volunteers.

At one rally, in Concord, close to 300 people stood in a steady and meteorology-defying rain to hear Weld and Johnson speak about the six-lane highway between the parties."
3420,3420,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/09/01/fact-checking-donald-trumps-immigration-speech/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_factchecker-1245am%3Ahomepage/story
http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-immigration-address-227616",0,"Donald Trump gave his long-awaited speech on immigration in Phoenix on Aug. 31. Here’s a roundup of some of the more interesting claims he made in the lengthy address; we expect we will dig deeper into some of his other statistics in the coming days. As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios in speech roundups.

“Illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. And this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher.”

Trump states this $113 billion figure as an undisputed fact, but it comes from a report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks to dramatically reduce legal immigration. So you immediately have to look at the numbers with skepticism.

Digging into the numbers, you see that burden on the federal budget is estimated to be just $29 billion, whereas $84 billion is supposedly borne by state and local governments. Why is that? The group counts the cost of educating the children of illegal immigrants, even if they are born in the United States and, thus, are U.S. citizens. “The birth of these children and their subsequent medical care represent a large share of the estimated Medicaid and Child Health Insurance Program expenditures associated with illegal aliens,” the report says.

The report, however, says it tries to account for the taxes collected by federal and local governments from illegal immigrants, but the services used by undocumented immigrants outweigh revenue collections. (Taking into account tax revenues, FAIR says the net cost is about $99 billion.) We should note that because the federal government is currently running a deficit, U.S. citizens also receive more in government benefits than they pay in taxes.

“Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.”

Trump falsely says Clinton’s plan will provide Social Security to illegal immigrants. We awarded this claim Four Pinocchios. In general, people in the United States illegally are not eligible to collect Social Security benefits. They must be granted some type of lawful status — either by obtaining legal status or being granted deferred action.

Even those who are granted deferred action through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) are not granted benefits through the Affordable Care Act. They are, however, eligible for Social Security retirement and Medicare benefits with 10 years of work history, after paying income taxes, and once they reach retirement age.

Clinton supports “comprehensive immigration reform” and has vowed that within her first 100 days in office, she will introduce a plan to overhaul the immigration system with a pathway to full citizenship (which Trump calls “amnesty”). Clinton also supports President Obama’s executive actions on DACA and DAPA. DAPA is pending in court under litigation, and DACA went into effect in 2012.

Clinton does support expanding Obamacare to all families, regardless of immigration status and allowing them to buy into the health exchanges, according to her immigration proposal.

But DACA grantees will not yet reach retirement age if Clinton becomes president and serves two terms in office. DACA grantees must have been under 31 as of June 15, 2012, and meet several other criteria to be eligible. So if Clinton serves two terms and leaves office in 2025, the oldest DACA grantees would be 43.

Trump says her plan would break the federal budget, but the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the immigration reform component of Clinton’s plan would save the federal budget $100 billion over 10 years.

“This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time.”

Trump has used this number before, but it stems from the unverified assumption that Clinton, who has called for 55,000 additional refugees from Syria, would continue at that pace for every year of her first term, on top of the Obama administration’s proposal for 100,000 refugees for fiscal year 2017. Trump then multiplies 155,000 times four years to reach 620,000 refugees. Clinton has never proposed such a “plan,” so this is an invented figure. Clinton only has proposed an increase of 55,000 refugees for one year.

“We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don’t even know about.”

Trump lauded these two Department of Homeland Security programs, but both have been widely scrutinized and it’s questionable how effective they are.

DHS targeted immigration enforcement to those who committed serious crimes through efforts like Secure Communities, rolled out per county from 2008 through 2012. But a 2014 study showed that increased enforcement didn’t lead to decreased crime, calling into question whether serious crimes were prevalent.

Secure Communities was billed as a crackdown on immigrants who committed serious crimes. But researchers found Secure Communities did not result in a meaningful reduction in the FBI’s overall index crime rate or in rates of violent crimes. There were modest reductions in burglary and motor vehicle theft, not serious crimes like homicides or violent crime.

The program is being phased out, as local agencies are ending or scaling back their participation. Secure Communities was meant to be a complement to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program, through which ICE gave authority to certain state and local law enforcement officers to carry out the functions of federal immigration agents.

The 287(g) program was scrutinized by immigration advocates for diverting local resources to do federal enforcement work, and the potential for racial profiling, without proper federal oversight.

In fact, local law enforcement officers carrying out immigration enforcement under 287(g) authority led to a federal racial profiling case against Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, a Trump surrogate who delivered one of the opening speeches Wednesday night. The Department of Justice found that the sheriff’s office engaged in systemic racial profiling of Latinos. DHS removed the 287(g) authority of Arpaio’s agency, and a federal judge imposed changes.

“It’s always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.”

Trump says the number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States — which is estimated at 11 million — could be anywhere between 3 million or 30 million. A number of independent organizations researching immigrant flows and the federal government have arrived at the 11 million estimate for the population of undocumented immigrants, using calculations of Census data.

Our friends at PolitiFact and FactCheck.org have found Trump’s 30 million figure to be bogus. A range of experts who study this issue say the margin of error for the 11 million figure may be plus or minus 1 million, but no serious research supports Trump’s claim it could be as high as 30 million.

“For instance, in the last five years, we’ve admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries, according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified.”

Actually, between 2009 and 2014, the United States has admitted 120,000 immigrants from Iraq and 18,000 from Afghanistan, according to Department of Homeland Security statistics. So this is a rare case where Trump lowballs a number. (Oops! In our bleary-eyed state, we counted six years. From 2010 to 2014, the combined figure was about 108,000.)

It goes without saying that the United States has fought two long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In fact, special visa programs were enacted by Congress to expedite the processing of Afghans and Iraqis who worked for the U.S. government.

Trump correctly cites a Pew Research study that surveyed attitudes in various Muslim countries. “In only two countries — Afghanistan (60%) and Iraq (60%) — do majorities say honor killings of women are often or sometimes justified, while only in Afghanistan does a majority (59%) say the same about executing men who have allegedly engaged in pre- or extra-marital sex,” the report said.

President Obama and Hillary Clinton “support visa overstays.”

The Department of Homeland Security has a visa overstay identification process. According to DHS, there were nearly 45 million nonimmigrant visitors in fiscal 2015, with an overstay rate of 1.17 percent, or 525,127 people. That was the first time DHS provided an estimate of foreign visitors who overstayed.

But the Obama administration — and previously, the Bush administration — has been criticized by Congress, law enforcement officials and advocates for failing to fix loopholes in the visa program.

Clinton’s immigration proposal does not address visa overstays. The only mention of visa issues in her proposal is to “fix the family visa backlog,” but it does not offer any specifics. According to the pro-immigrant group National Immigration Forum, there is an administrative backlog of processing visas for spouses, children and parents of U.S. citizens. Clinton has said her “comprehensive immigration reform” proposal with a pathway to citizenship would fix the family visa backlog.

“There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they’ve been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won’t take them back.”

Trump is right about this, according to a letter written by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who in June 2016 urged the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department to stop granting visas to countries that refuse to accept the deportation of their own citizens. The letter said such action has been taken only once, against Ghana in 2001. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) has said he would seek legislation that would sanction countries that refuse to take back their nationals.

The Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that the United States can hold convicted criminals for only six months in detention if a country refuses to accept them. More than 100 immigrants released from detention have later been charged in homicides.

“Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced.”

Trump likes to use anecdotes as evidence for associating violent crimes with illegal immigration, telling stories of victims of homicide by undocumented immigrants. He often talks about the deaths of Jamiel Shaw, Kate Steinle and Sarah Root, all killed by people in the country illegally.

Clearly, stories like this exist. But as we’ve noted numerous times, there are two important data points to remember when Trump talks about this.

First, the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants do not fit Trump’s description of aggravated felons, whose crimes include murder. U.S. Sentencing Commission data shows homicides are a small percentage of the crimes committed by noncitizens, whether they are in the United States illegally or not.

Second, illegal immigration flows across the Southern border in fiscal 2015 were at the lowest levels since 1972, except for in 2011. Earlier this year, there were upticks in border apprehensions of unaccompanied children and their families, compared to 2015. The apprehensions in fiscal 2016 so far have exceeded fiscal 2015, but still indicate an overall decline.

“A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.”

The figure is correct, but this is misleading and lacks context. The 2011 Government Accountability Office report Trump cites collected reports from 2003 to 2009 to the Department of Justice’s State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, through which states and localities get reimbursed for convicting and incarcerating inmates of illegal or unknown immigration status (mainly from Mexico).

The study looked at five states (Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas) with the largest populations of such inmates. There were 25,064 homicide arrests for this population, but it comprised 1 percent of the 2.9 million arrests they tracked in the study. About 50 percent of the arrests were related to immigration, drugs or traffic violations.

Inmate legal status is not always tracked at local jails and state prisons. This report includes both people who are known to be in the United States illegally, and those who states and local jurisdictions believe are present illegally but whose status can’t be confirmed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Republican presidential nominee said that an alliance with Russia would help defeat the Islamic State, and when asked to defend some of Putin’s aggressions on the world stage, he asked, “Do you want me to start naming some of the things Obama does at the same time?”

Trump also said he appreciated some of the kind words Putin has had for him. “Well, I think when he calls me brilliant, I think I’ll take the compliment, okay?”

Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton made back-to-back appearances at an event that sounded the starting gun for the final stretch of the presidential race and offered a potential preview of what are expected to be rollicking debates in the weeks to come.

Clinton offered herself as a model of “absolute rock steadiness” on foreign policy, and Trump promised to be a disruptive force for improvement, saying that under Obama even the military’s generals have been “reduced to rubble.” Trump suggested he could replace some of the military brass.

Clinton appeared guarded, even stilted, as she navigated tough questions about her use of a private email server as secretary of state and her vote for the Iraq war in the Senate, but Trump showed no such restraint with a series of controversial statements.

He reaffirmed his view that having men and women serve alongside one another is the root of the military’s sexual-assault problem. He said recent intelligence briefings have convinced him that Clinton and other Obama administration officials did not heed the advice of experts. And he praised Putin, noting among other things the Russian president’s “82 percent approval rating.”

Ahead of Wednesday’s forum, Trump delivered a speech in Philadelphia in which he called for a robust expansion of U.S. military capabilities and an end to budget sequestration on defense spending.

“As soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military. It is so depleted. We will rebuild our military,” Trump said during the speech at the Union League of Philadelphia. “This will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs.”

Trump’s address represented his most substantive and comprehensive plan on national security to date — part of an ongoing effort to assuage doubts that he lacks a sufficient understanding of policy issues to assume the presidency. Reading from prepared remarks, Trump spoke about modernizing the ­military’s equipment and increasing the size of the armed forces.

Clinton, who has also advocated ending the defense sequester, spent the earlier part of her segment of the forum defending herself regarding the email controversy and her handling of classified material, which she insisted she did responsibly.

And she acknowledged that her vote as a senator from New York to authorize the use of military force in Iraq was a mistake. But Clinton said she had learned from the decision and chided Trump for saying he had opposed the war from the outset despite statements to the contrary.

“I have taken responsibility for my decision,” Clinton said. “He refuses to take responsible for his support.”

The forum, broadcast by MSNBC and NBC stations and hosted by Matt Lauer of the “Today” show, was billed as a discussion of the most important issues facing the nation’s next commander in chief. Clinton and Trump appeared separately before a live audience of active-duty military personnel and veterans — a group that traditionally skews Republican — at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. The event was hosted by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.

The forum was scheduled ahead of three standard debates between the two major-party presidential nominees, the first of which is scheduled for Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y.

Clinton and Trump were asked early in their segments not to attack each other — and both drew admonishments from Lauer for ignoring his request.

Clinton, for example, chided Trump for proposing a ban on Muslims entering the country, saying, “That is not going to help us succeed in defeating ISIS.”

And Trump accused Clinton of having a “happy trigger,” a suggestion that she is too eager to insert the United States into international conflicts.

The United States’s involvement in Iraq was a prominent part of both segments.

Clinton argued that the war was one area where she and Trump shared positions. “I think that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake, and I have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was, from my perspective, my mistake,” Clinton said. “There was a mistake. My opponent was for the war in Iraq. He says he wasn’t; you can go back and look at the record. He supported it.”

Clinton vowed that, if she is elected president, “we are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again.”

As he has in the past, Trump insisted that he did not support President Bush’s invasion in 2003, despite evidence to the contrary.

The businessman also argued that taking Iraq’s oil would have prevented the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group in the Middle East.

“I’ve always said, shouldn’t be there, but if we’re going to get out, take the oil,” he said. “If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn’t have ISIS, because ISIS formed with the power and the wealth of that oil. “

During his segment, Trump also defended a Twitter message he posted three years ago that stated the estimated number of unreported sexual assaults in the military and then mused: “What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?”

“Well, it is, it is a correct tweet,” Trump said when asked about the tweet by Lauer. “There are many people that think that that’s absolutely correct. . . . Well, well, it’s happening, right? And, by the way, since then, it’s gotten worse.”

When asked what he had learned from his intelligence briefings since becoming the Republican nominee, Trump said that Obama and others have not done “what our experts said to do.”

“And I was very, very surprised,” he said. “In almost every instance, and I could tell, I’m pretty good with the body language. I could tell, they were not happy. Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending.”

Trump said he was not a fan of the Russian system of government but predicted continued good relations with Putin, saying: “I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Putin, and I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Russia.”

Trump denied that mutual admiration between him and the Russian leader would benefit Russia in its dealings with the United States. “It’s not going to get him anything,” Trump said. “I’m a negotiator.”

During her segment, Clinton defended her handling of classified information, insisting that she never sent or received any documents on her private email server that were properly marked as classified.

Clinton was pressed with questions on the issue almost as soon as the forum began.

“Classified material has a header that says ‘top secret,’ ‘secret,’ ‘confidential,’ ” Clinton said. “None of the emails sent or received by me had such a header.”

The issue has bedeviled her campaign from the start, and one of the questions about it came from a veteran, who noted that if he had handled classified information in a way that was not permitted, he would have been prosecuted and jailed.

“I communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system,” Clinton said. “I took it very seriously.”

A poll released Wednesday showed Trump with a sizable lead among active-duty personnel and veterans.

Trump leads Clinton by 19 points — 55 percent to 36 percent — among voters who are serving or have served in the U.S. military, according to the NBC News/SurveyMonkey tracking poll.

That’s a somewhat larger margin that two other recent national polls of military veterans since the Democratic convention. Trump led Clinton by 14 points in a Fox News poll and 11 points in a McClatchy-Marist poll.

The demographics of military veterans align closely with Trump’s strongest sources of support. More than 9 in 10 are men, and about 8 in 10 are white. In 2012, among military veterans, Republican Mitt Romney bested Obama by about 20 points, according to exit polls.

The run-up to Wednesday’s forum featured intense jockeying between Clinton and Trump over which candidate is better suited to lead the military — with each sharply questioning the other’s temperament and judgment. During a campaign stop Tuesday in Tampa, Clinton said Trump had “no clue” about national security issues.

Just minutes before the forum was to begin, Clinton tweeted, “Donald Trump has proven over and over again that he’s unfit to be our Commander-in-Chief.”

On Tuesday, Trump announced that he has been endorsed by 88 retired senior military officials. Not to be outdone, Clinton released a list Wednesday showing the support of 95 retired generals and admirals, more than any recent nonincumbent Democrat, her campaign said. Meanwhile, Clinton noted that Trump’s endorsement figure was more than 400 shy of the last Republican nominee, Mitt Romney."

The New York Times's Michael Barbaro sums up that sentiment. No. 1 rule of presidential politics. Okay to mock your opponent. Never a good idea to mock the electorate. — Michael Barbaro (@mikiebarb) September 10, 2016 But my summary above is not a fair condensation what Clinton said — and the fuller context makes it clear what she was aiming at.

""To just be grossly generalistic,"" Clinton said according to a transcript from BuzzFeed's Ruby Cramer, ""you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic — you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.""

She talked a bit about how Trump has interacted with that racist element and then continued. ""But the other basket — and I know this because I see friends from all over America here … but that other basket are people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures — they're just desperate for change. … Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well.""

Trump's campaign — and Trump himself — quickly tried to make hay from the first part.

But there are two ways in which this differs from something like President Obama's ""cling to guns and religion"" comments from another fundraiser in 2008.

The first is that the ""clingers"" remark disparaged something that was positive: a person's religion or their cultural affinity for gun ownership and sportsmanship. It was a dismissal of things of which people were proud. Clinton, however, was saying that half of Trump's base was motivated by negative inclinations: racism, sexism. No one is going to say, ""Hey, how dare you disparage my family's history of being racist.""

Trump's tweet said she insulted his supporters, but Clinton clearly delineated between two groups of supporters, and she offered words of understanding to the latter. So let's break the electorate out into four groups and consider how the comment will play.

Advertisement

1. Clinton supporters. They support Clinton; it seems unlikely they'll be put out.

Share this article Share

2. Racist/sexist/xenophobic/Islamophobic Trump supporters. How big a group is this? It's hard to say. Clinton's spokesman Nick Merrill tried to defend his boss's use of ""half"" by saying on Twitter that the racist/xenophobic types ""appear to make up half of his crowd"" at events. (Update: Clinton issued a statement on Saturday apologizing for implying it was ""half"" of Trump supporters.) We do know that 7 percent of Trump supporters think the candidate is racist, suggesting that they themselves don't see racism as a dealbreaker. Regardless of the actual fraction of the Trump base this group constitutes, Clinton's not likely to change their minds away from their preferred candidate, either.

3. Non-'deplorable' Trump supporters. This group will go one of two ways. They'll either a. see Clinton's remarks as insulting them as a whole, or b. be reminded that there are elements of Trump's base of support that makes them uncomfortable. That sense may spur them to be less enthusiastic to go vote for Trump in November.

Advertisement

But notice: Either way, there's no loss for Clinton! If she spurs some Trump supporters to reconsider, the loss is to Trump.

4. Undecided voters. They'll go one of two ways, too, it seems. Some may think Clinton was being rude and be less likely to support her. Some may similarly be reminded about elements of Trump's base that they don't like and be less likely to back him.

This is a much smaller group than the number of Trump backers, mind you. In the current RealClearPolitics average, Trump backers are about 43 percent of the electorate and undecided voters are about 12 percent. If Clinton sways 5 percent of the (let's say) 90 percent of Trump backers who aren't ""deplorables"" to rethink their support, that's 2 percent of the overall electorate. If she loses 10 percent of the undecideds, that's 1.2 percent of the electorate.

Advertisement

That's assuming the shorthand here doesn't collapse into ""Clinton insulted all Trump supporters."" This is the point that Barbaro was making. Clinton may have been trying, once again, to separate out non-racist/sexist/xenophobic Trump backers by pointing to those supporting Trump who do hold those objectively deplorable views. It's a tricky line to walk — but compared with ""clingers,"" for example, she's in a slightly better position."
3458,3458,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/22/blame-rumor-and-blood-run-in-charlotte-as-protests-surge-1-critically-wounded-4-cops-injured/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_no-name%3Ahomepage/story,0,"CHARLOTTE — Uproar over the fatal police shooting of a black man reached new levels of violence in protests that raged into early Thursday amid looting, street clashes and gunfire, including a demonstrator critically injured in what officials called a “civilian on civilian” shooting. The incident thrust an already tense night deeper into chaos as reports of the victim’s condition changed throughout the night and word spread among protesters that the victim may have been shot by police, which the police adamantly deny.

As protests swept through the city for a second night following the police killing of Keith Lamont Scott, protesters and police clashed outside the Omni Hotel in the city’s commercial hub.

Shortly after 8 p.m., as people marched through the EpiCentre entertainment complex, a group of riot officers entered the hotel lobby. When marchers tried to follow them, police fired tear gas canisters and rubber bullets to back them off. A shot rang out and a man collapsed to the sidewalk, bleeding profusely from a head injury.

“They killed him,” some protesters yelled as police scattered the crowd of several hundred. As demonstrators moved on to other parts of the city, some smashed the windows of businesses and set small fires in the street.

Before dawn Thursday, the protests had mostly cleared. Authorities, meanwhile, boosted their strength in anticipation that unrest could flare again. Local police were backed up by state troopers and National Guard units under a state of emergency declared by North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory.

Many businesses with offices in central Charlotte — including Wells Fargo and Bank of America, which is headquartered in the city — told employees to stay home Thursday. A message to Bank of America workers cited the “ongoing civil unrest” in the rare corporate order to stay away.

Police said they responded to a call for an assault with a deadly weapon at the scene at 8:31 p.m. and took a civilian suffering from an “apparent gunshot wound” to the Carolinas Medical Center. Officials initially said from the city’s official Twitter account that the victim had died, but later stated that the victim was in critical condition and on life support.

CORRECTION UPDATE: Civilian who suffered gunshot wound during protests is on life support, critical condition. Not deceased. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

4 officers injured during demonstration. All non- life threatening — CMPD News (@CMPD) September 22, 2016

Officials said the apparent shooting was “civilian on civilian.” But a police spokeswoman declined to comment on how they reached that conclusion, other than to say, “This is not an officer-involved shooting.”

Witness accounts of the incident differed widely from those offered by the city.

James Tyson, 31, said he was marching with protesters in front of the hotel when he heard a loud bang and saw a tall black man with dreadlocks fall to the ground. A certified Wilderness First Responder, Tyson said he was carrying first aid materials with him at the time and rushed over to help.

“There was blood on the ground and blood coming from his temple,” Tyson told The Washington Post. “Everybody thought he was dead.”

Tyson said he gave the man’s friends a gauze pad to press against the wound. About 10 minutes later, he said, a half-dozen medics in riot gear took the man away and police dispersed the crowd.

Tyson said the protest had been tense but not violent up to that point. He said police started firing rubber bullets at the crowd and that one of them might have hit the man in the head.

Share this article Share

“I heard no gunshot and I did not see any protesters with guns,” Tyson said. “I’m almost positive it was a rubber bullet.”

Police declined repeated requests to comment on the account from Tyson or other witnesses.

A group of clergy members who marched with the protesters Wednesday night offered a similar version of events.

In interviews with The Post, they said they saw no protesters with weapons and that the shot

— described by some as a gunshot and others as a loud bang — rang out from the direction of police. None of them actually saw police fire their weapons, they said, nor did they see a civilian shoot a gun.

Despite that, a tweet by Rev. Michael McBride, a regular MSNBC and CNN commentator who has worked with the Charlotte clergy members, suggested that a police officer shot the man. The tweet had been shared 2,400 times by Thursday morning.

The violence in Charlotte came less than a week after disputed police shooting of a black man in Tulsa — amplifying debates over policing and race that have been thrust open before in places such as Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore. The questions also are likely to get another national airing on Monday in the first head-to-head debate between GOP nominee Donald Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.

In Tulsa, conflicting accounts over a police shooting last Friday have sharply divided the city, but have so far not touched off clashes.

Videos made public this week show 40-year-old Terence Crutcher being shot, and then several minutes passing before an officer beings to render medical aid. Activists and others question why the medical assistance was not given immediately. Police advocates say officers must first determine the situation is under control before giving medical attention.

Back in Charlotte, the Rev. Jay Leach, senior minister of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Charlotte, said he and other clergy members had joined the demonstrations in hopes of keeping peace between police and protesters. Leach said protesters felt “trapped” and “ambushed” by police when they entered the cramped intersection outside the hotel. Protesters started yelling at officers, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, he said.

“It was apparent right away that this was a very dangerous and provocative situation,” Leach said.

Moments later, he said, he heard a shot and saw the man collapse. Protesters immediately surrounded the man, he said.

“My sense was that I’d just seen a fatality,” Leach said.

Linda Flynn, executive director of the Charlotte Spirituality Center, said she was just feet from the man when she heard a “gunshot” and saw him fall.

Left behind was a large pool of his blood, Flynn said. She said she watched a distraught woman dip her hand into it, wipe it on a police officer’s bicycle and yell, “You’re murderers!”

Flynn compared the demonstrations in Charlotte to the uprising in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014, when a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager.

“Right now, I feel like North Carolina is Ferguson,” she said. “It’s that bad.”"
3460,3460,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/09/27/fact-checking-the-first-clinton-trump-presidential-debate,0,"In the first debate between presidential contenders Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, Trump repeatedly relied on troublesome and false facts that have been debunked throughout the campaign. Clinton stretched the truth on occasion, such as when she tried to wiggle out of her 2012 praise of the Trans Pacific Partnership as a “gold standard.” But her misstatements paled in comparison to the list of Trump’s exaggerations and falsehoods.

Trump once again asserted that the 2008 Clinton campaign was responsible for spreading the myth that President Obama was born in Kenya, when that is false. He claimed that “thousands” of American jobs will leave the country when Ford shifts small-car manufacturing to Mexico, but no one here will lose their jobs. He also falsely claimed that he was against the Iraq War, when all available evidence demonstrates that he supported it until the rest of the country began to turn against it in 2004. He also once again falsely said he started his business with a “small loan” from his father.

Here’s a roundup of 23 of the most noteworthy claims that were made. As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debates.

“So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They’re all leaving. And we can’t allow it to happen anymore.”

—Trump

Ford is moving its small car production to Mexico, but the expansion will not affect U.S. workers.

The company has said that while production of Ford Focus models will shift to Mexico, its plant in Michigan will build other, larger vehicles. Ford and many other automakers are finding Mexico more attractive for several reasons.

“The cost of labor is indeed greater in the United States, which makes producing labor-intensive small cars in Mexico more profitable. The United States also has advantages, though — inexpensive electricity, experienced technicians and access to sophisticated materials and equipment — often means building larger and more expensive cars is cheaper in this country,” our colleague Max Ehrenfreund wrote.

“The only years that anybody’s ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn’t pay any federal income tax.”

—Clinton

Clinton exaggerates here. We know of three years in the 1970s when he did pay federal income taxes. But there were at least five years in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s when Trump did not pay any, or nearly any, income taxes.

“Under my plan I will be reducing taxes tremendously.”

—Trump

Trump’s tax plan would raise federal income taxes on more than half of America’s single parents and one-fifth of families with children, according to an analysis by Lily Batchelder, a New York University expert on tax policy who formerly worked for Obama’s National Economic Council.

While the Trump campaign called it “pure fiction,” the right-leaning Tax Foundation has said the group was able to replicate her findings. Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation, posted on Twitter that Batchelder’s results “seem reasonable to me.”

.@lilybatch We were able to replicate many of the numbers in the report. The results seem reasonable to me. — Kyle Pomerleau (@kpomerleau) September 26, 2016

“Independent experts have looked at what I’ve proposed, what Donald has proposed. And basically they’ve said this. … [Under Trump’s tax plan] we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession. My plans — and they’ve said ‘okay, we can do this,’ and I intend to get it done — we will have 10 million more jobs because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.” —Clinton

Mark Zandi, a well-respected economist, did issue a report saying that if Trump’s economic plans were fully implemented, 3.5 million jobs would disappear, incomes would stagnate, debt would explode and stock prices would plummet. But the report also said it was highly unlikely that Trump would get many of his plans approved by Congress, even if it is controlled by Republicans, because so many of his positions are so a departure from Republican principles. Even so, the report said the U.S. economy would likely suffer under a Trump presidency.

His report also said that if Clinton were able to fully implement her economic plans, the economy would add an additional 3.2 million jobs during the first four years of her presidency. Combined with anticipated job creation under current law, that adds up to 10.4 million jobs. But the report also said that Clinton would face significant roadblocks to getting her economic plan through Congress, resulting in far fewer job gains.

“I don’t mind releasing. I’m under a routine audit, and it’ll be released.”

—Trump

Trump cites an Internal Revenue Service audit as his justification for not releasing his federal income tax returns, but the audit does not prohibit from releasing the returns. Richard Nixon, who started the tradition of presidents and presidential candidates releasing their returns, did so in the middle of an audit.

Moreover, Trump has not released his tax returns from before 2009, which are no longer under audit, according to his attorney.

Presidential candidates have no legal obligation to release their returns, but there has long been a tradition to do so for the sake of transparency. Hillary Clinton has released three decades’ worth of tax returns.

While Trump has not released the returns, his long history of litigation has given the public a sense of what is in his returns. Tax information made public so far show Trump did not pay any, or nearly any, income taxes at least five times in the past 40 years.

“As far as tax return, you don’t learn that much” from tax returns.

—Trump

Trump is being misleading. Tax experts say that tax returns provide insight about a person’s finances in several key areas.

First, the tax return reveals a person’s annual income. A person’s net worth is not disclosed, but voters would gain an understanding of a person’s cash flow. Second, voters would understand the sources of a person’s income, such as how much comes from certain businesses, speeches, dividends, capital gains and so forth.

Third, a tax return would disclose how much a person gives to charity. Mitt Romney gave almost $2.3 million to charity in 2011, while Bill and Hillary Clinton gave $3 million to charity in 2014. We know these figures because of information in their tax returns.

Trump claims he has given $102 million to charity in the past five years, but a Washington Post investigation found not a cent in actual cash — mostly just free rounds of golf, given away by his courses for charity auctions and raffles. Trump’s tax return would clear up exactly how much he has really given to charity — indeed, whether he has given anything at all.

Fourth, a tax return would reveal how aggressive Trump has been on his taxes. There is no black-and-white approach to taxes; there are many gray areas subject to interpretation, especially regarding deductions. Trump frequently suggests that he knows how to game the system, so voters would learn whether he takes the same approach to his taxes.

Finally, the tax returns would disclose what percentage of Trump’s income actually goes to taxes.

TRUMP: “You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it’s the finest deal you’ve ever seen.” CLINTON: “No.” TRUMP: “And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.” CLINTON: “Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are — I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated.”

Trump is right. Clinton is subtly adjusting her words here when confronted with a question about her consistency on policy positions.

But the fact is she never used the word “hoped.” Instead, she was more declarative, using the phrase “gold standard” when she was Secretary of State.

“This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field,” she said in Australia in 2012. “And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world’s total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.”

“You’ve taken business bankruptcies six times.”

—Hillary Clinton “On occasion — four times — we used certain laws that are there.”

—Donald Trump

Clinton is correct.

Trump’s companies have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which means a company can remain in business while wiping away many of its debts. The bankruptcy court ultimately approves a corporate budget and a plan to repay remaining debts; often shareholders lose much of their equity.

Trump’s Taj Mahal opened in April 1990 in Atlantic City, but six months later, “defaulted on interest payments to bondholders as his finances went into a tailspin,” The Washington Post’s Robert O’Harrow found. In July 1991, Trump’s Taj Mahal filed for bankruptcy. He could not keep up with debts on two other Atlantic City casinos, and those two properties declared bankruptcy in 1992. A fourth property, the Plaza Hotel in New York, declared bankruptcy in 1992 after amassing debt.

PolitiFact uncovered two more bankruptcies filed after 1992, totaling six. Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004, after accruing about $1.8 billion in debt. Trump Entertainment Resorts also declared bankruptcy in 2009, after being hit hard during the 2008 recession.

Why the discrepancy? Perhaps this will give us an idea: Trump told Washington Post reporters that he counted the first three bankruptcies as just one.

“In Chicago, they’ve had thousands of shootings. … Stop and frisk worked very well … it brought the crime way down [in New York City].”

—Trump

Trump cherry-picks the increase in violence in Chicago, but this is not indicative of overall crime rates, which have been declining for years. Moreover, while Trump says stop-and-frisk policies should be enacted in Chicago as it was implemented in New York City, those policies have not been correlated with crime.

While violent crime overall has been declining for about two decades, there was a sharp increase in the violent crime rate in 2015. Homicides have continued to spike in major cities this year, though the rates remain far below their peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Law enforcement officials, including the FBI, have voiced concerns about the uptick in crime in 2015.

Criminal justice experts warn against comparing crime trends from short periods of time, such as month over month or year over year. An annual trend can show a trajectory of where the trend might be headed, but still does not give a full picture. Many criminal justice experts say crime trends are determined over at least five years, preferably 10 or 20 years, of data.

Trump praises stop-and-frisk policies under former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani. But it’s debatable whether the stop-and-frisk policies had such a direct impact on crime, as Trump suggests. Crime is affected by many factors, and New York’s decline in crime mirrored the decline in many other major cities at the time. Moreover, crime was declining for four years before Giuliani took office, and it continued to decline for 14 years after he left.

We awarded Three Pinocchios to Trump’s claim attributing stop-and-frisk policies to the decline in crime.

Trump also claimed that “murders are up” in New York. That is incorrect. Homicides in New York are down so far this year from the same point last year, according to the New York Police Department. But homicides did see an uptick in New York City in 2015, similar to trends in numerous other cities.

“If you’re too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.”

—Clinton

Democrats, including Clinton, frequently point out that people on the terrorist watch list can purchase a gun. But the proposal that Democrats have made in Congress wouldn’t ban such purchases automatically. We have awarded Two Pinocchios to this claim for lack of context.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has introduced legislation to give authority to the attorney general to decide whether or not a suspected terrorist could buy a gun. Anyone who was subjected to a federal terrorism investigation within five years of the attempted gun purchase would be flagged in the background-check system, and the Justice Department would be able to review those cases.

The government uses a “reasonable suspicion” standard to nominate and include someone in the Terrorist Watchlist, which includes the “no-fly list.” Belonging to a terrorist organization, or being listed on one of the watch lists, does not automatically stop someone from buying a gun. There has to be another factor that disqualifies the person from buying a gun under federal or state law, such as a felony conviction or illegal immigration status.

“He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gaddafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.”

—Clinton

Clinton is right that Trump emphatically urged the United States to remove Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi from power.

Share this article Share

Here’s Trump, in February 2011, urging an intervention on his video blog. “I can’t believe what our country is doing,” Trump said. “Qaddafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we’re sitting around we have soldiers all have the Middle East, and we’re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that’s what it is: It’s a carnage.”

Trump added: “Now we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives. This is absolutely nuts. We don’t want to get involved and you’re gonna end up with something like you’ve never seen before. …We have go in to save these lives; these people are being slaughtered like animals. It’s horrible what’s going on; it has to be stopped. We should do on a humanitarian basis, immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively, and save the lives.”

“I did not support the war in Iraq.”

—Trump

This is just totally false.

We have found no evidence of his early opposition to the invasion. Trump expressed lukewarm support the first time he was asked about it on Sept. 11, 2002, and was not clearly against it until he was quoted in the August 2004 Esquire cover story titled “Donald Trump: How I’d Run the Country (Better).”

But by the middle of 2004, many Americans had turned against the war, making Trump’s position not particularly unique. In light of Trump’s repeated false claim, Esquire has added an editor’s note to its August 2004 story, saying, “The Iraq War began in March 2003, more than a year before this story ran, thus nullifying Trump’s timeline.”

We have awarded this claim Four Pinocchios, compiled a timeline of all of Trump’s comments prior to the invasion in March 2003, and even a video documenting how this is a bogus claim.

Trump said he had “numerous conversations with Sean Hannity” prior to the invasion, expressing his opposition to the war. These appear to be private conversations. Hannity told Erik Wemple Blog that Trump “would watch the show and call after and we argued a lot about” the war. We should note that Hannity is one of Trump’s biggest boosters and has never asserted that Trump made these private claims to him until recently, even though this has been a constant source of controversy during Trump’s campaign. Hannity has also not offered any evidence to back up his claim that he and Trump had such conversations at the time.

[Update: During the debate, Trump also cited his January 2003 Fox News interview with Neil Cavuto as proof of his early opposition. The day after the debate, Fox News cited this clip, declaring it “backs up Trump on Iraq War opposition.” As our timeline shows, Trump was not clearly against the war in this interview, either.

On Feb. 18, 2016, Cavuto replayed the clip and said it wasn’t clear Trump was against the war then. While Trump now says he opposed the Iraq war, Cavuto said: “When I interviewed him back in January 2003, couple of months before we formally got involved in Iraq, he could’ve left you with a different impression.”

Cavuto said that in the January 2003 interview, Trump was “not bashing the president back then, nor is he fully endorsing Iraq. But he is saying some clear decision is required.” Meghan McCain, appearing in the segment, said in response: “He speaks now though, like he was protesting with Code Pink in the street, like he was adamantly against the war in Iraq. Like he was this huge person in the media stage, protesting against President Bush and going into Iraq.”]

Clinton: “You know, I made a mistake using a private email.” Trump: “That’s for sure.” Clinton: “And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But I’m not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.” Lester Holt: “Mr. Trump?” Trump: “That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake.”

Regarding Clinton’s statement, the key issue with the email controversy was that Clinton had a private server — not just a private email — and she never used her designated State Department email account, which would have kept records of emails subject to requests under the Freedom of Information Act.

The accuracy of Trump’s claim depends on whether he is referring to her decision to use a private server, or if he is suggesting that Clinton purposefully intended to mishandle classified information. On the former point, yes, Clinton chose on purpose to use a private email server. On the latter, the FBI would disagree.

FBI Director James B. Comey has said Clinton was “extremely careless” in handling classified information through her private server. Our colleagues Matt Zapotosky and Rosalind Helderman noted: “But Comey also has said that investigators found particularly lacking any intent on Clinton or her staff’s part to mishandle classified information, and that would undermine any possible criminal case against them.”

“In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They’ve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE.”

—Trump

How can a federal agency, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, endorse a candidate? Trump is actually referring to the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, which is the union representing ICE officers. In a statement released by the campaign, National ICE Council President Chris Crane said it was the union’s first-ever endorsement.

“We have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.”

—Trump

Trump is basically right. The trade deficit in 2015 was $762 billion, according to the Census Bureau.

“You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.”

—Clinton “Wrong. Wrong.”

—Trump

Clinton is correct. Trump in May caused a stir when he suggested the United States should borrow more and renegotiate new terms later. “I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal,” Trump said on CNBC. The comments caused angst in the financial markets, as the U.S. Treasury securities are considered the world’s safest investment precisely because the United States is at low risk of default. Renegotiating the terms would be seen as a form of default.

Trump later walked away from his comments, claiming he had been misquoted.

“Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to — during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. … Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate.”

—Trump

To support the debunked notion that Clinton’s campaign originated “birther” rumors during the 2008 presidential campaign, Trump pointed to these two examples. But they don’t add up to much of anything.

James Asher, former D.C. bureau chief of McClatchy, has said that longtime Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal “strongly urged” him to “investigate the exact place of President Obama’s birth, which he suggested was in Kenya.” McClatchy assigned a reporter to go to Kenya, and the reporter found the allegation was false, Asher said. (We reached out to Asher several times but did not receive a response.)

Blumenthal, declining to elaborate further, said in a statement to The Fact Checker: “This is false. Period. Donald Trump cannot distract from the fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie, and bears the responsibility for it.”

Solis Doyle did say in a recent CNN interview that in December 2007, a volunteer coordinator in Iowa forwarded an email perpetuating the birther conspiracy. Clinton “made the decision immediately to let that person go,” Solis Doyle said in the interview.

As in the instance with the Iowa volunteer coordinator, the campaign denounced isolated instances of Clinton’s staffers questioning whether Obama was Muslim. We found that there’s no evidence that she or her campaign were “pressing it very hard” — though some of her supporters did perpetuate the claims in the bitter 2008 primary campaign against Obama.

“As multiple, independent fact checkers have affirmed in the years since, neither the 2008 campaign nor the candidate ever questioned the President’s citizenship or birth certificate. Period,” said Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin.

“The 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren’t paying their fair share. Number two — and that bothers me, because we should be asking — we’re defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they’re supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that’s great. And I think we should get — because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It’s a lot of money to protect other people. But I’m all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And they’re going to do that. And that was — believe me — I’m sure I’m not going to get credit for it — but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.”

—Trump

Trumps mixes up a lot of things here.

The United States pays about 22 percent of the common-fund budget for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But the volume of the U.S. defense expenditures effectively represents 73 percent of the defense spending of the Alliance as a whole. But that does not mean that the United States pays 73 percent of the costs of running NATO.

The figure reflects the fact that United States, as a world power, projects its might across the globe. Experts say it is all but impossible to calculate how much of overall U.S. defense spending is devoted exclusively for NATO, but there is little dispute that most members are not meeting their commitment to have defense expenditures should amount to 2 percent of each country’s gross domestic product.

As for Trump patting himself on the back for spurring NATO to focus on terror, he’s kidding himself. The plan was in the works long before Trump starting saying NATO was obsolete.

“Violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don’t want to see it creep back up. We’ve had 25 years of very good cooperation.”

—Clinton

This data checks out, according to research by the Brennan Center for Justice. Nationally, the violent crime rate has fallen by 51 percent since 1991, and property crime has fallen by 43 percent.

“President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out — what, they shouldn’t have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed. … But they wouldn’t have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn’t have had them.”

—Trump

As Clinton noted in her response, the terms of departure from Iraq were originally set by the George W. Bush administration. The Bush administration signed a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) with Iraq in 2008 that established a deadline for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq by Dec. 31, 2011. But it was widely expected troops would remain after a negotiated extension.

Clinton, as Secretary of State, had pushed for some troops to remain in Iraq but the administration was not able to reach an agreement and so U.S. troops left Iraq. Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, in his memoir, pinned the blame on Obama: “To my frustration, the White House coordinated the negotiations but never really led them. Officials there seemed content to endorse an agreement if State and Defense could reach one, but without the President’s active advocacy, [Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri] al-Maliki was allowed to slip away.”

Obama, meanwhile, was pleased to be able to run for reelection in 2012 on a claim that no more U.S. troops were left in Iraq.

To a large extent, the Islamic State of today is simply an outgrowth of al-Qaeda of Iraq, which emerged after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

At best, one could argue that actions that Obama failed to take (over Clinton’s opposition) helped contribute to the growth of ISIS, also known as the Islamic State. Islamic State certainly has become an important player in the Middle East, taking advantage of the civil war in Syria and the disarray in the Iraqi government to claim vast areas of both countries. In the past couple of years, the group’s activities have gathered attention in the United States; it was only in 2014 that President Obama dismissed Islamic State as a “JV team.”

Clinton was Secretary of State when Obama made decisions that could be seen as contributing to the rise of the Islamic States, but ironically she was one of the loudest forces for keeping a residual force in Iraq and for intervening in Syria, such as arming the rebels. Both steps advocated by Clinton might have thwarted the emergence of the terror group. Moreover, Clinton was not Secretary of State when Obama all but ignored the Islamic State as it moved back into Iraq in late 2013.

But — and here’s the irony — Trump criticizes Obama for a policy position he had advocated be taken even sooner than 2011. “I would announce that we have been victorious in Iraq and all the troops are coming home and let those people have their civil war,” Trump told CNBC in 2006. “I just said, announce victory, get them home…. Let’s say, ‘Victory, Tremendous.’ Have a big thing in the streets. Then get out real fast before you get shot. Let’s get home.”

“We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they’re illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.”

—Trump

Indeed, there are victims of homicide by undocumented immigrants, including by those in gangs. But there are two important data points to remember when Trump talks about this.

First, the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants do not fit Trump’s description of aggravated felons, whose crimes include murder. U.S. Sentencing Commission data shows homicides are a small percentage of the crimes committed by noncitizens, whether they are in the United States illegally or not.

Second, illegal immigration flows across the Southern border in fiscal 2015 were at the lowest levels since 1972, except for in 2011. The apprehensions in fiscal 2016 so far have exceeded fiscal 2015, but still indicate an overall decline.

“I said it to you once, had we taken the oil — and we should have taken the oil — ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil — a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.”

—Trump

ISIS does not control oil in Libya. Trump has been called out before on this point, but he keeps saying this false claim.

As for keeping the oil in Iraq, This is nonsensical. The Bush administration invested a lot of diplomatic effort in assuring Middle Eastern allies that the United States was not invading because of Iraq’s oil fields. Moreover, oil revenue was crucial to ensuring a functioning Iraqi state — which is why insurgents often targeted the oil sector in Iraq.

In any event, seizing the oil of a sovereign nation after invading it would be considered a “grave breach” of the Geneva Conventions, one of the cornerstones of international law, as well as other international agreements. Maybe Trump’s staff should arrange a tutorial on international law.

Our colleague Steven Mufson looked deeply at whether, international law aside, such a proposal was even feasible. One expert said it was “beyond goofy.”

“You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.”

—Clinton

Clinton is referring to this statement by Kellyanne Conway, back when she was supporting Trump rival Ted Cruz, the Texas senator. Conway, who now defends Trump with fervor, told CNN on March 8: “For Trump, the debates are fought with peril. The Trump victims. The reason the messaging has gotten better is they are starting to talk about victims of Trump University, victims of Trump in Atlantic City. Before it was conservative apostasies, and now it is, you built your business on the backs of the little guy.”

http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/27/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate-reaction/index.html",0,"Hillary Clinton moved to capitalize Tuesday on a sharp-edged debate performance that exposed vulnerabilities for Donald Trump, excoriating his values and character in an effort to expand her coalition of women, minorities and young voters. Trump, meanwhile, scrambled to move his campaign forward. While the Republican nominee insisted that he was not unnerved, he and his advisers grasped at excuses to explain why he did not perform better at the first presidential debate Monday night.

Trump on Tuesday was unrepentant and eager to defend his past, denigrating a former beauty pageant winner whom he targeted as his latest foil and vowing to attack Clinton over her husband’s marital infidelities in their next showdown.

In a country divided over two historically unpopular candidates, Trump’s turn is unlikely to shake his core support. But Democrats said they felt assured that Trump’s hot temperament, scattered demeanor and series of statements that left him exposed to further scrutiny would make it increasingly difficult for him to win over the undecided voters he has been courting, especially moderate white women.

“I look back as a former practitioner and say, ‘Is there anything Donald Trump did to convince somebody who wasn’t in his column to be for him?’ ” said David Plouffe, President Obama’s former campaign manager. “I have a hard time thinking there’s many of those people. I don’t think he lost anybody. But that’s not his challenge now. He’s got to add.”

Memorable quotes from Clinton and Trump’s first presidential debate + 14 Here are some memorable quotes from the presidential debate in Hempstead, N.Y.

Clinton was ebullient as she returned to the campaign trail Tuesday in Raleigh, N.C., and strove to keep alive the controversies that marred Trump’s debate performance.

“The real point is about temperament and fitness and qualification to hold the most important, hardest job in the world, and I think people saw last night some very clear differences between us,” Clinton told reporters aboard her campaign plane en route to North Carolina.

Trump did little to change the subject. In a Tuesday morning interview on Fox News Channel, he said debate moderator Lester Holt, the anchor of “NBC Nightly News,” was biased, and the Republican complained about the quality of his microphone. Clinton jabbed him for that, telling reporters, “Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night.”

Trump also disparaged a former Miss Universe pageant winner, Alicia Machado, for her physique. In the debate, Clinton raised Trump’s past comments about the Venezuela-born woman, who was crowned Miss Universe at age 19 in 1996.

“He called this woman ‘Miss Piggy,’ and then he called her ‘Miss Housekeeping,’ because she is Latina,” Clinton said in one of the debate’s more electric exchanges.

The next morning, Trump offered an indignant defense of how he dealt with Machado when he was a partner in the company that owned the Miss Universe contest.

Here's what you need to know about Alicia Machado. (Video: Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)

“She was the worst we ever had,” he said on Fox, adding: “She gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.”

The Clinton campaign sought to advance the story across media platforms, releasing a Web video featuring the beauty queen-turned-actor, now a U.S. citizen who lives in California, and arranging a conference call for reporters with Machado, who described the election as ""like a bad dream.""

Like Trump’s feud this summer with the Muslim parents of a dead U.S. soldier, the Machado episode rapidly emerged as a microcosm of the campaign — and a test of whether Trump can expand his support beyond his base of aggrieved white voters, most of them men.

Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican strategist who has been critical of the party’s nominee, said Trump’s comments about Machado were “hugely tone deaf.” The debate overall, he said, was for many Republicans “an ‘Oh, crap’ moment. If you thought he had a spring in his step for the last few weeks and was getting back in the hunt, that’s pretty much gone.”

Few of Trump’s supporters went so far as to crown him the victor. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who has been a weather vane for the Republican leadership during this election season, was supportive though muted at a Tuesday news conference. He told reporters that Trump gave a “unique, Donald Trump response to the status quo.”

“I think he gave a spirited argument,” Ryan said, “and I think he passed a number of thresholds.”

Trump’s backers insisted that the debate would not damage his standing in the close race with Clinton. Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) said, “As far as the temperament, that’s how he’s been for the last 15 months. It got him to the top. . . . He does have the feistiness that I think 51 percent of the American people will like.”

William J. Bennett, who served in President Ronald Reagan’s Cabinet, said of Trump: “When he loses his temper a little bit, many people see that as passion and as someone who’s engaged in the fight and in what he believes. People forgive that — and a leopard can’t change his spots.”

It will take several days before the political impact of Monday's debate becomes clear, but many Republicans said they were bracing for Clinton to get a bump in the polls. An estimated 84 million people watched the clash at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., making it the most-watched presidential debate in history.

The event reverberated around the globe. Former Mexican president Vicente Fox said Trump’s behavior should alarm world leaders because he revealed himself to be “ignorant” and “dangerous.”

""When he speaks about the geoeconomic situation and the geopolitical situation and terrorism, he's absolutely ignorant, and he's only provoking us democratic leaders from around the world to reject everything he's proposing,"" Fox, who watched the debate on Mexican television, said in a telephone interview. ""He is an imperialistic gringo.""

In the United States, the risk for Trump is that a negative impression sets in on shows such as NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” on social media and in workplace conversations.

Democrats sought to taunt Trump on his uneven performance, particularly given his regular attacks on Clinton’s “stamina” and appearance.

“He seemed unable to handle that big stage, and I really did feel that by the end, with the kind of snorting, the water gulping and the leaning on the lectern, that he just seemed really out of gas,” said Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.

Trump previewed an even more combative second debate, Oct. 9 in St. Louis, by saying he might “hit her harder,” perhaps over former president Bill Clinton’s affairs.

“I really eased up because I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings,” Trump said on Fox, saying he would have brought up “the many affairs that Bill Clinton had” but held back because the Clintons’ daughter, Chelsea, was in the audience.

“I didn’t think it was worth the shot,” he said. “I didn’t think it was nice.”

Hillary Clinton shrugged off the threat, telling reporters: “He can run his campaign however he chooses. I will continue to talk about what I want to do for the American people.”

Clinton campaigned at a community college gymnasium in Raleigh to whoops and loud applause. “One down, two to go,” she said of the debates.

During a campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., Tuesday evening, Trump said that Clinton is “a woman that I think is virtually incompetent, certainly as secretary of state.” He called her incompetent repeatedly throughout the rally.

“We’re going to get rid of that crooked woman. She’s a crooked woman. She’s a very, very dishonest woman,” Trump said.

For Democrats, Trump provided what Plouffe called “an embarrassment of riches” at the debate — a series of controversial statements and unresolved, damaging questions. He seemed to affirm that he paid no income taxes; he made side remarks and pained expressions while Clinton praised the vibrancy of African Americans; he said it was a smart business strategy to profit from the housing crash.

Vice President Biden seized on that last point at a rally for Clinton in Philadelphia, where he charged that Trump has no “moral center.”

“This is a guy who said it was good business for him to see the housing market fail,” Biden said. “What in the hell is he talking about?”

Clinton and a brigade of high-profile surrogates plan to continue using Trump’s debate comments against him. She will campaign in New Hampshire on Wednesday with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), hoping to energize young voters there with a discussion of college affordability, while first lady Michelle Obama will stump across Pennsylvania on Thursday.

“He put a lot on the table — a lot of things that are not true and a lot of views that we think are counter to where most voters are,” said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton’s communications director. “It won’t end tomorrow. There’s a lot that will live on from this debate.”"

http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/06/us/hurricane-matthew-evacuations/index.html",0,"ORMOND BEACH, Fla. — Hurricane Matthew churned along Florida’s Atlantic Coast on Friday, its center remaining just offshore as the storm battered the state with punishing rain, beach-swallowing sea surges and destructive wind gusts topping 100 mph. By late Friday afternoon, the strongest hurricane to menace the United States in a decade had weakened to a Category 2 storm, and it was clear that Florida had dodged some of the worst-case scenarios laid out by forecasters and public officials. Yet the danger wasn’t past: South Carolina was bracing for the storm’s potential landfall there Saturday, and even residents in North Carolina faced a considerable threat.

The National Hurricane Center said Friday that the storm’s center had been “hugging the coast” in Florida as it continued toward Georgia and South Carolina and warned of a surge of up to nine feet that could cause dangerous flooding.

Late Friday night, the hurricane center said “strong winds and storm surge” were also spreading north along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina and warned of “rising water levels” expected in both states into early Saturday morning.

While Matthew is expected to continue weakening over the coming days, forecasters expect it to remain a hurricane until it pivots away from the East Coast on Sunday. On Friday afternoon, as it lashed northeast Florida, hurricane-force winds extended 60 miles from the storm’s center and tropical-storm-force winds reached as far as 185 miles.

At least four deaths in the state were linked to the storm Friday, officials said. Two were medical emergencies that ambulances couldn’t reach and two were women killed by falling trees. One of these women was trying to “ride out the storm” in a camper trailer about halfway between Jacksonville and Orlando when a tree was knocked onto the camper, the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office said.

More than 1.1 million people in Florida lacked power by Friday night, according to the office of Gov. Rick Scott.

Officials there were very concerned about storm surge, which had been projected for as high as 11 feet. Scott said he was particularly worried about Jacksonville, home to more residents than any other city in the South.

On Friday afternoon, video footage on social media showed water breaking through barriers surrounding Jacksonville, which is right along the coast in the northeastern corner of Florida. A cascade of water flooded along palm trees swaying in the wind and rushed toward houses not far from the water. Wind gusts approaching 70 mph were also recorded at the Jacksonville airport.

Millions have been ordered to evacuate homes along the Southeast, and all along the coast many more stocked up on supplies and hunkered down as the storm approached. Matthew roared across the Caribbean before approaching the United States, and officials blamed it for at least 300 deaths in Haiti, a figure certain to climb once rescue workers are able to reach cutoff areas.

President Obama on Friday said that much like during Sandy in 2012, the storm surge could cause significant damage.

“I want to emphasize to everybody that this is still a really dangerous hurricane,” Obama said during remarks in the Oval Office after he met with the heads of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Homeland Security.

Obama again urged residents to listen to what local officials are saying, expressing concerns about areas in northern Florida and Georgia.

“Do not be a holdout here because we can always replace property, but we can’t replace lives,” he said.

Across the Southeastern United States, officials pleaded all week with residents to take seriously the threat of a storm that would be the strongest hurricane to hit the country since Wilma in 2005.

More than 2.5 million people were told to evacuate in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, where schools and government offices alike were shuttered this week. Florida said airports in Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Melbourne were closed, while airlines canceled nearly 1,500 flights through the state. Disney World closed down Friday, and college football games from Gainesville, Fla., to Columbia, S.C., were called off or rescheduled.

Flood warnings were issued through late Friday night for northern Nassau County, in Florida not far from the Georgia line, as well as Camden and Glynn counties in southeastern Georgia, the National Weather Service said. A flash flood warning was announced for Savannah, Ga., through 5:45 a.m. Saturday.

Officials in Georgia and South Carolina announced curfews in some places intended to keep people off the roads at night. One in Charleston was to take effect at midnight and last until 6 a.m., the Charleston police said Friday night.

“Let’s not underestimate how dangerous this hurricane can be,” Gov. Nathan Deal (R) said at a news conference Friday. “There’s nothing certain about this other than the danger.”

In preparation for the storm’s arrival, more than 170 medical facilities in South Carolina had been emptied or were in the process of being evacuated by Friday evening, although one of the largest, the Medical University Hospital in Charleston, decided against evacuating its staff or 550 patients.

An estimated 355,000 people have evacuated the coastal area of South Carolina, officials said. With 69 shelters open statewide, Gov. Nikki Haley (R) again urged people to evacuate in advance of the storm’s arrival. “There is nothing safe about what is getting ready to happen,” she said.

There was even extreme caution from the Waffle House, the southern institution that has famously become a yardstick for emergency responders looking to gauge the impact disasters have on communities because of how quickly it reopens restaurants.

Waffle House said Friday that it has closed more than two dozen locations from Florida to South Carolina.

Obama had declared emergencies in four states — Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and, on Friday, North Carolina — opening up federal aid and assistance. Governors also declared emergencies and activated thousands of National Guard members to help with the response.

Forecasts had used dire language when describing the storm’s potential impact. The National Weather Service warned that brutal winds could leave some places “uninhabitable for weeks or months.” The National Hurricane Center called it “extremely dangerous” and spoke grimly of flooding dangers.

While northern Florida saw the brunt of the storm Friday, residents of Palm Beach County to the south were taking down shutters, raking up leaves and cleaning up the effects of the storm.

“We got lucky,” David Pinciss. He noted that the state’s governor had been dramatic in news conferences, but also said he was glad he evacuated.

“Whatever the governor said was going to happen didn’t happen, and that’s good,” he said.

At the Breakers Hotel on Palm Beach, Mark Reid, director of golf and grounds, was treating his team of 30 workers to lunch Friday.

“They all left their homes this morning before they even had a chance to take their shutters down to come into work, and I’m grateful for that,” Reid said. He added that the oceanfront hotel’s grounds suffered no damage. “Just a few palm fronds to clean up,” Reid said. “We are in good shape, and we’ll be ready to go tomorrow.”

Matthew continued to make its way north through the day Friday, and the National Weather Service reported a series of blistering winds across the Florida coastline.

A wind gust of 68 mph was reported in Daytona Beach, while gusts topping 100 mph were recorded in northern Brevard County, east of Orlando, according to the weather service. By the afternoon, gusts of around 80 mph were registered in Flagler Beach and St. Augustine.

Flash flood warnings in the Jacksonville area were announced through Friday evening, and flood warnings were also issued in parts of Volusia, Brevard and Seminole counties.

In Volusia County, officials said there were initial reports of major damage that included a destroyed iconic fishing pier in Daytona Beach; structural damage to business and homes; fallen trees, flooding and widespread power outages. But the storm’s shift to the east eased some of the risks that had been feared.

“I don’t think 30 miles has ever meant so much to a community, said Volusia County Manager Jim Dinneen. “We are very fortunate the eye of the storm stayed 30 miles from the coast. I believe it made all the difference in how catastrophic the damage could have been.”

Authorities said they would continue to enforce a curfew until 7 a.m Saturday and said they would additional deliveries of food and water to area shelters to ensure needs are met.

As the storm moved toward Daytona Beach on Friday morning, trees were whipped around and downed branches and power lines dotted the roads. Only police cars could be seen driving around. Just to the south in Ormond Beach, a neighbor’s tree landed on the roof of Lynn Kearns’s home, but she still had no plans to leave.

“Our street doesn’t usually flood,” said Kearns, who has lived in this part of Florida for nearly 30 years. The pine tree dangled off the roof as Kearns spoke.

Her windows were boarded up and she was watching the wind whip trees along the street, part of which was already flooded. But she said leaving would be too difficult for her mother and two dogs.

At a Hampton Inn in Ormond Beach, guests ate breakfast Friday by flashlight and LED candlelight after the electricity went out earlier that morning.

After a night of howling winds and whistling gusts, the power went out at 7:30 a.m., and through the morning large raindrops popped against windows as sheets of rain swept in all directions.

Cochise Israel lives a half-block from the beach and would ordinarily have stayed there. He said he prefers to be in the home when the roof tears off so he can move furniture into dry areas, adding that he favors “fighting it off as opposed to going back to complete destruction.”

“I’ve always rode them out,” said Israel, 38. “If anyone is in trouble, I have chainsaws and help them get out. I’ve always been the hero.”

He spent much of the week helping board up homes and fill sandbags for his older neighbors who opted to ride out the storm. But he said he had little choice but to leave this time, because he had to take care of his 97-year-old great aunt, Dorothy Butler, who suffers from dementia.

“It’s kind of hard to be so far away,” Israel said.

As guests gathered around the hotel doors to watch the squalls, the temperature in the rooms continued to rise. One of the guests, Pat Sheil, had called Tuesday to reserve a spot at the Hampton Inn for her and her cat, because her manufactured home was squarely in the path of Matthew’s winds.

“I don’t know what I’m going back to,” said Sheil, 73.

Tim Kaine of Virginia, and the Republican nominee, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, debated Oct. 4 at Longwood University in Farmville, Va. Here is a roundup of 25 suspicious or interesting claims that were made. As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debates.

“She worked a deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile”

— Tim Kaine

Kaine surely meant to say nuclear weapons but it came out as chemical weapons. (Later in the debate, he said “[Clinton] went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia’s nuclear stockpile.”)

New START placed tighter limits on deployed strategic weapons but Russia was actually already meeting the treaty’s limits, for the most part, when the treaty’s implementation began. Indeed, Russia has increased deployed nuclear weapons from 1,537 in February 2011 to 1,796 in September of this year. Also, the treaty does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons, nor does it require them to destroy any existing weapons.

Russia’s total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline from 40,000 since 1986. The total has hovered around 4,500 since 2012, during Obama’s presidency.

“She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.” — Kaine

Kaine leans way over on his skis here. The Iranian nuclear agreement was actually negotiated by Clinton’s successor, John Kerry, though Clinton helped tee up the negotiations by increasing sanctions on the Islamic Republic. The deal, which has been sharply criticized by Republicans, did increase the amount of time that Iran would need to build a nuclear weapon by reducing its centrifuges for uranium enrichment and its stockpile of enriched uranium; international monitoring of Iran’s nuclear facilities was also implemented. But key elements of the deal expire in 15 years (some go longer) and Iran’s nuclear infrastructure remains in place.

While Iran has insisted it has no interest in building nuclear weapons, the deal does not eliminate the risk that it will obtain nuclear bombs. The agreement limits Iran’s civilian nuclear program and it is also contains an indefinite prohibition on activities related to a weapons program, defined in Annex 1, Section T. Whether those elements eliminates the nuclear weapons program is a matter of opinion.

Clinton and Kaine are “actually advocating $1 trillion in tax increases.” — Mike Pence

Indeed, Clinton’s economic plan would raise an estimated $1.46 trillion in tax revenues over the next decade, according to an analysis by economist Mark Zandi. But the tax hike “falls almost exclusively on the most highly paid,” the analysis says.

This figure does not take into account the impact of her other proposals on the economy. For example, his report also said that if Clinton were able to fully implement her economic plans, the economy would add an additional 3.2 million jobs during the first four years of her presidency. Combined with anticipated job creation under current law, that adds up to 10.4 million jobs. But the report also said that Clinton would face significant roadblocks to getting her economic plan through Congress, resulting in far fewer job gains.

“Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He’s called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. I don’t like saying that in front of my wife and my mother. He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican. He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn’t a hero because he’d been captured. He said African Americans are living in hell. And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen. … And we don’t think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.”

— Kaine

Trump has, indeed, said all of those things.

During his campaign announcement, Trump said: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.“ We awarded Trump’s claim connecting illegal immigrants from Mexico and crime Four Pinocchios.

(During the debate, Pence asserted that that Kaine was leaving out a part where Trump said: “Many of them are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote.” What Trump said, actually, was: “And some, I assume, are good people.” Updated thanks to the reader who pointed out Pence’s substitution of “many” for “some.”)

In 2007, Trump called Rosie O’Donnell “a slob,” “a pig” and a “degenerate” in a single speech. He has called Arianna Huffington “a dog” and said New York Times columnist Gail Collins had “the face of a dog.”

Trump did say that the Indiana-born U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel had an “inherent conflict of interest” because of his Mexican heritage and Trump’s plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump has said McCain was “not a war hero,” and that McCain is “a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.” Trump has, indeed, said: “We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African Americans, Hispanics, are living in hell, because it’s so dangerous.” And Trump was one of the most high-profile “birthers” who questioned whether Obama was a U.S. citizen.

Earlier in the campaign, Trump said women who receive illegal abortions should be subject to “some sort of punishment.” But he reversed that statement several hours later, after widespread criticism from those on both sides of the abortion rights issue. He amended his statement to say that the doctors, not women, should be punished.

“Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.” — Kaine

This is correct. A key difference here is that Nixon did not release his taxes while he was a presidential candidate; he did so in 1973, a year after he was reelected.

Presidential candidates have no legal obligation to release their returns, but there has long been a tradition to do so for the sake of transparency. Trump has cited a pending Internal Revenue Service audit, even though the first president to release his taxes, Nixon, did so in the middle of an audit. Moreover, Trump has not released his tax returns from before 2009, which are no longer under audit, according to his attorney.

“The state of Indiana has a balanced budget.… We’ve made record investments in education and infrastructure.” — Pence

Pence is correct on raw numbers regarding education spending, but is incorrect when the figures are adjusted for inflation.

In fiscal year 2017, state spending on higher education and K-12 education is the largest in Indiana’s history. But adjusted for inflation, the 2017 appropriations are not quite as high as they were in 2010 and 2011, said Lawrence DeBoer, Purdue University economist and an expert on Indiana’s state budget. By 2017, Indiana state spending on education will be almost back to 2011 levels, DeBoer said.

On infrastructure, Pence began improving the state’s roads only after an emergency repair of the Interstate 65 bridge led to a month-long traffic problem and caused a political liability, the Associated Press reported. Political ads attacked Pence for saving money in the state’s reserves at the expense of underfunding the state’s infrastructure.

Pence then proposed a plan to improve roads “that relied on borrowing, drawing down state reserves and accounting gimmicks to reach an advertised $1 billion sticker price,” the AP reported. “In the end, he got just a fraction of that after Indiana’s Republican-controlled Legislature balked. And much of the money set aside for local governments came from local taxes held in state reserves that were already supposed to be returned.”

Clinton and Kaine “have a plan for open borders.” — Pence

Pence exaggerates Clinton’s stance on border security and immigration enforcement.

Clinton has said she would expand Obama’s executive actions on immigration and has advocated for comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship. But she also has supported enhanced border security. And her immigration proposal includes “humane, targeted and effective” enforcement and focusing immigration resources on detaining and deporting those “who pose a threat to public safety.”

[Update: Hacked emails released on Oct. 7 showed Clinton apparently said in a paid closed-door speech to a Brazilian bank: “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders,” through green energy.

The Clinton campaign has refused to authenticate the hacked emails, but campaign manager Robby Mook said in an Oct. 9 CBS “Face the Nation” interview that Clinton was “talking about integrating green energy between North and South America. … If the question is, ‘Does Hillary Clinton support throwing open our borders?’ Absolutely not. And she is going to do everything she can to fight to protect the interests of workers in this country.”]

“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 550 percent.” — Pence

This is correct. Clinton has said she supports President Obama’s decision to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 — and that she would support an increase up to 65,000. That is a 550 percent increase from 10,000. But Clinton has not yet disclosed her plan for the new fiscal year or beyond.

This map below shows where Syrian refugees have ended up in the United States.

Kaine: “You’ve got to be tough on Russia. Let’s start by not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader. Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he’s a great leader.”

Pence: “No, we haven’t.” Kaine: “Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.”

Pence: “That is absolutely inaccurate…. He [Trump] said he’s been stronger on the world stage.”

Maybe the GOP ticket did not precisely use the word “great” or “better,” but Kaine pretty much hits the target here.

Pence told CNN just a few weeks ago: “I think it’s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been.” Pence made these remarks just after Trump asserted that Putin has “been a leader far more than our president has been a leader.”

“The second component of the [Trump] plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that’s exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession — the deepest recession since the 1930s.”

— Kaine

Kaine repeats a line that recently earned Hillary Clinton Three Pinocchios. But no credible analyst would cite the Bush tax cuts as playing a key role in spurring the economic crash.

Kaine puts it even more starkly than Clinton. The Clinton campaign tried to suggest income inequality, exacerbated by tax cuts, led to the stagnation of the middle class and spurred excess borrowing and leverage — key components of the crash along with lax regulation. But that’s a real stretch, given that a housing bubble was the key trigger. The causes of the Great Recession are complex and debatable, but there’s no debate that it is wrong to put the Bush tax cuts at the top of the list.

“When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and said … quote, ‘They will all be gone. They will all be gone.’”

— Kaine

This isn’t a direct quote about deporting all undocumented immigrants, but Trump did say that all “criminal illegal immigrants” (likely referring to undocumented immigrants convicted of a crime) “are going to be gone. It will be over.”

Share this article Share

Among other claims Trump made at the Aug. 31 Phoenix rally about removing those here illegally:

“Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation.” “Under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.”

But Trump also laid out his deportation priorities during the speech. Among them: Targeting at least 5 million and as many as 6.5 million undocumented immigrants who would be subject to swift removal. That is about half of the 11 million undocumented people estimated to be living in the United States.

“More than half of the private meetings when she [Clinton] was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation.” —Pence

Pence misconstrued an Associated Press report here, similar to the way Donald Trump did earlier in the campaign.

The AP analyzed State Department records and looked specifically at Clinton’s meetings on the phone or in person with 154 people who were not federal employees or foreign government representatives. This narrowed down the denominator to a small subcategory of people Clinton met with as secretary of state, since the majority of her diplomatic work would involve representatives of foreign governments. In addition, the AP report is based on partial records released by the State Department so far and does not reflect the full scope of people with whom Clinton met as secretary of state.

The AP found that 85 of those 154 people, or “more than half,” had donated to the Clinton Foundation or “pledged commitments to its international programs.” The 85 donors collectively contributed as much as $156 million, the AP reported. There were representatives from at least 16 foreign governments, who donated as much as $170 million to the charity, but those representatives were not included in the 154 number, the AP reported.

“15 million new jobs? 15 million new jobs?” — Kaine

This is wrong. Counting from January 2009, nearly 11 million private-sector jobs have been created in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you count all jobs, including government jobs, the figure is 10.5 million.

So how does Kaine come up with 15 million? He’s counting from the low point for jobs in Obama’s presidency, February 2010. When you start the clock from then, the tally is 15 million private-sector jobs and 14.8 million overall jobs.

The last time we checked, February 2010 was 6 1/2 years ago. So with this claim, Kaine is trying to wipe off a year of Obama’s presidency.

Moreover, as a general matter, regular readers know that we tend to discount job-creation records by a president, as so much of the record is due to economic forces beyond a president’s control.

“Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs.” — Kaine

Mark Zandi, a respected economist at Moody’s Analytics, did issue a report saying that if Trump’s economic plans were fully implemented, 3.5 million jobs would disappear, incomes would stagnate, debt would explode, and stock prices would plummet. (This compares to an anticipated increase of 6 million jobs under current Obama administration policies.) In another report, Zandi also said that if Clinton were able to fully implement her economic plans, the economy would create an additional 3.2 million jobs during the first four years of her presidency. Combined with anticipated job creation under current law, that adds up to 10.4 million jobs.

But both reports were highly skeptical that either candidate would be able to get their plans through Congress — even a Republican-controlled one during a Trump presidency — because so many of Trump’s positions are such a departure from GOP principles. Even so, the report said the U.S. economy would likely suffer under a Trump presidency. (The report was issued in June, and Moody’s has not issued an updated report that would reflect additional policies announced by Trump, including a revised tax plan. But the report said Trump’s trade policies would be especially damaging.)

“A reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran.” — Pence

Pence makes it sound like this is U.S. taxpayer money — and he uses a too-high estimate. Because of international sanctions over its nuclear program, Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe. With sanctions lifted, in theory, those funds would be unlocked.

But the Treasury Department has estimated that once Iran fulfills other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. (Much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in China.) For its part, the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion, not $55 billion.

“That’s why Donald Trump’s claim that he wants to — that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.” — Kaine

Trump has called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization obsolete, but he has not said he wants to get rid of it. Asked specifically by The Washington Post in March if he wanted to pull out of NATO, he said, “I don’t want to pull it out. NATO was set up at a different time. NATO was set up when we were a richer country. We’re not a rich country anymore. … I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved.” Trump has argued that “distribution of costs” has to be changed but, as we have noted, Trump frequently overstates the burden on the United States.

“We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.”

— Kaine

Kaine is referring to Trump’s 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” where he made such a comparison about Social Security and said he wanted to privatize the program: “The workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme. The pyramids are made of paper-mache.”

Trump added in the book: “Privatization would be good for all of us. As it stands today, 13.6 percent of women on Social Security live in poverty.”

But that book was published 16 years ago. On the campaign trail, Trump has said he wants to “keep Social Security intact.… I’m not going to cut it.” His specific plans for the program, however, are vague. His campaign has said “the key to preserving Social Security and other programs that benefit AARP members is to have an economy that is robust and growing.”

For more on Social Security and allegations it is a Ponzi scheme, see The Fact Checker’s guide to critical questions about the program.

“We have the smallest Navy since 1916” — Pence

This is a zombie claim that just won’t go away. We have awarded it Three Pinocchios, and fact checkers repeatedly debunked this during the 2012 presidential election.

Indeed, the number of ships (272) as of Oct. 4 is the lowest count since 1916 (245 ships). But a lot has changed in 100 years, including the need and capacity of ships. After all, it’s now a matter of modern nuclear-powered fleet carriers versus the gunboats and small warships of 100 years ago. The push for ships under the Reagan era (to build the Navy up to 600-ship levels) no longer exists, and ships from that era are now retiring.

This talking point is a poor way to depict the country’s naval fleet needs. Gunboats of 1915 and aircraft carriers of 2015 are not the same. And military budgets, fleet needs and historical circumstances are much different in 2015 than they were in 1916.

“We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009.” — Pence

Pence reprises a GOP talking point from the 2012 campaign, but it’s not correct. Obama substituted a different system, but it was on the recommendation of then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a Republican. Gates, in fact, had recommended the original plan to President George W. Bush and then decided the new system implemented by Obama was more effective, less costly and timelier than the Bush plan.

Gates, in his 2013 memoir, noted that while the Obama administration had stumbled in failing to lay the diplomatic groundwork for the shift, looking “like a bunch of bumbling fools,” the Bush plan was already running into trouble in both Prague and Warsaw and likely would have been rejected by parliaments in both countries. “The Polish and Czech governments were relieved,” he wrote.

“I sincerely believed the new program was better — more in accord with the political realities in Europe and more effective against the emerging Iranian threat,” Gates added. “While there certainly were some in the State Department and the White House who believed the third site in Europe was incompatible with the Russian ‘reset,’ we in Defense did not. Making the Russians happy wasn’t exactly on my to-do list.”

In fact, Gates says, the Russians quickly concluded that the Obama plan was even worse from their perspective, as it eventually might have capabilities that could be used against Russian intercontinental missiles.

“How ironic that U.S. critics of the new approach had portrayed it as a big concession to the Russians,” Gates added sardonically. “It would have been nice to hear a critic in Washington — just once in my career — say, Well I got that wrong.”

“Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.” — Kaine

Trump has walked back the particular claim that Kaine cites, that “wages are too high.” Of course, Trump has flip-flopped on the minimum wage at least five times since August 2015 and has consistently contradicted his own statements, making it hard to track exactly where he stands on the issue at a given time. Trump’s stance on this matter, as of August 2016, was that he supports “raising it to $10 at the federal level, but believes states should set the minimum wage as appropriate for their state.”

During a November 2015 Republican primary debate, Trump was asked whether he was “sympathetic to the protesters’ cause since a $15 wage works out to about $31,000 a year.” His full answer, with the part Kaine is quoting in bold:

“I can’t be, Neil. And the reason I can’t be is that we are a country that is being beaten on every front economically, militarily. There is nothing that we do now to win. We don’t win anymore. Our taxes are too high. I’ve come up with a tax plan that many, many people like very much. It’s going to be a tremendous plan. I think it’ll make our country and our economy very dynamic. But, taxes too high, wages too high, we’re not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we cannot do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can’t do it.”

Days later, Trump clarified he was referring to whether he would increase the minimum wage. He would not raise it, because then it would be “too high,” he said.

Kaine correctly notes that Pence, as a congressman, voted in 2007 against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.

“More and more young people today are embracing life.” — Pence

Pence made this claim in the context of abortion and choosing whether to be for or against abortion rights. But polling does not support this. In fact, it shows young adults’ views on abortion rights are about the same as their elders — unlike issues like marijuana and gay marriage, where young people are more liberal.

Among adults aged 18 to 29, 58 percent said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and 39 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center poll. That was similar to those aged 30 to 49 (59 percent supported abortion, 38 percent opposed) and those aged 50 to 64 (56 percent supported, 37 percent opposed).

“But what I can’t understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion.”

— Pence

“Partial-birth abortion” is usually used to refer to later-term abortions using a specific fetus-extraction method.

Clinton has said she supports a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, as long as the health and the life of the mother are protected. As senator, Clinton opposed the Partial-Birth Abortion Act of 2003, which did not include a health exception.

Earlier this year, Clinton again said she is “on record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother.”

Kaine: “More nations should get nuclear weapons. Try to defend that.”

Pence: “Don’t put words in my mouth. Well, he never said that, Senator.”

Kaine: “He absolutely said it. Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan.”

Trump has, indeed, said that countries such as South Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia should have nuclear weapons because nuclear proliferation is inevitable. Trump has said that countries like Japan and South Korea would be “better off” if they were armed with nuclear weapons, in order to defend themselves from North Korea. And Trumps said he considers nuclear weapons a last resort, though he would not “rule anything out” regarding their use.

For example, during a CNN town hall in March, Trump was asked: “So if you said, Japan, yes, it’s fine, you get nuclear weapons, South Korea, you as well, and Saudi Arabia says we want them, too?”

Trump answered: “Can I be honest with you? It’s going to happen, anyway. It’s going to happen anyway. It’s only a question of time. They’re going to start having them or we have to get rid of them entirely. But you have so many countries already, China, Pakistan, you have so many countries, Russia, you have so many countries right now that have them.”

“She [Clinton] went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia.” — Kaine

This is an odd, inaccurate comment. The Russia-Georgia war took place in 2008, when Clinton was still a U.S. senator. Bush’s secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, lodged the protests. Whatever diplomatic pressure the Bush team had put on Russia over Georgia was abandoned when President Obama was elected and the administration decided to pursue the ill-fated “reset.”

Pence: “Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.” Kaine: “Ninety percent.”

Kaine gets this right, as Pence repeated a false claim that is popular on the right. The Clinton Foundation does not dole out grants, like a typical foundation, but instead directs the donations it raises directly for specified charitable activities. So simply only looking at the grants does not tell the whole story about the foundation’s activities.

The American Institute of Philanthropy’s “Charity Watch” gives the Clinton Foundation an “A” rating for its efficiency (the top rating is A+). It says the foundation spends 88 percent of its expenses on programs and 12 percent on overhead. It also says the Clinton Foundation spends just $2 to raise $100.

His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, on occasion made a factual misstep, but it didn’t even compare to Trump’s long list of exaggerations. Here’s a roundup of 25 interesting and suspect claims. As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debates.

“One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she’s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.” — Donald Trump

Trump mixes up a story about a long-ago criminal case. Clinton did not laugh at a rape victim.

In 1975, Clinton — then Hillary Rodham — was a 27-year-old law professor running a legal aid clinic in the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. After a 41-year-old factory worker was accused of raping a 12-year-old girl, he asked the judge to replace his male court-appointed attorney with a female one. The judge went through the list of a half-dozen women practicing law in the county and picked Clinton.

In her autobiography, “Living History,” Clinton wrote, “I told [prosecutor] Mahlon [Gibson] I really don’t feel comfortable taking on such a client, but Mahlon gently reminded me that I couldn’t very well refuse the judge’s request.” Gibson has confirmed that account in interviews with Newsday and CNN, saying Clinton told him: “I don’t want to represent this guy. I just can’t stand this. I don’t want to get involved. Can you get me off?”

Ultimately, the prosecution’s case fell apart for a number of reasons, including investigators mishandling evidence of bloody underwear, so in a plea agreement the charges were reduced from first-degree rape to unlawful fondling of a minor under the age of 14. Not until 2008 did the victim, Kathy Shelton, realize that Clinton had been the lawyer on the other side. She has since attacked Clinton for putting “me through hell,” and she appeared at a news event with Trump before the debate.

The rape case reemerged when the Washington Free Beacon in 2014 discovered unpublished audio recordings from the mid-1980s of Clinton being interviewed by Arkansas reporter Roy Reed for an article that was never published.

In the recorded interview, Clinton is heard laughing or giggling four times when discussing the case with unusual candor; the reporter is also heard laughing, and sometimes Clinton is responding to him.

Here are the four instances:

“Of course he [the defendant] claimed he didn’t [rape]. All this stuff. He took a lie detector test. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.” (Both Clinton and the reporter laugh.)

“So I got an order to see the evidence and the prosecutor didn’t want me to see the evidence. I had to go to Maupin Cummings [the judge] and convince Maupin that yes indeed I had a right to see the evidence before it was presented. (Clinton laughs lightly between “evidence” and “before.”)

“I handed it [a biography of her expert witness] to Mahlon Gibson, and I said, ‘Well this guy’s ready to come up from New York to prevent this miscarriage of justice.’” (Clinton laughs, as does the reporter.)

“So [Judge] Maupin had to, you know, under law he was supposed to determine whether the plea was factually supported. Maupin asked me to leave the room while he examined my client so that he could find out if it was factually supported. I said ‘Judge I can’t leave the room I’m his lawyer!’ he said ‘I know but I don’t want to talk about this in front of you.’” (Reporter says, “Oh God, really?” And they both laugh.)

Bill Clinton “had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who’s also here tonight.” — Trump

Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, alleged that in 1991 Clinton, while governor, propositioned her and exposed himself. She later filed a sexual harassment suit. The case was dismissed by a federal judge, who ruled that even if her allegations were true, such “boorish and offensive” behavior would not be severe enough to constitute sexual harassment under the law. That ruling was under appeal when Clinton in 1998 settled the suit for $850,000, with no apology or admission of guilt. All but $200,000 was directed to pay legal fees.

Your [Obamacare] health insurance is going up … 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent.” — Trump

Premiums are expected to increase overall in 2017, but Trump is cherry-picking from the highest proposed increases in the insurance marketplace.

Advertisement

State-by-state weighted average increases range from just 1.3 percent in Rhode Island to as high as 71 percent in Oklahoma. But the most common plans in the marketplace will see an average increase of 9 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s July analysis. These plans have been used as the benchmark to calculate government subsidies.

The vast majority of marketplace enrollees (about eight in 10) receive government premium subsidies. They are protected from a premium increase (and may even see a decrease) if they stay with a low-cost plan. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, “anecdotal examples of premium hikes or averages across insurers can provide a skewed picture of the increases marketplace enrollees will actually face.”

“You owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal — he’s another real winner that you have — and he’s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology.” — Trump

To support the debunked notion that Clinton’s campaign originated “birther” rumors during the 2008 presidential campaign, Trump once again referenced longtime Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal and Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle. But he’s grasping at straws — and once again refused to apologize for his own role in promoting the birther fable.

Advertisement

James Asher, former D.C. bureau chief of McClatchy, has said that Blumenthal “strongly urged” him to “investigate the exact place of President Obama’s birth, which he suggested was in Kenya.” McClatchy assigned a reporter to go to Kenya, and the reporter found the allegation was false, Asher said. (We reached out to Asher several times but did not receive a response.)

Blumenthal, declining to elaborate further, said in a statement to The Fact Checker: “This is false. Period. Donald Trump cannot distract from the fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie, and bears the responsibility for it.”

Solis Doyle said in a recent CNN interview that in December 2007, a volunteer coordinator in Iowa forwarded an email perpetuating the birther conspiracy. Clinton “made the decision immediately to let that person go,” Solis Doyle said in the interview.

As in the instance with the Iowa volunteer coordinator, the campaign denounced isolated instances of Clinton’s staffers questioning whether Obama was Muslim. We found that there’s no evidence that she or her campaign were “pressing it very hard” — though some of her supporters did perpetuate the claims in the bitter 2008 primary campaign against Obama.

“Hillary Clinton attacked those same women, attacked them viciously.” — Donald Trump

Trump has used this line of attack throughout the campaign, sometimes saying Hillary Clinton was an “enabler” of her husband’s affairs, saying she would “go after these women and destroy their lives.”

One of the interviews that Clinton’s critics have pointed to is a Jan. 27, 1998, interview on the “Today” show, saying it showed Clinton was discrediting allegations by then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky. This interview took place a week after her husband was accused of having an affair with Lewinsky, and Clinton blamed Republican foes for making false attacks against her husband.

Specifically, critics have pointed to this quote by Clinton:

“I mean, look at the very people who are involved in this, they have popped up in other settings,” Clinton told Matt Lauer. “This is the great story here, for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it, is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.”

This interview, by many accounts, was certainly pivotal to saving Bill Clinton’s presidency, as his wife forcefully backed him. But by Hillary Clinton’s account at the time, her husband had not yet admitted the Lewinsky affair to her. That did not happen until Aug. 15, 1998, according to her memoir.

Moreover, at the time of the interview, Lewinsky also denied there had been a relationship. Her lawyer had submitted an affidavit on Jan. 12 from her saying she “never had a sexual relationship with the president.” Lewinsky did not begin to testify before the independent prosecutor about the full extent of the relationship until July 27, six months after the “Today” show interview. Lewinsky testified for 15 days, after which the president finally confessed to his wife.

“Bill Clinton was abusive to those women.” — Trump

While Trump has ramped up the attacks on the Clintons and the sex allegations against Bill Clinton, the record shows that Trump dismissed or minimized these very allegations for many years. Trump dismissed the women involved as losers and not attractive. Trump even suggested that Americans would have been more forgiving if Clinton had slept with more beautiful women.

Here are some examples (see more here):

In 1998, Trump attacked Paula Jones, who had sued Clinton, alleging sexual harassment: “Paula Jones is a loser, but the fact is that she may be responsible for bringing down a president indirectly.”

In 1999, Trump faulted Bill Clinton for the way he handled the Lewinsky scandal, and complained about his choice in women: “He handled the Monica situation disgracefully. It’s sad because he would go down as a great president if he had not had this scandal. People would have been more forgiving if he’d had an affair with a really beautiful woman of sophistication. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe were on a different level. Now Clinton can’t get into golf clubs in Westchester. A former president begging to get in a golf club. It’s unthinkable.”

During a 2001 interview, Trump again expressed sympathy for Bill Clinton, arguing that the former president’s biggest mistake was answering questions about his sex life. Trump said he likes Clinton, and finds it all too easy to understand why the then-president found it hard to answer the question: “Did you f— Monica?” “What he should have done is fought for years not to answer it,” Trump said in the interview. “I mean, isn’t it amazing and terrible that a guy — a president — is put in that position? He could have gone down as truly great and, instead, you know, he’ll be viewed somewhat differently, which is really a shame.”

“When I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it’s a one-sided transaction where we’re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state.” — Trump

Trump always makes it sound like this is U.S. taxpayer money — and he always uses a too-high estimate. Because of international sanctions over its nuclear program, Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe. With sanctions lifted, in theory those funds would be unlocked.

But the Treasury Department has estimated that once Iran fulfills other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. (Much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in China.) For its part, the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion, not $55 billion.

“In San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment.” — Trump

There is no evidence this was the case in the 2015 terrorist attack that killed 14 people. There have been unconfirmed second- or third-hand reports — a friend of a friend of a neighbor — that a neighbor claimed to have noticed suspicious activity but did not report anything for fear of doing racial profiling. The religion of this supposed neighbor is unknown, but presumably a fear of racial profiling would suggest the neighbor was not Muslim.

“You [Clinton] get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.” — Trump

Trump is technically correct on the timeline, but Clinton’s staff had requested the emails to be deleted months before the subpoena, according to the FBI’s August 2016 report. Moreover, there’s no evidence Clinton deleted the emails in anticipation of the subpoena, and FBI director James B. Comey has said his agency’s investigation found no evidence that any work-related emails were “intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.”

PolitiFact compiled a helpful timeline of events relating to Clinton’s release of her emails, based on the FBI report. From their timeline:

On July 23, 2014, the State Department agreed to produce records pertaining to the 2012 attacks in Libya, for the House Select Committee on Benghazi’s investigation. In December 2014, Clinton aide Cheryl Mills told an employee of the company that managed her server to delete emails on her server unrelated to government work that were older than 60 days.

On March 4, 2015, the Benghazi Committee issued a subpoena requiring Clinton to turn over her emails relating to Libya. Three weeks later, between March 25 and March 31, the employee had an “oh s—” moment and realized he did not delete the emails that Mills requested in December 2014, he told the FBI. The employee then deleted the emails and used a program called BleachBit to delete the files.

“I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked.” — Trump

This is just totally false.

We have found no evidence of his early opposition. Trump expressed lukewarm support the first time he was asked about it on Sept. 11, 2002, and was not clearly against it until he was quoted in the August 2004 Esquire cover story titled, “Donald Trump: How I’d Run the Country (Better).”

But by the middle of 2004, many Americans had turned against the war, making Trump’s position not particularly unique. In light of Trump’s repeated false claim, Esquire has added an editor’s note to its August 2004 story, saying, “The Iraq War began in March 2003, more than a year before this story ran, thus nullifying Trump’s timeline.” We have awarded this claim Four Pinocchios, compiled a timeline of all of Trump’s comments prior to the invasion in March 2003, and even a video documenting how this is a bogus claim.

“Our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.” — Trump

Trump is simply wrong when he says the United States is the highest-taxed nation in the world.

Share this article Share

The Pew Research Center, using 2014 data, found that the tax bill for Americans, under various scenarios, is below average for developed countries.

In 2014, according to comparative tables of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product — the broadest measure of the economy — was 26 percent for the United States. Out of 34 countries, that put the United States in the bottom third — and well below the OECD average of 34.4 percent.

“[I] negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.” — Clinton

Clinton overstated the impact of the 2011 New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) agreement, which she helped negotiate as secretary of state.

New START placed tighter limits on deployed strategic weapons, but Russia was actually already meeting the treaty’s limits, for the most part, when the treaty’s implementation began. Indeed, Russia has increased deployed nuclear weapons from 1,537 in February 2011 to 1,796 in September of this year. Also, the treaty does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons, nor does it require them to destroy any existing weapons.

Russia’s total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline, from 40,000, since 1986. During Obama’s presidency, Russia’s nuclear warhead total has hovered around 4,500 since 2012.

“As soon as my routine audit is finished, I’ll release my taxes.” — Trump

Trump cites an Internal Revenue Service audit as his justification for not releasing his federal income tax returns, but the audit does not prohibit from releasing the returns. Richard Nixon, who started the tradition of presidents and presidential candidates releasing their returns, did so in the middle of an audit.

Moreover, Trump has not released his tax returns from before 2009, which are no longer under audit, according to his attorney.

Presidential candidates have no legal obligation to release their returns, but there has long been a tradition to do so for the sake of transparency. Hillary Clinton has released three decades’ worth of tax returns.

“Gaddafi’s out. It’s a mess. And by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.” — Trump

Trump is simply wrong.

The toppling of Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi — at the hands of Libyan rebels aided by U.S. and NATO air power — has led to highly unstable governance as the country’s tribes have vied for influence and power. There are rival governments based in the capital of Tripoli and the eastern city of Tobruk, and neither has fully recognized the “unity” government established by United Nations mediators.

The National Oil Corporation (NOC) claims to be operating independently without taking orders from either of the country’s rival governments, though a rival NOC appears to have been set up in the east. ISIS has attempted to step into the power vacuum. But not a single expert or news article that we consulted said that ISIS has grabbed a single oil field. Instead, militants appear to be trying to disrupt the flow of oil, mainly by scaring workers away.

Claudia Gazzini, a Tripoli-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, told The Fact Checker it was not true that the Islamic State has control of any Libyan oil.

“While it is true that ISIS has attacked oil fields in the Sirte basin area and destroyed key equipment there, they have not sought to keep control of the oil fields,” Gazzini said. “At the moment they appear to have adopted a hit-and-run strategy. There is no evidence that they are pumping out the crude oil and certainly no evidence that they are trading it. At the moment they just appear interested in starving the Libyan state of oil revenues.”

“Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.” — Trump

Trump made a ludicrous claim that U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens made 600 requests for help before he perished in the September 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi. This is a misunderstanding of a figure widely used by Republicans on the House Select Committee on Benghazi, but even they never claimed that these came from Stevens.

The Fact Checker delved deeply into this “600” figure. It is a subjective accounting of “requests and concerns,” not actual requests for help. There is no dispute that security was inadequate in Benghazi and that the State Department failed to respond to all requests for security. But the shorthand description of “600 requests” has left a misleading impression — so much so that many reporters and lawmakers appear to believe that all of these requests were ignored. At least some of the requests were actually fulfilled — and the counting of “concerns” may be subject to dispute.

“We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.” — Trump

Homicides were up 10.8 percent nationwide in 2015, the biggest percentage jump in a single year since 1971, according to FBI data. But violent crimes overall have been declining for about two decades, and are far below rates seen one or two decades ago.

Homicides have continued to spike in major cities this year, though the rates remain far below their peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Law enforcement officials, including the FBI, have voiced concerns about the uptick in crime in 2015.

Criminal justice experts warn against comparing crime trends from short periods of time, such as year over year. An annual trend can show a trajectory of where the trend might be headed but still not give a full picture. Many criminal justice experts say crime trends are determined over at least five years, preferably 10 or 20 years, of data.

“Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.” — Trump

Trump takes Clinton’s statement out of context. During a March 2016 town hall, Clinton was asked by a voter: “Make the case to poor whites who live in Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, who vote Republican, why they should vote for you based upon economic policies versus voting for a Republican?”

Clinton gave a lengthy response, which included the line, “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” It was part of her longer answer about how transitioning away from coal-powered plants has already affected mining communities, and her plan to help coal mine workers adjust after losing factory jobs, as explained in her November 2015 policy proposal for revitalizing coal communities.

Here’s her full answer. The portion that Trump cited is in bold.

Well, first of all, I was happy to carry those states you mentioned, and I carried the white vote in those states, too, that voted Democratic now, I don’t want to get carried away here. Look, we have serious economic problems in many parts of our country. And Roland is absolutely right. Instead of dividing people the way Donald Trump does, let’s reunite around policies that will bring jobs and opportunities to all these underserved poor communities. So for example, I’m the only candidate which has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity using clean renewable energy as the key into coal country. Because we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, right, Tim? And we’re going to make it clear that we don’t want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories.Now we’ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don’t want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.So whether it’s coal country or Indian country or poor urban areas, there is a lot of poverty in America. We have gone backwards. We were moving in the right direction. In the ’90s more people were lifted out of poverty than anytime in recent history. Because of the terrible economic policies of the Bush administration, President Obama was left with the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and people fell back into poverty because they lost jobs, they lost homes, they lost opportunities, and hope. So I am passionate about this, which is why I have put forward specific plans about how we incentivize more jobs, more investment in poor communities, and put people to work.

“There wasn’t ‘check out a sex tape.’ It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.” — Trump

This is easy to disprove. Let’s look at the tweet, sent at 5:30 a.m. regarding former Miss Universe Alicia Machado:

Trump claims that Machado is “no angel.” No sex tape has surfaced since Trump sent out the late-night tweet. But he clearly tweeted that people should “check out sex tape.”

“You go into the inner cities and you see it’s 45 percent poverty. African Americans, now, 45 percent [are in] poverty in the inner cities.” — Trump

It’s unclear what Trump’s source is on this one, and his campaign did not respond to our inquiry. In 2015, 24 percent of black people lived below poverty levels, according to the Census. Black people had the highest rate of poverty among all racial groups (21 percent of Hispanics, 11 percent of Asians and 11.6 percent of whites).

Moreover, the majority of black people do not live in the “inner city,” as the NAACP tweeted during the debate.

#Fact: the majority of black people in America don't live in the ""inner city"". — NAACP (@NAACP) October 10, 2016

Research shows that as of 2010, the majority of blacks, Asians and Latinos in metropolitan areas lived in the suburbs.

“There is a thing called clean coal.” — Trump

Coal is not clean. When burned in power plants, it emits sulfur dioxides, nitrous oxides and mercury unless coal-fired power plants have scrubbers to remove those from the air, thanks to regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency that Trump said was “so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.”

Coal also emits carbon dioxide, which the Supreme Court in 2007 said was a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. That carbon dioxide can only be removed from emissions at great cost, and the technique is not currently in use except in areas where it can be used for enhanced oil recovery.

Finally, the act of mining coal is not clean. It either involves open-pit mines or underground mines that often pollute waters. And coal-fired power plants also produce coal ash waste that is often kept in ponds that are prone to leaking.

Probably the major reason for the decline in coal use is the discovery of a way to tap into shale gas, which has brought down the price of natural gas. Many utilities are switching to natural gas.

“You know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.” — Clinton

Actually, the United States is still a net importer of crude oil and refined petroleum products. It imported 5.3 million barrels a day in July, according to the Energy Information Administration. That is, however, down sharply from the 13 million barrels a day of imports reached in 2006.

Clinton went onto say, “We are not dependent upon the Middle East.” That’s correct, but it’s been the case for years. Canada is the biggest source for American oil imports — more than the entire Persian Gulf combined.

“With all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.” — Trump

This is wrong. The Obama administration has admitted 12,500 refugees over the past fiscal year, which slightly exceeded a goal of 10,000. Even so, this is about one-third accepted by Canada, with a much smaller population.

Trump in the past has claimed that Clinton wants to admit 620,000 refugees in her first term. Clinton has supported accepting up to 65,000 refugees from Syria in one year. This is 55,000 more than the Obama administration’s plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year.

The 620,000 figure that Trump often uses is based in the unverified assumption that Clinton would continue at that pace for every year of her first term, on top of the Obama administration’s proposal for 100,000 total refugees for fiscal year 2017. (Multiply 155,000 four times and you reach 620,000.) After Trump made his comment about “hundreds of thousands,” moderator Martha Raddatz deftly noted that Clinton had asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000.

“Since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.” — Clinton

Clinton’s talking point is out of date. The Census Bureau reported in September that median income was up 5.2 percent from 2014 to 2015, to $56,516. This is the first annual increase in median household income since 2007, the year before the Great Recession.

“Last year, we had an almost $800 billion trade deficit. Other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It’s hard to believe. Inconceivable.” — Trump

The United States has a trade deficit of about $500 billion in goods and services. Trump appears to be referring the deficit in goods, which was nearly $800 billion in 2015, according to the Census Bureau.

“I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government — because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well — chose me to do the Old Post Office. … One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.” — Trump

This is not the full story. The federal government weighed several factors when considering bids for redevelopment of the Old Post Office building: 50 percent were qualitative (including past performance of the developer, site plan and design concept) and 50 percent were quantitative (developer’s financial capability and capacity and the developer’s financial offer).

Two factors weighed heavily in Trump’s favor: the financial backing of major real estate investor Colony Capital and the design by prominent architect Arthur Cotton Moore.

Trump had submitted the bid with Colony Capital as the financial backer, and the Trump Organization as the lead developer. The Washington Post’s Jonathan O’Connell wrote: “Colony is a major global investor in real estate, which bolstered Trump’s efforts to secure the deal. At the time, Colony had already invested $45 billion in more than 14,000 corporate and real estate assets, ranking it among the top real estate investment firms worldwide.”

But after the Trump Organization won the bid, Colony Capital backed out of the deal, saying that “the project’s timeline became too long for the firm.” The Trumps instead contributed $40 million to $42 million in equity and borrowed $170 million from Deutsche Bank.

The selection of Moore “bolstered the organization’s experience restoring or managing historic buildings in New York,” O’Connell wrote. Moore stepped down from the project less than a year after Trump won the bid. He told the New York Times: “I left because I couldn’t support what they were doing to the building. They were covering up or tearing out everything that was historic.”

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/10/15/records-week-review-trumps-list-accusers-grows/92073378/",0,"A former contestant on the reality show “The Apprentice” on Friday accused Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of aggressively kissing her and groping her breasts during a 2007 meeting to discuss a possible job at the Trump Organization. Summer Zervos, who appeared on the show in 2006 and now owns a California restaurant, spoke about the incident at a news conference alongside civil rights lawyer Gloria Allred.

At times tearing up, Zervos said the incident occurred at Trump’s bungalow hotel suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel, which she visited after he suggested the two have dinner.

Zervos said Trump greeted her with an “open-mouthed kiss” and then urged her to sit close to him on a love seat before kissing her again, groping her and trying to pull her into his bedroom. Zervos said she pushed Trump away and told him, “Come on, man, get real.”

She said Trump responded by mimicking her words, “Get real,” and “thrusting his genitals” in her direction.

Zervos’s accusations came as a number of other women have stepped forward in recent days to accuse Trump of groping them or kissing them inappropriately. Also Friday, The Washington Post published the account of Kristin Anderson, 46, who said Trump reached up her skirt and groped her during an encounter at a nightclub in the early 1990s.

In a statement, Trump said he “vaguely” remembered Zervos as an “Apprentice” contestant but that he “never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago.”

“That is not what I am as a person, and it is not how I’ve conducted my life,” he said, adding that Zervos had emailed him in April asking that he visit her restaurant in California. Trump blasted the media, saying reporters are “throwing due diligence and fact-finding to the side in a rush to file their stories first,” a sign, he said that “we truly are living in a broken system.”

Trump has categorically denied other accusations. At a rally in North Carolina, he called the women’s accounts “total fiction.” He called Jessica Leeds, who told the New York Times that Trump had groped her on an airplane in the 1980s, “that horrible woman” and suggested Leeds was not attractive enough to have drawn his interest. “Believe me, she would not be my first choice,” he said.

Zervos, like the other women who have lodged allegations in recent days, said she was compelled to speak after watching a video of Trump bragging to “Access Hollywood” in 2005 that he was able to sexually assault women because he is a celebrity.

Allred said Zervos is one of “many” women who have approached her in recent days to describe experiences with Trump. Allred said several friends and family members of Zervos could corroborate that she had told them of her experiences with Trump shortly after they allegedly occurred, but Allred did not release those statements Friday.

Zervos read aloud from the email she said that she sent Trump in April 2016, which she said was an attempt to see whether the increasingly high-profile presidential candidate would consider apologizing for his behavior. She said she wrote to Trump, through an assistant, that his behavior toward her “blew my mind.”

“I have been in­cred­ibly hurt by our previous interaction,” she said she wrote. She said she received no response.

Unlike several other of Trump’s accusers, who either barely knew the business executive or did not know him at all, Zervos said she had considered Trump a mentor and role model, even after she was fired from the boardroom game show.

She said she reached out to him a year after her “Apprentice” appearance when she was traveling to New York and asked to meet to discuss a possible job at the Trump Organization.

In his Trump Tower office, she said Trump was complimentary and sounded eager to hire her. Then, she said, she became uncomfortable when, as she was leaving, he kissed her on the mouth.

Zervos said she shared the experience at the time with a friend and her parents, who urged her to view the kiss as a form of greeting. Not long after, she said Trump called her to say he was visiting California and suggested the two have dinner to discuss the job.

Zervos said Trump became physical soon after she arrived at his suite in the Beverly Hills Hotel.

“He put me in an embrace, and I tried to push him away,” she said.

After she rejected his advances, Zervos said, Trump grew cold. She said they proceeded with their planned dinner and that Trump ordered a club sandwich for the two to share.

As they waited for dinner to arrive, Zervos recalled that Trump told her that “he did not think I had ever known love or had ever been in love.” Over dinner, he offered financial advice, suggesting that she should stop paying the mortgage on her home, leave the keys on a table and demand the bank make her a better deal, she said.

Trump soon said he was tired and urged her to leave, Zervos said. He did not cut off discussions of a possible job. Instead he suggested they meet the next day at his Rancho Palos Verdes golf course, where she was given a tour by the general manager. Ultimately, she said she was offered a job that paid half of what she had discussed with Trump.

Allred said Zervos has no plans to file a lawsuit and has no affiliation with any political campaign."

The poll was conducted during one of the most tumultuous periods of Trump’s candidacy, after the release of a video in which he spoke about taking sexual advantage of women and during a time when numerous women have accused him of sexual misconduct.

Nearly 7 in 10 respondents believe Trump probably made unwanted sexual advances, and a majority say his apology for boasts about forcing himself on women on a hot-mic videotape was insincere. Nonetheless, the controversy appeared to have had only a minimal impact on his overall support.

Overall, Clinton leads Trump by 47-43 percent among likely voters, a slight edge given the survey’s four-percentage-point error margin. Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson has the support of 5 percent, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein is at 2 percent. Among registered voters, the poll shows a similar four-point margin, with Clinton at 44, Trump at 40, Johnson at 6 and Stein at 3. In a two-way matchup, Clinton leads Trump by 50-46 percent among likely voters and by 50-44 percent among registered voters.

The current findings show only slight changes from the last Post-ABC survey, which was taken on the eve of the first presidential debate. At that time, Clinton held an insignificant two-point edge over Trump among likely voters. The findings are somewhat better for Trump than other polls taken since the video, but if Clinton were to maintain such an advantage until Election Day, that could translate into a sizable electoral college majority.

Supporters of both candidates are locked in, with 88 percent of Trump supporters and 89 percent of Clinton backers saying they will “definitely” support their current preference.

The survey also underscored the hardening of the lines between those supporting Trump and those who are not. One question in particular highlighted this divide. Asked whether it was appropriate for Trump to say that, if he were in charge of law enforcement in this country, his opponent would be in jail for her use of a private email server, about 4 in 10 likely voters said yes, compared with 57 percent who said no. More than 7 in 10 Republicans and more than 8 in 10 Trump supporters called the language appropriate.

There is clearly less enthusiasm on the part of Clinton’s and Trump’s supporters than previous nominees have enjoyed at this stage of the campaign. Fully 83 percent of Clinton’s backers and 79 percent of Trump’s supporters say they are very or somewhat enthusiastic about their candidate. Four years ago at this time, more than 90 percent of both President Obama’s and Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s supporters described themselves as enthusiastic.

Meanwhile, antipathy toward the other side is at extremely high levels, as 87 percent of likely voters supporting Trump have a “strongly unfavorable” view of Clinton, and 90 percent of Clinton backers have a strong negative view of Trump.

The Oct. 7 release of the 11-year-old “Access Hollywood” video, which captured Trump on a hot mic speaking in crude and degrading ways about women, brought a torrent of criticism on Trump and caused significant defections among Republican elected officials.

Trump issued a series of statements apologizing for what he said on the video, but nearly 6 in 10 likely voters say they do not think the apology was sincere, including more than one-fifth of Republicans and more than 6 in 10 independents. The poll also finds that slightly more than a third of all likely voters say the video will make them less likely to vote for him, including 13 percent of Republicans.

Trump denied during the second presidential debate that he had ever engaged in the kind of behavior he talked about in the video. He held that position when confronted days later by accusations from multiple women who said he had groped them.

The Post-ABC poll indicates that an overwhelming majority of likely voters doubt those denials, with 68 percent saying Trump probably has made unwanted sexual advances on women and 14 percent saying he probably has not. Almost half of Republicans think he has probably engaged in such behavior, while 22 percent say he has not, and the rest have no opinion.

Trump repeatedly tried to brush aside his comments as “locker room banter.” Asked whether his comments are typical of locker room talk among men, just more than 4 in 10 likely voters said yes, while 52 percent said it was “beyond how men typically talk.”

There was little difference in the way men and women answered this question: About 4 in 10 men and 4 in 10 women say this is typical locker room talk. There was a significant variance among white voters based on levels of education, however, with 53 percent of whites without college degrees calling it typical and 55 percent of whites with college degrees saying it went beyond typical conversation among men.

As he has come under criticism on the issue of his treatment of women, Trump has countered by pointing to Bill Clinton, saying that what the former president did and has been accused of doing regarding women is far worse. Trump also has accused Hillary Clinton of intimidating her husband’s accusers.

This line of attack finds support among only a minority of voters. When asked to compare the two issues — Trump’s vs. Bill Clinton’s treatment of women or what Hillary Clinton did on behalf of her husband — there is no equivalence. While 55 percent say the issue of Trump’s treatment of women is a legitimate issue in the campaign, 62 percent say what Hillary Clinton may have done is not a legitimate issue, and 67 percent say Bill Clinton’s treatment is not a legitimate issue.

Both Clinton and Trump are viewed unfavorably by majorities of Americans. Clinton’s current net negative is 14 points (42 percent favorable and 56 percent unfavorable), while Trump’s is 25 points (37 percent favorable and 62 percent unfavorable).

At the same time, neither is viewed as honest and trustworthy, with 60 percent of likely voters saying Clinton is not and 62 percent saying Trump is not.

A slight majority (52 percent) say Clinton does not have strong moral character, and a much larger 66 percent say Trump does not have it. On these questions, there are significant and predictable partisan differences in perceptions of the candidates, yet 30 percent of likely voters who support Trump say he doesn’t have a strong moral character. Three times as many of his supporters say Clinton lacks it.

On two other attributes, however, Clinton is viewed positively and Trump is viewed negatively, and these help to highlight the obstacles that remain in Trump’s path as he attempts to make up ground lost over the past month.

Six in 10 say Clinton is qualified to be president, consistent with views of her readiness over many months. Meanwhile, almost 6 in 10 (57 percent) of likely voters say Trump is not qualified, also a level that has moved little through the course of the general election.

On the question of fitness — who has the kind of personality and temperament to serve as president — there is a similar mismatch between the candidates. Almost 6 in 10 likely voters say Clinton has the right temperament, while 62 percent say Trump does not.

Trump also has no advantage in trust to handle a series of major campaign issues. He is roughly even with Clinton in trust to handle the economy, terrorism and immigration, but he trails on handling ethics in government and by large margins on dealing with an international crisis, advocating women’s rights and looking out for the middle class.

Perceptions of Trump on these issues and attributes have changed only a little in the aftermath of the “Access Hollywood” video, in part perhaps because he was judged so negatively before the video became public. Taken together, the findings on these questions point to what could be a hard ceiling in Trump’s support, which he so far has been unable to change. Republicans have urged him for months to become more disciplined and to demonstrate greater stability as a candidacy.

His last big opportunity to do so will come on Wednesday when he and Clinton meet in Las Vegas for their final debate. Many Republicans said after the second debate that Trump had done well in making his arguments as a change candidate while portraying Clinton as part of a failed status quo. But at 45 percent to 33 percent, more likely voters say Clinton prevailed in the town hall debate in St. Louis.

The Post-ABC poll was conducted Oct. 10-13 among a random national sample of 1,152 adults reached on cellular and landline phones. The margin of sampling error for overall results is plus or minus three percentage points; the margin of error is 3.5 points among the sample of 920 registered voters and four points among the sample of 740 likely voters."

http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/19/politics/presidential-debate-highlights/index.html",0,"Donald Trump’s defiant assault on the presidential election’s integrity reverberated Thursday among his allies and rivals as the GOP campaign and Hillary Clinton’s inner circle argued over how best to face the outcome after the votes are counted. Trump on Wednesday amplified one of the most explosive charges of his candidacy: that if he loses the election, he might consider the results illegitimate because the process is “rigged.”

Questioned directly as to whether he would accept the outcome should Democratic nominee Clinton prevail Nov. 8, Trump demurred. “I’ll keep you in suspense,” the Republican nominee said. Clinton called Trump’s answer “horrifying,” saying he was “talking down our democracy.”

Trump reiterated the point after flying to Columbus, Ohio, to campaign Thursday, joking, “I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election — if I win.”

He added later, on a more serious note, “Of course I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result, right?”

At a rally at a downtown Charlotte brewery, one of two to kick off North Carolina’s early voting period, Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine said that Trump’s claims of a “rigged” election reminded him of the Third World politicking he had seen as a missionary in Honduras.

“We have a tradition unbroken back to the beginning of this nation,” Kaine said. “He wouldn’t defend our democracy, but he wouldn’t condemn Vladimir Putin’s attempts to tinker with our democracy.”

Kaine also used his speech to criticize the Republican-run North Carolina state legislature for passing a voter ID bill that a federal court later overturned after finding evidence of racial discrimination. There was a difference, said Kaine, between legal efforts to extend voting rights and claims of a “rigged” election.

“If there’s a legitimate concern on Election Day, sure, we’re going to let a court figure it out,” Kaine said.

Kaine said it was important for the Democratic ticket to win by a large margin. “The bigger we can win by, the harder it is for him to whine and have anyone believe him,” he said.

A new Clinton fundraising pitch made the same point Thursday. “We’ve got to beat [Trump] so definitively that Hillary’s victory is undeniable,” read the email to donors. “We need to build up our ground game even more if we want to make that a reality.”

Memorable quotes from Clinton and Trump’s final presidential debate + 19 Here are some memorable quotes from the presidential debate in Las Vegas.

Even as the two campaigns exchanged barbs, President Obama and his wife Michelle hit the campaign trail on Clinton’s behalf. The first lady spoke in Phoenix, a sign that Democrats now see traditionally conservative Arizona as a state they could possibly capture this year.

First lady Michelle Obama delivered a stirring endorsement of “our friend, Hillary” during the campaign rally in Phoenix. She praised men and women from across the country who have written to her in recent days and bemoaned the dark turn the election has taken in recent weeks, blasting Trump’s divisive rhetoric.

“Look at us. Just look at us. We all know better, we all know better. Whether we’re Democrats, Republicans or indpendents, it does not matter,” she said. “We all understand that an attack on any one of us is an attack on all of us. And we know that that is not who we are.”

She called the 2016 election a “crossroads” and said that Clinton’s “powerful” vision of America is backed by “policies to make that vision a reality.”

“Hillary has comprehensive policies to help people. Her opponent has tweets. You decide,” she said.

The first lady also blasted Trump for his suggestion Wednesday night that he may not consider the election results legitimate if he loses.

“You do not keep American democracy in suspense. Because look, too many people have marched and protested and fought and died for this democracy,” she said.

Meanwhile, the president spoke to a rowdy crowd of about 2,800 in Miami. He said Trump’s suggestion that there’s vote rigging “is more than just the usual lie.”

“That is not a joking matter. That is dangerous,” he said. “That undermines our democracy.”

While Clinton and Trump made their distaste for each other clear during their last debate, they will find themselves in the same room again Thursday night at the Al Smith charity dinner at New York’s Waldorf Astoria hotel. The white-tie dinner, which benefits Catholic charities, is a tradition-bound affair featuring comedic speeches by politicians.

Clinton, who arrived in White Plains, N.Y., at 5:30 a.m., has no public events scheduled before then.

Aboard her campaign plane Wednesday night, the Democratic nominee attacked Trump’s refusal to say he would accept the election results. “Our country has been around for 240 years, and we’re a country based on laws, and we have hot, contested elections going back to the very beginning. But one of our hallmarks has always been that we accept the outcomes of our election.”

A handful of GOP senators — including Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and Arizona’s Jeff Flake and John McCain — have criticized Trump’s stance.

McCain, who lost to President Obama in 2008, said in a statement: “I didn’t like the outcome of the 2008 election. But I had a duty to concede. A concession isn’t just an act of graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, an act that is every American leader’s first responsibility.”

The campaign took yet another unexpected turn Thursday morning when Trump suggested that Clinton had gotten the questions to Wednesday’s debate in advance. “Why didn’t Hillary Clinton announce that she was inappropriately given the debate questions — she secretly used them! Crooked Hillary,” he tweeted.

Many Republicans have questioned the debate process in the wake of a recent WikiLeaks revelation that interim Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile may have shared a question in advance of a CNN town hall in March. In an email to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Brazile — a CNN contributor at the time — wrote, “From time to time I get the questions in advance,” and highlighted the issue of the death penalty.

Clinton received a question right along those same lines the next day.

Trump picked up on that theme during his Columbus speech, saying his opponent received “the exact questions to a previous debate, word for word, by Donna Brazile, who is now under tremendous pressure to resign from the DNC, as she should be.”

“That is cheating at the highest level,” he said, as the crowd booed at the mention of Brazile’s name. “But I ask you, why shouldn’t Hillary Clinton resign from the race?”

In an interview with Fox host Megyn Kelly on Wednesday night, Brazile rejected the allegations of improper collusion with the Clinton campaign.

“I am not going to try to validate falsified information,” she said. “I do my homework, I communicate, I talk. CNN has never provided me with questions.”

Some of Trump’s supporters were also circulating a different debate theory on social media Thursday: that the glow emanating from a screen on Clinton’s lectern proved she was learning Fox moderator Chris Wallace’s questions in advance.

The Democratic nominee quickly turned the accusation into a fundraising pitch, retweeting it with the line, “Show Trump his tweets come at a cost — because Hillary supporters are pledging to donate every time he tweets.”

The sparring between the two camps came after the two parties’ candidates got into fiery exchanges over their fitness to serve as president and character traits Wednesday night.

But over the course of the third and final debate, they delved deeper into their substantive differences than they did in the first two forums and offered a clearer contrast in the directions they would take the country. They drew sharp distinctions on the economy, trade, terrorism, immigration and hot-button social issues including abortion and guns.

Russian President Vladimir Putin loomed as an unseen third presence onstage. Clinton and Trump sparred over which of them would be more effective as commander in chief in dealing with his aggression and Russian cyberattacks. Clinton labeled Trump as Putin's “puppet” — prompting Trump to snap back, “You’re the puppet!” — while Trump charged that Putin had “outsmarted and outplayed” her when she was secretary of state.

After Clinton cited the findings of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies that the Russian government had committed espionage — including by hacking Pdesta’s emails — to interfere in the U.S. election, Trump said he did not agree with that conclusion.

“Hillary, you have no idea,” Trump said. “Our country has no idea.”"

http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/27/politics/clinton-hack-wikileaks-collateral-damage/",0,"On the day the news broke that Hillary Clinton had used a private email account as secretary of state, the man who would soon be named to chair her presidential campaign fired off a note of distress, venting frustration about some of Clinton’s closest aides. “Speaking of transparency, our friends Kendall, Cheryl and Phillipe sure weren’t forthcoming on the facts here,” John Podesta complained in the March 2015 note, referring to Clinton’s personal lawyer, David Kendall, as well as former State Department staffers Cheryl Mills and Philippe Reines.

“Why didn’t they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy,” replied Neera Tanden, a longtime Podesta friend who also has worked for Clinton. Then, answering her own question, Tanden wrote again: “I guess I know the answer. They wanted to get away with it.”

The exchange, found in hacked emails from Podesta’s account and released Tuesday by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, provides a striking window into how the revelation of Clinton’s email setup roiled her nascent campaign team in the weeks before its official April 2015 kickoff.

The emails show that while aides struggled to get past the public controversy, they also expressed exasperation at each other and, at times, at Clinton — both for her decision to use the server and for the way she handled questions about it. Several exchanges illustrate fears among some top advisers that Clinton and other aides were demonstrating the very traits that polls suggested made her vulnerable: a penchant for secrecy and a hesitancy to admit fault or error.

“We’ve taken on a lot of water that won’t be easy to pump out of the boat,” Podesta wrote to Tanden in September 2015, at a time when Clinton’s campaign feared that Vice President Biden was about to enter the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. “Most of that has to do with terrible decisions made pre-campaign, but a lot has to do with her instincts.”

Tanden responded, “Almost no one knows better [than] me that her instincts can be terrible.”

Tanden and Kendall declined to comment. Neither Reines nor a lawyer for Mills responded to requests for comment.

Clinton’s campaign has largely declined to comment on the WikiLeaks emails, which U.S. officials say were stolen through hacks of Democratic groups and leaders orchestrated by the Russian government. Clinton aides have declined to authenticate the emails, noting that the Russians have been known to doctor documents, but they have not disputed any specific revelation from Podesta’s email trove.

Instead, Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin on Tuesday responded to questions about the internal campaign struggles revealed in the emails by attacking GOP nominee Donald Trump for his recent comments disputing U.S. government findings that the Kremlin was behind the hacks and for “cheering on WikiLeaks’ Russian-directed propaganda.”

Though the WikiLeaks disclosures have not contained the sort of campaign-shaking bombshell that some Trump backers had hoped for, the Podesta emails have provided an almost unprecedented historical archive of the inner workings of a major-party presidential campaign.

Hillary Clinton’s campaign comes to an end + 54 Hillary Clinton loses to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

Some of the emails include private and contemporaneous assessments of the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses by advisers widely seen as likely to hold top posts in Clinton’s White House should she win.

They show that in August 2015, months after the New York Times revealed Clinton’s use of a private account and after the Associated Press identified her private server, Clinton’s aides were still struggling to persuade the candidate that she should show remorse for her email practices.

By that time, the FBI had opened an investigation into whether classified material had been mishandled through Clinton’s use of the server.

Some of the most frank commentary can be seen in exchanges between two friends and frequent correspondents: Podesta, a longtime Clinton hand who founded the powerhouse liberal think tank Center for American Progress, and Tanden, a former top aide to Clinton’s 2008 presidential run who now heads the center. Both are strong supporters of Clinton and her presidential bid. In another email released by WikiLeaks, Tanden referred to herself as a “loyal soldier” who would “do whatever Hillary needs always.” Their email exchanges often appear to have been written out of concern for Clinton’s best interests.

“I know this email thing isn’t on the level. I’m fully aware of that,” Tanden wrote in an August 2015 note to Podesta. “But her inability to just do a national interview and communicate genuine feelings of remorse and regret is now, I fear, becoming a character problem (more so than honesty).”

On Sept. 4, Clinton gave an interview to NBC News's Andrea Mitchell, saying that she was ""sorry that this has been confusing to people"" but otherwise dodging questions about whether she apologized for her actions.

Tanden wrote later that day: “Everyone wants her to apologize. And she should. Apologies are like her Achilles heel.”

Three days later, Clinton had still not apologized, even as the issue dominated campaign news coverage. “This apology thing has become like a pa­thol­ogy,” Tanden wrote. “I can only imagine what’s happening in the campaign. Is there some way I can be helpful here?”

Podesta replied: “You should email her. She can say she’s sorry without apologizing to the American people. Tell her to say it and move on, why get hung on this.”

Finally, the next day, Clinton told ABC News that her use of the server had been a ""mistake."" ""I'm sorry about that. I take responsibility,"" she said.

The WikiLeaks disclosures reveal how, from the earliest days of the campaign, some advisers and staffers feared that Mills — who had served in the White House counsel’s office during the Republican investigations of the 1990s and then was Clinton’s chief of staff at the State Department — enabled Clinton’s tendencies to hunker down.

In her March 2015 exchange with Podesta about the email controversy, Tanden lay the blame squarely at Mills’s feet.

“This is a cheryl special,” Tanden wrote. “Know you love her, but this stuff is like her Achilles heal. Or kryptonite. she just can’t say no to this s---.”

Mills has no formal relationship with the campaign but, the emails show, consults frequently about all major decisions. If Clinton wins, Mills could assume a significant role in the White House.

The emails show, at one point, similar skepticism of Mills from campaign manager Robbie Mook, the young operative Clinton appointed to build an operation that would avoid the personality clashes and internal dramas that plagued her 2008 presidential bid.

In February 2015, Mook complained to Podesta that Mills was going around him to vet campaign contractors. “It is secretly going around a transparent system we all agreed upon,” he wrote. “The secret s--- has got to stop. It’s a giant time suck.”

The emails also show a fondness among Clinton’s staff for her strengths and genuine enthusiasm when she did well in interviews or other public appearances. After Clinton appeared on “Face the Nation” in September 2015, an ally wrote to Podesta to praise her appearance. “Thought she was really good. Really good,” he wrote, before adding: “She sometimes laughs a little too hard at jokes that aren’t that funny. Other than that.”

Podesta responded with humor: “Laughing too hard,” he wrote, “is her authentic weirdness.”"

The tracking poll finds little shift in Clinton's overall support following news of the FBI's renewed look at Clinton emails, but strong enthusiasm among her supporters fell behind Trump in combined Saturday and Sunday interviews. By 53 to 43 percent, more Trump supporters say they are ""very enthusiastic"" about him, compared with Thursday and Friday when Trump's edge was negligible (53 percent vs. 51 percent).

Voter enthusiasm has been in short supply for both Clinton and Trump through the fall campaign and continues to lag excitement about candidates on the ballot four years ago. At this point in 2012, 64 percent of Obama supporters said they were ""very enthusiastic"" about him; Romney was only narrowly behind at 61 percent.

Trump and Clinton continue to run nearly even in overall vote preferences, with Trump at 46 percent and Clinton 45 percent in a four-way contest in the poll conducted Thursday through Sunday. The margin is a mirror 48-47 Clinton-Trump split when third-party candidates are asked which major-party candidate they lean toward, a comparison that has grown in importance as support declines steadily for Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party's Jill Stein.

What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail + 57 The GOP presidential nominee is pressing his case ahead of Election Day.

Over 1 in 5 likely voters identified in the Post-ABC poll report having already voted (21 percent), while about one-quarter say they plan to vote early or by mail (24 percent,) and a slight majority plan to vote in person on Election Day. The level of early voting so far is roughly in line with expectations, given the 24.7 million early votes tracked so far by the United States Election Project, which amounts to 19 percent of the 129 million ballots cast in 2012.

Clinton has a modest 54-41 percent edge among early voters in an average of the three most recent tracking poll waves, while Trump leads by a 50-39 percent margin among those looking to vote on Election Day; those who anticipate voting early are more evenly split. Those breakdowns should be treated with caution, given both the sizable 8.5-point margin of sampling error around that result as well as general challenges in tracking attitudes among a rapidly growing population.

Older Americans have flocked to vote early, with 38 percent of senior likely voters saying they have done so, compared with 18 percent of those ages 40 to 64 and 17 percent of voters younger than that. Women are slightly more apt to report voting early than men (26 vs. 19 percent), as are voters in urban areas (28 percent) compared with suburban and rural voters (19 percent and 22 percent).

The daily tracking poll's latest four-night wave finds voters splitting sharply along traditional political divisions, with Trump's previously lagging support among core Republican groups now nearly matching Clinton's wide support on the left. Trump holds 78 percent support among white evangelical Protestants, 77 percent among conservatives, 68 percent among rural voters and 59 percent among white men. Clinton answers with 81 percent support among liberals, 67 percent of those identifying with no religion, 60 percent of those in urban areas and 72 percent among nonwhites.

Clinton and Trump receive similar support among fellow partisans, but Trump maintains an 18-point edge among political independents, significantly higher than Republicans have held in recent elections. Looking deeper at that group over a seven-day stretch, 77 percent of independents who say they lean Democratic prefer Clinton while a similar 80 percent who lean Republican favor Trump. But Trump holds a sizable 53-28 percent advantage among voters who say they don't lean toward either party, a group that accounts for about 10 percent of likely voters.

http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/10/media/election-day-polls/",0,"UPDATE: This post was originally published in late December. I'm reposting it in light of President Donald Trump's tweets this morning about polling being wrong. Donald Trump’s poll and forecast-defying victory Tuesday immediately raised criticisms of a crisis in public opinion polling, with CNN anchor Jake Tapper saying the result would put the polling and voter projection industry “out of business.”

Election pollsters have already been under scrutiny after high-profile polling mishaps around the world, from the close Brexit vote earlier this year to the defeat Colombia's referendum making peace with FARC rebels. In the United States, Hillary Clinton's surprise victory in the 2008 Democratic New Hampshire presidential primary prompted a comprehensive report on potential causes of the errors in by the American Association for Public Opinion Research.

Survey researchers expressed varying levels of concern Wednesday about the significance of polling inaccuracies and theories on the causes. “The final high quality scientific RDD landline/cellphone national polls consistently overestimated Clinton’s share of the vote by 3 or 4 percentage points,” Jon Krosnick said in an email. Krosnick is a professor of political science at Stanford University and a widely respected expert on survey methods. “That’s a systematic error but not huge.” (Update: Final vote counts show the average of national polls overestimated Clinton’s share of the two-party vote by about one percentage point.)

Krosnick said he was not surprised by the inaccuracy of state polls, reasoning that “most state polls are not scientific — either they involve volunteer respondents instead of randomly sampled respondents, or they involve automated calling to landlines only, omitted cellphone only people.”

Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray expressed greater concern about the way polls missed Trump’s support. “There’s a significant anti-establishment mood that polls didn’t catch — it caught some of it but not all of it,” Murray said in an interview Wednesday. “We might come to a conclusion that polls lose their precise predictive power and are best as general gauges of the mood of the electorate instead of predicting electoral outcomes.”

The causes of polling errors are typically hazy in the immediate wake of election results, due in no small part to votes continuing to be tallied well after Election Day. But even with incomplete data, it’s worth assessing how much polls differed from results and why they led to a surprising result.

An analysis of 145 polls nationally and in 16 states completed within one week of the election shows a number of interesting results. The magnitude of national and state survey errors was not far from historical levels; the more troublesome dynamic was that errors systematically overestimated Clinton’s vote margin against Trump, leading to parallel errors that did not catch a number of key states moving into Trump’s column.

Clinton won the national popular vote by two percentage points according to certified vote tallies compiled by David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report. Most individual surveys found Clinton holding a small single-digit edge over Trump, averaging to a three-point margin. Looking across individual national polls, the average difference from the final Clinton-Trump vote margin is 2.2 percentage points, much smaller than the level of error apparent when they were compared to preliminary vote results (3.4 points).

The National Council on Public Polls (NCPP for short) has analyzed the accuracy of national surveys dating back to the 1930s, using a metric called “candidate error,” which is the difference between the winning candidate’s margin over the losing candidate minus a poll’s margin, then divided by two.

The average candidate error in national polls for 2016 is 1.1, slightly lower than in 2012 (1.5) and just slightly higher than 2008 and 2004 (0.9 each) The overall size of errors this year is just below the average since 1992 (1.3) and about half the all-time average of 2.2. National poll error in the infamous 1948 election polls was nearly five times as large as 2016 (5 points).

The current estimate of candidate error in national polls is 1.7 (half of 3.4 above), slightly higher than 2012 and clearly larger than 2008 (0.9). The overall size of errors this year is a bit higher than the 1.3 average since the 1990s but below the all-time average of 2.2 and spikes in the early years, including a 5-point error in the infamous 1948 election.

One important caveat to this is that there are multiple different measures of polling accuracy — some focus on absolute estimates in support while others focus on the margin between candidates — and trends among these measures can yield varying conclusions. A different measure of national polling errors based on the difference in candidate’s estimated support and their vote share finds an average difference of between 2.9 and 3.3, with smaller errors for results that left third party candidates out.

Surveys across 17 states, including key battlegrounds, found a higher error of 1.7 using the candidate error metric, which is similar to the level of error found in all state-level surveys in 2004 (1.7), 2008 (1.8) and 2012 (1.9).

While the absolute size of most errors was far from unusual, the state-by-state results show how polling systematically showed a better picture for Clinton before Election Day. The largest consequential swing from pre-election polls to results was in Wisconsin, where Clinton averaged a six-point edge in the final week but lost the state, trailing by one-point in current tallies.

Trump won in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida despite polls showing Clinton ahead by narrow margins (especially in Florida). He won by a four-point margin in North Carolina, which appeared even in final pre-election polls, and far exceeded his slight advantages in Ohio and Iowa pre-election polls, winning both states comfortably.

Looking across all these states, Trump’s polling margin was three percentage points better than pre-election polls estimated. What’s striking is that many of these surveys did not miss by much — a majority came within four percentage points of the final vote margin. Yet while 52 showed Clinton faring at least four points better than the final margin, only three surveys showed Trump outperforming his final margin by that much.

Many of these two-plus differences are small enough to fall within the margin of sampling error, though taken in the aggregate they show a consistent bias. A similar dynamic occurred four years ago, with surveys underestimating Barack Obama’s margin of victory.

If only sampling error were at play, errors should be evenly scattered around population target. Assumptions of sampling error only apply to probability samples in the mix, of course, and the pattern of results suggests other types of error are at play.

Krosnick, of Stanford, suggested the answer may lie in how pollsters select likely voters and handle respondents who are less certain to vote.

“I hope those pollsters enlist teams of experts to work with them to try to figure out what happened,” said Krosnick, suggesting such teams stitch together large numbers to make estimates of small geographic areas that can be compared to election returns. “But regardless, that result in itself is not a reason to claim pollsters face a crisis.”

Both Krosnick and Monmouth’s Murray suggested exploring potential biases due to survey refusals and social desirability, such as respondents concealing their true vote preference to avoid potentially offending an interviewer. Research during the election season found mixed evidence for this, but there have been limited public examinations during the campaign.

“There might be a certain segment of the population that was not going to talk to a pollster,” Murray said. “They were going to prove us all wrong.”

The upcoming choice of a new Democratic National Committee chairman could become an early proxy fight between the establishment wing of the party, embodied by Clinton, and the party’s more liberal members, many of them aligned with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the party’s runner-up in the Democratic primaries.

Sanders and other liberal lawmakers and advocacy groups say the DNC needs to be reimagined as less of an insider’s club focused on raising money and more of an advocate for the working-class voters won over Tuesday by the Republican president-elect.

With Clinton’s loss, the DNC chairman is certain to become a more visible face of the Democratic Party, and the contest to replace interim chairwoman Donna Brazile now appears to be a wide-open affair. Brazile stepped in for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who announced her resignation in July after the release of a trove of hacked emails that suggested that the DNC was aiding Clinton in preference to Sanders in the primaries.

Had Clinton won Tuesday, she would have been expected to name a political ally to head the DNC.

The candidate garnering the most early attention is Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a favorite of liberal advocacy groups and a Muslim — a fact that his supporters argue would send a strong signal about the party’s diversity during Trump’s tenure.

Support for Ellison has extended beyond his liberal base; already backed by Sanders, he won the endorsement Friday of Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is expected to be the next Senate minority leader.

Ellison plans to announce his bid for the chairmanship Monday.

Sanders said he thinks a DNC “preoccupied” with raising large sums of money from wealthy donors was partly responsible for Tuesday’s loss.

“You can’t tell working people you’re on their side while at the same time you’re raising money from Wall Street and the billionaire class,” Sanders said. “The Democratic Party has to be focused on grass-roots America and not wealthy people attending cocktail parties.”

On a conference call Saturday between Clinton and her top donors, her finance director, Dennis Cheng, said Clinton’s fundraising operation had raised $972 million for her campaign, the DNC and state parties. Of that amount, 56 percent was “generated by the people on this call,” Cheng said.

In total, the campaign held more than 1,500 fundraisers, of which Clinton attended nearly 400 herself, and more than 3 million people made donations, Cheng said.

Sanders acknowledged the need for the party to continue its function as a fundraising vehicle but suggested a model akin to his presidential campaign, which raised much of its money from small-dollar donors.

“Millions of people are willing to put in 20 bucks, 30 bucks, 50 bucks if there’s a party to believe in,” he said.

His views have been echoed by several liberal groups that are supportive of Ellison.

""The Democratic establishment had their chance with this election,"" said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. ""It's time for new leadership of the Democratic Party — younger, more diverse and more ideological — that is hungry to do things differently, like leading a movement instead of dragging people to the polls.""

Those more closely aligned with Clinton are cautioning against overreacting to an election in which she appears to have won the popular vote. Among at least eight hopefuls for chairman who have emerged, still others are billing themselves as unifiers between Clinton and Sanders supporters.

Those include former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, who said Friday that he is taking a “hard look” at seeking the chairmanship. O’Malley, who ended his presidential bid after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses, said he thinks he was the second choice of many Sanders supporters and that many Clinton supporters have encouraged him to seek the DNC role.

Share this article Share

“That puts me in a unique position right now to bridge that divide,” said O’Malley, who previously headed the Democratic Governors Association. “We need to come together. We need to start acting like a party again.”

At least four of those hoping to become party chairman are Latino, a sign of that demographic’s growing clout within the party.

During a conference call Thursday with members of the liberal advocacy group Democracy for America, Ellison said the party needs to become more of a presence in local communities across the country. He argued that television advertising and sophisticated data analysis of voter behavior is no substitute “for getting Dems together around a pot of chili and getting to know them.”

Already, Ellison has come under fire from some Democrats who argue that their party needs a full-time chairman and that his continuing to serve in Congress would make that impossible.

Former Vermont governor Howard Dean, who served as DNC chairman a decade ago, announced plans to try to regain the position and made the case for a full-time role.

“Look, I like Keith Ellison a lot,” Dean said during a Friday appearance on MSNBC. “He’s a very good guy. There’s one problem: You cannot do this job and sit in a political office at the same time. It’s not possible.”

That view was echoed Friday by longtime Democratic operative Harold Ickes: ""I do think there's a very strong argument for a full-time DNC chair, especially for a party out of power.""

Henry Muñoz III, the DNC’s national finance chairman who helped Clinton collect millions of dollars for her campaign, said Friday that he is considering a bid for party chairman but also is in touch with other Hispanic leaders about ensuring that the DNC more properly represents Latino concerns.

“The one thing that is abundantly clear is that the Latino community held up their end of the bargain,” Muñoz said. “We did deliver on our promise.”

Hispanics accounted for at least 11 percent of all voters on Election Day, according to national exit polls — a one-percentage-point increase from the 2012 presidential election.

Muñoz said the participation of Latinos would have been even greater if the party had been more attuned to their concerns in the past four years.

In addition to Muñoz, outgoing Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) and Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) are said to be considering running for chairman. Muñoz confirmed that he is in touch with all of them.

On the basis of the wide interest, “I expect our perspective will be presented up front in the talks about the DNC going forward,” he said.

“I think we’re a long way from making a pick,” he added.

Gallego, 36, a former U.S. Marine corporal who represents most of the Phoenix area, is popular with younger congressional Democrats and is seen as a rising figure in a new generation of Democratic leaders. Becerra, who was an avid campaigner for Clinton, is said to be considering the DNC job now that he will not have an opportunity to serve in a Clinton Cabinet, as he had expected.

Another potential contender eyeing the race is Jaime Harrison, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party. Harrison said the next DNC chairman should focus far more on helping build the state Democratic parties, including his, across the country.

“There’s no party-building that’s taking place,” he said. “It becomes in­cred­ibly difficult to recruit candidates.”

Jason Kander, who lost the Senate race in Missouri to Roy Blunt (R) on Tuesday, also is considering a run for chairman, according to people close to him.

Some longtime Democrats say the race has probably begun prematurely — particularly as the party is still mourning Clinton’s loss.

Former national chairman Don Fowler, a fixture in South Carolina, said, “I think it’s somewhat ill-advised for people to get in and try to do all of this during a funeral.”"
3566,3566,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/17/fed-still-likely-to-hike-interest-rates-in-december-despite-election-result/,0,"The Federal Reserve appears on track to raise interest rates in December, but its plans to continue a gradual tightening of monetary policy next year could shift depending on what policies President-elect Donald Trump and Congress pursue, Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen signaled on Thursday. In remarks to the congressional Joint Economic Committee, and under questioning from its members, Yellen gave several indications that the central bank is poised for a rate increase next month unless economic data quickly sour. Yellen also said “It is fully my intention to serve out my term,” which ends in February of 2018, even though Trump criticized her frequently on the campaign trail.

And she warned that the fiscal agenda that emerges under the incoming administration, which appears likely to include tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending, could change the Fed's calculus on how fast to continue raising rates.

“We will be watching the decisions that Congress makes and updating our economic outlook” as they begin to play out, Yellen said, under questioning. “Things could turn out very differently, we understand.”

Financial markets appeared largely unfazed by her comments, with stocks barely fluctuating. Bond yields continued to climb on new inflation data that showed consumer prices increased last month at their fastest pace since April.

Analysts have said that Trump's tax and spending plans, if enacted, could accelerate inflation, because unemployment has fallen below 5 percent and wages are growing at an increased rate. Yellen seemed to nod to those concerns, noting that the economy no longer needs the dose of fiscal stimulus that Fed officials called for in the wake of the Great Recession and urging lawmakers to keep America's long-run budget deficit concerns in mind.

Asked if uncertainty over Trump's agenda warranted holding off on a December rate increase - which economists have long suggested, and which Fed officials have been foreshadowing for months - Yellen gave what amounts, in the guarded language of Fed chairs, to a fairly direct ""no"".

“My guess is that uncertainty about these measures will last for some considerable time, and we have had an accommodative monetary policy…for a long time,” she said, adding: “I would think that the judgment that the committee reached in November remains the appropriate one.""

Share this article Share

Most analysts read the Fed's November release as a sign that a rate increase was just around the corner. In her testimony, Yellen seemed to encourage that reading, telling the committee that Fed officials deemed this month “that the case for an increase in the target range had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon.”

Advertisement

She said growth and inflation appear to be gaining steam in the second half of the year, and she warned against waiting too long to begin raising rates again.

“Were the FOMC to delay increases in the federal funds rate for too long,” Yellen said, “it could end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of the Committee’s longer-run policy goals. Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long could also encourage excessive risk-taking and ultimately undermine financial stability.”

What happens after the next rate hike could well hinge on Congress and Trump. The Fed has long suggested it would embark on a carefully planned series of moves to bring rates up from their historically low levels over the next few years. After a single and small increase last year, rates have remained just above zero throughout 2016. They have held off as they watched for even more evidence that the labor market is getting close to full employment and the inflation rate, which currently is running below the Fed's 2 percent target, is rising.

Advertisement

In her remarks, Yellen said the Fed, “continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time” in order to reach full employment and not overshoot on inflation. She also said that “While above-trend growth of the labor force and employment cannot continue indefinitely, there nonetheless appears to be scope for some further improvement in the labor market.”

Analysts cautioned that Yellen may need to change her tune in short order, if Trump and Congress agree on a package of measures to stimulate the economy. ""At some point, particularly if a stronger pace of growth materializes in the back half of 2017 as we anticipate,"" researchers from Deutsche Bank said on Wednesday, ""the Fed may have to rethink this 'gradual' strategy.""

Taking questions from the House and Senate members on the committee, Yellen addressed two other possible consequences of the election.

She said she hoped the new administration would not roll back financial regulations put in place under the Dodd-Frank bill passed after the Great Recession. “I certainly would not want to see all the improvements we have put in place, I would not want to see the clock turn back on those,"" she said, ""because I think they’re important to reduce the odds of a future crisis.”"

Romney appeared to warmly shake hands with Trump, each man gripping the arm of the other, as he arrived at Trump’s New Jersey golf course. The two exchanged pleasantries, with Trump placing his hand on Romney’s back, and disappeared behind a large brown door with Vice President-elect Mike Pence.

After the meeting, which lasted for more than an hour, Romney said the men had a “very thorough and in-depth discussion” regarding “the various theaters in the world where there are interests of the United States of real significance.” Romney said that he and Trump exchanged views and that he looks forward to the new administration. Trump said of the meeting: “It went great.”

Romney and Trump hold different views on U.S. relations with Russia. Romney has called the country America’s “number one geopolitical foe.” According to the Kremlin, Trump and Russian President Vladi­mir Putin spoke Monday, agreeing that U.S.-Russian relations are “unsatisfactory” and vowing to work together to improve them. Trump’s office said in a statement that the president-elect told Putin he was looking forward to “having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the People of Russia.”

The cordiality that Romney and Trump displayed publicly was a marked change from the way the men spoke about each other during the campaign.

Romney told CNN in June that a Trump presidency could bring ""trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry, trickle-down misogyny"" to the nation. In a speech, Romney called the real estate mogul a ""con man"" and a ""fake."" Trump said Romney ""blew it"" and ""choked like a dog"" in his failed bid to unseat President Obama in 2012, and he called the former Massachusetts governor ""one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics.""

Trump and Pence are spending the weekend at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., in a nearly constant stream of meetings with potential administration hires and others looking to dispense advice. Trump said Saturday evening that he was seeing “tremendous talent.” When asked if his cabinet was being shaped, he said: “Yes. Partially. We’re doing this again tomorrow.”

He and Pence met earlier in the day with retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, a potential pick for secretary of defense who could be seen as a rebuke to President Obama. Mattis oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East from 2010 to 2013. He was said to have consistently pushed the military to punish Iran and its allies, including calling for more covert actions to capture and kill Iranian operatives and interdictions of Iranian warships.

Former defense officials said Mattis's views on Iran caused him to fall out of favor with the Obama administration, which was negotiating the Iranian nuclear deal at the time. Mattis, who also clashed with the administration over its response to the Arab Spring and how many troops to keep in Iraq, was forced to retire earlier than expected to clear room for his replacement at U.S. Central Command. Now a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, Mattis has publicly criticized Obama's defense and national security policies.

When asked whether he would choose Mattis as defense secretary, Trump said: “We’ll see.” He called the retired general “the real deal” and a “brilliant wonderful man.” A source familiar with transition discussions, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that no decision has yet been reached about whether Mattis will join the Trump administration.

Here’s what President-elect Donald Trump has been doing since the election + 70 He has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to enter the White House.

Michelle Rhee, the former D.C. schools chief who is being floated as a possible education secretary, and her husband, Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, also met with Trump and Pence. Rhee served three contentious years as chancellor of the District’s schools, where she oversaw a rise in test scores but shuttered some schools, laid off nearly 700 teachers for poor performance and filled more than 91 principal openings that were created via firings, resignations and retirements. Rhee has been a supporter of Common Core, which Trump opposes.

Trump also met with donor Betsy DeVos, who is also reportedly being considered for education secretary. DeVos is a proponent of charter schools and vouchers.

Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire oncologist who advised Vice President Biden's efforts to combat cancer, also met with Trump and Pence on Saturday afternoon, as did conservative community development leader Robert L. Woodson Sr., who told The Washington Post that he is under consideration to be secretary of housing and urban development.

The president-elect and vice president-elect are also planning to huddle this weekend with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, an immigration hard-liner who is on Trump's transition team, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was ousted as chairman of Trump's transition team.

“These meetings that the president-elect and vice president-elect are having really show . . . the depth to which we’re going to pull in diverse ideas and different perspectives as we form this administration,” Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Saturday.

Some visitors, he said, are “potential administration hires,” while others are coming only to offer advice. “The president-elect is bringing together folks who have been on the opposite side of him politically,” Miller said.

Questions about Trump’s ability to bring Americans together arose onstage Friday night on Broadway.

In a morning tweetstorm — a communication method that Trump often used as a candidate but that is unprecedented for a president-elect — Trump claimed that Pence was “harassed” Friday night at a New York theater, where he went to see “Hamilton,” a Tony Award-winning musical about Founding Father Alexander Hamilton that features a diverse cast and crew.

“Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!” Trump tweeted.

At the show’s curtain call, the cast stood onstage as actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who portrays Hamilton nemesis Aaron Burr, addressed Pence, who apparently was walking out of the theater.

“We sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir,” Dixon said during his remarks. “But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us — all of us.”

A spokesman for the show told the Associated Press that Pence stood outside the theater to listen to Dixon.

Later, Trump took to Twitter, saying the cast should apologize for addressing Pence.

“The Theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!”

Dixon tweeted back to Trump: “@realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen.”

Trump also used Twitter to address a $25 million settlement to end the fraud cases pending against Trump University, a defunct real estate seminar program. Trump, who had repeatedly claimed that he never settled lawsuits, despite doing so for years, now will likely not face the prospect of testifying in court during his presidential transition.

“I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country,” Trump tweeted.

He added: “The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!”

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Friday that the settlement includes a $1 million penalty paid to the state for claiming the program was a “university” even though it did not offer degrees, violating New York education law."
3596,3596,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/30/donald-trump-is-assembling-the-richest-administration-in-modern-american-history/?utm_term=.d7f7e53482e0,0,"When George W. Bush assembled his first Cabinet in 2001, news reports dubbed them a team of millionaires, and government watchdogs questioned whether they were out of touch with most Americans’ problems. Combined, that group had an inflation-adjusted net worth of about $250 million — which is roughly one-tenth the wealth of Donald Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary alone.

Trump is putting together what will be the wealthiest administration in modern American history. His announced nominees for top positions include several multimillionaires, an heir to a family mega-fortune and two Forbes-certified billionaires, one of whose family is worth as much as industrial tycoon Andrew Mellon was when he served as treasury secretary nearly a century ago. Rumored candidates for other positions suggest Trump could add more ultra-rich appointees soon.

Many of the Trump appointees were born wealthy, attended elite schools and went on to amass even larger fortunes as adults. As a group, they have much more experience funding political candidates than they do running government agencies.

Their collective wealth in many ways defies Trump’s populist campaign promises. Their business ties, particularly to Wall Street, have drawn rebukes from Democrats. But the group also amplifies Trump’s own campaign pitch: that Washington outsiders who know how to navigate and exploit a “rigged” system are best able to fix that system for the working class.

“It fits into Trump’s message that he’s trying to do business in an unusual way, by bringing in these outsiders,” said Nicole Hemmer, an assistant professor in presidential studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. But Trump and his team, she added, won’t be able to draw on the same sort of life struggles that President Obama did, in crafting policy to lift poor and middle-class Americans.

“They’re just not going to have any access to that” life experience, she said. “I guess it will be a test — does empathy actually matter? If you’re able to echo back what people are telling you, is that enough?”

Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary is industrialist Wilbur Ross, who has amassed a fortune of $2.5 billion through decades at the helm of Rothschild’s bankruptcy practice and his own investment firm, according to Forbes.

Ross’ would-be deputy at the Commerce Department, Todd Ricketts, is the son of a billionaire and the co-owner of the Chicago Cubs. Steven Mnuchin, who Trump named to head the Treasury Department, is a former Goldman Sachs executive, hedge fund executive and Hollywood financier.

Betsy DeVos, a Michigan billionaire who was named as Trump’s education secretary, is the daughter-in-law of Richard DeVos, the co-founder of Amway. Her family has a net worth of $5.1 billion, according to Forbes. Elaine Chao, the choice for transportation secretary, is the daughter of a shipping magnate.

It is a group that has long spent big to influence politics. Mnuchin, Ross and DeVos each made hundreds of thousands of dollars of political contributions within the last two years, according to OpenSecrets.org. In Ross’ Manhattan office, next to a window overlooking Central Park, there is a table filled with pictures of Ross with candidates to whom he has contributed, including John A. Boehner, Michael Bloomberg and Bill Clinton.

On Wednesday, Democrats seized on Ross’s and Mnuchin’s Wall Street ties to accuse Trump of undermining his populist pitch.

“I’m not shocked by this. It’s a billionaire president being surrounded by a billionaire and millionaire cabinet, with a billionaire agenda . . . to hurt the middle class,” said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). “The appointments suggest that he’s going to break his campaign promises.”

In their first interviews Wednesday after being unveiled as cabinet nominees, Mnuchin and Ross pitched their business experience as beneficial to the goals of boosting workers.

“I think one of the good things about both Wilbur and I, we have actually been bankers,” Mnuchin told CNBC, adding, “We’ve been in the business of regional banking, and we understand what it means to make loans.”

On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to lift up Americans who have seen their economic prospects dim with the loss of well-paying blue-collar jobs. And indeed, voters by and large ignored Trump’s own opu­lence, which never became the baggage that it did for the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.

Still, the question now is whether public officials who come from such privileged backgrounds will favor policies that benefit the rich.

“This isn’t a criticism or a conspiracy . . . but it’s important to recognize that everyone’s perspective and policy and government is shaped by the kind of life you’ve lived,” said Nicholas Carnes, a political scientist at Duke University. “The research really says that when you put a bunch of millionaires in charge, you can expect public policy that helps millionaires at the expense of everybody else.”

Future appointments could further increase the wealth of Trump’s cabinet. Harold Hamm — a self-made oil industry executive who ranks 30th on the Forbes 400, a list of the wealthiest Americans, with a net worth of $16.7 billion, — is on Trump’s shortlist for secretary of energy. Andrew Puzder, a restaurant industry executive, has been floated for labor secretary.

Trump is hardly the first president to dole out cabinet positions to wealthy Americans. The Commerce and Treasury departments in particular tend to be headed by politically connected donors or Wall Street executives, said Matt Grossman, a political scientist at Michigan State University.

“Of course, it’s not uncommon for the wealthy to be overrepresented in political positions of all kinds, and in appointment processes you tend to get people who are already well-connected to the incoming president,” he said.

Penny Pritzker, the current commerce secretary, comes from one of America’s wealthiest families, and her net worth is estimated at $2.5 billion. Former treasury secretaries Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Paul H. O’Neill both had personal wealth in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.

The tradition goes back in history. Andrew Mellon, one of the wealthiest Americans in the early 20th century, served as treasury secretary under three administrations. Eisenhower’s cabinet garnered the nickname “nine millionaires and a plumber.”

Mellon was first appointed by President Warren G. Harding, and he helped steer the U.S. economy through the “Roaring Twenties” — and into the Great Depression.

He is widely credited with pioneering an early version of the tax policies that form part of Trump’s economic agenda, which proved successful in the 1920s. It was the notion that the government could speed up the economy — and increase federal revenue — by cutting taxes on the rich."

That came an hour after Boeing’s chief executive was quoted questioning Trump’s stance on trade. In the afternoon, Trump directed his attention elsewhere, taking credit in a surprise announcement for a Japanese conglomerate’s months-old pledge to invest $50 billion in the United States.

In the raucous hours in between, a top Trump aide announced offhandedly that, months before, Trump had sold his entire stock portfolio, which some ethics advisers had worried could raise questions about conflicts of interest during his presidency.

It was a day of big pronouncements and few details, leaving many wondering whether this would be the unusual and unpredictable way that Trump will govern when he takes office next month.

That style, including his opaque personal financial dealings and his sudden shots at certain companies, has helped unnerve a corporate America that traditionally craves stability. Some business leaders and economists have worried whether executives can speak their minds about the president-elect or his policies without fear of facing Trump’s rage.

“Twisting people’s arms is inherently problematic” for a president, said N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush.

“The president has so much power, you always wonder if there’s some implicit threat to individuals, and that goes beyond what I think a limited government should do,” Mankiw said.

But some defended Trump’s highly visible way of doing business in his transition to the Oval Office. Lanhee Chen, policy director of Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, who is now at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, said he was not terribly concerned by Trump’s interactions with individual corporations and chief executives.

“I just assume this is what generally happens,” Chen said. “I don’t think it is that unusual for a president to make appeals to specific companies. What may be unusual is the public nature of the communications. But the activity itself is not uncommon” for presidents or for governors, he said.

Taking on Boeing

Trump has for months targeted companies that, like his own, have shipped jobs overseas. In a string of early-morning tweets Sunday, he threatened ""retribution or consequence"" for companies that move operations out of the country, as well as a 35 percent tariff on goods sold back to the United States.

Trump’s Boeing slam Tuesday, though, was something new. The president-elect criticized the Chicago-based jet manufacturer, alleging that the costs of its federal contract to build a new Air Force One had, as Trump said, spiraled “out of control.”

Trump's tweets came roughly an hour after the publication of a Chicago Tribune column citing Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg's suggestion that Trump and Congress ""back off from the 2016 anti-trade rhetoric.""

Trump spokesmen did not explain why he had targeted Boeing and did not provide other details. But they contributed to the confusion, by claiming Tuesday morning that Trump had in June sold a stock portfolio that by last year was worth up to $40 million.

The sale of Trump’s shares in big banks, oil conglomerates and other companies with business before the government would have netted Trump millions of dollars during his costly presidential campaign. It also could help him tamp down worries over conflicts of interest between his private holdings and public job.

Opaque finances

But beyond spokesman Jason Miller’s comments Tuesday to The Washington Post, Trump representatives have not provided records of stock transactions or other details since a financial-disclosure filing released in May.

Advertisement

Over the past five months, Trump campaign officials gave no indication of the stock sale. Trump has also refused to release his tax returns, which would provide more detailed information about his financial holdings.

As president, Trump will be subject to the Stock Act, a 2012 law that requires elected officials, including the president, to publicly disclose any stock transactions worth at least $1,000 within 45 days.

By Tuesday afternoon, Trump had taken a new turn, announcing that a Japanese telecommunications firm, SoftBank, had agreed to invest $50 billion in U.S. start-ups, a move he tweeted that the company would never have done ""had we [Trump] not won the election!""

The president-elect made a brief showing in the gilded lobby of Trump Tower to announce the investment, smiling for the cameras and shaking hands with the firm’s chief executive, Masayoshi Son.

The deal, however, is not new. The money will come from a $100 billion joint investment fund that Son established in October using money from partners, including Saudi Arabia’s state-owned investment fund.

SoftBank has invested in the United States in the past, including paying $22 billion in 2013 for a 80 percent share of Sprint. The firm also led a $1 billion investment round last year in San Francisco-based online lender Social Finance.

Trump's announcements followed his assertion last week that he had saved 1,100 jobs in Indiana through a deal with air-conditioning company Carrier. The agreement, which includes $7 million in state incentives for the company, will actually keep 800 workers in the state, while 600 jobs will still go to Mexico.

In an interview Monday with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, the chief executive of Carrier’s parent company confirmed that it had made the deal in part out of fear.

“There was a cost as we thought about keeping the Indiana plant open,” United Technologies chief executive Greg Hayes said. “At the same time . . . I was born at night but not last night. I also know that about 10 percent of our revenue comes from the U.S. government.”

After Trump concluded his public events at Carrier on Thursday night, he took on a second company that has announced it is moving jobs from Indiana to Mexico. ""Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!"" he tweeted Friday.

Rexnord, which is based in Milwaukee, announced in June that it was closing an Indiana plant, resulting in the loss of 300 jobs.

Long-run risk?

Keith Hennessey, director of the National Economic Council under Bush, warned about the impact of Trump’s approach to business and trade, which he said could do “long-run economic harm to the U.S.”

“When a politician rewards his business friends and punishes his business enemies it’s called crony capitalism,” Hennessey wrote in a blog on his personal website Monday.

“It creates incentives for other business leaders to spend their time and money trying to get similar political access with elected officials,” Hennessey added. “And a firm leader now knows it can initiate a negotiation with the Trump Administration simply by threatening to outsource jobs.”

In his blog, Hennessey urged Trump to stop “trying to tell individual American business leaders how to run their companies.” He said his criticism was aimed at Trump’s maneuvers involving Carrier, Rexnord and tariffs, but said he did not want to comment on Boeing.

Mankiw, the former Bush economic adviser, said that targeting individual companies runs contrary to “equal protection of the law, which is a fundamental principle of fairness,” violating founder John Adams’s contention that the United States should be a nation of laws and not men.

Beyond using the power of the presidency to intimidate in unpredictable and unfair ways, no individual could efficiently manage the economy, company by company, said Mankiw, who indicated before the election that he did not plan to vote for Trump.

“When a chief exec is making individual calls to individual companies, he’s in some sense acting like a central planner,” Mankiw said. “We have a lot of history under communism that suggests it doesn’t work well in practice, and that’s the direction you’re heading in as the president starts to weigh in on individual business decisions.”"

Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that he would soon leave his “great business in total” to focus on the presidency, a response to growing worries over the businessman-in-chief’s conflicts of interest around the globe. Shortly after, the official Twitter account of the Office of Government Ethics, the traditionally staid federal agency that often works closely with presidential transition teams, issued a rapid-fire series of tweets celebrating that Trump had committed to fully divesting his company stake — though Trump has publicly said no such thing.

The back-to-back tweetstorms raised more questions than they answered: whether Trump’s move would focus on severing his ownership ties, or simply his management responsibilities; and whether the OGE was releasing new information or simply the victim of a hacker, prankster or official gone rogue.

The OGE’s messages were deeply out of character for a federal ethics agency that is famously quiet and unadventurous. Among the nine tweets: “@realDonaldTrump Bravo! Only way to resolve these conflicts of interest is to divest . Good call!” The tweets were first posted Wednesday morning, then deleted within an hour. They then reappeared at 1 p.m., for unknown reasons.

In a 1:30 p.m. statement from the OGE’s email account, attributed to OGE spokesman Seth Jaffe, the agency said, “Like everyone else, we were excited this morning to read the President-elect’s twitter feed indicating that he wants to be free of conflicts of interest. OGE applauds that goal, which is consistent with an opinion OGE issued in 1983. Divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not. We don’t know the details of their plan, but we are willing and eager to help them with it.”

A second statement at 3:30 p.m. added, “The tweets that OGE posted today were responding only to the public statement that the President-elect made on his Twitter feed about his plans regarding conflicts of interest. OGE’s tweets were not based on any information about the President-elect’s plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed. OGE is non-partisan and does not endorse any individual.”

Phone messages left with a dozen agency executives and representatives seeking verification or more details were not returned.

OGE lawyers have been influential in past presidents’ decision making, but their advice has almost always been kept confidential. If nothing else, the OGE’s tweets have publicly revealed federal-ethics officials’ preference for the president-elect to completely divest — a form of lobbying that is potentially unprecedented for the agency.

The messages surprised many who had worked with the agency in the past: Brett Kappel, a Washington campaign-finance lawyer who has worked with OGE, said the agency “never tweets about an individual federal official’s ethics issues unless they are announcing the conclusion of an enforcement action.”

The tweets followed Trump’s morning announcement, which appeared to echo his long insistence that he would cede the company’s management to his children, a way of putting distance between his private interests and public power.

But it remained unclear whether the new arrangement would include a full sale of Trump’s stake in the company. Ethics advisers said a management hand-off to his children would not resolve worries that the business could still influence his decisions in the Oval Office.

“I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump tweeted.

“While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses. Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!”

Presidents are not bound by the strict conflict-of-interest laws governing most U.S. elected officials. But most modern presidents have agreed to sell or sequester their assets in a blind trust, led by an independent manager with supreme control, in order to keep past business deals, investments and relationships from influencing their White House term.

Giving company management to his adult children — Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka — would still leave open the potential for Trump to make presidential decisions for their benefit. The children have already played a key part in Trump’s governing preparations, serving on the transition team now selecting key appointees and sitting in on meetings with foreign heads of state.

Trump spokespeople did not immediately return requests for more details on the move. But Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, said the move did not appear to offer enough of a division to keep entanglement worries at bay.

“That’s business operations, not ownership. The problem is, we need to resolve the conflicts of interest that arise from his ownership. And we’re hearing nothing about how that’s getting resolved,” Painter said.

“Even if he does not operate the businesses, you’re going to have lots of people working for the business running around the world trying to cut deals,” Painter added. “And it’s critical that none of those people discuss U.S. business in a way that could be interpreted, or misinterpreted, of offering quid pro quo … or soliciting a bribe on the part of the president.”

If Trump’s family does take over management of the business, Norman Eisen, the chief White House ethics lawyer for President Obama from 2009 to 2011, said an “ethics firewall” would need to be put in place to combat the “risk of improper preferential relationships and treatment for the Trump Organization with the United States government and foreign ones.”

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that he was not “ready to reveal” whether the move would include Trump truly severing ties to his business or whether he would simply leave the day-to-day operations to his kids.

“It’s not the easiest thing to work out,” Priebus said. “What you see in those tweets is the person at the top that understands and is willing and showing the American people that he’s working hard on it and he’s taking it seriously.”

Others in the president-elect’s orbit have shared little more on his plan. Asked Wednesday if he would take over the business, Eric Trump said, while walking through Trump Tower, “You’ll hear it soon enough.”

Asked how the new arrangement would be set up, Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the transition team’s executive committee, said, “I don’t want to steal Mr. Trump’s or the children’s thunder on that, so let’s wait for Dec. 15.” He added, “At age 70, after having this phenomenal life and building this phenomenal business in this great tower, he’s going to be a hundred percent focused on working for the American people and for the United States.”

The weeks since Trump’s electoral victory have been marked by a series of entanglements between his private ventures and public ambitions.

Trump welcomed a group of Indian business executives to meet with him and his family at Trump Tower, where talk turned to the potential for new real-estate deals. Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, who will likely play a key part in running the company, met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during Trump’s first meeting as president-elect with a foreign government leader.

His company, the Trump Organization, has over the years sealed lucrative real-estate and branding deals for business in at least 18 countries and territories across the world, including in places where the U.S. has sensitive diplomatic ties, such as Turkey, Azerbaijan and India.

Trump’s company is also pitching foreign diplomats on his new luxury hotel in Washington as a place to book rooms and hold meetings. But such entreaties eventually could run afoul of an “emoluments” clause in the U.S. Constitution that bars the president from accepting gifts from foreign leaders — even if he is not actively running the company.

Don Trump Jr. traveled to Turkey this week as part of a vacation with a friend, according to a Trump Organization statement Wednesday. Turkey is now under close scrutiny by U.S. diplomats following a series of government crackdowns. Trump’s company has made millions of dollars there by licensing the name to Trump Towers Istanbul.

Before that statement, Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported that it was Eric Trump, not his brother, who traveled to the country to hunt wild deer at the invitation of a Turkish businessman. The Trump Organization said Don Jr.’s travel was not a business trip but declined to provide other details.

Buffeted by entanglement worries, Trump has largely dug in, arguing “the law’s totally on my side, meaning, the president can’t have a conflict of interest” last week in an interview with the New York Times.

“In theory I could run my business perfectly, and then run the country perfectly,” Trump said. “But I would like to do something. I would like to try and formalize something, because I don’t care about my business.”

Peter Schweizer, a conservative author who raised alarms in the book “Clinton Cash” about Hillary Clinton’s possible conflicts of interest because of donations to her family’s foundation, said Trump will face an equally skeptical public, not just about his entanglements but those of his children as well.

“It’s incumbent on the president of the United States, particularly one who is seemingly committed to ‘draining the swamp,’ to remove any questions about financial transactions involving him or his family,” said Schweizer, who is also close to Trump senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon, who served as chairman of the Government Accountability Institute, where Schweizer is president.

“Foreign entities look at family members as a route to gaining influence and getting special favors. It’s not a question of if it’s going to happen — it’s going to happen. The best thing he could do is set up mechanisms now to avoid those pitfalls that invariably surround presidential families.”

He suggested both Trump and his adult children voluntarily submit to quarterly in-depth disclosures about their financial holdings and major Trump Organization financial transactions, even though the law does not require it.

He also proposed that Trump’s charitable foundation cease accepting donations from non-family members and that Trump’s children agree they will not accept paid speaking engagements for fees larger than those they were paid before their father was elected president.

Stuart E. Eizenstat, who served as former President Jimmy Carter’s domestic policy chief and helped guide his transition to the White House, called Trump’s announcement today “an important first step showing that he recognizes the concerns of the press and the public.”

Eizenstat recalled that Jimmy Carter put his interest in a peanut warehouse in a blind trust before inauguration day and that Carter agreed to recuse himself from discussion of Agriculture Department policy towards peanuts and limit his involvement in sugar — the latter playing a critical role in the fortunes of Coca-Cola, a leading home state industry.

Trump presents a unique challenge from an ethics perspective because of his wide ranging business interests and because his name is used so widely in pursuit of those interests around the globe. “We are navigating in uncharted waters,” Eizenstat said.

Eizenstat, who also held several major positions in the Clinton administration, said the blind trust approach might be unworkable for Trump given those wide-ranging interests, his name brand on his companies and the active involvement of his children in the business.

He spoke approvingly of the idea of an independent monitor as a possible way to reassure the public. But he said that a monitor can be cumbersome and expensive. Given those hurdles, the best way to deal with the public policy challenges of Trump’s vast business portfolio may be to simply encourage “a free and unfettered press” to investigate Trump’s holdings and potential conflicts — along with his disclosure statements.

“The power of a free press is what separates our country from non-Democratic countries and the vibrancy of the press would be the best instrument” to deal with Trump’s international holdings and the constitutional prohibition against his receiving favors from foreign leaders. In addition, Eizenstat said that Trump’s honesty and credibility in discussing his holdings is critical.

“In the end, he is going to want to be sure that he is seen by the public as a president animated by the national interest,” Eizenstat said. “I am hopeful he will meet that standard.”

Michael Toner, who served as general counsel to the Bush-Cheney transition in 2000, recalled the 10-week post-election period as a time for setting broad ethical policy — and considering specific safeguards for the incoming president — that would set the tone for the incoming administration.

At the time of the Kennedy-Johnson transition, Lyndon Johnson separated himself from the Texas radio stations he operated, drawing up new ownership documents putting his wife, Lady Bird, in charge and removing himself, at least officially, from the company’s operations. After his election in 1976, Jimmy Carter set up elaborate arrangements to remove himself from the family peanut business, its management and knowledge of day to day decisions.

For decades incoming presidents and vice presidents have used the inaugural period to meet with federal ethics officials to take steps, such as setting up blind trusts, to remove themselves from their previous business activities and investments. The idea, Toner and others said, is to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.

One of Trump’s most visible potential entanglements, even under a potentially new business arrangement, would be Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., the new luxury hotel he opened in the White House’s backyard.

Charging his children with running the Trump Organization also does not necessarily protect against potential contractual or constitutional violations his presidency may trigger in regards to his D.C. hotel, legal experts say. Trump remains the majority owner of the project, which the company leases from the federal government.

Trump opened the hotel this fall after spending $42 million of his own money and borrowing another $170 million to foot the cost of construction. There is a provision in the lease allowing Trump to sell or transfer his stake in the hotel to “any Trump Family Member.” Selling it to an outside entity would likely require approval by the General Services Administration.

If Trump chooses not to sell, his ownership stake could create two problems once he steps into office. A boilerplate 88-word lease measure may require that the government terminate the deal because it bars “an elected official of the Government of the United States” from having “any share or part of this Lease.”

Procurement experts Steven L. Schooner and Daniel I. Gordon have argued the GSA ought to terminate its deal with Trump because of that clause, writing in The Post a week after the election that “having the president’s adult children negotiate with the staff of the president’s appointee at GSA presents what any reasonable person would view as the appearance of a conflict of interest.”

Schooner, a George Washington University law professor, said in an email Monday that he worried GSA officials wouldn’t terminate the lease out of risk of financial penalties or “intimidation” from the incoming president.

But Steven J. Kelman, a former administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy in the Office of Management and Budget, said the passage may apply only to elected officials at the time of lease negotiations.

Even if it’s not a violation of the lease, putting his children in charge would leave them to negotiate with Trump administration officials over the deal going forward. The official who oversaw the selection of Trump for the project, Robert A. Peck, said recently that he couldn’t imagine the average federal employee feeling much empowered to negotiate with one of Trump’s children while they also advised their father in the White House, if he holds on to the property.

“It would be one thing if his kids ran the business, if his kids didn’t also want to be White House advisers,” Peck said. “But even then, the specter of some … contracting officers sitting across the table from Eric Trump. How does that feel?”"

http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/trump-foundation-irs-charitable-funds-self-dealing-231743",0,"President-elect Donald Trump’s charitable foundation has admitted to the Internal Revenue Service that it violated a legal prohibition against “self-dealing,” which bars nonprofit leaders from using their charity’s money to help themselves, their businesses or their families. The admission was contained in the Donald J. Trump Foundation's IRS tax filings for 2015, which were recently posted online at the nonprofit-tracking site GuideStar. A GuideStar spokesman said the forms were uploaded by the Trump Foundation's law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius.

The Washington Post could not immediately confirm if the same forms had actually been sent to the IRS.

In one section of the form, the IRS asked whether the Trump Foundation had transferred ""income or assets to a disqualified person."" A disqualified person, in this context, might be Trump — the foundation's president — or a member of his family or a Trump-owned business.

The foundation checked yes.



For 2015, the Trump Foundation checked “yes” when asked whether it had transferred “income or assets to a disqualified person” — which in this context might be Trump, a member of his family or a Trump-owned business — and checked “yes” again when asked if it had engaged in any acts of self-dealing in prior years. For 2014, The foundation answered “no” to these questions.

Another line on the form asked whether the Trump Foundation had engaged in any acts of self-dealing in prior years. The Trump Foundation checked yes again.

Such violations can carry penalties including excise taxes, and the charity leaders can be required to repay money that the charity spent on their behalf.

During the presidential campaign, The Post reported on several instances in which Trump appeared to use the Trump Foundation's money to buy items for himself or to help one of his for-profit businesses.

But the new Trump Foundation tax filings provided little detail, so it was unclear if these admissions were connected to the instances reported in The Post.

The Trump Foundation tax forms did not, for instance, describe any specific acts of self-dealing. They also did not say whether Trump had paid any penalties already. That kind of detail would be submitted on a separate IRS form, which was not included in the information posted online by GuideStar.

The New York attorney general’s office is investigating Trump’s charity, following up on reports in The Post that described apparent instances of self-dealing going back to 2007. A spokesman for Attorney General Eric Schneiderman declined to comment, other than to say “our investigation is ongoing.”

The IRS also did not immediately respond. That agency has not said if it is investigating the president-elect’s charity.

The Trump Foundation has existed since 1987. This appeared to be the first time that it had admitted committing such a violation.

Philip Hackney, who formerly worked in the IRS chief counsel’s office and now teaches at Louisiana State University, said he wanted to know why the Trump Foundation was now admitting to self-dealing in prior years — when, in all prior years, it had told the IRS it had done nothing of the kind.

“What transactions led to the self-dealing that they’re admitting to? Why weren’t they able to recognize them in prior years,” Hackney said. He said that, since the prior years’ returns were signed by Trump, that opened the president-elect to questions about what he had missed and how.

During the presidential campaign, The Post revealed several instances — worth about $300,000 — where Trump seemed to have used the Trump Foundation to help himself. From 2009 until this year, the charity was funded exclusively with other people's money, an arrangement that experts say is almost unheard of for a family foundation.

In two cases, The Post reported, the Trump Foundation appeared to pay legal settlements to end lawsuits that involved his for-profit businesses.

In one case, Trump settled a dispute with the town of Palm Beach, Fla., over a large flagpole he erected at his Mar-a-Lago Club. The town agreed to waive $120,000 in unpaid fines if Trump's club donated $100,000 to Fisher House, a charity helping wounded veterans and military personnel. The Trump Foundation paid that donation instead — effectively saving his business $100,000.

In another, Trump's golf course in New York's Westchester County was sued by a man who had won a $1 million hole-in-one prize during a tournament at the course. The man was later denied the money because Trump's course had allegedly made the hole too short for the prize to be valid.

The lawsuit was settled, and details on that final settlement have not been made public. But on the day that the parties told the court that their lawsuit had been settled, the Trump Foundation donated $158,000 to the unhappy golfer’s charity. Trump’s golf course donated nothing.

In three other cases, Trump's foundation paid for items that Trump or his wife purchased at charity auctions. In 2012, Trump bid $12,000 for a football helmet signed by then-Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow. In another case from 2007, Trump's wife, Melania, bid $20,000 on a six-foot-tall portrait of Trump painted by ""speed painter"" Michael Israel during a gala at Mar-a-Lago. And in 2014, Trump bid $10,000 to buy a four-foot painting of himself by artist Havi Schanz at another charity gala.

In all three cases, the Trump Foundation paid the bill. Tax experts said that, by law, the items had to be put to charitable use. Trump’s representatives have not said what became of the helmet or the $20,000 portrait.

The $10,000 portrait was, however, located by Post readers, following coverage of the Trump Foundation. It was hanging on the wall of the sports bar at Trump's Doral golf resort, outside Miami.

In September, a Trump campaign spokesman rejected the idea that Trump had done anything wrong, by using his charity's money to buy art for his bar. Instead, spokesman Boris Epshteyn said, the sports bar was doing the charity a favor by ""storing"" its art free of charge.

Tax experts said that this argument was unlikely to hold water.

“It’s hard to make an IRS auditor laugh,” Brett Kappel, a lawyer who advises nonprofit groups at the Akerman firm, told The Post then. “But this would do it.”

In the new 2015 tax filing, the Trump Foundation acknowledged for the first time that it owned these items. But it listed market values far below what the foundation had paid: The helmet was valued at $475, the portrait purchased for $20,000 was valued at $700, and the portrait purchased for $10,000 was valued at $500.

The tax filing did not give any details about where these items are or what charitable use Trump has in mind for them.

The Trump Foundation’s tax filing also shows that — for the first time in six years — the foundation received a donation from an entity controlled by Trump himself.

It lists a donation of $566,370 from the Trump Corporation, an entity 100 percent owned by Trump himself. It also lists a $50,000 gift from Trump Productions, a Trump-owned business that produced “The Apprentice.”

Previously, the last donation to the foundation from Trump or one of his businesses had come in 2008. Trump’s spokesmen did not respond to a question about the reason for these new gifts.

In addition, the Trump Foundation reported a $150,000 gift from the foundation of Viktor Pinchuk, a powerful Ukrainian steel magnate. That was the first such gift from him.

Pinchuk, who supports closer ties between Ukraine and Western nations, had also pledged large donations to the foundation of Trump's presidential opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Those donations, pledged to the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was secretary of state, raised questions about whether she had conflicts of interest when she met with her family foundation's donors.

A spokesman for Pinchuk's foundation said that the gift was made as part of an agreement for Trump to speak — via video link — to a conference Pinchuk organized in September 2015. The conference, called the Yalta European Strategy annual meeting, was held in Kiev. At the time of his 20-minute speech, titled ""How New Ukraine's Fate Affects Europe and the World,"" Trump was already a presidential candidate.

Trump’s spokesmen did not respond to a question about Pinchuk’s gift.

Marc S. Owens, the former head of the IRS nonprofit division, noted that this was a rare contribution to the Trump Foundation from overseas. The only other foreign gifts were small ones from New Zealand and Canada in 2006 and 2008. And it was certainly the first from a foreigner who could seek to influence the foreign policy agenda of a President Trump.

“The contribution points out a potential way for foreign donors to align themselves with [Trump],” Owens said.

So far, Trump has said nothing about how he will run his foundation when he takes office — or what he will do to avoid potential conflicts of interest involving Trump Foundation donors.

In contrast, when she was preparing to take office as secretary of state in 2009, Clinton was closely questioned about the operations of the global charity founded by her husband. As a result, the president of the Clinton Foundation signed a memorandum of understanding with the Obama administration that placed certain restrictions on its activities, notably limiting some donations from foreign governments.

The agreement was criticized by Republicans during the campaign for loopholes, and the Clinton Foundation has also acknowledged at least one failure to fully uphold its terms. But the document showed an understanding that some additional transparency and regulations were needed while Clinton held public office.

“I will certainly do everything in my power to make sure that the good work of the foundation continues without there being any untoward effects on me and my service and be very conscious of any questions that are raised,” Clinton said during her 2009 confirmation hearing. “But I think that the way that this has been hammered out is as close as we can get to doing something that is so unprecedented that there is no formula for it, and we’ve tried to do the very best we could.”

The Post was first alerted to the 2015 tax filing by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group. In a written statement, CREW spokesman Jordan Libowitz said many questions remained to be answered.

“Why were the Trumps unable to provide locations of the Foundation’s assets like paintings and football helmets . . . when they clearly remain in the possession of the Foundation? What assets do [they] admit to transferring to a ‘disqualified person?’ ” Libowitz wrote. “It’s pretty clear at this point that the IRS needs to investigate.”

In all, the 2015 tax filing shows that the Trump Foundation took in $781,000 and gave away $896,000 in grants during 2015. That left it with $1.1 million at year’s end, slightly down from the year before.

An early look at its outgoing grants showed a familiar pattern: Trump gave to a smattering of New York and Florida charities, plus a few connected to friends and business partners. Also, as he entered the presidential race, he gave to several nonprofit organizations connected with conservative causes.

One of them was Project Veritas, the group run by conservative provocateur James O'Keefe, which has used hidden-camera stings to target liberal groups. Stephen Gordon, of Project Veritas, said that its point of contact had been Corey Lewandowski, Trump's one-time campaign manager.

He said they had a brief meeting with Trump in 2015 at Trump Tower. Trump gave $10,000 from his foundation to the group, which is an IRS-certified nonprofit organization.

""We showed him a couple of videos. He thought that was really cool. And we walked out with a check. It was a typical donor meeting,"" Gordon recalled."

As his senior advisers engaged in an escalating feud over who the next secretary of state should be, Trump focused publicly on Clinton’s tally of 64 million votes — more than 2 million beyond what he garnered — by suggesting without evidence that millions of people illegally voted in the election.

""In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,"" Trump tweeted late Sunday, one of more than 10 tweets on the recount issue.

That accusation — spread by conspiracy sites such as ­Infowars.com and discredited by fact-checking organizations — gained traction among some far-right conservatives disappointed that Trump lost the popular vote.

But Trump’s embrace of the claim created even more instability around the election results from both ends of the political spectrum, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein leading calls among liberal activists for recounts in key battleground states to make sure voting fraud did not give the election to Trump.

The charges and countercharges could present a highly toxic issue for the Justice Department, including Sen. Jeff Sessions ­(R-Ala.), Trump's nominee to be attorney general, whose tenure, if confirmed, comes amid a long-running battle over renewal of the Voting Rights Act. The two parties are already locked in fights over ballot access, with Republicans advocating ID requirements and other limitations that Democrats say are aimed at suppressing the votes of minorities and others more likely to vote Democratic.

Trump spent the Thanksgiving weekend out of the public spotlight, holed up inside his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and continuing his private deliberations about building the next administration. Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and now senior adviser to the transition team, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Trump and President Obama spoke by phone for about 45 minutes on Saturday, the latest in a series of conversations the two men have had since the bitter campaign concluded.

Conway also led a remarkable rear-guard attack on 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney as a possible secretary of state, arguing that the former Massachusetts governor was disloyal to Trump and should not be considered for the post. The remarks highlighted a fierce behind-the-scenes battle within the Trump camp over whether Romney should be offered the job as a healing gesture with the establishment or instead whether a loyalist such as former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani should get the nod.

Rather than referee that dispute, however, Trump’s only public proclamations came over Twitter — his favorite means of communication — beginning at 7:19 a.m. Sunday, when he lambasted the Clinton campaign for agreeing to take part in a recount of votes in Wisconsin spearheaded by Stein.

“Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change,” Trump tweeted.

Trump then composed five tweets quoting parts of Clinton’s responses at the third presidential debate, during which she blasted Trump for telling moderator Chris Wallace that he would “keep you in suspense” rather than outright promise to accept the election results.

At the debate, Clinton had called Trump’s answer “horrifying” and “a direct threat to our democracy.”

On Saturday, Clinton campaign counsel Marc Elias said Clinton's advisers had been monitoring voting patterns in critical states to see whether there were any signs of foul play, particularly in the wake of hacking of emails at the Democratic National Committee and of senior campaign officials earlier this year. Elias wrote that no evidence of wrongdoing had emerged in their preliminary review.

But once Stein’s campaign formally started the recount process in Wisconsin, Elias said Clinton’s campaign would join the effort even if her top advisers did not expect the outcome to change in any of the Midwestern states that tipped the electoral college balance to Trump.

“We had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,” he said.

Clinton’s campaign plans to do the same if Stein, who has raised more than $5 million to help fund the recounts, follows through on plans to ask for the same process in Michigan and Pennsylvania.

The total margin in those three states was 107,000 votes out of nearly 13.8 million cast, with a combined 46 electoral votes among them — enough to give the race to Clinton had she won those three battlegrounds.

Clearly irritated by losing the popular vote, Trump suggested that the math to getting to the 270-vote margin in the electoral college made him come up short. “It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 states instead of the 15 states that I visited,” he tweeted.

Meanwhile, the extraordinary feud over his pick for secretary of state hit a fevered pitch when Conway took to three Sunday television shows to attack Romney’s credentials to be the nation’s top diplomat. Conway is part of a cadre of Trump confidants who are waging an unusual public battle against Romney to influence the ­president-elect’s decision.

Romney’s supporters have largely counseled Trump privately, while his opponents — Conway, former House speaker Newt Gingrich and a handful of other Trump loyalists — have gone public in recent days to stoke a revolt.

Those opposed to Romney have been advocating Trump to reward Giuliani with the secretary of state position, stressing his loyalty vs. Romney’s refusal to publicly say whom he voted for in the presidential race.

“I don’t think a cost of admission for party unity has to be the secretary of state position,” Conway said on ABC’s “This Week,” suggesting Romney went too far in questioning Trump’s character and intellect during the presidential race. “There was the ‘Never Trump’ movement and then there was Governor Mitt Romney. He went out of his way to hurt Donald Trump.”

The Conway offensive, which began Thursday on Twitter and continued in her three appearances Sunday, led the echo chamber of opposition to the former 2012 Republican presidential nominee. Gingrich said most Trump supporters could not countenance Romney's selection for any high-profile posting in Trump's new administration.

""I think we would be enormously disappointed if he brought Mitt Romney into any position of authority,"" Gingrich said on Fox News.

Others inside Trump’s orbit, particularly Vice President-elect Mike Pence, are viewed as Romney supporters, believing he has a steady hand that would benefit Trump in the turbulent world of diplomacy, according to people familiar with the dispute who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The incoming White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, also has a long-standing relationship with Romney since he served as Republican National Committee chairman during Romney’s unsuccessful 2012 presidential bid.

Infighting over such a prominent position is not unusual. Four years ago, President Obama faced internal division over his choice to succeed Clinton as secretary of state, with one possibility being Susan E. Rice, who had been a longtime Obama confidant. Senate Democrats preferred their colleague, John F. Kerry, and eventually Obama made Rice his national security adviser and gave Kerry the State Department.

However, that internal Democratic feud played out in the traditional Washington manner — behind closed doors and in anonymous background quotes to news outlets.

Today’s Republican battle has been carried out in an unusually public fashion that left some old Washington hands stunned and wondering whether this would be the new normal over the next four years.

“I have never, ever, seen any aide to a POTUS or PEOTUS publicly try and box the boss in like this. Extraordinary,” David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Obama’s two presidential campaigns, wrote on Twitter, using the acronyms for president and president-elect.

Axelrod later questioned whether Conway was assigned the job of trashing Romney, or else it was an ""unbelievable breach"" for a staffer to do so while Trump was still making his choice."
3636,3636,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/13/trump-taps-montana-congressman-ryan-zinke-as-interior-secretary/?utm_term=.739e9f30168b,0,"President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke, who has represented Montana’s at-large congressional seat for one term, to serve as secretary of the Department of the Interior, according to an individual with firsthand knowledge of the decision. Zinke, who studied geology as an undergraduate at the University of Oregon and served as a Navy SEAL from 1986 to 2008 before entering politics, campaigned for his House seat on a platform of achieving North American energy independence. He sits on the House Natural Resources Committee as well as the Armed Services Committee.

A lifelong hunter and fisherman, the 55-year-old Zinke has defended public access to federal lands even though he frequently votes against environmentalists on issues ranging from coal extraction to oil and gas drilling. This summer, he quit his post as a member of the GOP platform-writing committee after the group included language that would have transferred federal land ownership to the states.

“What I saw was a platform that was more divisive than uniting,” Zinke said at the time. “At this point, I think it’s better to show leadership.”

Trump also opposes such land transfers, but the provision made it into the official Republican platform.

Zinke recently criticized an Interior Department rule aimed at curbing inadvertent releases of methane from oil and gas operations on federal land as “duplicative and unnecessary.”

“Clean air and clean water are absolute top priorities when we talk about responsible energy development, however the final rule issued by the Obama administration does nothing to further protect our resources,” he said in a statement. “This rule is a stark reminder that we need to invest in infrastructure projects like the Keystone pipeline, so we don’t need to flare excess gas.”

During his time in Congress, Zinke has established a 3 percent voting score with the League of Conservation Voters. But he has broken ranks with the panel’s GOP majority on occasion, opposing a measure by Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) that would have allowed each state to buy up to 2 million acres in U.S. Forest Service land to boost timber production. He has also pushed for full funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a high priority for outdoors groups.

Land Tawney, president and chief executive of the Montana-based Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, described Zinke on Tuesday as “a straight shooter” who has established credibility with outdoors enthusiasts in the state. During a recent meeting with him at a distillery in Whitefish, the congressman’s home town, Zinke walked into the place in flip-flops.

“You wouldn’t know he’s a congressman,” Tawney said. “He really prides himself on being a Theodore Roosevelt Republican, and he lives that a little bit more than other people.”

Outdoors activities such as mountain biking and skiing are a major economic driver in Whitefish as well as in Montana overall, where roughly 200,000 residents have big-game hunting licenses and 300,000 have fishing licenses. Zinke, who has been endorsed by the Outdoor Industry Association, has embraced that sector of the state’s economy.

“Hunting and fishing isn’t something we do in Montana, it’s a way of life,” said Tawney, a fifth-generation Montanan.

Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership President Whit Fosburgh, whose hunters and anglers group has worked with Zinke, said in an interview that it would be “very supportive of Ryan Zinke” as a Cabinet nominee.

“He’s shown courage and commitment to public lands and conservation and [is] someone we think would be an excellent secretary of interior,” Fosburgh said.

Here’s a look at Trump’s administration so far + 32 The men and women the president-elect has selected for his Cabinet and White House team.

Still, a slew of environmental groups came out Tuesday against Zinke, who opposes safeguards the Obama administration has provided for temporary wetlands and intermittent streams, as well as its temporary moratorium on coal leasing on federal land. While he supported subsidizing renewable energy programs and climate change legislation before being elected to the House, during a 2014 debate he said of climate change, “It’s not a hoax, but it’s not proven science either.”

“Zinke embodies the worst kind of magical thinking in Congress: that government welfare handouts can save dying coal companies and crumbling oil and gas giants,” Greenpeace climate campaign specialist Diana Best said Tuesday. “The fact is, coal demand is shrinking globally, and people across America want a Department of the Interior that will protect our precious public lands in perpetuity. That means keeping them off-limits to fossil fuel production and recognizing that the world is moving forward.”

Kierán Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said the congressman’s “brief political career has been substantially devoted to attacking endangered species and the Endangered Species Act,” while the National Parks Conservation’s president, Theresa Pierno, said he “has repeatedly voted to block efforts to designate new national parks that would diversify the National Park System.”

While some Democrats are likely to oppose Zinke’s nomination, the pick does provide the party with one bit of good news: It removes a possible challenger to Sen. Jon Tester, the Montana Democrat who likely will face a tough reelection bid in 2018.

Although Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) was a leading contender to lead Interior in recent days, Zinke hit it off with Trump’s oldest son, Don Jr., an avid hunter, and met personally with the president-elect on Monday in New York.

In a Facebook post Tuesday evening, McMorris Rodgers wrote, “It was an honor to be invited to spend time with the President-elect, and I’m energized more than ever to continue leading in Congress as we think big, reimagine this government and put people back at the center of it.”"

The Washington Post is now reporting that the CIA has concluded something widely suspected but never flatly stated by the intelligence community: that Russia moved deliberately to help elect Donald Trump as president of the United States — not just to undermine the U.S. political process more generally.

The Post's report cites officials who say they have identified individuals connected to the Russian government who gave WikiLeaks emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and top Hillary Clinton aide John Podesta. One official described the conclusion that this was intended to help Trump as “the consensus view.”

The report highlights and exacerbates the increasingly fraught situation in which congressional Republicans find themselves with regard to Russia and Trump. By acknowledging and digging into the increasing evidence that Russia helped — or at least attempted to help — tip the scales in Trump’s favor, they risk raising questions about whether Trump would have won without Russian intervention.

Trump, after all, won by a margin of about 80,000 votes cast across three states, winning each of the decisive states by less than one percentage point. So even a slight influence could have plausibly made the difference, though we'll never be able to prove it one way or another.

CIA briefers told senators in a closed-door briefing it was now “quite clear” that electing Trump was Russia’s goal, according to officials. (Video: Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)

While saying that Russia clearly tried to help Trump doesn't inherently call into question the legitimacy of Trump's win —earlier Friday, the White House made sure to emphasize that it's not making that case — it's not hard to connect the dots. And Trump and his party know it. The Post's report cited Republicans who expressed skepticism about the available evidence when presented with it in September, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

In addition, any GOP effort to dig into the matter risks antagonizing the president-elect, who has said flatly that he doesn’t believe Russia interfered with the election, despite receiving intelligence briefings to the contrary. And he's proved more than willing to go after fellow Republicans who run afoul of him.

On the other hand, if Republicans play down the issue, they risk giving a pass to an antagonistic foreign power that significant majorities of Americans and members of Congress do not trust and which, if the evidence is accurate, wields significant power to wage successful cyberwarfare with the United States.

Already, House Democrats have begun pushing for something akin to the 9/11 Commission to look into allegations of Russian meddling. During the campaign, they pushed for hearings on the same issue.

Until this week, they'd been unable to get much buy-in from congressional Republicans. But Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) voiced support for a probe on Wednesday, and now Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) says he is working with Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) on a wide-ranging Senate probe, as The Post’s Karoun Demirjian reported Thursday.

“I’m going after Russia in every way you can go after Russia,” Graham said. “I think they’re one of the most destabilizing influences on the world stage. I think they did interfere with our elections, and I want [Russian President Vladimir] Putin personally to pay the price.”

Share this article Share

But even as these probes start to materialize, Trump is singing a far different tune. In his interview with Time magazine for his “Person of the Year” award, Trump suggested that the interference could just as well have come from someone in New Jersey as from the Russian government.

“I don’t believe they interfered,” Trump said. “That became a laughing point — not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say, ‘Oh, Russia interfered.’”

Trump added: “It could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.”

Advertisement

Trump also maintained over and over again on the campaign trail that he wanted a better relationship with Russia and praised Putin as a strong leader — while minimizing Russia’s favoritism for his campaign. And he did all of this at a time when Putin was very unpopular in the United States and even as the evidence was pointing in the direction of Russian meddling.

In other words, Trump has shown that he's committed to seeing the best in Russia, and it's unlikely another report from the “dishonest media” citing anonymous sources is going to change his mind.

And Trump has every reason to continue to dig in. He doesn’t want to breathe any life into the story line that he owes his election to Russian interference. Trump, after all, is a winner, and the idea that someone else might have won it for him just won't fly.

Update: A statement from Trump's transition team, as expected, took a defiant tone about The Post's report: “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It’s now time to move on and 'Make America Great Again.'”

But for congressional Republicans, the evidence is increasingly getting to the point where they simply can’t ignore it, and some of them are feeling compelled to act — in a way that Trump isn’t likely to embrace.

Compounding the dilemma for these Republicans is that many GOP and Trump voters are disinclined to think Russia meddled in the election. A poll released Friday by Democratic pollster Democracy Corps showed 55 percent of Trump voters and Republicans who didn’t vote for Trump say it’s probably true that stories alleging Russian interference in the election are conspiracy theories pushed by Clinton.

Many Republicans are undoubtedly concerned about this. But as long as Trump is holding fast to the idea that this is all made up in an effort to undermine him, this whole thing could reinforce the long-standing chasm within the GOP, with him and his base pitted against establishment Republicans who will (again) be made to look like they’re trying to take down their outsider president-elect. And you can bet that’ll be how Trump pitches it."

http://www.politico.com/blogs/donald-trump-administration/2016/12/mick-mulvaney-omb-232768",0,"President-elect Donald Trump has named Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) as his director of the Office of Management and Budget, signaling his intent to slash spending and address the deficit as president. Mulvaney, 49, was elected to Congress in 2010 in the wave that brought a cohort of younger, staunchly conservative members into the House. Mulvaney quickly staked out ground as one of Congress’s most outspoken fiscal hawks — playing a key role in the 2011 showdown between President Obama and House Republicans that ended in the passage of strict budget caps.

He has been an advocate for spending cuts, often taking on his own party to push for more aggressive curbs to government spending.

“We are going to do great things for the American people with Mick Mulvaney leading the Office of Management and Budget,” Trump said in a statement. “Right now we are nearly $20 trillion in debt, but Mick is a very high-energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nation’s finances and save our country from drowning in red ink.

“With Mick at the head of OMB, my administration is going to make smart choices about America’s budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayer’s trust in how their money is spent,” he added.

Trump has announced plans for increased defense spending in a massive infrastructure bill. Adding Mulvaney to his administration could help ease concerns from fiscal conservatives about the cost of such plans and their effect on the deficit.

A founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of about three dozen conservative hard-liners that has used its leverage to push Republican leaders to the right, Mulvaney was among the group of lawmakers widely credited with pushing House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) out of power in 2015.

He has broken with members of his own party at times, particularly around defense spending issues. Mulvaney has been a fierce critic of the use of a separate war funding stream known as overseas contingency operations, a budgetary maneuver used to skirt spending caps to fund military and anti-terror operations abroad. Mulvaney has allied himself with Democrats at times to try to force defense spending cuts.

Mulvaney is also an advocate of a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution.

Mulvaney has had largely friendly relations with Boehner’s successor, Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). He was among three members who offered nominating speeches for Ryan in a closed-door House GOP leadership election last month.

In a statement Ryan praised Mulvaney’s appointment to head OMB.

“Mick Mulvaney is the absolute right choice,” Ryan said. “In Congress, he has been a conservative reformer from day one, proposing solutions to fix the budget process and our regulatory system.”

“At OMB, he will lead the work he has started to improve the way government does the people’s business,” he added.

Among Mulvaney’s chief duties will be overseeing the most dramatic overhaul of the nation’s tax code since President Ronald Reagan. Trump has pledged to streamline the process for individual households and slash the rate for corporations from 35 percent to 15 percent. The changes are a central component of the administration’s promise to boost economic growth to 4 percent or higher, a message that resonated with voters still bruised by the Great Recession but that many economists say is unsustainable.

In addition, Trump has said that stronger growth would mean his tax proposal would not contribute to the national debt, and he has vowed not to cut expensive but popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. But experts have been skeptical of those claims, and Mulvaney would be responsible for reconciling the numbers.

One analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated Trump’s tax plan would cost more than $5.3 trillion over the next decade. Even after factoring in faster economic growth, Trump’s proposals are expected to add at least $2.6 trillion to the debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.

Trump has also called for as much as $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, an investment long sought by Democrats even though GOP leaders, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), remain opposed.

It is not clear how Trump intends to pay for rebuilding the nation’s roads and bridges. Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, billionaire industrialist Wilbur Ross, and economic adviser Peter Navarro have proposed tax credits intended to spur $1 trillion in private spending. But Trump’s website suggests that fulfilling his pledge will require at least some public money, although it does not detail where the funding will come from.

Mulvaney has spent the past few years learning Spanish and has been one of just a handful of GOP lawmakers able to appear on Spanish-language television programs to explain and defend Republican policies."

The suspect — who went by numerous aliases but was identified by German authorities as Anis Amri — became the subject of a national manhunt after investigators discovered a wallet with his identity documents in the truck used in Monday’s attack that left 12 dead, two law enforcement officials told The Washington Post.

Meanwhile, a clearer portrait took shape of the suspect, including accusations that he had contact with a prominent Islamic State recruiter in Germany.

German authorities issued a 100,000 euro ($105,000) reward for information leading to his capture, warning citizens not to approach the 5-foot-8, 165-pound Amri, whom they described as “violent and armed.”

His record, however, further deepened the political fallout from Monday’s bloodshed — pointing to flaws in the German deportation system and putting a harsh light on Chancellor Angela Merkel’s humanitarian bid to open the nation’s doors to nearly 1 million asylum seekers last year.

Although the vast majority of those who flooded into Europe were on the move to escape war and unrest, dozens of terrorism suspects have slipped into Germany and neighboring nations posing as migrants. Amri, officials said, was not part of the surge of migrants who entered Europe via the onetime main route from Turkey and Greece — a path that has been now largely cut off.

Rather, he came to Germany last year via Italy, where he apparently had entered as early as 2012. He applied for German asylum but was rejected in June and later faced deportation.

Amri was the subject of a terrorism probe on suspicion of “preparing a serious act of violent subversion,” and he had known links to Islamist extremists, authorities said.

Why a failed asylum seeker with such links and no passport was walking German streets is “the question 82 million Germans probably want an answer to,” said Rainer Wendt, Chairman of the German Police Union.

He added: “How many more ticking time bombs are roaming around here? . . . We saw how much damage one person can do with a truck.”

The dragnet for the suspect appeared to initially focus on the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia as well as Berlin, both places where the Tunisian suspect once lived. Police units had been due to stage raids Wednesday, officials said, but they remained mysteriously on hold.

The interior minister in North Rhine-Westphalia, Ralf Jäger, said the Tunisian man had bounced around Germany since arriving in July 2015, living in the southern city of Freiburg and later in Berlin.

Although authorities have sought to accelerate the deportation of rejected asylum seekers this year, there is still a backlog in Germany of tens of thousands, many of whom are able to resist because their countries of origin refuse to take them back. Amri, Jäger said, was one of them.

Amri had not been deported because — like many asylum seekers in Germany — he did not have a passport. The Tunisian government, Jäger explained, initially denied that he was a national and delayed issuing his passport. Pending his deportation, Amri had received a “toleration” status from the government.

Amri’s new Tunisian passport, Jäger said, finally arrived Wednesday.

“I don’t want to comment further on that circumstance,” said a visibly angered Jäger.

Importantly, authorities knew that Amri had “interacted” with Abu Walaa, a 32-year-old of Iraqi descent arrested in November on charges of recruiting and sending fighters from Germany to the Islamic State. Key evidence in Walaa’s case came from an Islamic State defector who had returned to Germany and accused Walaa of helping to recruit him and arrange his travel to Syria.

“Anis Amri was engaging with extremist salafist circles in Germany,” a German security official said.

According to Karen Müller, spokeswoman for the Berlin prosecutor, Amri had also been under police surveillance for several months until September of this year, because he was suspected of planning a burglary in Berlin to finance the purchase of weapons. The suspicion wasn’t confirmed. He was, she said, found only to be a small-time drug dealer.

The leaking of the suspect’s name and photograph in the press, authorities said, may have upset attempts to find him. Germany’s interior minister, Thomas de Maizière, would tell reporters in Berlin only that Germany had registered “a suspect” as wanted on European databases. He refused to give further details.

The two German law enforcement officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive case, said investigators discovered the man’s documents in the cabin of the truck that barreled into the market.

It remained unclear whether authorities believe the Tunisian man drove the truck, but police nevertheless made tracking him a priority.

Revelation of the asylum seeker’s background sparked outrage among conservative politicians and seemed set to damage Merkel, who is running for reelection next year.

“There is a connection between the refugee crisis and the heightened terror threat in Germany,” said Stefan Mayer, parliamentary spokesman on domestic affairs for the Christian Social Union party. “This can also be seen in the case of this Tunisian.”

President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to stand by his plans to establish a registry for Muslims and temporarily ban Muslim immigrants from the United States.

Speaking outside his Mar-a-

Lago resort in Florida, Trump did not walk back the proposals after he was asked by a reporter whether he was rethinking or reevaluating them in the wake of a fresh terrorist attack in Berlin.

“You know my plans,” Trump said.

He went on to add that the attack on a Berlin Christmas market, which was claimed by the Islamic State, had vindicated him.

“All along, I’ve been proven to be right. One hundred percent correct,” Trump said. “What’s happening is disgraceful.”

Germany’s Bild newspaper said Amri had several aliases and was apparently born in the southern Tunisian desert town of Tataouine in 1992.

Witnesses described one man fleeing the scene after the truck — packed with a cargo of steel — roared into revelers at a traditional Christmas market. One suspect, a Pakistani asylum seeker, was arrested Monday night, but authorities later released him because of a lack of evidence.

The new information emerged as German investigators raced for clues in the hunt for Amri and other possible suspects in the assault. They pored over forensic evidence and GPS data as they sought to retrace the steps of the runaway attacker. They were re-questioning witnesses and analyzing DNA traces found in the truck, as well as on the body of a dead Polish man in the passenger seat.

The Pole worked for a trucking company and was delivering a payload of steel to Berlin. Investigators are going on the assumption that he was taken hostage by the assailant — and may even have died a hero. Jörg Radek, deputy chairman of the German Trade Union of the Police, said evidence suggested that “a fight took place in the driver’s cabin.” As it barreled toward the crowded market, the truck was not driving straight, but “in a zigzag line,” he noted.

The Islamic State on Tuesday claimed responsibility for inspiring the unknown attacker — a claim as yet unproven and possibly just opportunistic. But it prompted some politicians to quickly point the finger at Merkel’s refu­gee policy, even as others pushed back, calling the accusations a politicizing of tragedy that had no place in progressive Germany.

There were also growing calls for the deployment of more police on the streets with military-style weapons — an unusual move in pacifist Germany. At the normally quaint and picturesque Christmas markets in at least three German cities — Mainz, Magdeburg and Dresden — concrete barriers were quickly erected to add security. In Magdeburg, police officers armed with automatic weapons were guarding the entrance.

Yet others argued that living in a free society was perhaps more important and that Germans were willing to accept a certain measure of risk to preserve that openness.

“If we want to maintain the freedom of our society, we simply have to live with the risk contained in this decision,” Die Tageszeitung said in a Wednesday editorial.

http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/paul-ryan-livestream-constitution-232994",0,"For now, it seems, the one lasting impact of House Democrats' 26-hour sit-in on gun control this summer is Republicans' desire to punish them for it. But figuring out a way to do that without fanning the flames of the gun control debate — not to mention angering gun control advocates who are more and more willing to fight fire with fire — could be politically tricky.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has every incentive to make sure the minority party doesn't ever again seize the floor. There's no such thing as a filibuster in the House of Representatives; what happens on the House floor is supposed to be unilaterally within his team's control, and for 26 hours in June, it wasn't.

But any punitive measures Ryan takes could play into Democrats' hands.

Democrats have struggled to turn their sit-in into any meaningful action. No post-Orlando gun control legislation passed Congress this year. Democrats didn't win big at the ballot box, either: They only gained six seats in the House despite expectations of up to 20 pickups, and Republicans kept their majorities in Congress and historically large majorities in state governments, too.

Despite historic efforts by Democrats, gun control has largely faded from the national conversation. Until now.

Democrats are practically begging Ryan to do something. No punishment had been doled out Tuesday, and already some Democrats were acting as if they had been punished. Here's one of the leaders of the sit-in, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), on Monday:

No surprise, then, that Ryan has decided to go a more roundabout way that doesn't directly lay the blame on any lawmaker. We learned Tuesday that one of the first things on his to-do list in January is to pass a rule authorizing the House's top cop to levy a fine, up to $2,500, on any lawmaker who shoots video or takes photos on the House floor. This rule would apply to future breaches of action and enforce already existing rules about having phones on the House floor (you're not supposed to).

""These changes will help ensure that order and decorum are preserved in the House of Representatives so lawmakers can do the people’s work,"" said his spokesperson, AshLee Strong.

Share this article Share

But here, too, Ryan finds himself potentially backing into a corner: Democrats could actually claim this more mundane procedural move is unconstitutional.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) office told Politico's Rachael Bade they are looking into whether such a rule passes muster under the Constitution. Bade spoke with several constitutional experts who said that giving a House officer the power to punish lawmakers could be cause for concern. (A long-accepted interpretation of the Constitution is that only the full House, via a vote, has the authority to punish a lawmaker.)

Ryan isn't singling out any one lawmaker for martyrdom, but the tweets and releases from Democrats and gun control advocates write themselves: “Republicans are trying to unconstitutionally punish us for their efforts to keep guns out of the hands of criminals!”

Advertisement

We should reiterate that you're already not supposed to take pictures or shoot video on the House floor. In fact, you're not even supposed to have your phone out on the House floor (though lawmakers frequently break that rule on an average day).

Live streaming became House Democrats' only option to broadcast their sit-in, since the C-SPAN cameras cut off shortly after their protest began. (And no, Republicans didn't directly cut the cord; the cameras are turned off as a matter of procedure when the House isn't in session, and Democrats essentially forced the House out of session by seizing the floor.)

The decision ended up being a great PR move for House Democrats. The shaky, grainy Periscope feed coming from lawmakers' phones only heightened national interest in the sit-in. As the sit-in headed into prime-time TV hours, the live stream was airing on nearly every major cable news channel. Ryan tried and failed several times to shut it down, with thousands on the Internet watching.

More than six months later, that chaotic moment feels like a distant memory. (Exit polling on how gun control factored into Americans' vote is scant, but it's notable the highest-ranking pro-gun-control candidate, Hillary Clinton, didn't win.)

Except here we are talking about it again.

Ryan has every reason to want to punish lawmakers who seized the floor. But in trying to put an end to what happened, Ryan also risks reviving it again."

Bush administration; Michael Singh is the Lane-Swig senior fellow and managing director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, and was senior director for Middle East Affairs at the National Security Council from 2007 to 2008.

Sizing up the Israeli-Palestinian conflict upon assuming office, President Obama decided Israeli settlements were the problem, and he insisted on a total freeze on construction. What followed were eight years of deadlock, the deterioration of U.S. relations with Israelis and Palestinians alike, and widespread disillusionment with the two-state solution.

Despite this track record, Obama is leaving off where he began: I n a departure from Washington's typical role as Israel's defender at the United Nations, the United States refused to use its veto and allowed the adoption of a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements.

Advertisement

For his part, President-elect Donald Trump had urged that the United States veto the resolution. Trump’s argument wasn’t merely that Obama should defer to his successor’s views or that the resolution was anti-Israel. It was that the measure would impede rather than advance Israeli-Palestinian peace — and he was right.

First, the resolution fails to distinguish between construction in the so-called blocs — that is, settlements west of Israel’s security barrier in which about 80 percent of settlers live — and construction east of the barrier. Building in the major blocs is relatively uncontroversial in Israel and rarely the subject of Palestinian protests.

President George W. Bush sought to move peace talks forward in 2004 by asserting what all sides had already tacitly acknowledged — that there could be no return to the 1967 lines in light of the blocs’ existence, and that any negotiated border would have to reflect this reality. By refusing to confirm Bush’s position, Obama dragged the process backward and harmfully reopened old debates.

Advertisement

This regression is enshrined in the resolution, which ""underlines that it will not recognize any changes"" to the armistice lines, and demands the cessation of all settlement activities everywhere. This is unnecessary and unrealistic — Israelis will not bring life to a halt in towns that no one disputes they will keep — and is more likely to obstruct than facilitate the revival of peace talks.

Second, the resolution rewards those who argue for “internationalization” of the conflict — that is, for using international forums such as the U.N., European Union or International Criminal Court to impose terms on Israel, rather than resorting to negotiations.

For the resolution does indeed dictate terms to Israel, not merely condemn settlement activity. It adopts, as noted above, the position that the 1967 lines, rather than today’s realities, should form the basis of talks — despite the fact that many Israeli communities east of those lines are decades old and that Jews have had a near-continuous presence in the West Bank for thousands of years.

Advertisement

It implicitly prejudges the disposition of East Jerusalem — one of most contentious issues dividing the parties — by characterizing Israeli construction as settlement activity, a stance Israelis reject. The resolution would demand an absolute halt to construction in East Jerusalem, even in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City, something no Israeli government ever would agree to do.

Share this article Share

Yet the resolution is conspicuously silent on Israeli concerns. There is no call for other states to recognize Israel’s existence — much less its status as a Jewish state — and end the conflict against it. On incitement and terrorism, it strikes a false balance by calling on “both parties” to refrain from them, despite the fact that Israel prosecutes its citizens who resort to terrorism while the Palestinian Authority lionizes them.

Ironically, though from an Israeli perspective this language may favor the Palestinians, reasonable Palestinians may suffer from it. Because the resolution, untethered as it is to any prospective diplomatic initiative or opening, will fail to yield improvements on the ground, it will further discredit the very notion of diplomacy and compromise as paths to peace and weaken those who champion them.

Advertisement

Finally, U.S support for the resolution lends legitimacy and encouragement to the U.N.’s disproportionate and one-sided focus on Israel. The United States has historically criticized this bias, which borders on the absurd: For example, Israel was the only country criticized by a special U.N. commission on the status of women, despite being the only state in its region where women enjoy equal rights.

Decades of such discrimination have not made Israel more accommodating to its critics, and this resolution won’t either. Instead it will reinforce Israelis’ mistrust of the U.N., thus eroding the Security Council’s capacity to contribute to the peace it professes to advance.

A U.S. veto of the resolution would not have been an endorsement of settlements. Rather, it would have been an affirmation that this is an issue that can only effectively be addressed through negotiations. The best way to encourage those negotiations is not to prejudge their outcome or set timetables, but to create the right regional conditions for them by countering spoilers such as Iran and the Islamic State who oppose peaceful coexistence, as well as the right local conditions for them by reinvigorating programs aimed at building confidence through economic and security cooperation.

Peace in the Middle East will not be accomplished through a U.N. vote. Rather, it will require renewed U.S. leadership in the region and the rebuilding of relationships of trust with all of our partners there. This is where the next administration should start."

Signifying how enormous a priority the issue is for the incoming administration, Vice President-elect Mike Pence met privately to discuss it with House and Senate Republicans. He offered no details afterward about what a new health-care law might look like but vowed to unwind the existing one through a mixture of executive actions and legislation.

Meanwhile, President Obama made a rare Capitol Hill appearance, meeting behind closed doors with Democrats from both chambers. He urged members of his party not to help the GOP devise a new health-care law.

The dueling high-level visits, on the same day that the Senate opened debate on a budget resolution that would begin rolling back the law, highlighted the sharp political fault lines that surround the future of the government’s health policies.

The president, who was accompanied by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) as he entered the Capitol, took no questions from reporters before or after the nearly two-hour meeting. But participants said he told members of his party that they did not have to “rescue” Republicans and that they should “stay strong” as the GOP strives to replace the law.

Pence told reporters that he and Trump would pursue a “two-track approach” to chip away at the ACA through executive powers and legislation. Trump is “working on a series of executive orders that will enable that orderly transition to take place,” Pence said, and is eyeing other policies that can be reversed.

While Pence did not identify other policy targets, Republicans from Western states urged him Wednesday to undo some of the public land protections Obama has created through the 1906 Antiquities Act. Other executive actions, including those providing new safeguards for LGBT Americans and curbing greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change, also could come under fire.

According to a lobbyist in touch with congressional aides on the ACA issue, the Trump transition team has been considering ways to strip down the health benefits that insurers must provide in plans that they sell to individuals and small businesses.

This list of “essential health benefits” was envisioned by the law but was defined in a regulation written by the Department of Health and Human Services. As a result, the incoming administration could alter it without help from Congress.

Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday morning to urge Republicans to “be careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster.” In a dig at Schumer and his allies, Trump added: “Don’t let the Schumer clowns out of this web.”

Less than half an hour after Trump’s social media messages, Schumer tweeted: “Republicans should stop clowning around with America’s health care. Don’t #MakeAmericaSickAgain.”

Schumer and other Democrats echoed Obama, saying they did not feel any responsibility to craft a substitute health-care bill.

“If you are repealing, show us what you’ll replace it with. Then we’ll look at what you have and see what you can do,” said Schumer, who met briefly with Pence on Wednesday.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that Obama told Democrats that they are well positioned to defend the law, which has extended insurance to more than 20 million Americans.

However, Obama also told lawmakers that he recognized that he had not succeeded in selling the law to the public. “There was an acknowledgment that so many features were so popular, but there was a failure to communicate that,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said.

Pence, who was greeted by applause as he entered the House GOP meeting with Reince Priebus, Kelly Anne Conway and several other future White House aides, made it clear that Trump, starting on the first day of his presidency, intended to embark on an aggressive campaign to reverse executive actions made by Obama.

Advertisement

“They didn’t enumerate a list, just that which came by the pen can die by the pen,” said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.).

The first bill Republicans introduced in the new Senate that convened Tuesday was budget legislation with instructions for House and Senate committees to begin repealing the Affordable Care Act. The bare-bones spending outline requires members of four committees — Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce in the House; and Finance, as well as Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, in the Senate — to produce bills just seven days after Trump’s inauguration that each would save $1 billion over a decade by slashing elements of the heath-care law.

House Republicans tasked with writing the repeal legislation said that no final decisions have been made on what it will include. Rep. Patrick J. Tiberi (R-Ohio) who chairs a House subcommittee that oversees health care, called the incoming administration’s Jan. 27 deadline “a challenging goal.”

Advertisement

Among the unanswered questions is whether Republicans will immediately end health-care taxes, such as an additional 0.9 percent Medicare payroll tax and a 3.8 percent investment income tax, that were created to help pay for the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans have insisted that the taxes should be eliminated immediately, even if lawmakers decide to delay the repeal of other parts of the law. Others worry that repealing the taxes will make it impossible to pay to keep Obamacare afloat while a replacement is finished.

“We’re not sure yet,” Tiberi said. “There’s just not consensus on this.”

Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), a member the Trump transition team, said in an interview that “we have six months to work out the replacement plan” for the sweeping health-care law.

Senate rules allow budget resolutions to pass by a simple majority — a maneuver that guarantees that the chamber’s Democratic minority will not have enough votes for a filibuster to block repeal.

Only changes related to taxes, spending or the long-term federal budget are eligible for the simple-majority treatment, however. Other parts of the law, such as the structure of the insurance marketplaces, probably would require a filibuster-proof margin of 60 votes in the Senate, a trickier task since the new Senate has 52 Republicans.

Since its passage by Congress in the spring of 2010 — entirely with Democratic votes — the ACA has spurred the most significant changes to U.S. health policy since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid during the Great Society legislation of the 1960s. It also has faced sustained opposition from Republicans, leading to two Supreme Court cases and a lawsuit over cost-sharing subsidies that is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

The ACA is best known for having expanded insurance coverage, starting in 2014, in two ways: new marketplaces selling private health plans to Americans who do not have access to affordable health benefits through a job, and an expansion of Medicaid in about three-fifths of the states. The marketplaces got off to a shaky start because of computer dysfunction with HealthCare.gov, the federal enrollment website.

Three years later, the U.S. Census reported that the nation's uninsured rate had declined to 9.1 percent, with most of a recent decrease coming from people who bought insurance on their own and more who had joined Medicaid.

The president’s visit to the Hill was part of a broader, last-ditch effort by his administration to preserve a central element of his domestic legacy.

On Wednesday morning, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) drew attention to the stakes for his state by issuing a county-by-county breakdown of the estimated 2.7 million New Yorkers who would lose coverage if the law were repealed. He pointed out that New York would lose $595 million this year in federal money that has helped the state expand its Medicaid program.

HHS officials have been trying to use to their advantage the fact that the change in administrations will take place while the fourth year’s enrollment period for ACA health plans is underway. On Wednesday, HHS released HealthCare.gov enrollment figures showing that 8.8 million Americans chose or were automatically re-enrolled in ACA health plans between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 in the 39 states that rely on the federal exchange website. That is about 200,000 more than at the same time a year ago, although the proportion of new customers was lower.

The new drive to unwind the health-care law will take time. Senate leaders must allow Democrats to offer a nearly unlimited number of amendments before a final budget vote. Democrats plan to use the process, known as a “vote-a-rama,” to offer a long string of potentially toxic amendments that could make it difficult for Republicans to vote for the final legislation, Democratic leadership aides said."

Why do we say this? Let's begin with the gruesome train wreck that was the presidential election. The campaign began with roughly 14,000 candidates running. Obviously not all of them were qualified to be president; some of them — here we are thinking of ""Lincoln Chafee"" — were probably imaginary. But a reasonable number of the candidates seemed to meet at least the minimum standard that Americans have come to expect of their president in recent decades, namely: Not Completely Horrible.

So this mass of candidates began the grim death march that is the modern American presidential campaign — trudging around Iowa pretending to care about agriculture, performing in an endless series of televised debates like suit-wearing seals trained to bark out talking points, going to barbecue after barbecue and smiling relentlessly through mouthfuls of dripping meat, giving the same speech over and over and over, shaking millions of hands, posing for billions of selfies and just generally humiliating themselves in the marathon group grovel that America insists on putting its presidential candidates through.

And we voters did our part, passing judgment on the candidates, thinning the herd, rejecting them one by one. Sometimes we had to reject them more than once; John Kasich didn't get the message until his own staff felled him with tranquilizer darts.

But eventually we eliminated the contenders whom we considered to be unqualified or disagreeable, whittling our choices down until only two major candidates were left. And out of all the possibilities, the two that We, the People, in our collective wisdom, deemed worthy of competing for the most important job on Earth, turned out to be ...

... drum roll ...

... the most flawed, sketchy and generally disliked duo of presidential candidates ever!

Yes. After all that, the American people, looking for a leader, ended up with a choice between ointment and suppository. The fall campaign was an unending national nightmare, broadcast relentlessly on cable TV. CNN told us over and over that Donald Trump was a colossally ignorant, narcissistic, out-of-control sex-predator buffoon; Fox News countered that Hillary Clinton was a greedy, corrupt, coldly calculating liar of massive ambition and minimal accomplishment. In our hearts we knew the awful truth: They were both right.

It wasn’t just bad. It was the Worst. Election. Ever.

And that was only one of the reasons 2016 should never have happened. Here are some others:

● American race relations reached their lowest point since ... okay, since 2015.

Did anything good happen in 2016? Let us think. ...

Okay, the “man bun” appeared to be going away.

That was pretty much it for the good things.

And now, finally, it is time for 2016 to go away. But before it does, let’s narrow our eyes down to slits and take one last squinting look back at this hideous monstrosity of a year, starting with ...

January

... which actually begins on a positive note with the capture of elusive Mexican drug lord Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán, who in 2015 escaped (for the second time) from a Mexican prison when authorities failed to notice the signs reading (in Spanish) ""WARNING: ESCAPE TUNNEL UNDER CONSTRUCTION."" Since then Guzmán had been in hiding except for an interview with Sean Penn, a guest spot with Jimmy Kimmel and a series of commercials for Buffalo Wild Wings.

Mexican police finally are able to track him down during his four-week stint as a guest judge on “America’s Got Talent.” He is taken to Tijuana and incarcerated in what authorities describe as “a very secure Motel 6.”

In health news, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, responding to the spread of the little-understood Zika virus, cautions Americans not to have unprotected sex with foreign mosquitoes. Meanwhile the Flint, Mich., water crisis worsens when samples taken from the city's main water supply are found to contain traces of a Chipotle burrito.

North Korea successfully tests a hydrogen bomb, although this achievement is tarnished somewhat by the fact that the explosion causes the death, by startling, of the isolated nation's lone remaining chicken.

In what critics cite as yet another example of declining U.S. prestige, Iran seizes two U.S. naval vessels and captures 10 crew members; what makes the incident particularly embarrassing is that these vessels were docked in Cleveland. The captured sailors are released, but only after Secretary of State John Kerry assures the Iranian government that he will not deploy James Taylor.

February

... the presidential primary season takes center stage. On the Republican side, the big issue — as you would expect, given the stakes in this election — is Donald Trump's hand size and whether it does or does not correlate with the size of his portfolio, which he claims is huge, although he is reluctant to show it to the non-supermodel public.

The hand-size issue is raised by Marco Rubio, who scores in the early polls, then fades as voters realize that he is still in the early stages of puberty. Trump’s strongest rival is Ted Cruz, a veteran debater so knowledgeable and confident that Mahatma Gandhi would want to punch him in the face.

Meanwhile Jeb Bush, who was considered the early favorite, fails to gain traction with the voters despite having by far the most comprehensive set of policy initiativezzz

Sorry! We nodded off thinking about Jeb, as did the voters.

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is widely presumed to be the front-runner based on being a historic woman with a lengthy résumé of service to the nation who, with her husband, Bill, has serviced the nation for decades to the tune of several hundred million dollars. She is declared the winner of the Iowa caucuses via a controversial and confusing process that, in some precincts, involves dodgeball. But Clinton faces an unexpectedly strong challenge from Bernie Sanders, a feisty 217-year-old senator from Vermont with a message of socialism, but the good kind of socialism where everybody gets a lot of free stuff, not the kind where starving people fight over who gets the lone remaining beet at the co-op. Sanders wins the New Hampshire Democratic primary, followed — in what some observers see as a troubling sign — by Vladimir Putin.

In other February news:

● A lengthy standoff at a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon finally comes to an end when anti-government militants, after protracted negotiations, are eaten by the federal wildlife.

● Following the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the nation's political leaders observe a period of mourning and reflection lasting 3 billionths of a second, then commence the important bipartisan work of not making any progress whatsoever on a replacement.

● The troubled Chipotle chain temporarily closes all of its restaurants after several customers are attacked by what health authorities describe as ""E. coli bacteria the size of adult pythons.""

● The Denver Broncos win the Super Bowl, thanks in part to a costly unsportsmanlike conduct penalty called on the Carolina Panthers defense for stealing Peyton Manning's walker.

Speaking of unsportsmanlike, in ...

March

... the Republican presidential race grows increasingly nasty, spiraling downward in tone to the point where Ted Cruz makes the following statement, which we swear we are not making up: ""Donald Trump may be a rat, but I have no desire to copulate with him."" This sounds as though Cruz is saying that he would copulate with a rat, as long as the rat was not Donald Trump.

Presumably that is not what Cruz meant, but nobody really wants to know what he did mean. Meanwhile Ben Carson announces, in his extremely low-key and soft-spoken manner, that he is going to suspend his campaign. Or visit Spain. Or possibly rob a train. There is no way to be certain.

On the Democratic side, Clinton and Sanders are also in a tight and testy battle, although Clinton slowly gains the upper hand thanks to the Democratic Party's controversial formula for allocating ""superdelegates,"" which is as follows:

● 57 percent go to Clinton.

● The remaining 43 percent also go to Clinton.

Responding to charges from the Sanders camp that the Democratic National Committee is tipping the scales in Clinton’s favor, chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz states that “the DNC is scrupulously neutral in the contest between Secretary Clinton and the senile Commie fart.”

In other political news, President Obama nominates Merrick Garland to replace Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Republican leaders are quick to note that, while Garland appears to be qualified, his name is an anagram for ""Rancid Lark Germ.""

But by far the most controversial political issue of the month — which nobody thought about before, yet which all of a sudden is the defining civil rights struggle of the 21st century — is the question of who can pee where in North Carolina.

In foreign affairs, Obama pays a historic visit to Cuba but is forced to leave after three days when he discovers that there is only one golf course.

April

... England observes the 90th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II, who celebrates the occasion by wearing a large hat and smiling grimly at horses.

Meanwhile world tension mounts when satellite imagery reveals that North Korea has positioned an 18-story-tall plastic bottle containing an estimated 40 million liters of Diet Coke on the border with South Korea, and has somehow obtained what one military analyst describes as ""Mentos mints the size of barns.""

North Korea insists that the project is “strictly defensive,” but the United Nations Security Council, responding with its toughest sanctions yet against the rogue nation, votes to unfriend Kim Jong Un on Facebook.

In another alarming international development, Russian fighter jets, continuing a pattern of increasingly provocative behavior toward the United States, attack the control tower at LaGuardia Airport. After assessing the damage, airport authorities announce that departing flights will be delayed an average of four months, nearly twice as long as usual. Secretary of State Kerry calls the act ""a deliberate provocation"" and, in his strongest response to date, warns that the United States is considering ""a harshly worded memorandum.""

In U.S. presidential politics, Ted Cruz, making a last-ditch effort to stop the Trump juggernaut, announces that his choice for running mate is — prepare for a game-changing jolt of high-voltage excitement — Carly Fiorina. This would be the same Carly Fiorina who dropped out after the New Hampshire primary because she got approximately six votes. On the plus side, Cruz manages to make this announcement without mentioning rats.

In other political news, Hillary Clinton is troubled by a persistent cough that leaves her unable to speak at some campaign stops, forcing her to express her commitment to working families by shattering a porcelain figurine of a Wall Street banker with a hammer.

A Trump spokesperson, speaking on condition of anonymity, says that the Trump campaign “will not speculate on Mrs. Clinton’s health,” adding that “she obviously has some terrible disease.”

May

... tragedy strikes the Cincinnati Zoo when zoo authorities, fearing for the life of a 3-year-old who climbed into the gorilla enclosure, are forced to shoot and kill a gorilla named Harambe, who instantly becomes way more revered on the Internet than Mother Teresa.

In other domestic news, passengers at major U.S. airports complain that they are missing flights because security lines are so long.

Q. How long are they?

A. One of them contains a Wright brother.

Asked for an explanation, a spokesperson for the federal Transportation Security Administration, which is responsible for screening passengers, blames the airline industry, pointing out that “If the airlines didn’t keep selling tickets, we wouldn’t have all these people showing up at airports trying to catch flights.” The spokesperson suggests that people planning to travel by air during busy times should consider other options, such as suicide.

June

... it becomes evident that, barring some highly unlikely political development, the next president of the United States will be either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the nation is in the grip of a worsening heroin epidemic. Coincidence? You be the judge.

Speaking of coincidences: Bill Clinton happens to find himself in the same airport as U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and — as any two people would do if one of them was the nation's chief law enforcement officer and the other was married to the subject of a federal investigation — they meet privately aboard Lynch's Justice Department jet. When word of the meeting leaks out, Lynch assures the press that she and Bill did not discuss the FBI investigation into Hillary's email, adding, ""nor did we inhale."" For her part, Hillary continues to insist that she never emailed anything classified, and even if she did she actually didn't, besides which so did a lot of other people such as Colin Powell and Harry Truman, and this so-called scandal is ancient history from literally years ago that just makes a person sigh and roll her eyes because it is preventing her from fighting for working families while at the same time being a historic woman.

Also for the sake of balance we should note that throughout June Donald Trump continues to emit a steady stream of truly idiotic statements.

In sports, Cleveland — in a historic upset — actually wins something.

But the big sports story for June, and the year, is the death of Muhammad Ali, a person so remarkable that even the tidal wave of phony, saccharine media-manufactured grief-hype that engulfs modern celebrity deaths cannot detract from the simple truth that he really was as great as he said he was.

Internationally, the top story is ""Brexit"" — the decision by voters in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. This comes as a big surprise to professional pollsters, who had confidently predicted the opposite result; they enjoy a hearty laugh, then head across the Atlantic to apply their talents to the forthcoming American presidential election.

Meanwhile British politics is plunged into chaos, the result being that in ...

July

... Prime Minister David Cameron and other top officials resign, new people take office, and the United Kingdom essentially has a new government, ready to move on. This entire process takes about two weeks, or less time than it takes the major American political parties to agree on the seating arrangements for a ""town hall debate.""

In U.S. politics, the Republicans gather in Cleveland to nominate Trump, although many top party officials are unable to attend because of an urgent, compelling need to not be there. Nevertheless Trump receives enthusiastic prime-time endorsements from former celebrity Scott Baio, several dozen Trump children and current Trump wife Melania, who enthralls delegates with a well-received speech in which she tells her heartwarming story of growing up as an African American woman in Chicago. The dramatic highlight comes on the final night, when Trump, in his acceptance speech, brings the delegates cheering to their feet with his emotional challenge to ""grab the future by the p---y.""

On the Democratic side, the month gets off to a rocky start when FBI Director James Comey, announcing the results of the bureau's investigation, reveals that when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, her official emails, some including classified material, were basically as secure from prying eyes as a neon beer sign. Nevertheless Comey says he is recommending that no criminal charges be brought against Clinton, because, quote, ""I don't want to die.""

With that legal hurdle cleared, relieved Democrats gather in Philadelphia for their convention, which opens — in a bid to placate Sanders delegates — with the ceremonial caning of Debbie Wasserman Schultz. This is followed by several hundred speeches praising Hillary Clinton for the many accomplishments she has achieved, as well as the achievements she has accomplished, while at the same time being, historically, a woman. In her acceptance speech, Clinton calls on Americans ""to join with me in building a better world for us and for our children,"" adding, ""or I will crush you like an insect.""

In a media shake-up, Roger Ailes resigns as chairman of Fox News following allegations that his name can be re­arranged to spell ""I ogle rears.""

As the month ends, skydiver Luke Aikins sets a world record by jumping out of a plane 25,000 feet over California without a parachute or wingsuit. He manages to land safely in a net despite the fact that on the way down — in what John Kerry calls ""a deliberate provocation"" — he is strafed by Russian fighter jets.

Speaking of provocations, in ...

August

... Donald Trump goes to Mexico, having been informed by his team of foreign-policy advisers that this is where Mexicans come from. He meets with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, and although he does not try to convince Peña Nieto that Mexico should pay for the huge imaginary wall that he has promised to build, Trump does demonstrate his legendary prowess as a hard-nosed businessman by negotiating what he describes as ""a fantastic price"" on a souvenir sombrero that he claims is ""easily four feet in diameter.""

Meanwhile newly released State Department emails cause some people to suggest that the reason a variety of dodgy foreign businesspeople and nations gave millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state was that they expected — Get a load of THIS wacky right-wing conspiracy theory! — to receive special access to or favors from the U.S. government. Hillary has no choice but to roll her eyes and laugh in a violently unnatural manner at this latest attempt to use these discredited smear tactics to prevent her, a historic and lifelong woman, from fighting for working families as well as working for fighting families.

Abroad, the Summer Olympics open in Brazil amid dire warnings about Zika, riots, muggers, muggers with Zika, and windsurfers being attacked by predatory oceangoing feces. But the games for the most part go smoothly, the biggest glitch being when one of the diving pools mysteriously turns a dark, murky green. The mystery is finally solved when the pool is drained, revealing a Russian nuclear submarine, which Russia insists is in international waters.

In the athletic competition, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt becomes the first athlete ever to win the men's 100-meter final wearing flip-flops. But the U.S. team dominates the Games, with the most memorable performance coming from a team of athletes led by swimmer and rocket scientist Ryan Lochte competing in the Four-Man Gas Station Wall Pee.

Elsewhere in sports, the opening of the National Football League season provides a much-needed diversion to Americans who are sick of being bitterly divided over politics and welcome the opportunity to be bitterly divided over how players respond to the national anthem.

Speaking of bitter, in ...

September

... Clinton and Trump square off in the first presidential debate, which leads to a national conversation about an issue of vital concern to all Americans, namely the alleged weight gain of Alicia Machado, Miss Universe of 1996. This topic is raised by Clinton in an obvious attempt to bait Trump into wasting valuable campaign time talking about something that cannot possibly benefit him, so naturally Trump, who by his own admission has an extremely high IQ, latches on to it like a barnacle on the Titanic. He focuses on the former Miss Venezuela with laserlike intensity for the better part of a week before getting back to his previous campaign strategy of engaging in bitterly personal Twitter feuds, often with other Republicans.

But it is also not a totally great month for Clinton, who appears to collapse while being helped into a van after hastily leaving a 9/11 memorial ceremony. Her campaign, responding with the transparency, openness and candor for which it is famous, initially downplays the incident, saying that Clinton felt ""overheated."" Ninety minutes later she appears outside her daughter's apartment building and tells reporters, ""I'm feeling great."" But later that afternoon her physician releases a statement saying that two days earlier, Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia. This leads to renewed speculation about Clinton's health, which is quickly quelled by a vast army of Clinton campaign officials, surrogates, allies, lackeys, henchpersons and media flunkies, all heavily armed with talking points and declaring, in unison, that she has no undeclared health problems and is going to power through this minor, pesky so-called pneumonia, which is old news and will not distract her from being a historic person of gender with a lifelong commitment to fighting for working etc.

Speaking of overheating, Samsung announces a recall of all Galaxy Note 7 phones after an attempt to rebrand them as ""smart charcoal lighters"" meets with consumer resistance. Adding to Samsung's woes are reports that some of its top-loading washers have exploded, although the company insists that the machines are ""perfectly safe when operated using the delicate cycle,"" provided that ""there are no humans nearby.""

In other technology news, Apple announces the release of the iPhone 7, which is basically the iPhone 6 with the added convenience of not having a headphone jack. The marketing slogan is ""At Least It Doesn't Burst Into Flames.""

In entertainment news, ""Game of Thrones"" once again wins the coveted Emmy Award for Drama Series With the Most Naked People.

But for sheer drama, no TV show can compare with what happens to the American political system in ...

October

... when the U.S. presidential election, until now a cross between farce and soap opera, mutates into a full-on horror show.

The early part of the month goes badly for Trump with the release of a 2005 video in which he talks about kissing and groping women, which according to him he can get away with because he's a star who uses Tic Tacs.

Trump quickly apologizes for the video, noting that (a) it was recorded long ago when he was just 59 years old; (b) his remarks were “locker-room banter” such as you would hear in any locker room in America occupied by morally deficient billionaire pigs; (c) Bill Clinton did way worse things; and (d) WHAT ABOUT BENGHAZI?

But the story does not go away. Over the next week Trump is accused of improper groping by enough women to form a professional softball league. Trump responds to these allegations with a five-pronged defense:

Prong One: These women are lying.

Prong Two: ALL of them. They are LIARS.

Prong Three: They are frankly not attractive enough to be groped by a star of his magnitude.

Prong Four: The election is rigged!

Prong Five: WHAT ABOUT BILL CLINTON AND BENGHAZI?

Meanwhile the Clinton campaign is dealing with a steady stream of WikiLeaks emails suggesting that the Clinton Foundation is dedicated to humanitarian relief in the same sense that the Soprano family was dedicated to waste management. But this kind of scandal is ho-hum stuff for the Clinton campaign, whose slogan has slowly morphed from ""Stronger Together"" into ""At Least She's Predictably Corrupt."" As the month wears on and Trump continues to flail away unconvincingly at his alleged groping victims, it appears more and more likely that Clinton has established herself, with just enough voters, as the least loathsome choice in this hideous, issues-free nightmare of an election.

And then, just when we thought it could not get any weirder or any worse, we are hit with the mother of all October surprises in the form of the incurable genital wart on the body politic known as Anthony Weiner. While probing Weiner's laptop (Har!) for evidence of alleged sexting with an underaged girl, the FBI reportedly discovers thousands of emails that were sent from or to Hillary Clinton's private email server, which apparently had a higher Internet profile than Taylor Swift.

FBI Director James Comey sends a letter informing Congress that the FBI is taking another look at the email issue.

In a display of the intellectual integrity that has made our political class so respected by ordinary citizens, all the Democrats and allied pundits who praised Comey in July as a courageous public servant instantly swap positions with all the Republicans and allied pundits who said he was a cowardly hack.

This new development sends the political world into Full Freakout Mode, with cable-TV political analysts forced to change their underwear on an hourly basis. Meanwhile millions of critical swing voters switch from “undecided” to “suicidal.”

In non-campaign-related October news:

● A government report concludes that the Affordable Care Act (Motto: ""If You Like Your Doctor, Maybe You'll Like Your New Doctor"") is going to cost many people a lot more, while continuing to provide the same range of customizable consumer options as a parking meter.

● In a chilling reminder of the nation’s technological vulnerability, a series of cyberattacks disrupts popular Internet sites such as Twitter and Netflix, forcing millions of Americans to make eye contact with one another.

● In yet another blow to Samsung, the Federal Aviation Administration announces that it will not permit commercial aircraft to fly over states known to contain Galaxy Note 7s.

● In the arts, Bob Dylan refuses to answer his doorbell, forcing members of the Swedish Academy to leave the Nobel Prize for literature in his mailbox.

The month ends on an upbeat note as Americans celebrate Halloween, a welcome escape from the relentless drumbeat of bad news, as evidenced by this FoxNews.com headline, which we swear we are not making up: ""Some Florida parents plan to arm themselves while going trick-or-treating over clown concerns.""

Speaking of treats, in ...

November

... the Chicago Cubs win the World Series. Finally! Yay! What a fun month! Okay, that's our summary of November. Now it's time to move along to the events of ...

De-

No, that would be wrong. This is supposed to be a review of the whole year, warts and all, and we have to face reality. So let’s all take a deep breath, compose ourselves and go back to ...

November

... which begins with yet another letter to congressional leaders from FBI Director Comey, who lately has generated more correspondence than Publishers Clearing House. This time, he says, concerning the newly discovered emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop: never mind. This forces Republicans and Democrats to again swap positions on whether Comey is a courageous patriot or total scum. For a brief period members of Congress are so confused about who stands where that they are in real danger of accidentally working together and accomplishing something. Fortunately before this happens the two sides are able to sort things out and resume being bitterly deadlocked.

As Election Day approaches, a consensus forms among the experts in the media-political complex, based on a vast array of demographic and scientific polling data evaluated with sophisticated analytical tools. These experts, who have made lucrative careers out of going on TV and explaining America to Americans, overwhelmingly agree that Hillary Clinton will win, possibly in a landslide, and this could very well mean the end of the Republican Party. The Explainers are very sure of this, nodding in unison while smiling in bemusement at the pathetic delusions of the Trump people. Unfortunately, it turns out that a large sector of the American public has not been brought up to speed on all this expert analysis. And so it comes to pass that the unthinkable happens, in the form of ...

Decem-

No, damn it! We have to do this! What happens in ...

November

... is that Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, unless this turns out to be one of those really vivid dreams, like the one where you're at the dentist but you're naked and your dentist is Bette Midler and spiders keep coming out of your mouth.

Trump’s victory stuns the nation. Not since the darkest days of the Civil War have so many Americans unfriended each other on Facebook. Some even take the extreme step of writing “open letters.” Angry, traumatized protesters cry, march, shout, smash windows, set fires — and that’s just the New York Times editorial board. Leading celebrities who vowed to leave the country if Trump won immediately start making plans to ... okay, to not actually leave the country per se, but next time they definitely will and YOU’LL BE SORRY.

In Washington, Democrats who believed in a strong president wielding power via executive orders instantly exchange these deeply held convictions with Republicans who until Election Day at roughly 10 p.m. Eastern time believed fervently in filibusters and limited government.

On TV, the professional Explainers, having failed spectacularly to predict what just happened, pause for a period of somber and contrite self-reflection lasting close to 15 minutes before they begin the crucial work of explaining to the rest of us what will happen next.

Joe Biden lies awake nights, staring at the ceiling.

Meanwhile a somber Trump, preparing to assume the most powerful office on the planet, puts the pettiness of the campaign behind him and — facing a world rife with turmoil — gets down to the all-important work of taking Twitter shots at the cast of ""Hamilton."" He also begins assembling a Cabinet that — reflecting the diversity of the nation he has been elected to lead — includes several non-billionaires. The president-elect also receives classified briefings, during which he learns, among other things, that there are a LOT of foreign countries, including some where he does not even have golf courses.

Meanwhile the Democrats, now on a multi-year losing streak that has cost them the presidency, both houses of Congress and a majority of the state legislatures, desperately seek an explanation for their party’s failures. After a hard, critical look in the mirror, they are forced, reluctantly, to stop seeking scapegoats and place the blame where it belongs: the electoral college, the Russians, Facebook and of course James Comey.

In the month's biggest non-election news, the death of Fidel Castro is greeted with expressions of sorrow from several dozen world leaders who never had to live under his rule, and tears of happiness from many thousands of Cubans who did.

As the bitter and tumultuous month finally draws to a close, Americans briefly stop fighting over politics and come together to celebrate Thanksgiving in the same way the Pilgrims did in 1623: fighting over flat-screen TVs.

But the focus turns back to politics in…

December

... during which Trump continues to dominate the news, his face appearing 24/7 on every channel including the Food Network, even when the TV is turned off.

Early in the month the president-elect ruffles the feathers of the Chinese government when — in what is viewed as a departure from diplomatic protocol — he texts Beijing a poop emoji. Also he threatens a drone strike against Alec Baldwin.

But the big story continues to be the Trump Cabinet. His choice for secretary of defense is James N. ""Mad Dog"" Mattis, who impresses Trump with his sophisticated understanding of modern military strategy and also by biting the head off a live hamster. Most of the drama, however, involves the herd of hopefuls auditioning for secretary of state, including former Trump foe Mitt Romney, who dons wingtip kneepads for his pilgrimage to Trump Tower, after which he explains to the press that his previous criticisms of Trump have been taken out of context, particularly his use of the phrase ""scum toad,"" which Romney says he meant ""in the spirit of constructive dialogue.""

Chris Christie dines alone in a Golden Corral in Freehold, N.J., pondering whether to accept the ambassadorship to Belize.

The New York Times and Washington Post, seeking to improve their understanding of pro-Trump America, partner with TV network news divisions to create “Operation Outreach,” in which teams of reporters will travel to non-coastal regions carrying rucksacks full of chewing tobacco and moon pies, which they will trade with the natives in return for colorful quotes about their political views, religious beliefs, sex practices involving livestock, etc.

Meanwhile abroad:

● French President François Hollande announces that he will not seek reelection, leading professional pollsters to predict, based on scientific analysis of the data, that he will win in a landslide.

● In a disturbing development, North Korean troops mass near the South Korean border armed with what intelligence sources identify as “a large quantity of Samsung Galaxy Note 7s.”

Finally, mercifully, 2016 draws to a close. On New Year’s Eve, a festive crowd gathers in Times Square, and millions more tune in on TV, to watch the ball drop that marks the dawn of the new year. This is one of the great traditions that connect us as a nation, and it serves to remind us that, although we disagree on many things, we are all part of the same big family — the American family — and when all is said and done, we hate each other.

This is what we are thinking as the big lighted ball begins to slowly descend the pole, traveling roughly two feet before it is vaporized by Russian fighter jets.

Happy new year, fellow Americans. It’s going to be exciting.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/12/30/us-russia-sanctions/95991700/",0,"The Obama administration announced sweeping new measures against Russia on Thursday in retaliation for what U.S. officials have characterized as interference in this fall’s presidential election, ordering the expulsion of Russian “intelligence operatives” and slapping new sanctions on state agencies and individuals suspected in the hacks of U.S. computer systems. The response, unveiled just weeks before President Obama leaves office, culminates months of internal debate over how to react to Russia’s election-year provocations. In recent months, the FBI and CIA have concluded that Russia intervened repeatedly in the 2016 election, leaking damaging information in an attempt to undermine the electoral process and help Donald Trump take the White House.

Because Thursday’s announcement is an executive action, it can be undone by the next administration. But Obama’s last-minute measures put pressure on Trump, who has largely waved off the allegations against Russia, to make a decision about whether to keep the punitive measures in place.

In a statement issued by his transition office late Thursday, Trump was noncommittal, saying, “It’s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.”

“Nevertheless,” he said, “in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.”

Taken together, the sanctions and expulsions announced Thursday were the most far-reaching U.S. response to Russian activities since the end of the Cold War, and the most specific related to Russian hacking. The administration also released a listing of addresses of computers linked to the Russian cyberattacks and samples of malware inserted into U.S. systems.

Several lawmakers have called on the administration for months to respond, saying that tougher measures needed to be taken to punish Russia. The White House resisted acting ahead of the election for fear of appearing partisan.

Obama, who had promised a tough U.S. response, said the new actions were “a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U.S. interests.” He said Americans should be “alarmed” by an array of Russian moves, including interference in the election and harassment of U.S. diplomats overseas.

“Such activities have consequences,” the president said in a statement.

The new measures include sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies, three companies that are believed to have provided support for government cyber operations, and four Russian cyber officials. The two agencies named are the GRU, Russia’s military spy service, and the civilian spy agency FSB, a successor to the KGB.

The administration has also ordered 35 Russian operatives to leave the United States and will shut down Russian-owned facilities on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and on Long Island in New York believed to have been used for intelligence purposes.

State Department spokesman Mark C. Toner said the diplomatic retaliation was partly a response to Russian provocations against American personnel in Russia, including “arbitrary police stops, physical ­assault, and the broadcast on state TV of personal details about our personnel that put them at risk.”

In June, a senior U.S. diplomat was attacked by a Russian soldier at the doorway to the U.S. Embassy as he tried to enter. That incident, circulated on video, resulted in the earlier expulsion of two Russian diplomats from Washington. The State Department also said that personal details about U.S. diplomats were publicly released in Moscow, and that the Russian government had refused to approve security upgrades to the U.S. diplomatic facility in St. Petersburg.

Obama suggested Thursday that the United States may undertake covert activity in response to Russian activities. Officials gave no details. The Treasury Department also designated two Russian hackers, Evgeny Bogachev and Aleksey Belan, for criminal cyber-activities involving U.S. firms and unrelated to the election hacks.

Moscow, which has denied involvement in attacks related to the election, vowed to respond in kind.

“I cannot say now what the response will be, although, as we know, there is no alternative here to the principle of reciprocity,” Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement late Thursday evening carried by the Interfax news service.

Peskov said the response would be authorized by President Vladimir Putin. In virtually all previous cases of Soviet or Russian diplomats declared persona non grata in this country, an equal number of U.S. officials have been expelled from Russia.

Trump has called on the Obama administration to present proof of Russian hacking. Speaking Thursday before the reprisal announcement, Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, said Trump’s views on the hacking allegations could change if more solid evidence emerges that Russia was responsible.

“If the United States has clear proof of anyone interfering with our elections, we should make that known,” Spicer said, adding, “Right now we need to see further facts.”

Spicer also said that some on the political left were using the Russia allegations to downplay Trump’s victory at the polls on Nov. 8.

U.S. officials say they have been refining for months their assessment of the attacks, in which they say a Russian military intelligence agency hacked the Democratic National Committee and stole emails that were later released by WikiLeaks. Emails hacked from the account of John Podesta, who chaired Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, also were made public. State electoral systems were also targeted, but administration officials said Thursday, as they have in the past, that they have no evidence the actual voting process was interfered with on Election Day.

While U.S. officials have not named Putin himself in the ­cyber-meddling, Obama has suggested that approval came from the very top of the Russian government.

As part of the new measures, the administration has amended a 2015 executive order allowing the president to respond to foreign cyberattacks.

That order was intended primarily for attacks against infrastructure or commercial targets, but officials adapted it to cover attempts to undermine the electoral process — not only in the United States but in other countries as well.

In a call with reporters, U.S. officials said they chose to announce the new measures before the end of Obama’s term in an attempt to educate Americans about Russian activities and to deter future intrusions.

“There’s every reason to believe Russia will interfere with future U.S. elections and future elections around the world,” said one senior official, speaking on the condition of anonymity ­because he was not authorized to speak on the record.

“The Russian actions have been sustained over an extended period of time, and by any definition are against the national interests of the United States, not the interests of President Obama.” The harassment, the official said, “has been escalating steadily for some time” and is “a direct threat to the ability of the United States to conduct diplomacy.”

Both U.S. allies and American businesses were concerned about Russian activities, the official said, and “if [Trump transition officials] aren’t, then they should explain why.”

The Obama administration also released a document providing some details about the cyber operation U.S. officials have labeled ""Grizzly Steppe,"" including a list of names the hackers used.

These groups have conducted campaigns against think tanks, universities and corporations, as well as government agencies, according to the administration. In foreign countries, they have carried out damaging and disruptive cyberattacks, including on electrical utilities.

John Carlin, former head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said the measures announced Thursday were significant.

“It’s important to show that we can do attribution and are willing to impose a deterrent — not just for the Russians, but for the world, as we’re figuring out what the norms should be in cyberspace,” he said. “It’s not a world of free passes.”

Identifying the malware that was used, imposing sanctions and affecting the Russians’ ability to hack for intelligence purposes all “raise the cost” of conducting such activities, Carlin said.

The Obama administration has already imposed sanctions on Russia for its activities in Ukraine, but those measures do not appear to have deterred Russia’s actions there.

Congressional Republicans welcomed the crackdown but said it was overdue.

“It is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia,” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a statement.

Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said the measures were inadequate and promised to fight for stronger sanctions.

Despite the Obama administration’s efforts to deliver an 11th-hour blow against Russia, Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the international affairs committee of the State Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, suggested the measures would not inflict lasting damage.

“None of this will change the results of the election of the American president, and in January, the rightful owner of the White House will be Donald Trump,” Slutsky said. “I expect that with his arrival the dialogue between Russia and the United States will be conducted in a more healthy political atmosphere.”

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/07/fort-lauderdale-airport-shooting-what-we-know/96279672/",0,"The suspected gunman in an airport shooting rampage in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. — Esteban Santiago, 26, an Iraq War veteran — has been charged with federal crimes and could face the death penalty, the Justice Department announced Saturday night. Santiago showed signs of violence and what authorities called “erratic behavior” in the months before they said he traveled 4,000 miles from home, loaded a gun in a baggage area and killed five people in some 80 seconds.

Investigators said Saturday that Santiago drew frequent police attention for domestic violence in his Alaska home town and twice was arrested within the last year. Two months before the shooting, they said, he was admitted to a mental-health facility after showing up at an FBI field office and telling agents his mind was being controlled, complaining that the government was forcing him to watch Islamic State videos.

Police held his gun for a month, and then gave it back to him, authorities said.

Those sporadic run-ins now raise questions about how Santiago evaded detection as he boarded two flights — checking in a weapon — before he landed at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and allegedly fired at unsuspecting travelers.

Investigators said they were still trying to determine if there was a terrorism motive. A day after the shooting, agents had interviewed more than 100 people, including Santiago, who surrendered after firing all of his ammunition by dropping onto the floor, spread-eagle, near a baggage area when a sheriff’s deputy approached him, according to an FBI affidavit.

Investigators are scouring Santiago’s electronics and digital media, said a law enforcement official familiar with the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity, trying to determine whether he had any real contact with Islamic State sympathizers and whether that motivated him to carry out the shooting.

“We have not ruled out anything,” George L. Piro, the FBI special agent in charge of the bureau’s Miami division, said Saturday morning at a briefing. “We continue to look at all avenues, all motives for this attack. And we continue to look at the terrorism aspect as a motive.”

The bloody rampage sent people scrambling through the terminals and across the airfield at one of the country’s busiest airports, shutting down all flights for hours as paramedics and federal and local law enforcement officers flooded the scene. Six were injured in the shooting, and dozens more were hurt in the chaos that followed.

Santiago was placed in federal custody Saturday morning following a lengthy interview by Broward County Sheriff’s deputies and FBI agents. The federal charges against him are: performing an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation that caused serious bodily injury; using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence; and causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm.

The FBI is leading a sprawling investigation that spans from Florida to Alaska. Names of the victims have not yet been released, because not all families have been notified. The Associated Press reported that at least four of the five were vacationers picking up their bags before going to board cruise ships.

Santiago is believed to have lived most recently in Anchorage with a girlfriend and a young child. Neighbors said two other children also lived at the house. Local police and FBI officials in a Saturday news conference described his life as chaotic, with frequent police run-ins.

At least four times in 2016, police were called to Santiago’s house for physical disturbances or domestic violence. It is unclear who made those calls. In one case, he appears to have taken a plea deal and, in exchange for compliance with its terms, the charges were dismissed.

When he showed up in November at the local FBI office, he had a newborn and a weapon in the car, said Anchorage police chief Chris Tolley. But in an interview at the time with the FBI, Santiago stated that “he did not wish to harm anyone,” said Marlin Ritzman, special agent in charge of the FBI Anchorage field office.

“Our agents contacted local authorities who took custody of Mr. Santiago and transported him to a local mental-health facility for evaluation,” Ritzman said. The FBI interviewed his family members, conducted database reviews and interagency checks, and ultimately closed what it termed an “assessment” of Santiago.

Santiago’s weapon was logged “for safekeeping,” Tolley said. But one month later, the weapon was released to him.

Santiago arrived in Fort Lauderdale on Friday after flying from Anchorage, with a layover in Minneapolis. He traveled alone and checked a single bag — one that contained his firearm, said Jesse Davis, chief of police at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where passengers routinely check their weapons. “We’re a big hunting state, so we get quite a lot of that,” Davis said.

Travelers are allowed to bring firearms with them onto flights as long as the guns are unloaded, locked in a hard-sided container and in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration. Ammunition can be brought onto flights but also must be placed in checked baggage.

“Everything appeared normal,” Davis said. Santiago checked in for his Delta flight more than four hours early, which was unusual, Davis said, but “didn’t call attention to himself at all.”

In Fort Lauderdale, at the Terminal 2 baggage claim, Santiago picked up his bag from the carousel, went to the bathroom and loaded his Walther 9mm semiautomatic handgun, federal officials said. When he came out, he began firing, shooting the first people he encountered, according to an FBI affidavit.

Mario Andrade, a driver from Carey Limousine, was waiting for his customer, Ari Fleischer, who was White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, near the bottom of the escalator in the Delta baggage area of Terminal 2. He was holding a sign with Fleischer’s last name and talking on the phone with another driver. Fleischer’s 12:15 p.m. flight was late and it was nearly 1 p.m.

Then, Andrade heard gunfire.

“It was very fast, like tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat,” Andrade said. “I said, ‘Oh my God, someone is shooting!’ ”

He said that he immediately dropped to the floor, people were running and he heard screaming all around him.

Andrade said he looked up and saw a man in a blue shirt who had a gun in his hand. The gunman, he said, began walking slowly toward him and had a “surprised look” on his face, “like, Oh my God, what happened?’ ”

Relatives told news outlets that Santiago had a history of mental-health problems, including some that followed his military service in Iraq with the Puerto Rico National Guard.

“Only thing I could tell you was when he came out of Iraq, he wasn’t feeling too good,” his uncle, Hernan Rivera, told Newark’s Star-Ledger newspaper.

His aunt told the newspaper he was hospitalized after returning from Iraq.

“He lost his mind,” Ruiz Rivera said in Spanish.

He had seemed to get the help he needed, and became a father in September, she told Noticias Telemundo. But his mental health-issues, she said, worsened in December. “They took him to the hospital, but they didn’t tell me what for, but they had him in an isolated room because he was a little wrong in the head and he started to like hear things,” she said.

The airport reopened Saturday morning for flights, officials said, though they warned that some flights were canceled or rerouted in the wake of Friday’s violence. Some travelers were also being directed other two major airports in Miami and West Palm Beach.

http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/rex-tillerson-state-confirmation-233435?lo=ap_c1",0,"Secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson called U.S. intelligence findings of Russian interference in the presidential election ""troubling"" Wednesday but said he has not yet seen classified information about allegations that Russia intended to help President-elect Donald Trump. Tillerson, the former top executive at ExxonMobil, also declined to strongly denounce Russian military actions in Syria that have led to civilian deaths or to broadly condemn alleged human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. He conceded that climate change is man-made and needs to be addressed by world powers — but also that there’s very little he can do to control the potential global fallout of Trump’s tweeting.

Tillerson’s hearing was the marquee event on a busy day amid a consequential week for the incoming Trump administration as the president-elect’s top Cabinet picks begin the confirmation process. As Tillerson testified, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump’s choice for attorney general, was sitting for his second day of hearings with the Judiciary Committee and Elaine L. Chao, Trump’s choice for transportation secretary, testified before the Senate commerce panel.

Lawmakers were also keeping tabs on Trump’s long-anticipated news conference in New York, his first since winning the presidency, where he conceded that Russia had meddled in the U.S. election.

Tillerson’s sometimes testy confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee gave the 64-year-old Texan his first chance to address concerns that ExxonMobil put profits ahead of human rights, environmental and policy concerns, and to explain his relationship with Russia.

“I understand full well the responsibilities and the seriousness” of the job, Tillerson said. “I don’t view this as a game in any way,” he said, rejecting a characterization that he might view problems and policies as transactional.

Sharp inquiries by senators in both parties signaled that Democrats and Republicans are still skeptical about whether Tillerson is suited to be the chief U.S. diplomat alongside a president with no government experience, particularly at a time of increasingly strained relations between the United States and Russia.

With his smooth baritone voice, he assured senators that he would set aside a profit-driven worldview born of 41 years as an oil executive and would recuse himself from decisions involving his former employer, the world’s largest oil company. Tillerson retired Dec. 31 and has pledged to sell his remaining ExxonMobil stock.

But Tillerson seemed constrained and at times reluctant in answering questions about some of the most controversial positions adopted by Trump during the presidential campaign. In some cases he said he does not yet have sufficient information to comment in detail, as with the Russian presidential hacking allegations clouding Trump’s ascension to the presidency now, and in other cases he said the incoming administration has not yet settled on its views.

“In my conversations with him on the subjects we have discussed, he’s been very open and inviting of my views and respectful of those views,” Tillerson said of Trump. “My sense is that were going to have all the views presented on the table.”

Tillerson called himself a pragmatist about Russia, which he said is not a friend of the United States but can be a partner. Moscow has been emboldened in Ukraine and elsewhere by a void in strong U.S. leadership, Tillerson said, and he pledged a tough stance with both Russia and China over territorial ambitions.

“We have stumbled,” he said. “In recent decades, we have cast American leadership into doubt.”

He was most critical of foreign policy decisions made by President Obama, but he also found fault with the Iraq War launched by Republican President George W. Bush.

He declined to label Russian President Vladi­mir Putin a war criminal or to condemn Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte over human rights abuses the leader himself claims he committed.

He seemed to stun some senators by saying he had not yet discussed Russian action in Aleppo, Syria, with Trump. He frustrated others by appearing to stonewall questions about ExxonMobil lobbying against economic sanctions, especially concerning Russia, where the company does extensive business.

Tillerson said he never lobbied on the issue and fumbled over whether ExxonMobil ever had. At one point he said that to the best of his memory, ExxonMobil had not done that.

Democrats on the committee produced lobbying records that show ExxonMobil had said it was lobbying over various economic sanctions measures, including tough sanctions on Iran in 2010 and more recently over sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea.

Under questioning by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, Tillerson did not dispute intelligence officials’ findings on Russia, saying that he had reviewed the unclassified report that U.S. agencies released last week on Russian interference in the election. More detailed classified versions of that report were presented to Trump and to President Obama.

“That report clearly is troubling and indicates that all of the actions you just described were undertaken,” Tillerson said.

Rubio is the only Republican on the committee who has suggested he might oppose Tillerson — a move that could imperil the former executive’s nomination. Any GOP resistance could endanger the nomination in the Senate, which Republicans hold with 52 seats.

As the hearing concluded, Rubio signaled he has not made up his mind.

“I have to make sure I’m 100 percent behind whatever decision that I make, because when I make it, it isn’t going to change,” he told reporters.

Late Wednesday the committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, said he would need more time and research before he could vote for Tillerson. He called the nominee’s answers on sanctions and human rights issues troubling and confusing and said Tillerson seemed unwilling to fully separate himself from his former employer.

Rubio has become a proxy for other GOP senators voicing similar concerns about Tillerson’s views on Putin and Russia. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who do not sit on the panel, have indicated reluctance to vote for Tillerson, as have others. McCain said Tuesday that he had no plans to attend the proceedings but that he intended to send Tillerson written questions regarding Russia “and other matters.”

Concerns with Tillerson's ties to Russia include that he accepted an Order of Friendship award given personally by Putin in 2013 and because he has met with the Russian leader and other senior government officials numerous times.

Tillerson appeared to break with Trump over the whether Russia was justified in annexing the Crimea region of Ukraine, the value of an international climate agreement and the wisdom of expanding the number of countries that possess nuclear weapons, among other issues.

He also appeared to depart from the president he would serve in support for the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and rejection of any “blanket” ban on Muslim immigration or registry.

Tillerson hedged on his views on the human role in climate change and the extent of the threat it poses, although he did say he thinks the United States is better served by remaining a party to the international agreement on climate change brokered under the Obama administration.

Trump has vowed to “cancel” U.S. participation in the accord, in which hundreds of countries collectively agreed to slash carbon emissions to help mitigate the effects of global warming.

Under clipped questioning about Trump’s business dealings and Exxon’s views on climate science from Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who was the Democratic nominee for vice president in the 2016 election, Tillerson repeatedly answered “I have no knowledge.”

Kaine asked whether the response came from a lack of knowledge or a refusal to answer; Tillerson said with a smile, “a little of both.”

Tillerson flashed his blunt style again when asked by Sen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) how he might urge Trump to check his prolific tweeting to preserve foreign relations.

“I don’t think I’m going to be telling the boss how he ought to communicate with the American people. That’s going to be his choice,” Tillerson said, adding that he expects to be in sync with Trump on world affairs.

If there’s any disagreement, “I have his cellphone number,” Tillerson added. “And he’s promised me he’ll answer — and he does.”"
3707,3707,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/01/13/justice-dept-to-announce-results-of-investigation-into-chicago-police/?utm_term=.af98270b549b,0,"A federal investigation into the Chicago police found that the department routinely uses excessive force and violates the constitutional rights of residents, particularly those who are black and Latino. The blistering 164-page report by the Justice Department, released Friday, put an unwelcome spotlight on Chicago, a city already struggling with a surge in gun violence that has pushed homicide numbers to their highest level in two decades.

The report, and a pledge by city officials to reform the police department, come in the last days of the Obama administration, which has aggressively pursued investigations of abuse by local law enforcement.

On Friday, Chicago leaders said they had promised to negotiate with the federal government an order, enforceable by a judge, that would reform how the police department handles training, accountability and the way officers use force. A similar agreement is in place for the city of Baltimore.

But President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has criticized government lawsuits that force police reforms. And Trump himself has been a staunch defender of police officers, who he has called the “most mistreated people in this country,” and he has said that crime in this country is on the rise and requires a forceful response.

When asked whether the Chicago action would retain its strength under a Trump administration, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Friday she expected the agreement with Chicago to live on beyond Obama’s term.

“Yes, the top people at the Department of Justice move on, but this agreement is not dependent on one, or two, or three people,” she said.

The report details a grim succession of anecdotes.

Officers are described as running after people who they had no reason to believe committed serious crimes. Some of those chases ended in fatal gunfire. In one case, officers began chasing a man who was described as “fidgeting with his waistband.” Police fired a total of 45 rounds at him, hitting and killing him. No gun was found on the man, the report states, and a gun found almost a block away was both “fully-loaded and inoperable.”

These anecdotes were not limited to fatal incidents. A 16-year-old girl is described as being struck with a baton and shocked with a Taser for not leaving school when she was found carrying a cellphone. A 12-year-old Latino boy was “forcibly handcuffed” without explanation while riding his bike near his father.

Federal officials were also told about officers taking young people to the neighborhood of a rival gang to either leave them there “or display the youth,” putting their lives in danger by suggesting they had given information to police.

While the federal officials on Friday noted that city officials have made efforts recently to enact reforms, they said “complicated and entrenched” causes of the problems could only be fixed with outside help.

The report is the culmination of a 13-month investigation into the country’s second-biggest local law enforcement agency, which has a grim history that includes a former police commander who spent decades leading a torture ring until he was suspended and then fired in the early 1990s.

During the news conference on Friday, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said “some of the findings in the report are difficult to read.” But he also said that many of the problems had already been identified and officials were working to correct them.

“Quite simply, as a department, we need to do better, and you have my promise, and commitment, that we will do better,” Johnson said.

Officers are described as lying, as part of a “code of silence” and also in cases where they had little reason to lie, the report states.

But investigators also described an utter absence of morale in the police force, as officers increasingly feel they are adrift and unsupported, and the report describes suicides and suicide threats among officers as “a significant problem.”

Many “officers feel abandoned by the public and often by their own department,” the report states. “We found profoundly low morale nearly every place we went within CPD. Officers generally feel that they are insufficiently trained and supported to do their work effectively.”

Dean C. Angelo Sr., president of the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, did not respond to a message seeking comment Friday.

The Justice Department began its Chicago investigation in December 2015, just weeks after authorities in the city released video footage showing an officer fatally shooting Laquan McDonald, a black 17-year-old.

This dashboard-camera recording, withheld for more than a year by city officials, showed Officer Jason Van Dyke firing 16 shots into McDonald, some after the teenager had already crumpled to the ground, despite initial accounts that the teenager had lunged at the officer. The video unleashed a torrent of anger on the streets of Chicago, which became the latest in a series of cities that boiled over in recent years after a fatal encounter involving police.

The recording has continued to reverberate in the city. Not long after it was made public, the Justice Department announced that it would begin what is known as a “pattern or practice investigation” into the police department. Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), facing intense criticism, ousted Garry F. McCarthy as police superintendent, while voters decisively dismissed Anita Alvarez, the prosecutor in the case, in an election that highlighted the McDonald shooting.

Emanuel also created a task force to review how the Chicago police handled accountability, training and oversight, and the group released a highly critical report last year, describing the McDonald video as a tipping point giving “voice to long-simmering anger.”

In what some viewed as a prelude to the Justice Department’s findings, the task force’s report described repeatedly hearing from people who felt some police officers are racist and said the police force’s own data “gives validity to the widely held belief the police have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color.”

McCarthy, Johnson’s predecessor, had criticized the Justice Department before the report was released and said investigators never contacted him. Asked about that on Friday, Lynch said that investigators had tried but he was “unavailable,” although she did not elaborate.

Reached after the news conference, McCarthy declined to discuss the contents of the report — saying he still had to review it with his lawyer — but disputed that Justice Department investigators attempted to reach him.

“That is a lie,” McCarthy said. “With all the investigative resources of the federal government, they couldn’t find me here, in River North, which is a neighborhood in Chicago. That is absurd.”

The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois said that the findings confirmed “what we have known for decades” about policing in Chicago.

“The Chicago Urban League believes that the report must be viewed as a milestone,” Shari Runner, president and chief executive of the group, said in a statement. “It is verification of the worst of what we’ve been and continue to be, but offers a viable path to what we want to become.”

Distrust remains an issue between police officers and residents in Chicago. In a poll taken last year, one in three residents said the city’s police officers were doing an excellent or good job; far fewer black residents (12 percent) felt that way then white residents (47 percent) or Hispanic residents (37 percent). The new report also states that police use force almost 10 times as often against black people as white people. Complaints filed against officers by white people were substantially more likely to be substantiated than those filed by black people or Latinos.

Federal investigators said their inquiry found that Chicago police force did not provide officers with suitable guidance for using force, investigate improper uses of force or hold officers accountable for such incidents. Investigators also faulted the city’s methods of handling officer discipline, saying the process “lacks integrity,” while saying that in the rare case where misconduct complaints are sustained, discipline is “haphazard and unpredictable.”

Training is repeatedly described as woefully inadequate, with the report describing officers in a class on deadly force being shown a video made more than three decades ago that depicted tactics “clearly out of date.”

Emanuel acknowledged Friday that there were questions were surrounding what the next administration would do, but vowed to continue working with the government.

“We will continue on the path of reform, because that is the path of progress,” he said. Emanuel later added, “We’re going to continue to work with that new Justice Department.”

Speaking on Capitol Hill during his confirmation hearing this week, Sessions suggested that entire departments filled with good officers could be tarred by the work of individuals and was critical of lawsuits that force reforms.

“These lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness, and we need to be careful before we do that,” Sessions said. He would not commit to leaving unchanged agreements that are in place when he takes over, though he said he would enforce them until changes are made.

The Justice Department can investigate and force systemic changes­ on local police departments and sue them if they do not comply. This authority was given to the federal agency in 1994, when Congress acted in the wake of the 1991 beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers and subsequent unrest following the acquittal of the officers involved.

During the Obama administration, the Civil Rights Division has opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies, according to the Justice Department. Probes have found patterns of excessive force used in police departments including Portland, Ore., Cleveland, Albuquerque, New Orleans, Seattle and Puerto Rico, among others.

The Chicago probe was among the the largest pattern and practices investigations in the Justice Department’s history, involving a force that has 12,000 officers, trailing only the New York police force among local law enforcement agencies in the United States.

The announcement in Chicago came the same day that Justice Department officials also said that the Philadelphia Police Department was making “tremendous progress” in implementing findings from an assessment last year examining how officers use deadly force there.

A day before Lynch spoke in Chicago, she had traveled to Baltimore for officials to outline efforts to revamp policing there. Baltimore’s agreement on reforms came after the Justice Department released, last year, a blistering report accusing the city of discriminatory policies targeting black residents.

Angelo, the head of Chicago’s police union, has said he was concerned federal investigators were rushing to finish the probe before Trump’s inauguration. When asked Friday about the timing of the report’s release, Lynch noted the investigation had begun more than a year ago, though she acknowledged lawyers had worked “quickly” to bring it to fruition.

“This is not a political process, this is an investigative process,” Lynch said.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/08/opinions/looking-at-trump-putin-relationship-wrong-andelman/index.html",0,"President Obama said in an interview that he did not misjudge the potential threats of Vladimir Putin, despite the U.S. intelligence report that the Russian president personally ordered an “influence campaign” to meddle in the U.S. presidential elections. “I don’t think I underestimated him,” Obama told ABC News’s “This Week” in an interview broadcast Sunday, “but I think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation, for cyberhacking and so forth, to have an impact on our open societies, our open systems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that I think are accelerating.”

“This Week” host George Stephanopolous reminded Obama that he had dismissed Republican Mitt Romney’s contention during a debate in the 2012 campaign that Russia was the biggest geopolitical threat to the United States. The report released Friday from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Russian operatives hacked into the emails of Democratic Party officials and released them publicly to harm Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and, ultimately, help Republican Donald Trump, who emerged victorious.

Obama said he ordered the intelligence review “to make sure that we understand this is something that Putin has been doing for quite some time in Europe, initially in the former satellite states where there are a lot of Russian speakers, but increasingly in Western democracies.”

Trump, who has expressed skepticism over the findings, received a private briefing on the report from U.S. officials Friday in New York. In a statement afterward, Trump acknowledged that foreign actors from China, Russia and other countries attempt to hack into U.S. institutions, but he emphasized that the election outcomes were not altered in any way by foreign actors. The intelligence report stated that officials did not attempt to assess the effect on the outcome.

Obama reiterated his concerns that some Republicans seem “to have more confidence in Vladimir Putin than fellow Americans because those fellow Americans were Democrats. That cannot be.”

Asked if Obama included Trump in that category, the president said: “We have to remind ourselves we’re on the same team. Vladimir Putin’s not on our team. If we get to a point where people in this country feel more affinity with a leader who is an adversary and view the United States and our way of life as a threat to him, then we’re gonna have bigger problems than just cyberhacking.”

Some Republican leaders expressed their own concerns about Russia and questioned Trump’s judgment in disputing the intelligence community’s work.

In an interview on NBC News’s “Meet the Press,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said: “When it comes to Trump and Russia, I am really perplexed. I’m not questioning his motives. I’m questioning President-elect Trump’s judgment. I don’t care why the Russians hacked into our system. I don’t care if they were trying to help Trump or trying to help Clinton. I want to stop it. I don’t know what drives him on Russia, but I do know this. That if our policies don’t change vis a vis Russia, the worst is yet to come. And the Congress is going to have a different view on Russia than the president-elect does.”

Graham added that “if after the briefing he is still unsure that will shake me to my core about his judgment.”

Trump aides on Sunday continued to suggest that the intense Washington focus on Russia’s hacking is a politically motivated attack on the president-elect by his Democratic rivals who lost the election. Trump called it a “political witch hunt” on Friday.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who is slated to become Trump’s White House chief of staff, said on CBS News’s “Face the Nation” that it is “indisputable” that the rollout of the report is “clearly politically motivated to discredit the victory of President-elect Trump.

Trump’s briefing “came after leaks [of the report] to the media,” Kellyanne Conway, a Trump senior adviser, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We cannot have people in positions of keeping us all safe and knowing classified information — we can’t have them leaking to the media.”

On “Fox News Sunday,” Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of Trump’s transition team, called the intelligence report “a political rollout of a narrative just a couple weeks before Donald Trump’s inauguration. It bothers me.”

Nunes faulted the Obama administration: “How else do you define it? How does the news media have this information before” key lawmakers?

On Saturday, Trump issued a series of tweets reiterating his desire to establish better relations between the United States and Russia and declared that “only ‘stupid’ people, or fools, would think that it is bad!”

Republicans said Sunday that all recent administrations have sought improved relations with Moscow, including Obama’s and President George W. Bush’s."

http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/14/entertainment/ringling-circus-closing/index.html",0,"When Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus announced late Saturday that it would permanently end all of its performances this May after a 146-year run, there seemed to be a collective gasp online, along with a smattering of nostalgia for “The Greatest Show on Earth.” The show has been, after all, nearly synonymous with “the circus” in the United States since the 1800s, when showman Phineas Taylor Barnum partnered with ringmaster James A. Bailey to produce an exhibition of animals and human oddities. Meanwhile, five brothers from the Ringling family in Wisconsin had set up their own variety act.

After they merged, the circus spent decades touring the United States by train, transporting its iconic spectacle — along with hundreds of animals, performers and big-top tents — from city to city.

However, in recent years, the circus had been facing mounting obstacles that even its most acrobatic members could not overcome: declining ticket sales, high operating costs and an increasingly negative public sentiment about forcing captive wild animals to perform as entertainment.

“There isn’t any one thing,” Kenneth Feld, chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, told the Associated Press. “This has been a very difficult decision for me and for the entire family.”

His father, Irvin Feld, bought the circus in 1967, and it has been operated by the family-owned Feld Entertainment since. Today, the company has about 500 employees, who were informed Saturday night about the closure.

Kenneth Feld told the AP that it was becoming increasingly difficult to make a traveling circus viable and relevant in a world of modern entertainment.

“Try getting a 3- or 4-year-old today to sit for 12 minutes,” he added, referring to the show’s 12-minute tiger act.

Ringling Bros. had also been the target of protests by animal rights groups and was involved in protracted legal battles with many of them.

In 2015, Ringling Bros. announced it would stop using elephants in its shows. The lumbering mammals delivered their final performances last May — dancing, spinning and standing on pedestals at the command of the ringmaster — and then were retired to a reserve in central Florida.

The move exacerbated the show’s demise; the elephants’ departure ultimately expedited what was a “difficult business decision.”

“Ringling Bros. ticket sales have been declining, but following the transition of the elephants off the road, we saw an even more dramatic drop,” Kenneth Feld said in a statement Saturday. “This, coupled with high operating costs, made the circus an unsustainable business for the company.”

Among animal activist groups, news of its closure Saturday was met with a resounding cheer.

The Humane Society of the United States described itself as “long a bitter adversary of Feld Entertainment and Ringling Bros.” in its response to the news. In 2014, Feld Entertainment won $25.2 million in settlements from groups including the Humane Society, ending a 14-year fight over allegations that circus employees mistreated elephants, the AP reported.

“Ringling Bros. has changed a great deal over a century and a half, but not fast enough,” Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society, said in a statement. “It’s just not acceptable any longer to cart wild animals from city to city and have them perform silly yet coercive stunts. I know this is bittersweet for the Feld family, but I applaud their decision to move away from an institution grounded on inherently inhumane wild animal acts.”

The animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals also welcomed the announcement Saturday night, calling it “the end of the saddest show on earth” and demanding that other acts follow suit.

“All other animal circuses, roadside zoos, and wild animal exhibitors, including marine amusement parks like SeaWorld and the Miami Seaquarium, must take note: society has changed, eyes have been opened, people know now who these animals are, and we know it is wrong to capture and exploit them,” PETA said in a statement.

As The Washington Post’s Elahe Izadi reported in 2015, the death in 1998 of Kenny, a 3-year-old Asian elephant with the Ringling Bros., ultimately led to complaints about and greater attention to the treatment of the circus’s elephants:

He sat out a third show that day but was led into the arena to watch. Kenny died overnight in his stall. His death triggered a series of events: A whistleblower tipped off People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the group said, and it contacted the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The agency eventually brought a complaint that charged the circus with failing to handle Kenny in a way that “did not cause behavioral stress and unnecessary discomfort” and said that handlers made the young elephant perform even after discovering he was sick and needed to be seen by a veterinarian. Eventually, the USDA dropped the complaint and the circus’s parent company agreed to donate $20,000 to Asian elephant organizations.

Last year, California and Rhode Island moved to ban the use of the bullhook, also known as an elephant goad or ankus — a tool used to train elephants that activist groups describe as cruel and inhumane. The Rhode Island ban took effect Jan. 1. The California ban takes effect in 2018.

Ringling Bros. currently has two circus units: The final shows will be in Providence, R.I., on May 7, and in Uniondale, N.Y., on May 21. While the show retired its elephants last year, the circus still has a huge menagerie, including lions, tigers, camels, donkeys, alpacas, kangaroos and llamas, according to the Associated Press.

3721,3721,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-cabinet-nominees-meet-growing-ethical-questions/2017/01/18/a7d82af8-ddaf-11e6-acdf-14da832ae861_story.html?utm_term=.78061538ff28,0,"Three of Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks came under growing fire Wednesday on ethical issues, potentially jeopardizing their nominations. The most serious concerns surround personal investments by Trump’s health and human services nominee, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), in health-care firms that benefited from legislation that he was pushing at the time. Additionally, Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), Trump's choice to head the Office of Management and Budget, has acknowledged during his confirmation process that he failed to pay more than $15,000 in state and federal employment taxes for a household employee.

And Commerce Department nominee Wilbur Ross revealed that one of the “dozen or so” housekeepers he has hired since 2009 was undocumented, which he said he discovered only recently. The employee was fired as a result, he added.

All of those are the kinds of problems that have torpedoed nominees in the past. But it is far from certain — or even likely — that any of Trump’s nominees will buckle under the political pressure.

That is in part because the ­president-elect himself has broken so many norms — notably, by flouting the convention of major-party presidential candidates making their tax returns public and by refusing to sever himself from his financial interests while he is in the White House.

Critics say that Trump’s actions and those of his nominees suggest that an incoming administration that promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington has instead brought in a new, lower set of standards.

“This is a swamp Cabinet,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).

Schumer recalled that former senator Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) withdrew his nomination to become President Obama’s health and human services secretary in 2009 when a controversy arose over Daschle’s failure to pay taxes for, among other things, the perquisite of having a car and driver. As with Mulvaney, Daschle blamed his lapse on an oversight.

See photos from the past two weeks of confirmation hearings for Trump’s Cabinet nominees + 26 Hearings continue for the president’s picks for top administration jobs.

“If failure to pay taxes was disqualifying for Democratic nominees, then the same should be true for Republican nominees,” Schumer said.

When Daschle’s nomination collapsed, Obama said: “Ultimately it’s important for this administration to send a message that there aren’t two sets of rules — you know, one for prominent people and one for ordinary folks who have to pay their taxes.”

Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that the vetting process for Cabinet nominees had been tightened considerably since the days of the Clinton administration, when problems arose that were similar to those facing Trump’s nominees.

“From what we can tell, that process has not been vigorously applied by this transition team,” Mann said. “If Donald Trump can blow away all considerations of conflicts of interest, it’s a little hard to be insistent on these other matters. Trump is a category all by himself.”

One factor making it easier for Trump’s nominees to prevail in the GOP-controlled Senate is a 2013 rule change — ironically, one that was engineered over Republican objections by the Democrats who were then in the majority. It ended the ability of senators to filibuster Cabinet nominees, which means that nominees can be confirmed with 51 votes. There are 52 Republicans in the chamber.

“What’s different now is that [blocking a nominee] is going to require Republicans to stand up to their own president,” said Jim Manley, a longtime aide to former minority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). “I’m not sure that’s going to happen. So far, it seems like everyone is afraid of getting on the wrong side of a tweet storm.”

In several instances, when controversy has erupted around Trump’s appointees, the initial reaction of the president-elect and his team has been to counterattack.

That was the case when plagiarism charges surfaced against conservative pundit Monica Crowley, whom Trump had named senior director of strategic communications at the National Security Council.

“Any attempt to discredit Monica is nothing more than a politically motivated attack that seeks to distract from the real issues facing the country,” the presidential transition team said in a statement.

But more evidence accumulated until Crowley announced Monday that she would relinquish the post “after much reflection.”

“The team thought itself immune from the political laws of gravity,” said Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University. “The Crowley case showed they’re not immune. We’ll see what happens with these other cases.”

Questions are growing most rapidly around Price, whose investments, Schumer said, appear to show “a clear and troubling pattern.”

Democrats are also complaining that Senate GOP leaders are trying to rush hearings for some nominees, including a rare evening hearing on Tuesday for Betsy DeVos, Trump’s choice for education secretary.

Schumer noted that some hearings have had very little seating for the general public and that others have been held before a nominee’s required ethics background check was completed.

Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Wednesday: “A lot of this is Senate Democrats doing what they can to find stall tactics.”

Trump’s nominees are also coming under criticism for lacking a depth in their knowledge of the policy areas that are the purview of the Cabinet departments they will run.

Billionaire school choice activist DeVos, for instance, was widely ridiculed for answering a Democratic question about whether it is proper to have guns in school by saying firearms may be needed in places like Wyoming to protect against grizzly bears.

She also argued that states should have the right to decide whether to enforce the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which requires public schools to provide free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities. When told that the act is a federal civil rights law, DeVos said: “I may have confused it.”

Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Trump’s nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, was asked what level of lead consumption would be acceptable for children — a question related to the water crisis in Flint, Mich.

“That’s something I have not reviewed nor know about. I would be concerned about any level of lead going into the drinking water, or obviously human consumption,” Pruitt said. “But I have not looked at the scientific research.”

Public health officials have long said there is no safe level of lead, especially for children.

During an appearance on Fox News Channel on Wednesday morning, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway defended the performance of Trump’s nominees and accused Democrats of attempting to score political points.

“The idea of humiliating and trying to embarrass qualified men and women who just wish to serve this nation is reprehensible,” Conway said."

His remarks as delivered, with annotations and explanations, are here. Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.

We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.

Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.

We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.

Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.

Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People.

For too long, a small group in our nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.

Washington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth.

Politicians prospered – but the jobs left, and the factories closed.

The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.

Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.

Advertisement

That all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.

It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.

This is your day. This is your celebration.

And this, the United States of America, is your country.

What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.

January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.

The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.

Everyone is listening to you now.

You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.

At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.

Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.

Advertisement

These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.

But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.

This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.

We are one nation – and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.

The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.

For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;

Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;

We've defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own;

And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.

We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.

One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.

The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.

But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.

We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.

From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.

From this moment on, it’s going to be America First.

Share this article Share

Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.

We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.

I will fight for you with every breath in my body – and I will never, ever let you down.

America will start winning again, winning like never before.

We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.

We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.

We will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.

We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.

We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.

We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.

We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.

At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.

When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.

The Bible tells us, “how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.”

We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.

When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.

There should be no fear – we are protected, and we will always be protected.

We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.

Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.

In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.

We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.

The time for empty talk is over.

Now arrives the hour of action.

Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.

We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.

We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.

A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.

It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.

And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.

So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:

You will never be ignored again.

Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.

Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make America Wealthy Again.

We Will Make America Proud Again.

We Will Make America Safe Again."

http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/march-life-washington-anti-abortion-trump-234238",0,"Thousands of abortion opponents gathered in cold, blustery weather near the Washington Monument Friday and heard Vice President Mike Pence tell the annual March for Life that the Trump administration is determined to advance the fight against abortion. The massive crowd, bearing flags, banners and placards, then flowed down Constitution Avenue, filling the street, and rallied at the Supreme Court building across from the Capitol.

“We will not grow weary,” Pence said in a ten-minute addresss to the throng at the monument. “We will not rest, until we restore a culture of life in America for ourselves and our posterity,”

He said the administration is bent on ending tax-payer funding of abortion and abortion providers.

And he said that “next week President Donald Trump will announce a Supreme Court nominee who will uphold the God-given liberty enshrined in our Constitution in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia.”

Scalia, a conservative associate justice of the Supreme Court, died last year.

“Life is winning again in America,” said Pence, who added that Trump asked him to speak at the rally. “That is evident in...the historic election of a president...who I proudly say stands for the right to life.”

Pence was the first U.S. vice president to address the march in its history.

Bundled against a stiff wind, marchers from around the country first descended on the northeast grounds of the monument.

Pence, who has called himself an “evangelical Catholic,” has long been a hero among antiabortion activists and as governor of Indiana signed what was considered some of the strictest laws on abortion.

Also addressing the crowd was key Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway.

“I am a wife, a mother, a Catholic, counselor to the president of the United States of America and, yes, I am pro-life,” she said.

“This is a new day, a new dawn, for life,” she said.

The right to life “is not a privilege,” she said. “Its is not a choice. It is God-given...This is a time of incredible promise for the pro-life, pro-adoption movement.”

“We hear you,” she told the crowd, which earlier had been chanting, “Kell-ee-anne! Kell-ee-anne!”

“We see you,” she said. “We respect you. And we look forward to working with you.”

This year, organizers hoped to see a surge of energy with the ascension of a president who is expected to move forward on antiabortion policies, including defunding Planned Parenthood and appointing an antiabortion Supreme Court justice.

“He’s pro-life,” Lynn Ray, coordinator of campus ministry at the Louisiana State University at Alexandria, said Friday as she stood on Constitution Avenue with a group from the university. “So that’s good for us.”

“Being that we’re Catholics, we’re very pro-life,” she said. “Every step we take, we take for an unborn baby,” she said. “We’re not persecuting anyone, of course, just marching for the babies.”

Madeline Runyan, 22, a senior at LSU, said she, too, was pleased with President Trump’s stance on abortion. “I’m very confident in what he’s doing to help this cause,” she said. “I’m really excited and optimistic.”

The rally began at around 11:45 a.m. Pence spoke shortly after noon. The march began at around 1 p.m., and the crowd moved east, past the Capitol, and toward the Supreme Court, where another large assembly had already gathered.

There were members of the clergy, as well as “Bikers for Life.”

Many marchers were in school and church groups, carrying flags, banners, posters — and a life-size cutout of Pope Francis. They sang, chanted and prayed. The vast majority was white.

Dan Kehoe didn’t see the march as a political statement, but a religious one.

The 34-year-old from Taos, Mo., was a chaperone on his daughter’s eighth-grade Catholic Church trip. They took a Greyhound bus for 22 hours for what they called a “pilgrimage” to Washington.

He saw news coverage of last week’s Women’s March on Washington and thought that was a political march about women’s issues. This, he said, is “completely different,” and is not about women’s rights, but human ones.

“It’s not just a woman’s choice, it takes two to make a child,” he said.

More than 200 people made the trip from his central Missouri church community with him, most of them children. He said he voted for Donald Trump, and is happy with his presidents performance so far.

“If the younger generation doesn’t speak up now, who will?”

Large groups are common at the march, characterized by matching hats or shirts.

One block-long mass of 200 teenagers from 15 churches and three Catholic high schools filled five charter buses, but was only part of a 500-strong group from the Archdiocese of Mobile, Ala.

“Remember, we are guests in this city and we’re going to be respectful,” called Adam Ganucheau, 30, has he and other youth leaders handed out 200 boxes Subway sandwiches. “We are pilgrims; we do not litter.”

The size of the group is typical, said Ganucheau, who has attended more than a dozen of these marches since 2001. But he senses an extra electricity.

“It’s historic that these kids will be able to say they heard and saw the vice president,” he said as the throng began to move, sandwiches in hand.

Ganucheau said he was glad to have an antiabortion administration take office, although there are parts of the Trump agenda that concern him.

In addition to opposing abortion, Ganucheau said his faith also led him to support equal wages, equal pay, a welcoming immigration posture and other progressive social causes.

“Being Catholic is more than being conservative or liberal,” he said. “We believe in treating all people with respect.”

Earlier, Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, listed her four demands for Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress:

● Appoint an antiabortion justice to the Supreme Court.

● Make the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for many abortions in the United States, into a permanent law rather than the one-year provision that has been extended each year from 1976 to the present.

● Pass a law banning abortion nationwide after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

● Stop all federal funding for Planned Parenthood unless the organization were to somehow stop performing abortions.

The gathering came a week after Trump’s inauguration and followed last Saturday’s vast Women’s March on Washington.

Asked about the Women’s March, Ray, of Deville, La., said:

“I’m all about women’s rights, except when it comes to the baby. I believe — it’s my opinion — but I believe a baby is a gift from God, and once the baby is a gift from God, it’s no longer your body, but there’s another body within. And that body has a right also.”

When march attendee Brianna Roberts, 21, of Reading, Pa., met her birthmother two years ago, she was upset to hear that relatives wanted the woman to abort her.

Her mother was 20, already had one child, and was getting by on food stamps, Roberts said. But when her mother went to a clinic seeking an abortion, she was told she was too far along for the clinic to perform one.

Her birthmother placed Roberts for adoption. “She did the right and responsible thing,” Roberts said.

Roberts said she did not vote because she didn’t like either Trump or Clinton, but she is optimistic that Trump will advance anti-abortion policies.

“I thought this was going to be a really big year for policy change,” she said.

Francis Leung, 18, a college student from Naples, Fla., said he has attended the March for Life with his parents almost every year since “I was a little kid” in a stroller.

Now, at 18, six feet tall and a college freshman, he stood in the throng of demonstrators and grinned, saying, “I always look forward to it.”

Leung said he grew up in a devoutly Catholic family and has been hearing a strong anti-abortion message from his parents for as long as he can remember. His nine siblings -- eight of whom came to Washington with him this week -- have heard it, too.

“It’s a great movement, because it’s simple,” said Leung, a student at Ave Maria University in Florida. He was referring to the annual the March for Life. It’s simple, he said, because “every unborn child has a right to life.”

Like his brothers and sisters, Leung said, he was home-schooled. And a central theme of his education was this: “When two humans come together and produce a child, when they create a baby, that’s like, really, really big -- it’s the most important thing in the world. Procreation. It’s what human beings were put on Earth to do.”

The first March for Life was held one year after the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that recognized a right to abortion nationwide. Subsequent marches have been held on or near the Jan. 22 anniversary every year since.

On Friday, the marchers chanted, “Hey, hey, ho ho, Roe v Wade has got to go!”

Nationwide, 59 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, the highest percentage since 1996, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center .

— President Trump, statement on executive order, Jan. 29, 2017 The Pinocchio rating has been updated in light of new information. In justifying his controversial executive order halting travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries, President Trump claimed that President Barack Obama did the same thing in 2011. But the comparison is a bit facile.

Here’s what happened in 2011.

The Facts

The only news report that we could find that referred to a six-month ban was a 2013 ABC News article that included this line: “As a result of the Kentucky case, the State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told ABC News — even for many who had heroically helped U.S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets.”

The “Kentucky case” refers to two Iraqis in Kentucky who in May 2011 were arrested and faced federal terrorism charges after officials discovered from an informant that Waad Ramadan Alwan, before he had been granted asylum in the United States, had constructed improvised roadside bombs in Iraq. The FBI, after examining fragments from thousands of bomb parts, found Alwan’s fingerprints on a cordless phone that had been wired to detonate an improvised bomb in 2005.

The arrests caused an uproar in Congress, and the Obama administration pledged to reexamine the records of 58,000 Iraqis who had been settled in the United States. The administration also imposed new, more extensive background checks on Iraqi refugees. Media reports at the time focused on how the new screening procedures had delayed visa approvals, even as the United States was preparing to end its involvement in the Iraq War.

“The enhanced screening procedures have caused a logjam in regular visa admissions from Iraq, even for those who risked their lives to aid American troops and who now fear reprisals as the Obama administration winds down the U.S. military presence,” the Baltimore Sun reported.

The Los Angeles Times reported that U.S. officials acknowledged delays but were trying to speed up the process:

A U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad, speaking on condition he not be identified, acknowledged “unfortunate delays” in issuing special visas, the result of enhanced security clearance procedures, some instituted after the Kentucky arrests. But he said recent changes would speed the process.

The State Department’s National Visa Center has been ordered to flag special visa applications for expedited action, the official said. And a requirement that Iraqi applicants provide an original signature on certain forms sent to the U.S. has been dropped after Iraqis complained of logistical difficulties. “We are making changes, ordered at the very highest levels, that will help shave time off the application process,” the official said.

At a September 2011 congressional hearing, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) asked Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano if a hold had been placed on Iraqi visa applications.

COLLINS: “So my question is, is there a hold on that population until they can be more stringently vetted to ensure that we’re not letting into this country, people who would do us harm?” NAPOLITANO: “Yep. Let me, if I might, answer your question two parts. First part, with respect to the 56, 57,000 who were resettled pursuant to the original resettlement program, they have all been revetted against all of the DHS databases, all of the NCTC [National Counter Terrorism Center] databases and the Department of Defense’s biometric databases and so that work has now been done and focused.” COLLINS: “That’s completed?” NAPOLITANO: “That is completed. Moving forward, no one will be resettled without going through the same sort of vet. Now I don’t know if that equates to a hold, as you say, but I can say that having done the already resettled population moving forward, they will all be reviewed against those kinds of databases.”

The new rules were stringent, the Economist reported, and resulted in some turmoil.

“Immigration authorities soon began rechecking all Iraqi refugees in America, reportedly comparing fingerprints and other records with military and intelligence documents in dusty archives. About 1,000 soon-to-be immigrants in Iraq were told that they would not be allowed to board flights already booked. Some were removed from planes. Thousands more Iraqi applicants had to restart the immigration process, because their security clearances expired when the program stalled. Men must now pass five separate checks, women four, and children three.”

State Department records show there was a significant drop in refugee arrivals from Iraq in 2011. There were 18,251 in 2010, 6,339 in 2011 and 16,369 in 2012. But it’s unclear that equates to an actual six-month pause in visa processing, rather than a dramatic slowdown in approvals as new rules were put in place. One news report said “pace of visa approvals having slowed to a crawl,” indicating some were still being approved.

Update: Former Obama administration official Jon Finer denied that any ban in Iraqi refugee admissions was put in place under Obama. “While the flow of Iraqi refugees slowed significantly during the Obama administration’s review, refugees continued to be admitted to the United States during that time, and there was not a single month in which no Iraqis arrived here,” he wrote in Foreign Policy. “In other words, while there were delays in processing, there was no outright ban.”

Another former official, Eric P. Schwartz, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration at the time, also told The Fact Checker that Trump’s statement is false:

“President Obama never imposed a six-month ban on Iraqi processing. For several months in 2011, there was a lower level of Iraqi resettlement, as the government implemented certain security enhancements. Indeed, as we identified new and valuable opportunities to enhance screening, we did so. Nobody should object to a continual effort to identify legitimate enhancements, but it is disreputable to use that as a pretext to effectively shut down a program that is overwhelmingly safe and has enabled the United States to exercise world leadership. In any event, there was never a point during that period in which Iraqi resettlement was stopped, or banned.”

The Pinocchio Test

So what’s the difference with Trump’s action?

First, Obama responded to an actual threat — the discovery that two Iraqi refugees had been implicated in bombmaking in Iraq that had targeted U.S. troops. (Iraq, after all, was a war zone.) Under congressional pressure, officials decided to reexamine all previous refugees and impose new screening procedures, which led to a slowdown in processing new applications. Trump, by contrast, issued his executive order without any known triggering threat. (His staff has pointed to attacks unrelated to the countries named in his order.)

Second, Obama did not announce a ban on visa applications. In fact, as seen in Napolitano’s answer to Collins, administration officials danced around that question. There was certainly a lot of news reporting that visa applications had slowed to a trickle. But the Obama administration never said it had a policy to halt all applications. Indeed, it is now clear that no ban was put in place. Even so, the delays did not go unnoticed, so there was a lot of critical news reporting at the time about the angst of Iraqis waiting for approval.

Third, Obama’s policy did not prevent all citizens of that country, including green-card holders, from traveling to the United States. Trump’s policy is much more sweeping, though officials have appeared to pull back from barring permanent U.S. residents.

We have sought comment from the White House and from Obama administration officials and so may update this if more information becomes available. But so far this is worthy of at least Two Pinocchios.

Update: In light of the response from Obama administration officials that there never was a point when Iraqi resettlement was stopped or banned, we are updating this ruling to Three Pinocchios. Iraqi refugee processing was slowed, in response to a specific threat, but it was not halted. The Trump White House, meanwhile, has failed to provide any evidence for its statement.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/25/politics/mexico-president-donald-trump-enrique-pena-nieto-border-wall/index.html",0,"President Trump threatened Thursday morning to cancel a planned meeting later this month with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto if the Mexican government refuses to pay for construction of a border wall. Trump's threat, delivered in a pair of tweets, comes after the Mexican president declared in a televised speech to the Mexican people on Wednesday night that “Mexico will not pay for any wall.”

Peña Nieto and other Mexican officials repeatedly condemned the idea of a border wall — one of Trump's signature promises and a rallying cry for his supporters — during last year's U.S. presidential campaign.

Trump, in two tweets Thursday, accused Mexico of taking advantage of U.S. companies and consumers via the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Trump tweeted: “The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico. It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers ... of jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.”

Tensions between the two countries boiled over this week after Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to direct U.S. resources to begin construction of a border wall. He has said repeatedly, including in a Wednesday interview with ABC News, that the U.S. government probably would pay for the construction up front but would be reimbursed by the Mexican government.

Peña Nieto has come under pressure in Mexico to cancel his planned visit to Washington next week. Should he do so, Trump's threat may be a face-saving move to avoid embarrassment for the U.S. government.

Trump visited Mexico City last August, where he met with Peña Nieto and the two held a joint news conference.

Top Republican congressional leaders declined Thursday to wade into Trump's relationship with Peña Nieto.

""I don't have any advice to give to the president about that issue,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). McConnell said Congress intends to address the issue of the wall but he will leave the president's interaction with foreign leaders to him.

Asked if there are any concerns about the relationship with Mexico, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) replied, ""I think it'll be fine."""

Thousands clogged highways leading out of the area headed south, north and west, and arteries major and minor remained jammed as midnight approached on the West Coast — though by early Monday, Lake Oroville’s water level had dropped to a point at which water was no longer spilling over, and the crisis appeared to be stabilizing.

The level in the massive man-made lake reached its peak of 902.59 feet at about 3 a.m. Sunday and dropped to 898 feet by 4 a.m. Monday, according to the Sacramento Bee. Water flows over the emergency spillway at 901 feet.

“The drop in the lake level was early evidence that the Department of Water Resources’ desperate attempt to prevent a catastrophic failure of the dam’s emergency spillway appeared to be paying dividends,” the Bee reported Monday.

Officials doubled the flow of water out of the nearly mile-long primary spillway to 100,000 cubic feet per second, with the hope of lowering the lake level by 50 feet to leave room for upcoming rain. The normal flow is about half as much, but increased flows are common at this time of year, during peak rain season, officials said.

Officials also warned that damaged infrastructure could create further dangers as storms approach in the week ahead. During a midday news conference on Monday, they said they’re continuing to monitor the spillways for erosion. It also remains unclear when residents will be allowed back into their homes. Inmates at the Butte County Jail also have been moved to Alameda County about 170 miles away.

“I recognize that this is displacing a lot of people,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea told reporters. “We did this because our primary purpose is to ensure public safety. It was a hard decision to make.”

An early-morning inspection of the main spillway revealed no additional erosion, the Bee reported, and the Department of Water Resources said water would continue to flow at 100,000 cubic feet per second.

Officials also will have to determine whether the damaged primary spillway will be able to handle high levels of water through the rest of the rainy season, Jay Lund, a civil engineering professor at the University of California at Davis, told the Bee.

Lake Oroville is one of California’s largest man-made lakes, with 3.5 million acre-feet of water and 167 miles of shoreline. And the 770-foot-tall Oroville Dam is the nation’s tallest, about 44 feet higher than the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River. The lake is the linchpin of California’s government-run water delivery system, sending water from the Sierra Nevada for agriculture in the Central Valley and for residents and businesses in Southern California.

After a record-setting drought, California has been battered by potentially record-setting rain, with the Northern California region getting 228 percent more than its normal rainfall for this time of year. The average annual rainfall of about 50 inches had already been overtaken with 68 inches in 2017 alone.

There was never any danger of the dam collapsing. The problem was with the spillways, which are safety valves designed to release water in a controlled fashion, preventing water from topping over the wall of the colossal dam that retains Lake Oroville.

Earlier this month, unexpected erosion crumbled through the main spillway, sending chunks of concrete flying and creating a large hole. Then sheets of water began spilling over the dam’s emergency spillway for the first time in its nearly 50-year history.

Water from rain and snow rapidly flowed into the lake, causing it to rise to perilous levels, and sending water down the wooded hillside’s emergency spillway, carrying murky debris into the Feather River below.

“Once we have damage to a structure like that, it’s catastrophic,” Bill Croyle, acting director of the state’s Department of Water Resources, said at a news conference late Sunday, in reference to the erosion of the main spillway. “We determined we could not fix the hole. You don’t just throw a little bit of rock in it.”

Anticipating a possible catastrophe for the Lake Oroville area, located about 75 miles north of Sacramento and about 25 miles southeast of Chico, the Butte County Sheriff’s Office ordered evacuations, adding in a news release that it was “NOT a drill.”

But as the reservoir’s water levels lowered, the flows over the emergency spillway ceased late Sunday night.

California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) issued an emergency order to boost the state’s response to the evacuation efforts and spillway crisis, which Brown called “complex and rapidly changing.” The Federal Emergency Management Agency sent an incident management team to the governor’s Office of Emergency Services.

Despite the minimized threats, Honea, the sheriff, said that he would not be lifting the mandatory evacuation order until water resources officials had a better grasp on the anticipated risks.

See photos as thousands are evacuated after Oroville Dam threatens floods + 55 About 188,000 residents near Oroville, Calif., were ordered to evacuate after a hole in an emergency spillway in the dam threatened to flood the surrounding area.

The evacuation took residents by surprise.

April Torlone, 18, was at work at a Dollar General in Live Oak, Calif., Sunday evening when she received a flood emergency alert on her phone. She hurried home, she said, where she had about 10 minutes to gather some clothes and her late father’s ashes.

Torlone drove with her mother and sister to her grandmother’s house in Sacramento, arriving well after midnight. The roughly 40-mile trip took six hours, she said. Gas stations were packed and stores were running out of food. Along the way, they saw more than 30 people camped out in their cars on the side of the road, many with trunks full of belongings, Torlone said.

“I just hope everyone is safe and finds a place to stay, and that no one’s homes are damaged,” she told The Washington Post. “It’s honestly so sad.”

Shelters, churches, schools and seven Sikh temples opened their doors, and people offered to open their homes to strangers via Twitter messages. Hotels and motels out of harm’s way filled up quickly, creating communities of the suddenly displaced. Beale Air Force Base, east of Marysville, also opened its gates to area residents and said early Monday that it had received approximately 250 evacuees.

The dam itself remained structurally sound, the state Department of Water Resources said, and officials said helicopters would be deployed to drop bags of rocks into the crevice and prevent any further erosion.

Croyle, the acting Department of Water Resources director, said Lake Oroville would need to lower almost 50 feet to reach levels at which the system would normally operate. Croyle said that personnel were unable to access the eroded emergency spillway Sunday to do repair work. Officials aimed to continue to discharge as much water as possible ahead of upcoming storms, without adding too much pressure to the already damaged infrastructure.

“Our goal is to be able to use that infrastructure throughout this wet season,” Croyle said. Forecasts indicate that dry weather will dominate through Tuesday, but a series of Pacific storms are expected to arrive across the region Wednesday into Thursday, bringing up to four inches of rain to parts of the Central Valley, according to the National Weather Service.

Honea called the evacuation order a “critical and difficult decision” and said he recognized it would cause significant dislocations and traffic jams, which it did. Residents of Oroville, a town of 16,000 people, were ordered to head north toward Chico, while other nearby residents drove south toward Sacramento.

“I recognize how tough this situation is on people,” Honea said Sunday night. “I recognize that we’ve had to displace a lot of people.”

The California National Guard will provide eight helicopters to assist with emergency spillway repair, Adjutant General David S. Baldwin said. All 23,000 soldiers and airmen statewide received an alert to be “ready to go if needed,” Baldwin said. The last time such an alert was sent out to the entire California National Guard was the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which erupted after a trial jury acquitted four officers of the Los Angeles Police Department of the use of excessive force in the videotaped arrest and beating of Rodney King.

Officials said 250 law enforcement personnel were being deployed to patrol the evacuated areas.

Travelers reported traffic at a standstill on some routes, especially on Highway 99 between Oroville and Chico.

Nicholas Mertz, a front desk supervisor at Oxford Suites Chico, told The Post that when he started his shift at 3 p.m. on Sunday, the hotel’s 184 rooms were at 54 percent occupancy, but within an hour or two, the rooms reached full capacity. What began as a normal night quickly turned into “hectic craziness, everything all at once,” Mertz said. The hotel’s five phone lines were ringing nonstop, and hundreds of guests came pouring in.

“It’s never happened that fast,” Mertz said. Larger families of five to eight people packed into rooms, without having to pay the usual fees for additional guests, Mertz said, because “in this scenario, it’s whatever you can do.”

Many guests expressed confusion and frustration, while others spoke of their fears: What would happen to the pets they left behind? Would there be looting in the evacuated neighborhoods? Would their homes still be standing when they returned?

“Not only are you just a front desk person you’re kind of like a therapist as well,” Mertz said.

Kyle Dobson, 41, said he was visiting the dam Sunday afternoon from Yuba City, Calif., and noticed that the lake was higher than he had ever seen it. He said he got a call later in the day that Oroville was being evacuated. By the time he got home, Yuba City had also been ordered to evacuate.

Dobson said he and his wife packed about a week’s worth of clothes for themselves and their four young children, and moved pictures and other belongings to the second floor of their two-story home. For now, they are staying put, but if the situation gets worse, they will drive to Sutter, Calif., to stay with family, Dobson said.

“I’ll stay up probably all night, listen to the police scanner and watch the reports come in,” he said. “The river levels — that’s what you’ve got to watch out for.”

Adriana Weidman of Marysville, Calif., said she heard about the evacuation around 5 p.m. Fearing that nearby rivers would overflow, she rushed to pack as much as she could, then got into the car with her husband and two children, she said. By 10 p.m., the family was still sitting in gridlocked traffic on the way to Colfax, Calif., about 45 miles east.

“It’s scary,” Weidman told The Post. “I’m terrified I’m not going to have a home to come home to.”

Out of an “abundance of caution,” inmates were in the process of being evacuated from the Butte County Jail Sunday night, the sheriff’s office wrote on Facebook.

“We needed to get people moving quickly in order to protect the public and save lives if the worst case scenario did come to fruition,” Honea said.

The damaged primary spillway caused water flowing downstream to become muddy and brown with debris earlier this week, threatening the lives of millions of baby Chinook salmon in the Feather River Hatchery below. In a rescue operation, officials with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife successfully moved about 5 million Chinook salmon to a nearby annex, the department said on Facebook.

The other 3 million baby salmon will remain at the main hatchery, where staff and engineers have rigged a system of pumps, pipes and generators and a sediment pond in the hopes of filtering the water enough to support the fish.

Ironically, the state’s five years of drought caused Lake Oroville’s water levels to plunge to a low of 33 percent of capacity, according to the Los Angeles Times. The lake became a poster child for the drought. In a dramatic shift, Northern California witnessed an extraordinarily rainy winter this year that caused waters to rise to their highest levels in decades.

— President Trump, news conference, Feb. 16, 2017 We can’t quite fact check the statement above — it’s certainly open to debate what counts as achievements — but we can fact-check 15 dubious claims made by the president in his lengthy news conference. Some of these are from his greatest hits of falsehoods, which we have fact-checked many times before. The claims are addressed in the order in which Trump made them.

“A new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up.”

Trump has a tendency to focus only on polls that are good for him. Rasmussen has a right-leaning bias and earns a C+ grade from FiveThirtyEight.com. Other polls show Trump with significantly lower approval ratings, such as Gallup (40 percent) and Pew Research Center (39 percent).

“Trump’s overall job approval is much lower than those of prior presidents in their first weeks in office,” Pew said. “Nearly half (46%) strongly disapprove of his job performance, while 29% strongly approve.”

But Trump apparently dismisses such findings:

“The stock market has hit record numbers.”

This is a flip-flop for Trump. Before he was elected, he dismissed the stock-market performance under President Barack Obama as “artificial” and “a bubble,” as Sopan Deb of The New York Times noted:

“Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league — Ford, General Motors, so many of them.”

Trump keeps giving himself credit for business decisions made before he became president. Ford’s decision has more to do with the company’s long-term goal — particularly its plans to invest in electric vehicles — than with the administration. Here’s what Ford chief executive Mark Fields said about the company’s decision to abandon plans to open a factory in Mexico: “The reason that we are not building the new plant, the primary reason, is just demand has gone down for small cars.”

“To be honest, I inherited a mess. It’s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess.”

Trump indicated he was backing up this statement by noting that “jobs are pouring out of the country…. The Middle East is a disaster. North Korea.”

The state of foreign policy is open to interpretation — Trump claimed he was developing “a plan for the defeat of ISIS,” the terrorist group in Iraq and Syria.

But the economy was in pretty good shape when Trump became president, especially compared to the economic crisis that Obama inherited in 2009. In January 2009, coinciding with the last labor report of the George W. Bush administration, nearly 800,000 jobs disappeared, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, compared to the nearly 230,000 jobs added in January 2017. (Trump has given himself credit for the January numbers, but the data was collected when Obama still held office.)

“We got 306 [electoral college votes] because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before, so that’s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan.”

This statement is wrong on several levels.

Advertisement

Trump ended up with 304 electoral votes, because two electors he earned voted for someone else.

Trump did get more raw votes than any other Republican candidate in history — but he also earned 2.9 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton. Another 8 million people voted for third-party or write-in candidates. Moreover, turnout of the voting-age population (54.7 percent) was lower than in the elections of 2012, 2008 and 2004. [Correction: Once all the votes were counted, turnout of the voting-age population in 2016 was higher than 2012, but lower than 2004 and 2008.]

Finally, Trump was wrong on the size of his electoral college win. Of the nine presidential elections since 1984, Trump’s electoral college win ranks seventh. When a reporter pointed out his error, Trump first indicated that he was talking about Republican candidates. But George H.W. Bush received 426 electoral votes in 1988. Trump’s response: “I don’t know, I was given that information.”

“We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day.”

There is limited research on the impact of sanctuary policies and crime. And the research that does exist challenges Trump’s claim. We previously awarded Three Pinocchios to Trump’s claim that sanctuary cities “breed crime.”

There’s no official definition of “sanctuary,” but it generally refers to rules restricting state and local governments from alerting federal authorities about people who may be in the country illegally. Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility, and state and local law enforcement can decide how much they want to cooperate with the federal government for immigration enforcement. There are between 165 and 608 local and state governments with sanctuary policies, and they vary in their approach.

A handful of studies looked at whether there is a causation between sanctuary cities and crime. They either found no statistically significant impact of sanctuary policies on crime, or a reduction in crime due to immigrant-friendly policing strategies. Sanctuary jurisdictions release inmates after their criminal case is complete, and extensive research shows that noncitizens are not more prone to criminality than U.S.-born citizens. Moreover, some sanctuary jurisdictions do cooperate with the federal government if they believe the inmate is a public safety threat.

“In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent. I find that hard to believe. That is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further.”

Trump is referring to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which ruled against reinstating his travel ban. But there are other ways to slice the data, and it’s important to put this number into context. None of the data supports Trump’s contention that the court is “in chaos” and “in turmoil.”

Each court’s reversal rate changes every year, so it’s easy to cherry-pick this data. Under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., the 9th Circuit court did not set a “record” for reversals. The 9th Circuit’s reversal rate was usually higher than the average, but not always the highest. In the 2014-2015 term, the 9th Circuit’s reversal rate was 63 percent, below the average rate of 72 percent. In the 2015-2016 term, the latest year of data available, the 9th Circuit court’s reversal rate was 80 percent, and the average rate was 67 percent.

Most cases that are reviewed by the Supreme Court are reversed. For this reason, a 2010 analysis by the American Bar Association also looked at the number of cases reversed in each appellate court compared to the total number of cases terminated by the appellate court. From 1999 to 2008, 80 percent of 9th Circuit court cases reviewed by the Supreme Court were reversed (compared to the median rate of 68.3 percent). But the number of reversed cases represented only one-fifteenth of 1 percent of the total number of appeals terminated by the 9th Circuit Court during that 10-year period.

Moreover, the 9th Circuit rules on more cases in general. According to SCOTUSblog: “Far more cases come to the Court from the Ninth Circuit than any other court, and — not surprisingly — Ninth Circuit rulings make up a sizeable portion of the docket of argued and decided cases — 75 cases, or 25.7% for the last four Terms including the current session.”

“We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy-American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines.”

Trump, in saying “thousands and thousands of jobs,” leaves himself some wiggle room here. (He’d previously incorrectly said 28,000 jobs.) Moreover, some of these jobs have already been created. Workers in Arkansas, for instance, have already built about half of the high-strength line pipe needed for the project, some 333,000 tons.

“You [the media] have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that’s right.”

Trump indicated that he wasn’t sure if this assertion is correct. It is not. The public’s trust in the media has certainly fallen over the years. But a 2016 Gallup poll shows that Congress is viewed positively by 9 percent of respondents, compared to 20 percent for newspapers and 21 percent for television.

That’s not a high confidence level — besides Congress, only “big business” ranks lower than the media — but it’s enough to make Trump’s claim incorrect.

“When WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they’re not giving classified information.”

WikiLeaks actually released hundreds of thousands of classified State Department cables, in a significant blow to U.S. diplomacy.

“Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.”

Trump overstates the disclosure about Clinton reportedly getting a single debate question. During the Democratic primaries, a debate was held in Flint, Mich., to focus on the water crisis. Donna Brazile, then an analyst with CNN, sent an email to the Clinton campaign saying that a woman with a rash from lead poisoning was going to ask what Clinton as president could do the help the people of Flint.

There’s no indication Clinton was told this information, but in any case it’s a pretty obvious question for a debate being held in Flint. In her answer, Clinton committed to remove lead from water systems across the country within five years. Lee-Anne Waters, who asked the question, later said Clinton’s answer “made me vomit in my mouth” because that was too long to wait in Flint.

“You know, they say I’m close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She’s close to Russia.”

Trump repeated this claim, worthy of Four Pinocchios, several times during the news conference.

An entire chapter is dedicated to this uranium deal in Peter Schweizer’s “Clinton Cash.” In the book, Schweizer reveals ties between the Clinton Foundation and investors who stood to gain from a deal that required State Department approval.

Trump’s claim suggests the State Department had sole approval authority, but the department is one of nine agencies in the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States to vet and sign off on all U.S. transactions involving foreign governments. As we’ve noted before, there is no evidence Clinton herself got involved in the deal personally, and it is highly questionable that this deal even rose to the level of the secretary of state. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also needed to approve, and did approve, the transfer.

“We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision.”

Trump appears to have forgotten that imprecise wording in the executive order led to confusion over whether U.S. permanent residents — green-card holders — were also banned from returning to the United States. The White House counsel later issued guidance making clear that they were not covered. The Court of Appeals later said that the counsel’s statement was not a sufficient fix.

“Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years. Don’t speak to people from Russia.”

The Wall Street Journal reported during the campaign that before Trump gave a foreign-policy speech in April, he met with the Russian ambassador: “A few minutes before he made those remarks [calling for improved relations with Russia], Mr. Trump met at a VIP reception with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Ivanovich Kislyak. Mr. Trump warmly greeted Mr. Kislyak and three other foreign ambassadors who came to the reception.”

Trump also is being misleading when he says has “nothing to do with Russia.” Trump repeatedly sought deals in Russia. In 1987, he went to Moscow to find a site for a luxury hotel; no deal emerged. In 1996, he sought to build a condominium complex in Russia; that also did not succeed. In 2005, Trump signed a one-year deal with a New York development company to explore a Trump Tower in Moscow, but the effort fizzled.

In a 2008 speech, Donald Trump Jr. made it clear that the Trumps want to do business in Russia, but were finding it difficult. “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,” Trump’s son said at a real estate conference in 2008, according to an account posted on the website of eTurboNews, a trade publication. “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”

Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, told The Washington Post in May: “I have no doubt, as a company, I know we’ve looked at deals in Russia. And many of the former Russian republics.”

“You go to some of these inner city places and it’s so sad when you look at the crime. You have people — and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it — in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day. They’re living in hell.”

“Inner cities” is not a category by which crime is measured, and Trump often uses this term to refer to large, urban cities. In 2016, there was an uptick in the homicide rate in the 30 largest cities. One outlier city — Chicago — was responsible for 43.7 percent of the total increase in homicide rates in 2016. Overall, violent crime is on a decades-long decline, since the height of the crack cocaine epidemic in the early 1990s.

The homicide rate in the 30 largest cities also increased in 2015, but the two-year trend does not indicate the return of a crime wave in “inner cities.” Crime trends can randomly fluctuate year to year, and criminologists consider the data over much longer periods of time — at least 10 to 15 years — to draw conclusions about trends.

Pence told a skeptical audience at the Munich Security Conference that Europeans should rest assured that Washington’s fundamental foreign policy direction was not changing. In a speech that touched on military sacrifice, God and an unwavering faith in the power of shared values, Pence offered the fullest outline from the Trump administration on international policy since the beginning of the turbulent term nearly a month ago.

“Today, tomorrow and every day hence, be confident that the United States is now and will always be your greatest ally,” Pence said in his red-blooded speech, which was met with only a smattering of applause. “Be assured: President Trump and the American people are fully devoted to our transatlantic union.”

But allies were left trying to resolve Pence’s rhetoric with that of his boss, who routinely upends the statements of subordinates and has equated Russia’s human rights record with that of the United States, declared NATO obsolete and ferociously torn into judges, reporters and others who have crossed him.

The lack of mention of the European Union, whose unraveling Trump has praised, also unsettled European leaders. Pence travels to Brussels on Sunday for meetings with senior E.U. officials.

U.S. officials in Europe last week, including Pence and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, focused on an issue that has been a bipartisan concern in Washington, that of Europe’s lackluster defense spending, rather than Trump’s desire for a new relationship with the Kremlin, a major fear in Europe.

The mixed messages reassured some allies and unsettled others. Some leaders proposed that Europe respond by embracing its own strength and turning away from the United States to stand alone in the world — what one diplomat semi-

seriously called an effort to ""Make Europe Great Again.""

But the E.U. is riven by internal conflicts of its own, and officials said a true European declaration of independence is most likely a non-starter. Instead, there was acknowledgment from German Chancellor Angela Merkel on down that Europe is reliant on the United States to fight international terrorism and will never be able to go it alone.

“The challenges of this world today cannot be mastered by one state alone. It needs a cooperative effort. We need to forge ahead with multilateral structures. We have to strengthen them,” Merkel said in a speech that she delivered immediately before Pence’s. “Let me address this very openly. The Europeans alone cannot cope with fighting international Islamist terrorism. We also need the support of the United States.”

The biggest takeaway from the Munich conclave of security leaders — a ritzy conference at the Bayerischer Hof hotel where the world’s policy elite gather annually to joust over issues of the day — was that the Kremlin has a new rival in its efforts to unsettle Western alliances.

“You come here and you realize that the biggest source of instability in the world right now is not Russia. It’s the United States,” said Angela Stent, a Russia expert at Georgetown University who served as a policy adviser in the administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

The uncertainty manifested itself in a host of ways, none larger than an initiative from German Foreign Minister ­Sigmar Gabriel to reinvigorate the E.U. so that it is robustly capable of standing apart from the United States.

“In all of these conflicts, we always relied on the American government to solve the problems, to find a way,” Gabriel said. “And if we didn’t like it, we could always criticize the government of the United States. But we ourselves have been reluctant to interfere.”

Gabriel added that “we should hope for the best but be prepared for the worst” from the United States.

But the proposal was shot down by other leaders, who said that any steps that would degrade the transatlantic alliance would be dangerous and counterproductive.

“It is an absolutely mistaken idea, because we can be great only together, Europe and the United States, not separately,” Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said in an interview.

Still, many European officials said that Trump is such a major challenge to Europe that they cannot just hope to muddle through for the next four years.

“Our problem is not really Trump. Our problem is that Trump exposes our weaknesses and gaps,” said one European diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal talks.

Pence met Grybauskaite and the leaders of Latvia and Estonia to reassure allies that border Russia and have called for a robust U.S. military presence in the region to fend off attack. Grybauskaite and others in the room said that Pence mostly listened in the closed-door meeting but that he had repeated public reassurances of support and said the message was backed by Trump.

“He said all the right things,” said Estonian Foreign Minister Sven Mikser, who was also in the meeting.

Pence also met with the leaders of Ukraine and Iraq, as well as with other senior officials from Europe and the Middle East.

In his speech, Pence offered a vision of the world that could easily have come from a conventional Republican security hawk, pointing to “Russian efforts to redraw international borders by force.” He called for quelling the conflict in Ukraine by adhering to the Minsk II agreement, a 2015 plan that sets out a road map for peace that was endorsed by President Barack Obama and European leaders.

And he pushed for greater defense spending, a key Trump campaign demand that was prefaced by Mattis earlier in the week. Only four NATO nations apart from the United States meet alliance guidelines to spend 2 percent of their annual economic output on defense. Mattis said that U.S. security guarantees remain rock-solid even as he warned that Washington might “moderate its commitment” to NATO if other countries fail to spend more.

Pence echoed the message. But — underscoring the beliefs of his boss, who many in Washington and Europe say has been too cozy toward Russia — Pence also sought to strike a balance with the Kremlin, hinting at signs of a possible partnership between the two nations.

“And know this: The United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground, which as you know, President Trump believes can be found,” Pence said.

The thorny issue of Russia has clouded Trump’s young presidency, amid reports that Michael Flynn, his national security adviser who resigned Monday, improperly discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office, and that Trump staffers and associates repeatedly communicated with senior Russian intelligence officials during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Pence’s tough line on Russia was enough to upset Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who later Saturday called for a “post-West world order” and added that “we cannot rejoice in the fact that the European Union still cannot find the strength to abandon its policy toward Russia,” a reference to sanctions."
3796,3796,https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/tom-perez-elected-as-first-latino-leader-of-democratic-party/2017/02/25/1fd76f52-fad7-11e6-9845-576c69081518_story.html?utm_term=.a5b7a48e8a1e,0,"Former labor secretary Thomas Perez was elected the first Latino chair of the Democratic National Committee on Saturday, narrowly defeating Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) at the end of a contentious battle over the fate of the beleaguered party in the age of President Trump. Perez’s victory concluded the first contested race for the DNC leadership since 1985, a contest the party had extended by a month to allow more debate. It put in place the Democratic leadership that will navigate thousands of state and local elections — where the party hopes to reverse the losses of the past six years — and a 2020 presidential race that could divide the party again.

Ellison’s defeat was a blow to the party’s liberal wing, personified by activists, labor leaders and organizers, many of whom had supported the presidential bid of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and had come to Atlanta to cheer Ellison on. Many of them warned that by picking Perez, the party was alienating the growing “resistance” that has organized against Trump.

The race was close enough that it required a second round of balloting, with Perez winning 235 of 435 votes cast. With tensions still high as the result was announced, nine Ellison supporters chanted “Party for the people, not big money!” and stormed out of the room.

“Someday, they’re going to study this era of American history,” Perez said after his win. “They’re going to ask the question of all of us: Where were you in 2017 when we had the worst president in the history of the United States? We will be able to say that the Democratic Party led the resistance and made sure this was a one-term president.”

Onstage, Perez gave Ellison the symbolic role of deputy party chair, and the Minnesota congressman gave a short speech asking his supporters to stay with the party and avoid recriminations.

“We don’t have the luxury to walk out of this room divided,” Ellison said.

Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, tweeted her support for both ­Perez and Ellison as representatives of a “unified party,” while former president Barack Obama congratulated “my friend” Perez in a statement.

“I know that Tom Perez will unite us under that banner of opportunity, and lay the groundwork for a new generation of Democratic leadership for this big, bold, inclusive, dynamic America we love so much,” Obama said.

Sanders, who had supported Ellison, said in a statement that it was “imperative that Tom understands that the same-old, same-old is not working and that we must open the doors of the party to working people and young people in a way that has never been done before.”

Trump, in classic fashion, responded to the election by simultaneously congratulating and belittling Perez in a tweet: “I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!”

Photos from the DNC winter meeting in Atlanta + 21 During the three-day meeting in Georgia, Democrats selected Thomas Perez as the new chairman of the party’s national committee. The former Obama Cabinet official becomes the first Latino to lead the Democratic National Committee.

The vote itself was tense. On Friday night, Democrats gathered at a downtown Westin hotel here in Atlanta to meet, drink and lobby for votes, and the Ellison campaign — along with allies of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a third candidate — battled rumors that Perez might already have locked up the votes he needed.

But by Saturday morning, it was clear that the race was up for grabs. Buttigieg used his nomination speech to quit the race, endorsing no candidate. As most of the 439 DNC members present cast their votes — eight eligible members did not attend — several DNC members got a text from the Ellison camp saying the congressman was “grateful to have the support of Mayor Buttigieg,” an endorsement that the mayor denied.

In the first round of balloting, Perez won 213.5 votes to 200 for Ellison, 12 for Idaho Democratic Party Executive Director Sally Boynton Brown, 0.5 for Democratic strategist Jehmu Greene and one for Buttigieg in the first round of balloting. Greene endorsed Perez, while two fringe candidates who had won no votes backed Ellison. Members who are abroad get half a vote.

Perez’s victory did not represent a Democratic shift to the right. On key issues, Perez’s platform mostly resembled Ellison’s. Perez promised to refocus on small donors and online fundraising; Ellison set a goal for “low-dollar contributions from everyday Americans [to] account for 33 percent of revenue.” Ellison called for an “Innovation Hub” in Silicon Valley; Perez promoted DNC fellowships to “encourage developers, programmers, data scientists, [and] engineers.”

While Perez and Ellison praised each other personally, the race was defined for outsiders by Sanders’s support of the Minnesota lawmaker. Ellison was one of the few members of Congress who had backed Sanders for president. He billed himself as the “unity candidate” who would keep Sanders’s restive supporters in the party while embracing those who had backed Clinton.

In the first weeks after Ellison declared his candidacy, the strategy seemed to be working, despite some hiccups. Labor unions that had endorsed Clinton, such as the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, got behind Ellison.

Howard Dean, the most successful DNC chair in modern party history, dropped his plans to run again when Ellison said he would resign from Congress if elected to the full-time job. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who had frequently clashed with Dean over strategy and investments, endorsed Ellison and defended the first Muslim member of Congress against charges of anti-Semitism.

But veterans of the Obama administration, where Perez had been a popular liberal force, encouraged the former labor secretary to run — and starting Dec. 15, he did. In progressive media, the race was frequently covered as a clash between “the establishment” and the “revolution” that had been proved right by the 2016 election.

That was not how most DNC members chose to see it. In public forums, including the final one broadcast on CNN, Ellison and Perez declined to criticize each other. While progressive media outlets accused Perez of protecting the party's consultant class, DNC members who broke for Perez said that he had convinced them that he knew what state parties needed.

""Tom seemed to have a better handle on the job,"" said Kathy Sullivan, a former chair of New Hampshire's Democratic Party, who endorsed Perez after current New Hampshire state chair Ray Buckley quit the race.

Perez was also helped by a string of endorsements from Obama administration veterans — although, as Ellison backers noticed, he did not win any high-profile supporters of Sanders's to compete with Ellison's endorsements from Clintonites. The Feb. 1 endorsement of Perez by former vice president Joe Biden, one of the party's most beloved figures, prompted Sanders to criticize Perez for the first time.

""Do we stay with a failed status-quo approach or do we go forward with a fundamental restructuring of the Democratic Party?"" Sanders asked in a statement after Biden's endorsement. ""I say we go forward and create a grassroots party which speaks for working people and is prepared to stand up to the top one percent.""

Most of the DNC’s membership — just 39 of whom had backed Sanders for president in 2016 — did not view the contest as a stark ideological clash. Sanders supporters, including Ellison, had largely succeeded in moving the party’s platform to the left. In interviews, some acknowledged that there would be walkouts by Sanders die-hards in their states, but they argued that the daily outrages around Trump might bring them back into the process.

That confidence was on display Saturday before the vote for chairman. DNC members debated whether to strike language from California’s Christine Pelosi, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s daughter, that would have restored a ban on corporate donations to the DNC. The prohibition was quietly rolled back during the controversial tenure of the previous elected DNC chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.)

“This resolution has nothing to do with nonprofit organizations,” said Larry Cohen, a former president of the Communications Workers of America who backed Sanders in 2016. “This is to send a message, loud and clear, that the DNC itself — not candidates, not state parties — will restore the ban that President Obama put into effect.”

When the language was struck, a few of the activists who had come to cheer Ellison — including members of National Nurses United, Progressive Democrats of America and Democratic Socialists of America — started a brief chant."

Trump gave a nod in particular to his largely white working-class supporters, calling them ""the forgotten men and women of America"" and reminding them that his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, referred to some of them as ""deplorables.""

“That is the heart of this new movement and the future of the Republican Party,” Trump said. “These are hardworking, great, great Americans. These are unbelievable people who have not been treated fairly. Hillary called them deplorable. They’re not deplorable.”

With his appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference at National Harbor in Maryland, Trump became the first sitting president since Ronald Reagan to address the group during his first year in office.

Trump, who remains out of sync with the establishment wing of the party on trade and several other issues, was nevertheless enthusiastically embraced, a testament to how much he has pushed the GOP and the conservative movement toward an ""America first"" nationalism that previously existed on the fringes.

“Now you finally have a president, finally,” Trump told the group, whose annual conference he skipped last year while in the heart of his primary campaign. Later, he called his election “a win for conservative values.”

Friday’s speech amounted to a victory lap for Trump, and it was notable — more than a month after he got the keys to the White House — for how much it mimicked his campaign rallies.

The president ticked off a familiar list of promises, including pledges to “keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out” of the country and to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall. At one point, when he mentioned Clinton, the crowd, as was often the case at his rallies, started chanting, “Lock her up!”

“The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first,” Trump said at another point, prompting the crowd to chant “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!”

While Trump was cheered on in suburban Maryland, other Republicans openly worried Friday about whether, in coming cycles, the party can hang onto the traditionally Democratic and independent voters Trump wooed, and they criticized him for doing little since his election to reach out beyond his core supporters.

Trump lost the popular vote to Clinton by nearly 3 million votes, and his job approval numbers are at historic lows for any president at this point in his term.

“We know historically that these sorts of populist, introverted efforts can be sustained for a couple of cycles and not much longer than that,” said John Weaver, a GOP strategist who worked on the presidential campaign of Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R).

“Fearmongering and the victimization of whole swaths of people is not something you can grow,” Weaver added, referring to derogatory comments Trump has made about Mexicans, Muslims and other groups. “Tell me which groups he’s going to attract. Millennials? African Americans? Hispanics? Young women?”

Former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said that the party needs to stay focused on expanding its base and that it remains to be seen how successful Trump will be at reshaping “a party of Reagan that no longer exists.”

A key, Steele said, will be what comes of Trump’s efforts to turn campaign promises into actual policy.

Trump’s fledgling administration has given conservatives plenty to cheer, including many of the president’s Cabinet selections and his pledges to repeal the Affordable Care Act and pursue sweeping tax reform.

He also campaigned on dismantling the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other trade pacts long championed by Republicans, and on making a massive investment in the country’s infrastructure, a goal many small-government advocates in the GOP view warily.

Trump made only a passing reference to the latter initiative in his appearance Friday, during a portion of his speech in which he lamented how much money the United States has spent abroad.

Share this article Share

“We’ve spent trillions of dollars overseas while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay,” Trump said. “In the Middle East we’ve spent, as of four weeks ago, $6 trillion. Think of it.”

As an aside, Trump offered his view that the Middle East is in “much worse shape” than it was 15 years ago. “If our presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape than we are right now, that I can tell you.”

While on script, Trump sought to portray his administration as one of action, listing steps it has already taken: pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, reducing regulations, cracking down on illegal immigrants and clearing the way for construction of major oil pipelines.

He also touted his efforts to “massively lower taxes” and asserted that his presidency is already producing more jobs, saying it is time for all Americans to “get off welfare and get back to work.”

He pledged “one of the greatest military buildups in American history” and vowed to “totally obliterate” the Islamic State terrorist group.

“Nobody will dare question our military might again,” Trump said.

The president also reprised his core campaign promise of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and said construction would begin soon, even though it remains unclear where the money to pay for it will come from.

“We’re going to build a wall, don’t worry about it,” the president said.

Trump also said that in a matter of days, he would have a “brand-new action” to keep the country safe, a reference to a second attempt at an executive order to restrict travel into the United States from several majority-Muslim nations.

“I will never, ever, ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the American people,” Trump said.

After taking the stage at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center to Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the U.S.A,” Trump used the opening of his remarks to again denounce the media, saying many stories about his administration are “fake news” that relies on anonymous sources.

“A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people,” the president said. “And they are. They are the enemy of the people.”

Trump pointed to a Washington Post story this month that cited nine current and former intelligence sources who said former national security adviser Michael Flynn discussed U.S. economic sanctions on Russia with that country's ambassador before Trump took office.

Trump said he did not believe there were nine sources. “They make up sources. They are very dishonest people,” he said.

But The Post’s stories helped lead to Flynn’s resignation after further disclosures that he had misled administration officials, including Vice President Pence, about the nature of his conversations.

“We are fighting the fake news,” Trump said. “It’s fake, phony, fake.”

In a statement after Trump’s speech, Marty Baron, executive editor of The Post, stood by the story.

“Everything we published regarding Gen. Flynn was true, as confirmed by subsequent events and on-the-record statements from administration officials,” Baron said. “The story led directly to the general’s dismissal as national security adviser. Calling press reports fake doesn’t make them so.”

Trump's speech Friday followed several well-received appearances at the four-day gathering by senior members of his administration, including a speech Thursday night by Pence.

The vice president touted the administration’s plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, declaring that “America’s Obamacare nightmare is about to end.”

Trump’s speech marked the fifth time he has addressed the conference, hosted by the American Conservative Union. His first appearance, in 2011, which was viewed as a curiosity at the time, offered clues to his political ambitions."
3807,3807,https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/trump-prepares-to-address-a-divided-audience-the-republican-congress/2017/02/28/183138ce-fced-11e6-8ebe-6e0dbe4f2bca_story.html,0,"President Trump sought to repackage his hard-line campaign promises with a moderate sheen Tuesday night, declaring what he termed “a new chapter of American greatness” of economic renewal and military might in his first joint address to Congress. Seeking to steady his presidency after a tumultuous first 40 days, Trump had an air of seriousness and revealed flashes of compassion as he broadly outlined a sweeping agenda to rebuild a country he described as ravaged by crime and drugs, deteriorating infrastructure and failing bureaucracies.

Trump’s 60-minute speech touched on his plans to overhaul the nation’s health-care system and tax code, but it was short on specifics and heavy on lofty prose. Struggling to steer a bitterly divided nation with his job-approval ratings at historic lows, Trump effectively pleaded with the American people to give him a chance and to imagine what could be achieved during his presidency.

“We are one people, with one destiny,” Trump said quietly near the end. “The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.”

Trump extended olive branches to his opponents. He called on Congress to pass paid family leave, a reference to a long-held Democratic Party priority that brought liberal lawmakers to their feet to applaud. And he pledged to work with Muslim allies to extinguish Islamic State terrorists, going so far as to acknowledge the killings of Muslims as well as Christians in the Middle East.

Still, Trump did not back away from his most controversial policies. He used typically bellicose language to describe the fight against the Islamic State, calling it “a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs.” He made a point to utter the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism,” which Republicans cheered heartily.

The president forcefully defended his travel ban of refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries — an executive order that was halted in federal court — as necessary to prevent the entry of foreigners who do not share America’s values.

“We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America,” Trump said. “We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.”

The president trumpeted his plans to budget a major increase in military spending. One of Trump’s fiercest Republican critics, Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), stood enthusiastically when the president said he would end the “defense sequester” caps on Pentagon spending.

On foreign affairs, Trump said he would honor historic alliances — and explicitly stated his support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, on which he had wavered during his campaign — but said he would seek new ones as well, even with former adversaries. The latter seemed an indirect reference to potentially working to combat terrorism with Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded meddled in the November election in hopes of helping Trump.

“America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where share interests align,” Trump said. “We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.”

Trump declared the time had come to rewrite trade deals and alliances in terms that benefit the United States, irrespective of global pressures.

“My job is not to represent the world,” Trump said. “My job is to represent the United States of America.”

Trump was adamant that the United States cannot continue to abide by what Republicans and Democrats see as free trade. “It also has to be fair trade,” Trump said. He cited Abraham Lincoln, who, he said, “warned that the ‘abandonment of the protective policy by the American government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.’ ” He said he would not let workers “be taken advantage of anymore.”

As is tradition when the president addresses a joint session of Congress — typically known as a “State of the Union,” although the speech is not called that during a president’s first year — Trump invited guests to sit with first lady Melania Trump in the balcony.

The night’s emotional high point came when Trump singled out one of the night’s guests, Carryn Owens, the widow of Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owens, who died in a Jan. 29 raid in Yemen.

Although Ryan’s father has spoken out against the raid that killed his son, Trump said Tuesday night that Ryan died “a warrior and a hero,” with Carryn looking on with tears in her eyes. The audience stood with sustained applause. Trump peered up at Carryn and said, “Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he’s very happy.”

Trump, as he typically does, basked in his electoral feat and cast his ascent to the presidency in epic terms. “In 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet,” he said, saying that a “rebellion” that started as “a quiet protest” morphed into “a loud chorus” and finally “an earthquake.”

He said he was sent to Washington to deliver on the promises he made on the campaign trail — arguably chief among them, to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump argued that everyday Americans cannot succeed “in an environment of lawless chaos” at the borders.

“To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or their loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?”

As he spoke, Trump turned toward Jamiel Shaw, a black man whose son was killed by an illegal immigrant. Shaw, who frequently traveled with Trump during last year’s campaign, sat stone-faced and then grew visibly emotional as Trump spoke to him and Shaw stood to applause.

On the seemingly in­trac­table issue of immigration, Trump signaled he would be open to a reform bill — though he did not state what terms he would find acceptable in such a compromise.

“I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation’s security, and to restore respect for our laws,” Trump said. “If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.”

Trump said he supports a “merit-based immigration system,” such as those in Canada and Australia, that allow people to enter the country who can support themselves financially and contribute to society.

Trump challenged both parties in Congress to move quickly to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the signature health-care law of former president Barack Obama.

“Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans,” Trump said. “Action is not a choice; it is a necessity.”

House Republicans immediately rallied behind Trump’s remarks, interpreting his words as an endorsement of several key parts of their own plan. In an email to reporters, an aide to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) wrote that Trump “embraced” the House plan and demonstrated that “the White House and Congress are coalescing around a particular approach” that includes individual health-savings plans and tax credits.

“The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going to do,” Trump said, calling for Democrats to work with him. He said he would “ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.”

Turning to the states, he said he would give governors “the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out,” a supportive mention of a program whose budget some Republicans would like to see pared back.

Trump also called for a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that he said would be the biggest program of national rebuilding since former president Dwight Eisenhower built the interstate highway system in the 1950s. Trump said his projects would be financed through a combination of public and private capital, but he offered no further details.

Trump was more somber than usual, toning down his bravado, but there were moments where he reveled in his celebrity. He glad-handed Supreme Court justices as he made his way to the rostrum and shared small talk with a reverential congressman, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.). As he left at the end of his speech, he paused to autograph books in the aisle.

An uncharacteristically disciplined Trump stuck mostly to the script running on his teleprompters, but he veered off his prepared text at times to make playful asides. During a discussion about taxes, Trump recalled his visit with Harley-Davidson executives and ad-libbed, “They wanted me to ride one and I said, ‘No, thank you.’ ”

Trump opened his address by noting the wave of anti-Semitic vandalism and threats targeting Jewish cemeteries, community centers and schools. “We are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms,” Trump said.

Trump plans to take his message to the American people on a traditional road show, like those his predecessors undertook to sell their agendas following major addresses to Congress.

On Thursday, Trump plans to give a speech aboard the USS Gerald Ford, a newly christened aircraft carrier in Newport News, Va., and lead a roundtable discussion with military officials and shipbuilders. And on Friday, he will visit St. Andrew's Catholic School in Orlando to conduct what aides described as a listening session on school choice.

At a moment when more Americans oppose him than support him, Trump sought to sell the country on his vision for transformational change. He wanted people to imagine America on its 250th anniversary in 2026 following what he hopes will be a two-term presidency.

He said dying industries like coal would come roaring back to life, new roads and bridges would be built, and the drug epidemic would not just slow down, but stop.

“Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed,” Trump said. “Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.”"

http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/politics/house-health-care-debate/index.html",0,"House Republicans on Monday released long-anticipated legislation to supplant the Affordable Care Act with a more conservative vision for the nation’s health-care system, replacing federal insurance subsidies with a new form of individual tax credits and grants to help states shape their own policies. Under two bills drafted by separate House committees, the government would no longer penalize Americans for failing to have health insurance but would try to encourage people to maintain coverage by allowing insurers to impose a surcharge of 30 percent for those who have a gap between health plans.

The legislation would preserve two of the most popular features of the 2010 health-care law, letting young adults stay on their parents’ health plans until age 26 and forbidding insurers to deny coverage or charge more to people with preexisting medical problems. It would also target Planned Parenthood, rendering the women’s health organization ineligible for Medicaid reimbursements or federal family planning grants — a key priority for antiabortion groups.

The debate, starting in House committees this week, is a remarkable moment in government health-care policymaking. The Affordable Care Act, former president Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement passed in 2010 with only Democratic support, ushered in the most significant expansion of insurance coverage since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society programs of the mid-1960s.

There is no precedent for Congress to reverse a major program of social benefits once it has taken effect and reached millions of Americans.

Taken together, the bills introduced Monday night represent the Republicans’ first attempt — and best shot to date, with an ally in the White House — to translate seven years of talking points about demolishing the ACA into action.

At the same time, major aspects of the plans, notably the strategy for tax credits and Medicaid, reflect the treacherous terrain that Republicans face to win enough votes within their own conferences in the GOP-controlled House and Senate.

The bills must address concerns of both conservatives worried about the cost of the overhaul and worries that it might in effect enshrine a new federal entitlement, as well as more moderate members who want to ensure that their constituents retain access to affordable health care, including those who received Medicaid coverage under the ACA.

Even so, signs emerged on Monday that Republicans in Congress’s upper chamber could balk either at the cost of the proposal or if it leaves swaths of the country without insurance coverage.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), one of at least three conservative senators who opposes the plan to provide income-based tax credits, tweeted: “Still have not seen an official version of the House Obamacare replacement bill, but from media reports this sure looks like Obamacare Lite!”

And four key Republican senators, all from states that opted to expand Medicaid under the ACA, said they would oppose any new plan that would leave millions of Americans uninsured.

“We will not support a plan that does not include stability for Medicaid expansion populations or flexibility for states,” Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) wrote in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

The four senators were split on exactly what proposals would meet their standards, but with 52 Republicans, McConnell would not have enough votes to pass repeal without the support of at least two of them.

Democrats, meanwhile, have given no indication that they intend to work with Republicans, and top party leaders decried the GOP plan Monday as a betrayal of everyday Americans. “Trumpcare doesn’t replace the Affordable Care Act, it forces millions of Americans to pay more for less care,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).

In particular, the plan to target Planned Parenthood has already generated fierce pushback from Democrats and doubts from some Republicans who have noted that federal funds are already barred from funding abortions and that Planned Parenthood provides routine medical care to millions of American women.

The tax credits outlined by the Ways and Means Committee’s portion of the legislation incorporate an approach that Republicans have long criticized: income-based aid to help Americans afford health coverage.

Until now, the GOP had been intending to veer away from the ACA subsidies that help poor and middle-class people obtain insurance, insisting that the size of tax credits with which they planned to replace the subsidies should be based entirely on people’s ages and not their incomes. But the drafts issued Monday proposed refundable tax credits that would hinge on earnings as well as age — providing bigger credits for older and poorer Americans.

Advertisement

This big pivot, developed by the Ways and Means Committee under the guidance of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), stems from a combination of problems that were arising with the idea of age-only credits that would have been available to any individual or family buying insurance on their own, no matter how affluent.

Share this article Share

The Republican plan would offer tax credits ranging from $2,000 per year for those under 30 to $4,000 per year for those over 60. The full credit would be available for individuals earning up to $75,000 a year and up to $150,000 for married couples filing jointly. The credits would phase out for individuals earning more — for each $1,000 in additional income, a person would be entitled to $100 less in credit, meaning a 61-year old could make up to $115,000 and still receive some credit.

The income-based phase-out of the credit allows the GOP plan to be funded without taxes on employer-provided insurance that had been considered earlier in the drafting process. In addition, the latest proposal would delay the ACA’s “Cadillac” tax, a levy on the most generous employer-provided health plans, until 2025. It also retains the tax exclusion for premiums paid for employer-provided health plans.

Estimates from congressional budget analysts and the White House’s Office of Management and Budget kept showing that the credits would be both too small to provide enough help to lower-income people and too expensive overall for a GOP determined to slash federal spending that the ACA has required.

Those analysts have not had time to assess how this new configuration would affect federal spending or the number of people with insurance coverage.

While the number of Americans who can afford health insurance has never been the priority for the GOP that it is for Democrats, President Trump has made clear that he is sensitive to any changes that would strand large numbers of people who gained coverage under the ACA.

Compared with the ACA’s subsidies, the tax credits would go to more people but provide less financial help to lower-income people, according to Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Meanwhile, the portion of the legislation drafted by the Energy and Commerce Committee would substantially redesign Medicaid in a way that attempts to balance the GOP’s antipathy toward the ACA’s expansion of the program against the concerns of a significant cadre of Republican governors — and the lawmakers from their states — who fear losing millions of dollars that the law has funneled to help insure low-income residents.

Medicaid would be converted from its current form of entitlement to anyone eligible into a per capita cap on funding to states, depending on how many people they had enrolled. In states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA, the government for now would continue paying for virtually the entire cost of the expansion.

Thirty-one states, plus the District of Columbia, have adopted that expansion. Starting in 2020, however, the GOP plan would restrict the government’s generous Medicaid payment — 90 percent of the cost of covering people in the expansion group — only to people who were in the program as of then. States would keep getting that amount of federal help for each of those people as long as they remained eligible, with the idea that most people on Medicaid drop off after a few years.

For the other 19 states that did not expand Medicaid, the legislation would provide $10 billion spread over five years. States could use that money to subsidize hospitals and other providers of care that treat many poor patients.

While members of the two committees working on the replacement drafts were determined to begin considering legislation this week, final work on them was still underway over the weekend and Monday, according to three individuals with knowledge of the process.

The change in thinking about tax credits emerged since Friday, when a White House meeting chaired by Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and attended by key GOP congressional figures was called to finalize key provisions.

At the same time, the shift to take income into account could create a potentially difficult ripple effect for Republicans, who regard a reduction in the federal government’s role in health care as a central reason to abandon the sprawling 2010 health care law. One motivation for the GOP thinking that credits could depend only on age was that the Internal Revenue Service would no longer have needed to verify the eligibility of people for financial help, as it has for ACA subsidies. If income is taken into account, the IRS would still need to be involved.

Coming out of a closed-door GOP conference meeting last week, several House Republicans expressed concerns that the committees might start to work on the legislation without a complete fiscal assessment. To be eligible for special budget rules known as “reconciliation” — allowing bills to pass in the Senate by a simple majority — the legislation cannot increase the deficit after its first 10 years in effect.

Several House GOP aides involved in drafting the legislation could not say when the Congressional Budget Office would provide its formal analysis of the bill, but the two committees of jurisdiction are poised to advance the bill without it. One said committees “regularly go through the markup process without a formal CBO score.”"
3823,3823,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/03/04/trump-accuses-obama-of-nixonwatergate-plot-to-wire-tap-trump-tower/?utm_term=.6e151a1f62ac,0,"President Trump on Saturday angrily accused former president Barack Obama of orchestrating a “Nixon/Watergate” plot to tap the phones at his Trump Tower headquarters last fall in the run-up to the election. While citing no evidence to support his explosive allegation, Trump said in a series of four tweets sent Saturday morning that Obama was “wire tapping” his New York offices before the election in a move he compared to McCarthyism. “Bad (or sick) guy!” he said of his predecessor, adding that the surveillance resulted in “nothing found.”

Trump offered no citations nor did he point to any credible news report to back up his accusation, but he may have been referring to commentary on Breitbart and conservative talk radio suggesting that Obama and his administration used “police state” tactics last fall to monitor the Trump team. The Breitbart story, published Friday, has been circulating among Trump's senior staff, according to a White House official who described it as a useful catalogue of the Obama administration's activities.

Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for Obama, said in a statement early Saturday afternoon: “A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.”

Senior U.S. officials with knowledge of the wide-ranging federal investigation into Russian interference in the election said Saturday that there had been no wiretap of Trump.

Officials at Justice and the FBI declined to comment.

Trump has been feuding with the intelligence community since before he took office, convinced that career officers as well as holdovers from the Obama administration have been trying to sabotage his presidency. He has ordered internal inquiries to find who leaked sensitive information regarding communications during the campaign between Russian officials and his campaign associates and allies, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Some current and former intelligence officials cast doubt on Trump's assertion.

“It's highly unlikely there was a wiretap,” said one former senior intelligence official familiar with surveillance law who spoke candidly on the condition of anonymity. The former official continued: “It seems unthinkable. If that were the case by some chance, that means that a federal judge would have found that there was either probable cause that he had committed a crime or was an agent of a foreign power.”

A wiretap cannot be directed at a U.S. facility, the official said, without finding probable cause that the phone lines or Internet addresses were being used by agents of a foreign power — or by someone spying for or acting on behalf of a foreign government. “You can't just go around and tap buildings,” the official said.

Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a statement chastising Trump for leveling a ""spectacularly reckless allegation"" against Obama without evidence.

Referencing Trump's description of Obama as a ""bad (or sick) guy,"" Schiff said, ""If there is something bad or sick going on, it is the willingness of the nation's chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them. ""

Trump sent the tweets from Palm Beach, Fla., where he is vacationing this weekend at his private Mar-a-Lago estate. It has long been his practice to stir up new controversies to deflect attention from a damaging news cycle, such as the one in recent days about Sessions and Russia.

After visiting one of his golf courses on Saturday morning, Trump amended his public schedule to add a late-afternoon meeting with Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly at Mar-a-Lago. The president also is planning to have dinner there with both secretaries, as well as chief White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, White House Counsel Don McGahn and White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller.

Trump had departed Washington in a fury on Friday, fuming at a senior staff meeting in the Oval Office that morning about Sessions' decision to recuse himself. Trump was angry and told his top aides that he disagreed with the attorney general's decision and that he thought the White House and Justice Department should have done more to counter the suggestion that Sessions needed to step away. The president told staff he wanted to see them fight back against what he saw as a widespread effort to destabilize his presidency, according to senior White House officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.

Bannon and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who normally travel with the president, stayed behind in Washington to work on health care and immigration policies and were not with Trump on Saturday when he tweeted. Bannon was expected to fly to Florida on Saturday afternoon to attend the dinner at Mar-a-Lago.

Trump's tweets took numerous top White House aides by surprise, according to one of the White House officials. Saturday was expected to be a “down day, pretty quiet,” this official said, and there was little, if any, attempt to coordinate the president's message on the wiretapping allegations.

Here are Trump's tweets, in the order they were sent:

Trump did not stop tweeting there. About an hour later, the president revived one of his favorite feuds, this one with Arnold Schwarzenegger. The movie star-turned-California governor has been hosting “The New Celebrity Apprentice,” the NBC reality franchise that Trump helped found.

Schwarzenegger announced Friday that he would not return to the show for another season because, he said, the show had too much “baggage.” But Trump insisted on Twitter that there is more to the story than that.

Memorable tweets from President Trump + 9 Trump tweets from his personal account and the president’s. Here’s a look at some of his more memorable tweets."
3825,3825,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/14/the-republican-health-care-arguments-that-were-most-severely-hurt-by-the-cbo-report/?utm_term=.14bfba528da2
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/14/fact-check-how-accurate-were-cbos-obamacare-predictions/99157846/",0,"The White House and Republican leaders knew that the Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of their American Health Care Act wasn’t going to be helpful. They’d laid the groundwork for rejecting the CBO numbers well in advance, with press secretary Sean Spicer disparaging the CBO’s prior estimates last week, and a slew of administration and House officials appeared on the Sunday talk shows to set expectations for viewers.

It’s unlikely, though, that they understood just how badly the report released Monday would undercut their core arguments for reform.

The argument: Obamacare is about to implode. President Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Affordable Care Act is about to collapse, even claiming last week that it was designed to “explode” in 2017, because Barack Obama would be out of office. (This is, of course, ridiculous; Obama sees the legislation as integral to his legacy.) Other Republicans have offered more measured predictions of doom. Last year, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) predicted that the system was “entering a death spiral” as premiums rose, and people dropped out of the individual marketplace for insurance.

The CBO’s response: It isn’t. The CBO’s analysis addressed Ryan’s phrasing specifically.

“Decisions about offering and purchasing health insurance depend on the stability of the health insurance market — that is, on having insurers participating in most areas of the country and on the likelihood of premiums’ not rising in an unsustainable spiral,” it reads. The way the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare’s formal name) is set up, in the CBO’s estimation, “subsidies to purchase coverage combined with the penalties paid by uninsured people stemming from the individual mandate are anticipated to cause sufficient demand for insurance by people with low health care expenditures for the market to be stable.”

In other words, while the CBO doesn’t claim that the current system is flawless, it also thinks that the Obamacare structure will be stable.

Advertisement

The argument: The number of people lacking coverage will not increase, or may decrease. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price told NBC’s Chuck Todd on Sunday that his vision of success was “more people covered than are covered right now at an average cost that is less. I believe that we can firmly do that with the plan that we’ve laid out there.”

Trump repeatedly assured voters on the campaign trail that he’d preserve existing coverage, telling The Washington Post in January that his goal was “insurance for everybody.” The Republican website promoting the bill states flatly that millions of Americans won’t lose their insurance.

The CBO’s response: 24 million fewer people will have coverage by 2026 if the AHCA is passed. This was the most obvious takeaway from the report — and the one that Republicans clearly expected. Over the next decade, millions fewer people would have coverage under Medicaid, through an employer or purchased individually than if the Affordable Care Act were kept in place.

The argument: The cost of coverage will decrease, allowing more people to enroll. Ryan’s argument has consistently been that the Republican plan will substitute mandated insurance with more broadly affordable insurance — which people could purchase or not as they saw fit.

“It’s not our job to make people do something that they don’t want to do,” he told CBS’s John Dickerson on Sunday. “It is our job to have a system where people can get universal access to affordable coverage if they choose to do so or not.”

Share this article Share

The CBO’s response: Coverage will become cheaper down the road in part because older Americans give up on buying insurance. The immediate effects of the passage of the AHCA, in the CBO’s estimation, would be that premiums on the individual market would increase, because the repeal of the individual mandate means that healthier people would be more likely to opt out, leaving more less-healthy people in the pool of those insured.

Because the AHCA establishes age-based tiers that the CBO estimates would kick in by 2019, those less-healthy people would heavily skew toward older Americans. The result for them? A big spike in their health-care costs — and, as a result, more of them would choose to forego coverage, driving the cost back down.

The argument: The Trump White House won’t reduce Medicaid. Trump repeatedly insisted on the campaign trail that he would preserve Medicaid spending, including using the subject as a point of leverage against his primary opponents.

Advertisement

The CBO’s response: Medicaid spending will drop by $880 billion. The CBO report’s main redeeming point for Republicans is that it projects $935 billion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years from insurance coverage changes. Unfortunately for the White House, though, more than half of the net savings would come from that drop in Medicaid spending. (Overall, the CBO estimates that the AHCA would reduce spending by $1.6 trillion but add new spending of about $700 billion from insurance coverage. Overall, the net savings would be about $337 billion.)

That net reduction is the peg on which the AHCA hangs. It’s the primary point on which the CBO’s analysis works to the AHCA proponents’ advantage: If your main worry is reducing spending, the CBO report estimates that this will happen."

http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2017/03/14/report-trump-s-2005-taxes-revealed.html?via=desktop&source=copyurl",0,"It wasn’t the smoking gun President Trump’s critics had hoped for. Far from it. Some even thought MSNBC host Rachel Maddow’s apparent scoop on Trump’s leaked 2005 tax return made him look good. After all, the New York Times had once suggested that he had avoided taxes, and others that he was faking the extent of his wealth.

The White House circulated a response before the segment aired, complete with its go-to “dishonest media” broadside.

“You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago,” a White House spokesman said anonymously in a statement.

Donald Trump Jr. seized on the report minutes after the show ended, tweeting, “Thank you Rachel Maddow for proving to your #Trump hating followers how successful @realDonaldTrump is $ that he paid $44mm in taxes!”

The documents revealed nothing about the president’s financial ties, the subject of intense scrutiny from Democrats and others who think Trump may have concealed business relationships in Russia.

All told, Trump seemed to make it through the segment in pretty good shape — so good that a cyberspace chorus wondered for hours after the fact: Did Trump leak his own tax return?

Feeding the theory was the recipient of the two-page summary of the return, David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and tax expert, who discussed it on Maddow’s show Tuesday night. The documents showed that Trump had earned more than $150 million in 2005 and had paid $36.5 million in income tax — hardly the game-changing exposé some believed it would be.

“It’s entirely possible that Donald sent this to me,” Johnston told Maddow. “It’s a possibility, and it could have been leaked by someone in his direction.”

Others noted that the tax return was labeled “client copy,” ostensibly indicating that it came from someone close to him, rather than the IRS.

“So,” said a blogger at Redstate.com, “either Donald Trump leaked this himself, or someone with a ‘client copy’ did. Given that there appears to be nothing embarrassing about the return whatsoever, and the world is laughing at Maddow, my money’s on Trump being the leaker. It’s probably the most favorable return for his narrative in existence.”

Others made similar observations on Twitter:

Here's a photo of the Trump tax returns that @maddow just displayed.

Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) went further, saying Trump may have released the documents to divert attention from debate over the GOP health-care bill and the investigation into the administration’s ties to Russia:

Trump probably released the 2 pages to show he paid taxes once to divert attention from Russia & CBO report on #Trumpcare.Y no other pages? https://t.co/VOjvbJF5ok — Steve Cohen (@RepCohen) March 15, 2017

The right-wing radio host Joe Walsh, meanwhile, pondered whether Trump was trying to “troll” Maddow:

What do ya bet that Trump himself leaked these tax returns to troll @maddow?



Love it. — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) March 15, 2017

If Trump or someone near him was the source of the leak, it certainly wouldn’t be out of character for the president. For years, Trump regularly posed as his own spokesman, using the aliases “John Barron” and “John Miller” to brag about himself and steer coverage about his personal life. (Trump has denied that he ever used a fake name, but he admitted under oath to doing so, as The Washington Post has reported.)

Trump has also proven himself a master of deflection, habitually taking to Twitter to distract from the day’s controversies. As David Smith of the Guardian noted, “It would be a classic Trump tactic to deflect attention from his troubles with wire-tapping claims and replacing the healthcare law.”

For months now, Trump has refused to release his tax returns, claiming his lawyers have told him not to do so because he is under audit.

But in its statement Tuesday, the White House said Trump had paid $38 million in taxes on an income of more than $150 million, both figures close to what the documents showed. It added that Trump was “one of the most successful businessmen in the world” and had paid “no more tax than legally required.”

“If all of Donald Trump’s federal tax returns are along the lines of this one,” Binyamin Appelbaum of the New York Times tweeted, “it would certainly be in his interest to publish them.”

After the story broke, Johnston said “Trump fans” made threatening calls to his wife and one of his children.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/01/opinions/trump-speech-to-congress-reaction-opinion-roundup/index.html",0,"President Trump sought Wednesday to build on the momentum of a speech that invigorated fellow Republicans, as they focused on the hard work of turning his vision into policy. Following his first joint address to Congress — in which Trump won high marks from Republicans for both his agenda and his measured tone — he convened a lunch Wednesday with leading GOP lawmakers.

“We’re just here to start the process,” said Trump, who was flanked by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) as the meeting began. “It begins as of now, and we think we’re going to have tremendous success.”

Trump was scheduled to meet later Wednesday with members of his own team to talk more about how to advance key parts of his sweeping agenda.

No Democrats were invited to Wednesday’s lunch at the White House with congressional leaders, which press secretary Sean Spicer said was by design.

“To be factual here, at some point the people who set the agenda and the timetable to enact his agenda are Republican,” Spicer told reporters, who were later invited into the luncheon in the Roosevelt Room only briefly.

Spicer said Trump would meet with Democrats in Congress — who criticized him Wednesday for not offering concrete plans — at some other point.

While Trump garnered enthusiastic applause Tuesday from the Republican side of the aisle for marquee items such as replacing former president Barack Obama’s health-care law and retooling the tax code, major differences remain within the GOP on the specifics of how to move forward.

“I think he understands, as we do, the importance of getting those things done to set the tone for his entire first term,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), one of the luncheon participants.

Cornyn said the meeting focused more on how the two chambers of Congress and the White House will work together than on reaching immediate consensus.

“We are getting organized, getting prepared,” he said. “The only way we’re going to get this done is to work closely together.”

Vice President Pence said earlier Wednesday that the reception Trump received both in the House chamber and outside it gave him “great confidence that the agenda that the president articulated last night is the right agenda for America; it’s resonating with the American people.”

“I couldn’t be more optimistic about the opportunity to move forward our agenda,” Pence said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” the first of 11 planned television and radio interviews in the wake of Trump’s speech.

Spicer added that Trump felt “humbled” by praise he had received for his 60-minute address.

Both Trump and Pence are planning to hit the road to pitch their plans beyond the Beltway.

On Thursday, Trump plans to give a speech aboard the USS Gerald Ford, a newly christened aircraft carrier in Newport News, Va., and lead a roundtable discussion with military officials and shipbuilders. And on Friday, he will visit St. Andrew's Catholic School in Orlando to conduct what aides described as a listening session on school choice.

In his address Tuesday night, Trump sought to repackage his hard-line campaign promises with a moderate sheen, declaring what he termed “a new chapter of American greatness” of economic renewal and military might.

Seeking to steady his presidency after a tumultuous first 40 days, Trump had an air of seriousness and revealed flashes of compassion as he broadly outlined an agenda to rebuild a country he described as ravaged by crime and drugs, deteriorating infrastructure and failing bureaucracies.

Trump’s speech touched on his plans to overhaul the nation’s health-care system and tax code, but it was short on specifics and heavy on lofty prose. Struggling to steer a bitterly divided nation with his job-approval ratings at historic lows, Trump effectively pleaded with the American people to give him a chance and to imagine what could be achieved during his presidency.

“We are one people, with one destiny,” Trump said quietly near the end. “The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.”

The softer edges than in previous speeches, including Trump’s inaugural address, prompted speculation about whether he was attempting a broader shift in his leadership style. That style has been marked by numerous distractions, including some he has instigated on Twitter.

As of 9 a.m. Wednesday, Trump had tweeted only two words since his speech: “THANK YOU!”

Democrats warned that less had changed than it might appear.

“With this president more than any other, his speeches are detached from reality,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday morning on NBC’s “Today” show. “In his campaign, and even his inaugural speech, he talks to the working people of America, but for the last 40 days, his actions have been decidedly on the side of special interests, hurting working America.”

Schumer criticized Trump for, among other things, not yet presenting a package to overhaul the nation’s infrastructure, despite heralding that aim in his speech.

“He’s not governing like his speeches,” Schumer said. “This speech will be forgotten in a day or two, and where’s the action?”

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) struck a similar tone Wednesday, calling Trump “a good salesman” who delivered “a bait-and-switch speech.”

“He hasn’t had a proposal on jobs, on infrastructure, not even renegotiating NAFTA, which he promised,” Pelosi said during an appearance on MSNBC, referring to the North American trade pact.

Democrats also expressed skepticism about Trump’s comments Tuesday suggesting that he is open to an immigration overhaul that could provide a pathway to legal status. Trump made the remarks during a private White House luncheon with television news anchors but made no mention of it in his speech.

“We await the details of what a plan might be that be that could get by a Republican, right-wing House of Representatives that so far has opposed any real meaningful comprehensive immigration policy,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) during an appearance Wednesday on CNN.

Trump did extend some olive branches to his opponents. He called on Congress to pass paid family leave, a reference to a long-held Democratic Party priority that brought liberal lawmakers to their feet to applaud. And he pledged to work with Muslim allies to extinguish Islamic State terrorists, going so far as to acknowledge the killings of Muslims as well as Christians in the Middle East.

Still, Trump did not back away from his most controversial policies. He used typically bellicose language to describe the fight against the Islamic State, calling it “a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs.” He made a point to utter the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism,” which Republicans cheered heartily.

The president forcefully defended his travel ban of refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries — an executive order that was halted in federal court — as necessary to prevent the entry of foreigners who do not share America’s values.

“We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America,” Trump said. “We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.”

Trump had planned to unveil a revised order Wednesday, but that appeared to be pushed off until later in the week in the wake of his generally well-received speech.

In the speech, the president trumpeted his plans to budget a major increase in military spending. One of Trump’s fiercest Republican critics, Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), stood enthusiastically when the president said he would end the “defense sequester” caps on Pentagon spending.

On foreign affairs, Trump said he would honor historic alliances — and explicitly stated his support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, on which he had wavered during his campaign — but said he would seek new ones as well, even with former adversaries. The latter seemed an indirect reference to potentially working to combat terrorism with Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded meddled in the November election in hopes of helping Trump.

“America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align,” Trump said. “We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.”

Trump declared that the time had come to rewrite trade deals and alliances in terms that benefit the United States, irrespective of global pressures.

“My job is not to represent the world,” Trump said. “My job is to represent the United States of America.”

Trump was adamant that the United States cannot continue to abide by what Republicans and Democrats see as free trade. “It also has to be fair trade,” Trump said. He cited Abraham Lincoln, who, he said, “warned that the ‘abandonment of the protective policy by the American government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.’ ” He said he would not let workers “be taken advantage of anymore.”

Trump, as he typically does, basked in his electoral feat and cast his ascent to the presidency in epic terms. “In 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet,” he said, adding that a “rebellion” that started as “a quiet protest” morphed into “a loud chorus” and finally “an earthquake.”

He said he was sent to Washington to deliver on the promises he made on the campaign trail — arguably chief among them, to build a wall along the border with Mexico. Trump argued that everyday Americans cannot succeed “in an environment of lawless chaos” at the borders.

Trump challenged both parties in Congress to move quickly to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature health-care law.

“Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans,” Trump said. “Action is not a choice; it is a necessity.”

Trump also called for a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that he said would be the biggest program of national rebuilding since President Dwight D. Eisenhower built the interstate highway system in the 1950s. Trump said his projects would be financed through a combination of public and private capital, but he offered no further details.

Trump was more somber than usual, toning down his bravado, but there were moments where he reveled in his celebrity. He glad-handed Supreme Court justices as he made his way to the rostrum and shared small talk with a reverential congressman, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.). As he left at the end of his speech, he paused to autograph books in the aisle."

Trump used his first meeting with Merkel to affirm his “strong support” for NATO and to declare he is not an “isolationist” on free trade after a campaign in which he questioned U.S. policies on multilateral security and economic alliances in Europe and elsewhere.

But the two remained far apart on immigration in the wake of Trump’s efforts to impose a temporary travel ban on refugees and immigrants from several majority-Muslim nations in the Middle East and Northern Africa, a move that contrasts sharply with Merkel’s more liberal policies.

For a second time, federal judges this week suspended the president's executive order, though his administration has vowed to appeal the rulings.

“Immigration is a privilege, not a right,” Trump said at a joint news conference with Merkel, adding, “the safety of our citizens must always come first.”

Merkel's decision to welcome large numbers of Syrian refugees stands in sharp contrast to Trump's insistence that the U.S. refu­gee program has made the country vulnerable to terrorist infiltration.

Merkel on Friday acknowledged the need to secure borders and work to integrate immigrants into society, but she emphasized that such goals have “to be done while looking at the refugees as well, giving them opportunities to shape their own lives . . . [and] help countries who right now are not able to do so, sometimes because they have civil war.”

Beyond policy, their summit was marked by an Oval Office photo op during which Trump appeared to disregard Merkel’s suggestion that they shake hands and he generally avoided making eye contact with her as news photographers captured the scene.

And Trump put the German leader on the spot during their news conference when he made an awkward joke about them having ""something in common"" over his unfounded allegations that President Barack Obama had ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to wiretap Trump Tower in New York.

He appeared to be referring to reports in 2013 that the Obama administration authorized eavesdropping on Merkel’s personal cellphone calls, a point of tension between her and Obama.

Merkel, looking uncomfortable, chose not to respond to Trump’s remarks.

“It’s always better to talk to one another than about one another,” Merkel said through an interpreter during her opening remarks.

The disharmony between Trump and Merkel is a sharp contrast to Merkel’s warm relationship with Obama, whose world view was largely aligned with the German chancellor on many issues. Trump was sharply critical of Merkel during the presidential campaign, accusing her of “ruining Germany” — a longtime U.S. ally — over her more liberal policies on free trade and refugees. He has also expressed support for Britain’s decision to leave the European Union — an alliance deeply important to Merkel.

Beyond their seemingly divergent worldview, the two leaders could not be more different in terms of personality. Trump is a brash, outspoken businessman and Merkel a staid and reserved trained scientist.

The summit was being closely watched at home and abroad for signs of how the two leaders would engage each other. As much as Trump has questioned the multilateral alliances of the post-World War II international order and Merkel has defended them, German officials insisted that her visit was aimed at finding common ground.

Yet unlike Trump's White House summits with several other world leaders — such as prime ministers Shinzo Abe of Japan, Theresa May of Britain and Justin Trudeau of Canada — there were few signs Friday that he and Merkel had built much personal rapport.

Hoping to get reassurances from Trump on trade ties, Merkel arrived in Washington with an entourage that included German business executives to emphasize the economic ties between the nations. Trump has opposed multilateral trade deals, and talks on a major U.S.-European pact called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which had been negotiated by the Obama administration, have stalled.

Trump said he is not anti-trade, but wants “fair trade,” and he reiterated his past criticism that U.S. policies have harmed American workers.

Despite his endorsement of NATO, Trump reiterated his campaign-trail criticism that member nations are not paying their “fair share” to support the security alliance.

Trump said some countries owe “vast sums” in dues, which is “very unfair to the United States” — an allegation that appeared to be based on an incomplete understanding of how the alliance is funded.

Trump stated that each nation agreed to contribute 2 percent of its gross domestic product to NATO. In fact, the alliance had long ago set a goal that each member would devote at least 2 percent of GDP to defense in their own budgets.

The members contribute their capabilities to NATO, not monetary assessments. Those who haven’t reached 2 percent, which is the majority of nations, don’t “owe” or have to make up shortfalls of the past."

http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/18/politics/trump-tough-week/index.html",0,"When Judge Neil Gorsuch arrives on Capitol Hill on Monday morning to begin his confirmation hearings for a seat on the Supreme Court, he will give President Trump his first chance to make a lasting imprint on the federal judiciary — and Republicans a fresh test to work their will now that they control all of Washington’s levers of power.

Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge from Colorado, was promoted by conservative legal activists because of his sterling credentials, a decade of right-of-center rulings and his allegiance to the same brand of constitutional interpretation employed by the late justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia.

“Single best thing the president’s done,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a frequent Trump foil who predicted Republican unity on the matter and an easy victory for the president following the string of controversies that Trump has wrought since he took office.

All of that also sets up a stark dilemma for Senate Democrats. Monday brings their newest opportunity since the confirmation hearings of Trump’s Cabinet to take a stand against a young administration that has horrified liberal Americans with efforts to strip away provisions of the Affordable Care Act, impose an entry ban on some immigrants and deeply cut federal agencies’ budgets.

The left also remains angry about a Supreme Court seat that has been vacant since Scalia died 13 months ago, after which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) decided to block a hearing for President Barack Obama’s selection for the seat, Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

Gorsuch seemed to forecast what might await him from Democrats in a 2002 column he wrote lamenting the state of the Supreme Court nomination process: “When a favored candidate is voted down for lack of sufficient political sympathy to those in control, grudges are held for years, and retaliation is guaranteed.”

Yet Democrats are divided about how to take on a genial jurist who has made few waves in the weeks since Trump nominated him and he began meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

Gorsuch “is a bit of a puzzle,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “We’re going to try to put those pieces together so that the puzzle is complete and we have an understanding of what kind of a fifth vote will be going on the court.”

Asked about what more she hopes to learn about Gorsuch’s stances, Feinstein said: “Voting rights. Right to choose. Guns. Corporate dollars in elections. Worker safety. Ability of federal agencies to regulate. All of the environmental issues — water, air.”

Senators and their staffs are also examining Gorsuch's role as a high-ranking official in the Justice Department at the time the George W. Bush administration was dealing with Guantanamo Bay detainees, reports of torture and anti-terrorism policies.

A new trove of materials released this weekend shows Gorsuch playing a central role in coordinating legal and legislative strategy, but portraying himself as reconciling the many opinions of those in the administration rather than driving policy.

“I am but the scrivener looking for language that might please everybody,” he wrote in one email.

Four days of hearings are set to begin Monday, when Gorsuch will sit and listen for several hours as members of the Judiciary Committee read opening statements. He is poised to deliver his opening statement on Monday afternoon, giving senators and the nation an early indication of how he might serve on the court.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, Gorsuch is set to face at least 50 minutes of questioning by each member of the panel. The proceedings are expected to conclude Thursday with a panel of witnesses speaking for or against Gorsuch.

Some of the issues that normally animate Supreme Court confirmation hearings won’t depend upon Gorsuch. Decisions from last term showed there was still support on the court for limited affirmative action in higher education, for instance. The majority that found a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry remains. And whatever Gorsuch’s position on abortion rights, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s vote to strike down a Texas law last year reaffirmed the court’s rulings that say government may not pass restrictions that unduly burden a woman’s right to an abortion.

But Gorsuch would probably reinforce the court’s pro-business image and skepticism about some significant environmental programs begun under Obama. His past decisions show him to be extremely protective of the rights of those who object to even generally applicable government laws and regulations that they say violate their religious beliefs.

If Gorsuch is approved in time for the court’s April hearings, he could play a significant role in a separation-of-powers case in which a church complains it was illegally denied a state grant. A conservative movement to curb the power of labor unions — stalled last year by Scalia’s death — is sure to resume. Cases involving legal protections for gay and transgender people are likely to arrive at the court soon.

Beyond their questions about Gorsuch’s record, Democrats plan to use his confirmation hearing to question the overall direction of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.’s court.

“When I hear my Republican colleagues say, ‘We want another judge like Scalia, who isn’t an activist,’ I say, ‘What are you talking about? This has been an incredibly activist court,’ ” said Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), a member of the Judiciary Committee. “So I want to ask him” about that.

The future of the court was a significant factor in Trump winning over conservative voters who might otherwise have been uncomfortable with the candidate’s ideology, values and personal history.

“Even if people don’t like me, they have to vote for me,” Trump said at a rally in Virginia last year. “You know why? Justices of the Supreme Court.”

In November exit polls, more than 1 in 5 voters said that Supreme Court appointments were “the most important factor” in determining their choice; of those voters, 56 percent went to Trump.

Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), Trump’s final Republican opponent in last year’s presidential campaign, described the Gorsuch pick as “the most transparent Supreme Court selection process in modern times” because Trump drew Gorsuch from a list of 21 candidates supplied to him by conservative legal groups during the campaign.

Gorsuch’s nomination “is not the product just of ordinary Washington political decision-making but rather a presidential election decided by the American people,” Cruz said.

Not a single Democrat, meanwhile, has pledged support for Gorsuch. That is partly fueled by a liberal base agitating for a win since Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20. Unable to block the large majority of Trump’s executive branch nominations, some Democrats want to draw blood and force Gorsuch to clear procedural hurdles that require 60 senators to vote in his favor. Republicans have only 52 members in the upper chamber, so they would need eight Democrats to cross the aisle and vote with them.

Mounting a filibuster to force such a vote could amount to a declaration of war against Republicans that some Democrats, particularly those from conservative states that voted for Trump last year, may be unwilling to do.

“The reality is that there is political pressure on them,” Caroline Fredrickson, president of the liberal American Constitution Society, said of Democrats. The Supreme Court is different from other choices Trump will make, she said, because “this is forever, or at least for the rest of my lifetime.”

Democrats have expressed specific concern about Gorsuch's record of independence following Trump's criticism of the judiciary, including his remark about the ""so-called judge"" who struck down his first entry ban. Afterward, Gorsuch called Trump's attacks on the courts ""demoralizing.""

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Republicans should expect Democrats to question Gorsuch aggressively because “we’re in a new world” in which Trump is pushing the limits of his constitutional authority. Knowing where Gorsuch stands on that issue is critical, he said.

“I have deep, deep doubts about him and his judicial demeanor, and the fact that he appears to be a calm, erudite person is not the key issue here,” Schumer said. “There are lot of people like that. It’s what goes into how he decides cases.”

Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said he will ask Gorsuch to weigh in on Trump’s push to implement an entry ban on visitors from certain majority-Muslim countries, because “the Supreme Court in the near future will be tested on constitutional questions involving separation of powers.”

Franken and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said they want to press Gorsuch on his cases involving campaign finance law, while Franken said he will also focus on Gorsuch’s record on voting rights and women’s reproductive rights. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said he plans to use documents provided by the Justice Department to ask Gorsuch about his years working for Bush on such matters as executive authority and the interrogation of terrorism suspects.

Gorsuch “is going to have to establish very much that he’d be independent of any president and that he’s going to uphold the rights of all Americans,” Leahy said. “He’s got a lot of work to do in that regard.”

Many conservative activists and GOP lawmakers say that the laundry list of Democratic concerns is evidence that they don’t quite know how to pin down Gorsuch.

Questions about Gorsuch’s potential independence from the Trump White House or conservative causes will be “an exercise in self-contradiction for the Democrats,” said Leonard Leo, who has been advising Trump on judicial matters and is on leave from his role as executive vice president of the conservative Federalist Society, which helped advise Trump on his list of potential court nominees.

""They want Judge Gorsuch to say, 'I'm my own man, I'm independent, I'm going to evaluate the actions of the executive branch on their own merits without regards to the president or any political issue,' "" he said. ""And then 10 minutes later they're going to ask him to promise how he's going to rule on Roe v. Wade and every other case that comes before the court.""

""There'll be an effort to use him as a piñata to jam the president,"" Leo said, later adding that such attempts would be ""unfortunate and inappropriate.""

And there could be other issues to emerge. With only eight members and the threat of ideological deadlock, the court has seemed reluctant to accept some controversial cases.

Gorsuch’s nomination to replace Scalia, with whom he shares an “originalist” philosophy of constitutional interpretation, is in some ways like other recent replacements — by some measures a zero sum, ideologically speaking. Bush’s two nominees, Roberts and Samuel A. Alito Jr., also replaced Republican nominees. Obama’s choices of Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan took the places of liberals.

But justices’ ideologies are not predictable purely by virtue of the party of the president who nominated them. Alito’s replacement of the more moderate Sandra Day O’Connor moved the court to the right on several issues, including abortion, voting rights and campaign finance law.

“I don’t accept the premise that it’s ‘Scalia’s seat,’ ” Durbin said. “I don’t know what the next seat will be or when it will be, so I take each of them seriously.”

Watching how Gorsuch fares will be the eight current members of the high court, who have said very little publicly in the past year about their diminished ranks.

Weeks before Scalia’s death, Roberts told an audience in Boston that public skepticism concerning the court starts with the Senate confirmation process. Decades ago, two of the court’s most controversial justices — Scalia on the right and Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the left — were confirmed practically unanimously, he said.

But the three “extremely well-qualified” nominees who followed Roberts — Alito, Sotomayor and Kagan — were approved largely on party-line votes.

“That suggests to me that the process is being used for something other than ensuring the qualifications of the nominees,” Roberts said.

Skittish Republicans acknowledged that Trump could still spoil Gorsuch’s chances. Graham said it could happen “if the president tweets any more about judges.”

Said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), the chamber’s second-ranking Republican: “I think the best thing the White House could do is just let the Senate do its work.”"

The president, through his aides in a closed-door meeting, signaled that the time for negotiations was over with rank-and-file Republicans who were meeting late at night on Capitol Hill to try to find common ground on the embattled package crafted by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).

The move was a high-risk gamble for the president and the speaker, who have invested significant political capital in passing legislation that would replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act. For Trump, who campaigned as a skilled negotiator capable of forging a good deal on behalf of Americans, it could either vindicate or undercut one of his signature claims. If the measure fails, it would be a defeat for Trump in his first effort to help pass major legislation and it may also jeopardize other items on his wish list, including a tax overhaul and infrastructure spending.

Defeat would also mean that Obamacare — something that congressional Republicans have railed against for seven years — would remain in place.

""Disastrous #Obamacare has led to higher costs & fewer options. It will only continue to get worse! We must #RepealANDReplace. #PassTheBill,"" Trump tweeted from his official presidential account as the meeting was wrapping up Thursday night.

It was far from clear, however, that Ryan and Trump have the votes to muscle the package through the House after several members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus refused to back it following a marathon session of negotiations Thursday with Trump and other top aides.

Post-meeting, a handful of Republicans announced they would back the legislation. But a larger number said they were still opposed or had yet to make up their minds.

“For seven and a half years we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law, because it’s collapsing and it’s failing families,” Ryan said. “And tomorrow we’re proceeding.”

But the speaker refused to answer shouted questions from reporters after the meeting about whether he had the votes for passage.

“They’re going to bring it up, pass or fail,” said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho).

In the meeting with House Republicans on Thursday night, according to Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told his former colleagues “the president needs this, the president has said he wants a vote tomorrow up or down.”

“If for any reason it’s down, we’re just going to move forward with additional parts of his agenda,” Collins described Mulvaney as saying. “This is our moment in time.”

A key moment inside the session, several lawmakers said, was when Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.), a freshman lawmaker who lost both his legs in 2010 while serving as an Army bomb disposal technician in Afghanistan, rose and called on his colleagues to unite behind the bill in the same way he and his comrades fought in battle.

A rowdy group of Republicans burst out of the meeting like explorers on a quest for glory. “Burn the ships,” one Republican shouted to House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (La.), invoking the command that Hernan Cortes, the Spanish conquistador, gave his men upon landing in Mexico in 1519.

The message was clear, to the GOP leaders now and the Spaniards in 1519, there was no turning back.

“Only way to do it,” Scalise told a packed elevator of lawmakers.

Leaders continued to plead with individual lawmakers to support the measure well into Thursday night, with the House Rules Committee slated to meet early Friday morning to consider the proposed changes.

Ryan got down on a knee to plead with Rep. Don Young, an 83-year-old from Alaska who is the longest-serving Republican in Congress and remains undecided.

When the speaker finished with Young, he spent about 10 minutes in an animated discussion with Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), one of the bill’s most outspoken critics. At one point, the speaker took his own arms and held them up, his hands at face level, then slowly lowered them to his waist — presumably trying to demonstrate his belief that the bill will lower costs.

The ongoing effort to whip the vote, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) said at one point, involved “back-patting and butt-kicking.”

“Democracy’s messy,” he added.

Ryan had intended to bring up his plan for a vote Thursday. But criticism — mainly from conservatives — caused that strategy to unravel after Freedom Caucus members rejected Trump’s offer to strip a key set of mandates from the nation’s current health-care law. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Trump chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon trooped up to Ryan’s office to make the case personally, warning recalcitrant conservatives that the only alternative would be to accept the ACA as the law of the land.

By evening, leaders adopted the proposed change conservatives had rebuffed earlier, eliminating the law's ""essential benefits"" that insurers must offer under the ACA in an effort to reduce premium costs. Those benefits include covering mental-health treatment, wellness visits, and maternity and newborn care, and states would have the option of adding them back next year.

They also added one sweetener for moderates, a six-year delay in repealing a 0.9 percent additional Medicare tax on high-income Americans who earn above $200,000 if filing individually, or $250,000 if married and filing jointly. By keeping the tax in place, GOP leaders could provide an additional $15 billion to the states to help cover treatment for mental health and substance abuse issues, as well as maternity and infant care.

Meanwhile, a new analysis by the Congressional Budget Office released Thursday evening showed that changes House leaders made to the bill Monday do not alter a projection that 24 million more Americans would be uninsured by 2026 under the bill. In addition, the updated bill would cut the deficit by $150 billion over the next decade — nearly $200 billion less than the earlier version of the legislation.

The changes include a couple of conservative overhauls to the Medicaid program and language directing that $85 billion be used to help Americans ages 50 to 64 obtain coverage.

It was unclear how the new CBO score would affect legislative support for the bill.

But it was lawmakers on the right eager to dismantle the current health-care law who remained GOP leaders’ biggest problem.

“I’m still a ‘no’ on the bill,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who chairs the Freedom Caucus. “I think it’s the president leading, and I applaud him for leading.”

Some key moderates are also against the bill. Rep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.), who has known Trump for decades and whose Staten Island district swung heavily toward the Republican candidate, left the meeting committed to voting no.

“I’ve got to think about the 744,000 people I represent,” he said. Asked about the White House’s message that killing the bill would leave no more chances for repeal, he shook his head. “I don’t believe that.”

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said during an appearance Thursday night on Fox News that the president remained confident the bill would pass.

“At the end of the day, this is the only train leaving the station that’s going to repeal Obamacare,” he said, adding that Trump always knew winning a majority would be tough.

“I think we’re going to see the same level of success” as in last year’s campaign, Spicer said. “He’s left nothing in the field.”

Trump devoted much of his day to personally lobbying members. Speaking to a group of trucking executives and employees at a White House event aimed at showing how the ACA had driven up the industry’s costs, Trump joked that he did not have much time to mingle.

“I’m not going to make it too long, because I have to get votes,” Trump said, sparking laughter. “I don’t want to spend too much time with you. I’m going to lose by one vote, and then I’m going to blame the truckers.”

This high-wire balancing act, in which Republicans are catering to conservatives in the House with the knowledge that they still must woo moderates to get legislation to Trump’s desk, could not only reshape the nation’s health-care system but could also have uncertain electoral repercussions for the new majority.

GOP leaders can afford only 21 or 22 defections, depending on how many Democrats are present Friday.

But with failure not a viable option, Ryan and Trump have been working furiously to win over the large voting bloc of conservatives who control the House bill’s fate.

Passage of the bill would represent a major political victory for both the White House and House leaders, although the ultimate fate of the legislation hinges on the Senate. There are at least a dozen skeptics of the bill among Senate Republicans, who maintain a slim 52-to-48 advantage, and many of them want to maintain some of the current law’s more generous spending components.

Democrats relished the GOP’s predicament. Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who had scheduled a 4 p.m. rally against the bill, turned it into a short-term declaration of victory.

“Remember, they wanted to have their repeal and replace ready when Trump was inaugurated,” said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.). “Now, here we are — they don’t have it, again. They’re looking for a sweet spot, and they won’t find one.”

Former president Barack Obama, for his part, issued a statement noting that more than 20 million Americans have gained coverage since he signed the law in 2010, while the rise in health-care costs has slowed. The statement came on the seventh anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act — a day that Republicans had hoped to mark by dismantling it.

“So the reality is clear: America is stronger because of the Affordable Care Act,” Obama said, adding that Republicans are welcome to work with Democrats to improve the law. “But we should start from the baseline that any changes will make our health-care system better, not worse, for hard-working Americans. That should always be our priority.”"

Comey acknowledged Monday that his agency is conducting an investigation into possible coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign in a counterintelligence probe that could reach all the way to the White House and may last for months. The extraordinary disclosure came near the beginning of a sprawling, 5½ -hour public hearing before the House Intelligence Committee in which Comey also said there is “no information” that supports President Trump’s claims that his predecessor ordered surveillance of Trump Tower during the election campaign.

Comey repeatedly refused to answer whether specific individuals close to the president had fallen under suspicion of criminal wrongdoing, “so we don’t wind up smearing people” who may not be charged with a crime.

The FBI traditionally does not disclose the existence of an investigation, “but in unusual circumstances, where it is in the public interest,” Comey said, “it may be appropriate to do so.”

Comey also said he was authorized by the Justice Department to confirm the existence of the wide-ranging probe into Russian interference in the electoral process. He drew fire last year after he notified Congress 11 days before the presidential election — and against the department's strong advice not to — that the FBI had reopened an examination of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server.

That move, Democrats charged, hurt Clinton as she was heading into the home stretch of her campaign. Now, the tables are turned.

Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the committee chairman, urged Comey to reveal if and when the bureau has information clearing any of its targets, and to do so as quickly as possible.

“There’s a big gray cloud that you’ve now put over people who have very important work to do to lead this country, and so the faster that you can get to the bottom of this, it’s going to be better for all Americans,” Nunes said.

Comey said that the investigation began in late July and that for a counterintelligence probe, “that’s a fairly short period of time.”

The hearing came amid the controversy fired up by Trump more than two weeks ago when he tweeted, without providing evidence, that President Barack Obama had ordered his phones tapped at Trump Tower.

“I have no information that supports those tweets,’’ Comey said. “We have looked carefully inside the FBI,’’ and agents found nothing to support those claims.

He added that the Justice Department had asked him to tell the committee that the agency has no such information, either.

Under questioning from the top Democrat on the panel, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), Comey said no president could order such surveillance.

Remarkably, Trump’s presidential Twitter account continued to fire away throughout the widely watched hearing, live-tweeting comments and assertions that lawmakers then referred to and used to question Comey and National Security Agency Director Michael S. Rogers.

Comey and Rogers both predicted that Russian intelligence agencies will continue to seek to meddle in U.S. political campaigns, because they consider their work in the 2016 presidential race to have been successful.

In an influence campaign that the U.S. intelligence community in January said was ordered by Russian President Vladi­mir Putin, hackers working for Russian spy agencies penetrated the computers of the Democratic National Committee in 2015 and 2016, as well as the email accounts of Democratic officials. The material was relayed to WikiLeaks, the intelligence community reported, and the anti-secrecy group launched a series of damaging email releases that began just before the Democratic National Convention last summer and continued through the fall. The Russians' goal was not only to undermine the legitimacy of the election process but also to harm Clinton's campaign and boost Trump's chances of winning, the intelligence community concluded.

“They’ll be back in 2020. They may be back in 2018,” Comey said. “One of the lessons they may draw from this is that they were successful, introducing chaos and discord” into the electoral process.

Rogers agreed: “I fully expect they will maintain this level of activity.” And, he said, Moscow is conducting a similar “active measures” campaign in Europe, where France and Germany are holding elections this year.

The panel’s Democrats focused on possible contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials. Schiff outlined a series of events that took place last July and August that he said appear to be “pivotal” to the question of whether there was improper contact.

He ticked off a list of more than a dozen incidents, including former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page’s trip to Moscow and alleged meeting with Igor Sechin, a Putin confidant and chief executive of the energy company Rosneft; and Trump political adviser Roger Stone’s boasts about his connections to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Stone’s prediction that the emails of Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta would be published.

“Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence? Yes, it is possible,” Schiff said. “But it is also possible, may be more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated. . . . We simply don’t know, not yet, and we owe it to the country to find out.”

At the White House, press secretary Sean Spicer stressed that an investigation into possible collusion between Russian officials and Trump associates doesn’t mean that there was any.

“Investigating it and having proof of it are two different things,” Spicer said. “I think it’s fine to look into it, but at the end of the day they’re going to come to the same conclusion that everybody else has had.” Said Spicer: “There’s no evidence of a Trump-Russian collusion.”

The committee Republicans, meanwhile, seemed most exercised by leaks to the media. Information shared with the press has resulted in stories since the election on the intelligence community’s conclusion about Moscow’s desire to see Trump win, and on contacts Trump administration officials or close associates had with Russian officials.

One story in particular that apparently upset the Republicans was a Feb. 9 piece by The Washington Post reporting that Trump's then-national security adviser, Michael Flynn, discussed the subject of sanctions with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, in the month before Trump took office. The Post reported that the discussions were observed under routine, court-approved monitoring of Kislyak's calls. Flynn, who had denied to Vice President Pence that he had spoken about sanctions, was forced to resign.

Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) suggested that the leaks were political. He asked Comey whether the intelligence community had shared such information with Obama or his attorney general, Loretta E. Lynch.

Comey — who had acknowledged that in general, senior officials, including Lynch, would have access to such information — said he would not comment on his conversations with Obama or Trump.

As the hearing was going on, Trump’s presidential Twitter account — in an apparent dig at Comey and carrying the suggestion that Obama administration officials were behind the leaks — posted the tweet: “FBI Director Comey refuses to deny he briefed President Obama on calls made by Michael Flynn to Russia.”

At another point, the account tweeted out, “The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process.”

Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), noting that the tweet had gone out to 16.1 million Americans, asked Comey, “Is that accurate?”

“We’ve offered no opinion . . . on potential impact because it’s not something we looked at,” Comey said.

Nunes sought an admission from the officials that the leaks were illegal under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the law that governs foreign intelligence-gathering on U.S. soil or U.S. persons overseas.

“Yes,” Comey answered. “In addition to being a breach of our trust with the FISA court.”

Rep. Thomas J. Rooney (R-Fla.) pressed Rogers to clarify under what circumstances it would be legitimate for Americans caught on tape speaking with people under surveillance to have their identities disclosed publicly.

Rogers stressed that the identities of U.S. persons picked up through “incidental collection” — in which investigating agents hear the words of people conversing with the targets of a wiretap — are disclosed only on a “valid, need-to-know” basis, and usually only when there is criminal activity or a potential threat to the United States at play.

Comey confirmed that individuals within the NSA, the CIA, the FBI, the Justice Department and others — including personnel in the White House, in some situations — could have requested the unmasking of the names of U.S. persons. But he stressed that only the collecting agency, whether it’s the FBI, the NSA or the CIA, can unmask the identities of people."

http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/23/politics/trump-health-care/index.html",0,"Republican leaders abruptly pulled their overhaul of the nation’s health-care system from the House floor on Friday, a dramatic defeat for President Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan that leaves a major campaign promise unfulfilled and casts doubt on the Republican Party’s ability to govern. The decision leaves President Barack Obama’s chief domestic achievement in place and raises questions about the GOP’s ability to advance other high-stakes priorities, including tax reform and infrastructure spending. Ryan (R-Wis.) remains without a signature accomplishment as speaker, and the defeat undermines Trump’s image as a skilled dealmaker willing to strike compromises to push his agenda forward.

In an interview with The Washington Post, Trump deflected any responsibility for the setback and instead blamed Democrats. “We couldn’t get one Democratic vote,” he said.

“I don’t blame Paul,” Trump added, referring to Ryan.

Trump said he would not ask Republican leaders to reintroduce the legislation in the coming weeks, and congressional leaders made clear that the bill — known as the American Health Care Act — was dead.

Shortly after the decision, Ryan told reporters his party “came really close today, but we came up short.” He added: “We’re going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.”

“It’s done, DOA,” said Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.), who drafted much of the legislation. “This bill is dead.”

Instead, Republican leaders said, they would wait for the Affordable Care Act to encounter fatal problems, believing that Democrats will then want to work with them to make changes.

“As you know, I’ve been saying for years that the best thing is to let Obamacare explode and then go make a deal with the Democrats and have one unified deal,” Trump said. “And they will come to us, we won’t have to come to them.”

It remains far from certain that Republicans, in control of the White House and both houses of Congress, will be able to credibly foist responsibility for the nation’s health-care woes onto Democrats. What is certain is that Republicans continue to have difficulty turning their campaign promises into legislative action.

For seven years, GOP candidates have pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which expanded Medicaid and created subsidized, state-based exchanges to expand health insurance coverage to 20 million Americans, decrying the taxes and government mandates it enacted.

“Since 2010, every Republican, with the exception of probably a handful, has campaigned from dogcatcher on up that they would do everything they could to repeal and replace Obamacare,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Friday. “To get in and say you’re going to do something else would not be fair to the American people.”

But in that time, the party never coalesced around a consensus alternative to the law, and the scramble to develop one after Trump’s election revealed some of the reasons: Republicans were loath to repeal popular ACA provisions such as a requirement that insurers cover those with preexisting conditions and dependents up to age 26 but wanted to repeal the taxes and the individual mandate to have insurance that helped make those provisions possible.

The policy difficulties were amplified by an ideological cleavage within the House GOP. Conservative hard-liners chafed that the Ryan-drafted bill left too much of the ACA in place and enshrined a federal role in health insurance markets, while moderates feared that cuts to tax subsidies and Medicaid would leave their constituents uncovered and their states with gaping budget gaps.

The drama on Capitol Hill unfolded amid new evidence that public opinion was running against the bill: A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday found that U.S. voters disapproved of the legislation 56 percent to 17 percent, with 26 percent undecided.

Signs of trouble across the Republican spectrum were evident by midday Friday, as lawmakers streamed onto the House floor for a procedural vote.

In one stunning defection, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) announced midday that the bill was “unacceptable” and that changes made late Thursday to placate conservatives “raise serious coverage and cost issues.”

He was joined by rank-and-file members such as Rep. David Joyce (R-Ohio), a low-key appropriator, and Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), a longtime Ryan ally who represents a competitive Northern Virginia congressional district.

But the White House and House leaders both saw the key bloc as the House Freedom Caucus, a group of roughly three dozen hard-line conservatives who made numerous demands of the bill since January — including a flat repeal of the ACA, a major reworking of the GOP bill’s tax incentives and new Medicaid restrictions.

Most of those demands were rejected, primarily due to the political reality of holding a Republican majority together in support of the bill.

The Freedom Caucus chairman, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), became a central player in the negotiations, however, and the group kept an open line to the White House — particularly with chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, who had been one of its founding members. The group made a final demand this week: The bill had to eliminate a set of ACA insurance mandates that, it argued, were a key factor in driving up premiums.

In a Thursday morning White House meeting, Trump made what would be his final offer: The bill would gives states the option to eliminate some of the mandates, 10 “essential health benefits,” but would leave others in place.

That afternoon, the Freedom Caucus met to reject the deal. Hours later, Mulvaney came to a closed-door House GOP conference meeting to deliver a final ultimatum, saying Trump was ready to move on if the bill failed Friday. Afterward, members lined up at microphones to deliver emotional pleas for party unity. Some were veiled critiques of the Freedom Caucus; others were less veiled.

During the midday procedural vote Friday, Ryan asked Meadows if his group had changed its stance. It had not, Meadows told him — meaning as many as 20 hard-liners would oppose the bill. Twenty-two Republican no votes would sink the bill, and more than a dozen other members had announced their opposition by Friday afternoon.

Ryan left shortly after for the White House to tell Trump the bill would fail.

Meadows declined to answer questions after the bill was pulled on Friday. But several Freedom Caucus members said they would not be cowed by Ryan or even Trump — a figure most of them had enthusiastically supported.

“You know what? I came here to do health care right,” said Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.), who was one of six Republicans who voted against the procedural measure.

“A no vote means we save Donald Trump from a Democratic majority in 2019,” said Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.), one of Trump’s most ardent congressional supporters.

The defeat has left the remainder of the Republican governing agenda in Congress in tatters. A proposed corporate tax overhaul favored by Trump and Ryan depended, in part, on the health-care legislation proceeding — creating both political momentum and fiscal space for dramatic action.

Before the bill was pulled Friday, Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) called it the “first big vote in the presidency of Donald Trump,” one that would be “a statement, not just about him and the administration but about the Republican Party and where we’re headed.”

“So much about political power is about perception. And if the perception is that you can’t get your first big initiative done, then that hurts the perceptions down the road about your ability to get other big things done,” Byrne said.

Trump had personally lobbied 120 lawmakers, either in person or on the phone, Spicer told reporters on Friday. The president, he said, had “left everything on the field.”

The White House did not think that defeat would slow other parts of Trump’s agenda, including tax reform and changes to immigration, Spicer added.

Vice President Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price also engaged in last-ditch attempts to win over members Friday — including a midday huddle with Freedom Caucus members at the Capitol Hill Club, a GOP social hall next door to the headquarters of the Republican National Committee.

The heart of the argument made by GOP leaders was that keeping the Affordable Care Act would be a worse outcome than passing a potentially flawed replacement. That worked with some Republicans, but not all.

Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), a Freedom Caucus member who said he would have voted for the bill, rejected the idea that the hard-liners were to blame.

“I thought we were constructive,” he said. “Because of the sensitivity of the issue, some of the normal compromise mechanism didn’t quite get us there. That doesn’t mean they won’t get us there sometime in this Congress.”

At the Capitol, a deflated Ryan said he would confer with fellow Republicans in the coming days about how to proceed, but he made clear health care would no longer be a central agenda item.

“Moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains,” Ryan told reporters. “We’re feeling those growing pains today.”

“Doing big things is hard,” he added.

Trump said he had no problem waiting for Democrats to seek cooperation with Republicans on health care: “I never said I was going to repeal and replace in the first 61 days.”

In fact, Trump said repeatedly as a candidate and before his inauguration that he would work to repeal the ACA on his first day in office.

Democrats, completely sidelined as Republicans quarreled among themselves, quickly disputed Trump’s accusations.

“The blame falls with President Trump and with the Republicans,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.

“So much for the art of the deal,” he added."

In a series of tweets that began in the morning, the president warned that the powerful group of hard-line conservatives who helped block the party’s health-care bill last week would “hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don’t get on the team, & fast.”

The president vowed to “fight them” as well as Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections, a warning that his allies said was intended in the short term to make members of the Freedom Caucus think twice about crossing him again. But Trump’s pledge was met with defiance by many in the bloc, including some members who accused him of succumbing to the establishment in Washington that he had campaigned against.

Later in the day, Trump singled out three of the group's members in another tweet, saying that if Reps. Mark Meadows (N.C.), Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Raúl R. Labrador (Idaho) got on board, ""we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts & reform.""

Most of the roughly three dozen Freedom Caucus members were elected from safe Republican districts, and many of them faced no primary opposition. To make good on his threat, Trump would have to recruit GOP candidates to make the case that the Republican incumbent they face was unhelpful to an un­or­tho­dox, populist president.

Trump’s frustrations with the Freedom Caucus also reflect only part of his challenge in moving legislation, even in a Congress where his party controls both chambers. If Trump does too much to mollify members of the hard-line group, he risks alienating a similar number of more moderate Republicans in districts won or narrowly lost by last year’s Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton.

And on many pieces of Trump’s congressional agenda, he’ll need the support of at least some Democrats, particularly in the Senate, an uncertain prospect given the toxic partisan environment on the Hill.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters a few hours after Trump’s first tweet on Thursday that he sympathized with him.

“I understand the president’s frustration,” Ryan said. “About 90 percent of our conference is for this bill to repeal and replace Obamacare and about 10 percent are not. And that’s not enough to pass a bill.”

Ryan said he had no immediate plans to bring the bill back to the House floor, saying it was “too big of an issue to not get right.”

Trump and his White House advisers have been particularly frustrated by the intransigence of several prominent Freedom Caucus members, led by Meadows.

In White House meetings, Trump lobbied them intensively, only to see the bill collapse last Friday after Meadows and some of his allies said they would not vote for it. The bill also faced strong opposition from a group of moderate Republicans who were concerned it went too far in cutting Medicaid and leaving millions more people without insurance.

“This has been brewing for a while,” a White House official said of Trump’s decision to pressure and possibly target Freedom Caucus members.

“Our view is: There’s nothing as clarifying as the smell of Air Force One jet fuel. So if he needs to bring in the plane and do a rally, he’s going to think about doing that,” said the official, who requested anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly.

The official added that Trump and White House aides are “sick and tired” of seeing Freedom Caucus members on television in recent days.

Trump’s threat comes as Republican leaders are bracing for a month of potential GOP infighting over spending priorities. Congress must pass a spending bill by April 28 to avert a government shutdown.

Beyond that, the same divide that derailed the health-care legislation could imperil the next marquee legislation that Trump wants to tackle: tax reform.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Thursday that Trump remains committed to “a bold and robust agenda,” adding: “He’s going to get the votes from wherever he can.”

Since Friday’s debacle, Trump and his aides have increasingly talked up the possibility of working with Democrats on a reboot of the health-care bill and other priorities — but that prospect has also divided Republicans on Capitol Hill.

In in a CBS News interview that aired Thursday morning, Ryan said he does not want to see Trump have to work with Democrats on revamping the Affordable Care Act — drawing flak from some members of his own party, including Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who said Trump’s bipartisan overtures should be encouraged.

“He’s irritated,” anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist said in explaining Trump’s decision to lash out at Freedom Caucus members. “During the health-care discussions, the Freedom Caucus would say they’d support him if they got one thing, then they’d want another thing. If you’re Trump, you wonder, ‘Why are these people meeting with me if they’re always going to be a ‘no’ vote?’”

If Trump gets involved in Republican primaries, Norquist said he thinks it’s possible he could “get some scalps.”

Though Trump’s national job approval numbers are historically low for a new president, he remains popular in many of the districts where Freedom Caucus members were elected. At the same time, most of those members won a larger percentage of the vote in their districts than Trump did.

On Capitol Hill, Trump’s tweet was met with a range of reactions: Some members said it could prove counterproductive while others praised him for using the power of his office in a way he hasn’t to this point.

Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), who has called for health-insurance reform to work its way through Congress more slowly, said that with Trump’s tweet on Thursday, the president was taking exactly the wrong approach.

“The idea of threatening your way to legislative success may not be the wisest of strategies,” Sanford said Thursday. “His message yesterday was that he wanted to work with Democrats; I guess the message today is, ‘We need to fight against Freedom Caucus members and Democrats.’ . . . It’s a case of shooting messengers who were, rightfully, pointing out problems in a bill that the American public has not shown a proclivity toward.”

Jordan, another Freedom Caucus member, said the break with Trump was based on real policy differences, not a lack of loyalty.

“The president can say what he wants and that’s fine. But we’re focused on the legislation,” Jordan said.

Some of the harshest responses to Trump came via Twitter, his preferred means of provocative communication. Those included a tweet from Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), who said that Trump’s support of the health-care bill signaled he was now part of the Washington elite.

“It didn’t take long for the swamp to drain @realDonaldTrump,” said Amash, a member of the Freedom Caucus and one of Trump’s frequent GOP critics. “No shame, Mr. President. Almost everyone succumbs to the D.C. Establishment.”

Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), a Trump ally, said the president’s focus on the Freedom Caucus was well placed as the White House attempts to steady itself and rethink its congressional coalitions.

Collins, a member of the Tuesday Group, a group of moderate House Republicans, rejected the notion — put forth this week by members of both groups — that there could be an accommodation between them on the health-care bill.

“The Tuesday Group will never meet with the Freedom Caucus, with a capital N-E-V-E-R,” Collins said, spelling out the last word.

Some Republicans said they see potential for Trump forging a governing coalition that includes some Democrats.

“Trump is a New York-type bargainer who wants to get something done,” said Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.). “That approach will give him a lot of room to maneuver on taxes and infrastructure. Once you break the barrier that every bill has to have total Republican support, you can be more creative.”

Michael Steel, who was a senior aide to former House speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), said there is potential in some districts for Trump to dislodge Freedom Caucus members.

“If the president chooses to support primary challengers to House members who’ve been unhelpful, it wouldn’t necessarily be an ideological challenge,” Steel said. “It would be based on loyalty to the president, or lack thereof.”

But Steel added: “You don’t necessarily have to wait for 2018 for this to have an effect.”

There is precedent for Republican leaders taking aim at Freedom Caucus members. A spate of 2015 ads purchased by the American Action Network, a nonprofit issue advocacy group with ties to House GOP leaders, targeted Jordan and two other hard-liners for opposing a Department of Homeland Security funding bill.

Those ads infuriated members of the caucus, then only months old, and spawned a confrontational relationship that culminated in Boehner’s resignation six months later.

One open question is whether the National Republican Congressional Committee, the GOP’s House campaign arm, would intervene on behalf of incumbents targeted by Trump.

Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), the NRCC’s chairman, chuckled Thursday after a reporter read him Trump’s tweet.

“I want to be very clear: We have a policy of helping out incumbents that pay their dues,” Stivers said, referring to the hundreds of thousands of dollars GOP lawmakers are expected to raise for the committee each election cycle. “As long as they pay their dues, we’re gonna be there for them. . . If I was them, I’d take a look and see how I’m doing on my dues.”"

Haley indicated in an interview on CNN's “State of the Union” that the United States does not see a peaceful political resolution for Syria's civil war as long as Assad remains in power.” We don't see a peaceful Syria with Assad in there,” Haley said.

The objective of U.S. policy, she said on NBC's “Meet the Press,” is “to defeat ISIS,” using an acronym for the Islamic State.

“I mean, we've got to do that for peace and stability in the area. It's also to get out the Iranian influence, which we think is causing so much friction and worse issues in the area,” Haley said.

“And then we’ve got to go and make sure that we actually see a leader that will protect his people. And clearly, Assad is not that person,” she added.

But speaking on ABC News' “This Week,” Tillerson said the Syrian people will eventually decide Assad's fate.

Tillerson emphasized the administration's priority in defeating Islamic State forces in Syria and said little about the United States' preference on Assad's future.

“Our priority is first the defeat of ISIS,” Tillerson said. “Once we can eliminate the battle against ISIS, conclude that, and it is going quite well, then we hope to turn our attention to cease-fire agreements between the regime and opposition forces.

“In that regard, we are hopeful that we can work with Russia and use their influence to achieve areas of stabilization throughout Syria and create the conditions for a political process through Geneva in which we can engage all of the parties on the way forward, and it is through that political process that we believe the Syrian people will lawfully be able to decide the fate of Bashar al-Assad,” he added.

The apparent dissonance did not go unnoticed. Speaking later on ABC News, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) criticized Tillerson for suggesting that the objective of defeating the Islamic State can be achieved as long as Assad remains in power.

“This idea that we’re going to get rid of ISIS and then we’ll hopefully use Assad and others to come up with a solution, it’s not going to work,” Rubio said. “There seems to be a difference between what Ambassador Haley is saying, and what she said last night that Assad really has no future, and what I heard this morning from Secretary Tillerson.

“You cannot have a stable Syria without jihadist elements on the ground with Bashar al-Assad in power,” he added. “They're two sides of the same coin.”

In a separate interview on CBS's Face the Nation, Tillerson said it was the goal of the U.S. and its allies to ""navigate a political outcome in which the Syrian people in fact will determine Bashar al-Assad's fate and his legitimacy,"" citing in part ""the United States' own founding principles are self-determination.""

Host John Dickerson said critics of that posture have noted that ""the Syrian people are in no position to make a determination about the president because he's bombing a lot of them, millions of them have had to flee the country, and he's created a condition where there is no institution that can remove him from power.""

""It's important that we keep our priorities straight, and we believe that the first priority is the defeat of ISIS,"" Tillerson replied. ""Once the ISIS threat has been reduced or eliminated, I think we can turn our attention directly to stabilizing the situation in Syria.""

Pressed to reconcile that seeming contradiction between the positions advanced by Tillerson and Haley, national security adviser H.R. McMaster suggested in his appearance on “Fox News Sunday” that there was little daylight between the two views.

“What Ambassador Haley pointed out was, it's very difficult to figure out how a political solution could result from the continuation of the Assad regime,” McMaster said. “We're not saying that we are the ones who are going to effect that change. What we're saying is, other countries have to ask themselves some hard questions. Russia should ask themselves … why are we supporting this murderous regime that is committing mass murder of its own population and using the most heinous weapons available.

“While people are really anxious to find inconsistencies in those statements, they are in fact very consistent in terms of what is the ultimate political objective in Syria,” he added.

Pressed by host Chris Wallace to explain Tillerson's statements that destroying the Islamic State is the U.S. priority, McMaster responded, “That's exactly what we're saying.”

“There has to be a degree of simultaneous activity, as well as sequencing the defeat of ISIS first,” McMaster said. “What you have in Syria is a very destructive cycle of violence perpetuated by ISIS, obviously, but also by this regime and their Iranian and Russian sponsors.

“And the resolution of the conflict will entail both of the elements that you're talking about,” he continued.

But the view of Assad's future as articulated by Haley was the one praised by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a frequent critic of the Trump administration.

“Ambassador Haley just said on your program, 'You'll never end the war with Assad in power,'"" Graham said. “So that means regime change is now the policy of the Trump administration. That's at least what I've heard.”"

http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/17/us/cleveland-facebook-homicide-video/",0,"The man suspected of fatally shooting a 74-year-old, randomly selected target and posting a video of the killing on Facebook committed suicide as police were closing in on him Tuesday, authorities said. Steve W. Stephens — the subject of a nationwide manhunt after Sunday’s horrific slaying in Cleveland reignited a debate about violence in the Internet age — was spotted late Tuesday morning at a McDonald’s in Erie County, Pa.

A restaurant manager told the New York Times that drive-through employees recognized Stephens, phoned police and tried to delay him by holding up his french fries.

“He just took his nuggets and said, ‘I have to go,’” the manager said.

Pennsylvania State Police said they chased him from the McDonald’s for about two miles, finally ramming his car.

“The vehicle spun around — came to a stop,” police Maj. William Teper Jr. said at a news conference. “He immediately pulled a weapon out and shot himself in the car.”

Thus ended a desperate, rapidly expanding search that began Sunday — when a video on Stephens’s Facebook page appeared to show him gunning down Robert Godwin Sr. for no apparent reason.

“We have our closure,” Cleveland Mayor Frank G. Jackson said at a news conference in Ohio.

But Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams probably spoke for many when he said moments later: “We have so many questions.”

Godwin was killed on Easter, as he walked alone down a residential road in east Cleveland, carrying a grocery bag.

He was reportedly collecting aluminum cans, though his family told CNN that he was walking home from a holiday meal when Stephens — 6-foot-1 and 224 pounds, according to police — approached with a cellphone camera.

“I found somebody I’m about to kill,” Stephens said in the live video. “He’s an old dude.”

There was little in Stephens’s history, as told by those who knew him, to suggest the violence he was about to document.

He had no criminal history. He had worked for many years at a children’s behavioral center in Ohio, where he had no red flags in his personnel file, according to the Erie Times-News.

The scene in Pennsylvania after Facebook murder suspect killed himself + 4 After a brief pursuit by state police in Erie County, Steve W. Stephens fatally shot himself, police say.

A neighbor told CNN that he often stayed with his girlfriend and her children in a house outside Cleveland and that he was there two days before the killing, fixing the garage.

But Stephens’s mother told CNN that he’d bid her a cryptic farewell that weekend. He’d said that he was “mad at his girlfriend” and — in a phone call shortly before the killing — that he was “shooting people.”

Authorities say Stephens had never met Godwin before he pulled his Ford Fusion up beside him about 2 p.m.

Stephens approached Godwin. “Can you do me a favor?” Stephens said, as seen in the video. He asked Godwin to say the name “Joy Lane.”

“Joy Lane?” Godwin responded.

“Yeah,” Stephens said. “She’s the reason why this is about to happen to you.”

Stephens then asked Godwin how old he was, raised a gun into the frame and pulled the trigger.

The camera spun around; when the picture came back into focus, Godwin was on the ground.

“I don’t think there’s any rhyme or reason for what happened,” the police chief, Williams, told reporters Monday. “I don’t think there’s anything we can point to specifically to say that this is what sparked this. Only Steve knows that.”

Stephens posted a subsequent video — on his cellphone, telling someone to watch the footage.

“I can’t talk to you right now. I f‑‑‑‑‑ up, man,” he says.

“Dog, I just snapped, dog,” Stephens adds in a video posted by Cleveland.com. “I just killed 13 motherf‑‑‑‑‑‑, man. That’s what I did — I killed 13 people. And I’m about to keep killing until they catch me, f‑‑‑ it. … I’m working on 14 as we speak.”

“She put me at my pushing point, man,” Stephens says, laughing and calling it the “Easter Sunday Joy Lane massacre.”

Police haven’t confirmed any other deaths linked to Stephens, and said they don’t think he had any accomplices.

“We had been in a relationship for several years,” Lane wrote to CBS News, according to the network. “I am sorry that all of this has happened … Steve really is a nice guy … He was kind and loving to me and my children.”

Facebook suspended Stephens’s account minutes after learning of the gruesome video, executives said.

But by then it had circulated for hours, horrifying countless people.

“This is something that should not have been shared around the world. Period,” Cleveland’s police chief said.

The case prompted Facebook to review how quickly and easily its users can report material that violates standards.

“We have more to do here, and we’re reminded of this this week by the tragedy in Cleveland,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a developer conference Tuesday. “We will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening.”

In January, four people in Chicago were accused of attacking an 18-year-old disabled man while broadcasting the assault on Facebook Live.

Three men were shot last year in Norfolk while one was broadcasting live on the website. In 2015, a shooter killed a TV journalist and her cameraman during a live television broadcast before posting his own video of the killing on Facebook.

Other live platforms have been used to broadcast similar videos.

In tears on CNN Monday, one of Godwin’s daughters offered empathy for her father’s accused killer.

“Our father … taught us about God,” Tonya Godwin-Baines said. “How to fear God, how to love God and how to forgive.”

And so, she said, “each one of us forgives the killer, the murderer. We want to wrap our arms around him.”

Police just wanted to find him.

“Whether somebody was harboring him or he was under a bridge somewhere, we don’t know,” Teper, the Pennsylvania police commander, said when it was over.

Authorities issued an arrest warrant on a charge of aggravated murder, put him on the FBI most-wanted listed, and offered up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest — while warning that he was “armed and dangerous.”

Police said they were in contact with Stephens via cellphone early in the investigation, but his last known location before the encounter in Pennsylvania was the site where Godwin was killed.

Hundreds of reports of possible sightings started to pour in from across the country — at a hotel in Washington, for example — nearly all of them inaccurate.

As panic spread, the Cleveland police chief had to dispel false rumors that the city was on lockdown, Cleveland.com reported.

For nearly 48 hours, Stephens essentially vanished from sight — baffling authorities to the point that they began to speculate that he was dead.

“You’re going to see law enforcement activity who knows where,” FBI Special Agent Vicki Anderson told The Washington Post on Tuesday morning.

That same morning, about 100 miles from the balloon-covered fence that marked Godwin’s death, the crew at a McDonald’s in Harborcreek Township outside Erie were setting up for lunch.

The store owner told the Erie Times-News how a drive-through worker called him back, suspecting she’d just rung up nuggets and fries for one of the most wanted men in America.

“He got to the second window of the drive-through,” Thomas DuCharme Jr. said. “We told him he was waiting on his fries for a minute just to kind of buy some time for the cops if it actually was him. He said he had no time to wait, he had to go.”

It’s not clear what brought Stephens to Erie County. Police described the area as remote, rural and full of potential hiding places.

Cleveland.com reported that he’d posted to Facebook about extensive gambling losses at a casino nearby, and police told CNN that he was a regular patron.

In any case, Pennsylvania state police were on the trail of his Ford Fusion by 11 a.m.

They scoured the area for the “Facebook Killer,” and soon spotted Stephens.

At least four troopers gave chase, police said — for about two miles, no faster than 50 mph, until they neared an abandoned school.

One of the patrol cars nudged Stephens’s back wheel, causing it to spin out.

As officers approached, police said, the suspect took his own life.

“We would like to have brought in Steven peacefully and really talk to him and find out why this happened,” said Williams, the Cleveland police chief.

Not everyone thought so.

“All I can say is that I wish he had gone down in a hail of 100 bullets,” Godwin’s daughter Brenda Haymon told CNN.

Drew Harwell, Travis M. Andrews and Fred Barbash contributed to this report, which has been updated numerous times. An earlier version incorrectly identified the suspect’s license plate as well as the year Facebook launched its live-streaming feature."
3922,3922,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/18/why-georgias-big-special-election-is-a-perfect-political-rorschach-test/?utm_term=.5ad708867acd,0,"This post has been updated. It's (special) Election Day in Georgia, when the seemingly endless race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel finally concludes. And with it will surely come all kinds of different takes about what, precisely, the result means. This is what happens when you have only a handful of special elections in small congressional districts between the 2016 and 2018 elections.

Some special election upsets have previewed shifts in power in the next election, but we also need to remember that this is 1 out of 435 congressional districts. What happens in suburban Atlanta may or may not translate to the rest of the country.

And indeed, the district we're talking about Tuesday is highly unusual -- in a way that makes firm predictions based on Tuesday's result quite difficult.

Advertisement

Democrats are fond of pointing out that Georgia's 6th district went for Mitt Romney by 23 points in 2012, the 82nd most Republican district that year, and has gone for other Republicans by similarly large margins in recent years. Republicans, meanwhile, point out that it's a district President Trump won by less than two points in November.

It's exactly the kind of highly educated, suburban district that proved uniquely bad for Trump in November 2016, even as he won. And it would seem unusually ripe for an anti-Trump upset eight months later — much more so than just about any other district on the map.

The 6th district is the bluest one in Georgia on the map below (courtesy of Daily Kos Elections) — signifying one of the biggest shifts toward Democrats in the 2016 presidential election.

In fact, only five out of 435 districts trended more against Republicans in the 2016 presidential election. And four of them were in highly unusual Utah, where many Republicans -- especially Mormons -- voted for independent candidate and Utah native Evan McMullin over Trump.

Here are the top 10 anti-Trump shifts, with Georgia's 6th at No. 6:

District Member Party Clinton margin ’16 Obama margin '12 Pro-Clinton shift UT-03 Jason Chaffetz (R) -23.9 -58.8 34.9 UT-04 Mia Love (R) -6.7 -37 30.3 UT-01 Rob Bishop (R) -27.3 -57 29.7 UT-02 Chris Stewart (R) -14 -38.8 24.8 TX-07 John Culberson (R) 1.4 -21.3 22.7 GA-06 Tom Price (R) -1.5 -23.3 21.8 TX-02 Ted Poe (R) -9.3 -27.3 18 TX-22 Pete Olson (R) -7.9 -25.4 17.5 CA-33 Ted Lieu (D) 41.3 23.8 17.5 TX-32 Pete Sessions (R) 1.9 -15.5 17.4 VA-08 Don Beyer (D) 52.6 35.4 17.2

So if it's a tight race or a modest GOP edge, would that really portend terrible things for Republicans? Or would it instead be a sign that the political map Trump redrew in 2016 might just have some staying power? It could certainly be either.

And the latter may not be such a bad thing for the GOP. Trump, after all, won 30 out of 50 states — 60 percent — and 230 out of 435 congressional districts — about 53 percent of all districts and more than Romney. Trump's ability to bring new white, working-class voters into the GOP fold actually allowed him to compete and win in more territory than Republicans are accustomed to (think Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin). If Republicans are suddenly more competitive in these areas at the expense of losing some ground in highly educated suburbs like those in Georgia's 6th, that may be an okay bargain. (Paul Kane has much more on this for those who are interested.) At the very least, it wouldn't be a shocking result.

And then there's the runoff — and specifically, the unusual setup Georgia uses, in which all candidates run in one primary, and then the top two advance to the final. The first time around, two months ago, Ossoff took 48 percent and Handel took 20 percent, but the crowded GOP field as a whole beat Democrats 51 percent to 49 percent.

History doesn't provide a ton of guidance about how that will shake out one-on-one. The only states with runoffs like this are California, Louisiana and Washington state. FiveThirtyEight ran the numbers in 181 such runoffs since 2008 to see whether Ossoff might still have a shot even if Democrats didn't win a majority of the vote Tuesday. The verdict was yes:

Out of 21 races in our database where a candidate won the plurality in the first round but her party lost the aggregate party vote, the candidate nevertheless won the runoff 11 times. For instance, Republicans combined got more of the vote in Washington’s U.S. Senate primary in 2010 , but Democratic incumbent Patty Murray got the plurality of the vote. Murray went on to win the second round over Republican Dino Rossi. Plugging Ossoff’s numbers into the formula above, we come up with a projection that he’d win the runoff by 4 percentage points.

The last time we saw a similar setup was in the California 50th district special election in 2006. And it was quite similar.

As with today in Georgia, Democrats were thirsty to prove that an unpopular Republican president — then George W. Bush — was a liability jeopardizing his party's midterm hopes by targeting a conservative-leaning district. They united around one candidate, Francine Busby, who led Republican Brian Bilbray 44 to 15 percent on primary day. But the crowded GOP field overall outpaced Busby and the Democrats 53 to 45 — quite similar to what we're seeing in Georgia's 6th. In the June runoff, Democrats narrowed the gap from 8 to 4 points, but still lost.

Another analog is Mississippi's conservative 1st district special election in 2008. There, Democrat Travis Childers led Republican Greg Davis 49-46 in the primary, with Democrats overall leading by 3 points, 51-48. And again, Democrats did better in the runoff, winning by eight.

So there is certainly precedent for a Democrats falling short of a majority but gaining ground in the special election in a tough district. Ossoff will need to gain about two points on his primary showing, while Handel basically needs to hold together all those Republican voters."

http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/29/trumps-first-100-days-ranked-215083",0,"As of this morning, Donald Trump has been president of the United States for 100 days. It's a period of time that has clearly humbled Trump — in his own uniquely Trump way — and also humbled the political establishment. It's caused all of us to continually rethink everything we thought we knew about American politics, in real time, and attempt to adjust.

Yes, 100 days is an arbitrary line, but it's also as good a time as any to step back and reflect on what we and President Trump have been through so far. And given Trump's 100th day falls on a weekend, we thought some light reading was in order.

Below are some winners and losers, with the losers up first.

LOSERS

President Trump

The first 100 days weren't good for Trump, objectively. And judging by his comments about his learning curve, he knows it. He has one signature accomplishment in confirming Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. But he has no significant legislative victories; three of his big executive orders have been halted by the courts; and his approval rating at 100 days is the lowest of any president in the modern era, by double digits. To top it all off, this was a president who promised to do huge things and do them quickly — now he's breaking promises almost weekly.

To pitch Trump's first 100 days as a success, the White House has resorted to citing highly misleading statistics and even bragging about how many executive orders Trump has signed — executive orders that Trump could sign thousands of if he wanted to and that he referred to in the past as the sign of a weak president. That just about says it all.

Paul D. Ryan

The House speaker from Wisconsin, once a Trump skeptic, has certainly been along for the ride over the first 100 days. He has a reputation as a serious policy wonk and was hailed as the one Republican who could unite the party when he agreed to become speaker. Both of those perceived talents have been seriously called into doubt. Ryan's efforts to pass a health-care bill never seemed close to succeeding, and the decision to try to rekindle that failed bill in recent weeks looks like a strange one right now.

It seems as though Ryan is allowing Trump to set the agenda and is doing his best to be a team player. But he's not looking like the skilled and serious politician who came into the speakership with such high hopes. Oh, and he's even more unpopular than Trump, with 29 percent approving of him and 54 percent disapproving, according to Pew.

Democratic unity

Non-interventionism

Remember when Trump was the guy playing up his claimed opposition to the Iraq War and promising to get us out of foreign conflicts so we could focus on “America first”? That same president has now launched unprecedented strikes against the Syrian government, put Iran “on notice,” and engaged in a war of words with North Korea while warning about the very real possibility of a “major, major conflict” there. When Trump struck Syria, he almost seemed mesmerized by the power at his fingertips, recounting how he launched the missiles over dessert (“the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake”) with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Whatever you think of Trump's posture toward adversaries, it's the kind of talk that could one day mean Trump will have to put his military where his mouth is. And that's not really the non-interventionist foreign policy he ran on.

Stephen K. Bannon

There is plenty of legend and lore surrounding Bannon, the former Breitbart News executive who took over Trump's campaign in the general election and then ascended to the post of chief White House strategist. Bannon's nationalist politics and past embrace of the alt-right have made him a controversial and unloved figure — but one that Trump apparently relied upon and trusted. That's now no longer a given, after Trump delivered a rare public rebuke of Bannon and even questioned his importance in the 2016 election. “I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late,” Trump told the New York Post earlier this month. (Ouch.) Bannon is still in the White House, but his role sure seems to be diminished, which was pretty unthinkable 100 days ago.

WINNERS

Obamacare

It turns out all that Trump's predecessor had to do to make Obamacare popular was to leave office and have Republicans prepare to repeal it! The Affordable Care Act has never polled better, with some surveys even showing a majority of Americans approve of it. Even more, the law has proven resilient in the face of GOP efforts to overhaul it. Republicans quickly gave up altogether on repealing it and are now trying to figure out how to replace it — with a somewhat similar, government-oriented alternative. But even that doesn't look likely to happen anytime soon, as both moderate and conservative Republicans balk.

The court returned to its nominal 5-4 conservative majority when Trump nominee Gorsuch was confirmed earlier this month. And in Gorsuch's wake lay the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. Democrats, incensed by the treatment of Obama Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland last year and itching for a fight, opted to try to stop Gorsuch, even though he was the kind of nominee that usually sails through confirmation. The result: The GOP simply continued what Democrats started in 2013 and rolled back the filibuster rules. Now, if a liberal justice retires anytime soon (as seems quite possible), Republicans will need only 50 votes to confirm a justice who could tip the court clearly in their favor for years to come.

Democrats' 2018 hopes



The minority party hasn't yet pulled off a big upset in a special election, but signs are pointing to an animated Democratic voting base and a real chance to seize upon Trump's historic unpopularity in the 2018 midterms. In Kansas, Democrats lost by just seven points in a district Trump carried by 27 points. As the chart below from Daily Kos Elections shows, that's a huge under-performance for the GOP.

And in Georgia, even though Democrat Jon Ossoff didn't win the 6th District House seat outright and avoid a runoff, he approached 50 percent just like Hillary Clinton in a conservative district — one that Republicans who are not named Trump usually win with 60 percent-plus. If Democrats can win these kinds of anti-Trump suburban districts, they'll have a fighting chance to win the majority.

Jared Kushner

The Trump White House is marked by seemingly constant backbiting and infighting, with nobody knowing who will emerge as the most influential advisers. But for now, that appears to be Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, who has asserted power as the embattled Bannon has sunk. We have yet to see Kushner's reportedly more pragmatic, politically moderate worldview come through in Trump's policies, but for now he seems to have Trump's ear. And having Trump's ear means a lot.

Trump's base strategy

Trump is unpopular, yes. He hasn't accomplished what he promised, yes. And things don't seem likely to get easier, either. But he's still in the game. And that's because he's got a base that just won't quit him. A Washington Post-ABC News poll last weekend showed just 2 percent of Trump voters thought he was a worse president than they expected, while 66 percent thought he was a better one. And 96 percent said they'd vote for him again.

Trump has broken his promises on all kinds of things that were important to his base, including prosecuting Clinton over her emails, repealing Obamacare, labeling China a currency manipulator, etc., etc. But while his overall approval rating is bad, having his base intact keeps him powerful in the Republican Party, and that means he can still get things done. Trump's ability to be a successful president in his next 100 days will be highly dependent upon how he leverages that."

By picking the pro-E.U. former economy minister Emmanuel Macron and National Front leader Marine Le Pen to advance to the decisive May 7 runoff, French citizens set up a stark choice. Now there will be a battle between a contender who wants to seal France tight against the tides of globalization and another who seeks to strip away even more barriers with the rest of the world.

The victor could determine whether the international alliances that formed the backbone of the West after World War II will strengthen or be shattered by the force of nationalism. Le Pen has said she will seek to pull France out of the European Union, a move many leaders on the continent think would doom the 28-nation bloc; she also said she would rekindle relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin after years of strife between Russia and the West. Macron has called for a more muscular European Union in which Europe's richest nations would do more to prop up their poorer neighbors.

If Le Pen wins, she will continue a global string of ballot-box revolutions that began last year with the British decision to leave the European Union and continued with the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president. With her fierce anti-immigration agenda and her vow to keep France for the French, she could be a Gallic counterpart to President Trump. But if Macron triumphs — and polls suggest he will, by a 24 percentage point margin — it would be a further barrier to transatlantic disruptions, at least for now, after Dutch voters rejected a far-right leader in March elections.

At the jubilant Macron rally in Paris, the centrist candidate who was Socialist President François Hollande's economy minister told his supporters France would prosper in a revitalized European Union.

“I’ve heard the anger, the fears of the French people, their fear of change,” the 39-year-old Macron said, winking at his cheering audience. “I want to be the president of all patriots against the nationalist threat.”

At Le Pen’s rally in Henin-Beaumont, a northern French town hit hard by factory closures, the modest assortment of soft drinks and snacks gave it more the feeling of a country fair than the celebration of an ascendant presidential campaign — exactly the everyman image Le Pen has sought to project.

“What is at stake in this election is a referendum for or against lawless globalization,” Le Pen told the cheering crowd. “Either you choose in favor of a total lack of rules, without borders, with unlawful competition, the free circulation of terrorists, or you make the choice of a France that protects.

“This is truly what is at stake. It is the survival of France,” she said.

The vote came after a turbulent campaign in which longtime pillars of France's political establishment were either rejected by voters or discredited by scandal. Hollande, the most unpopular of all postwar French presidents, said he would not seek reelection. His most prominent Socialist successor lost to a primary challenger. So did the former center-right president, Nicolas Sarkozy. The early front-runner in the race, François Fillon, a right-wing challenger who sought a Margaret Thatcher-style overhaul of France's economy, fell prey to a nepotism scandal.

See photos of French citizens voting for their new president + 22 In a primary round of voting, French voters selected centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen to move to the election’s final stage on May 7. The results could shape the future of the European Union.

With 97 percent of the vote counted, Macron led the field with 23.9 percent of the vote. Le Pen followed with 21.5 percent.

Many voters said they were opting for the least bad of an unpalatable slate of options.

“I want nobody, and it’s very complicated. I just don’t want to see the extremes,” said Emma Lacour, 42, who voted Sunday in the upscale Saint-Cloud suburb of Paris, where conservatives usually dominate. “I decided two minutes ago, and I’m not very happy,” said Lacour, who was too dispirited to say whom she picked as she walked out of the ornate 19th-century city hall that held the voting station.

Thursday's attack on police officers patrolling Paris's glittering Champs-Elysees boulevard was the final, bloody exclamation point in a campaign that often revolved around fears of terrorism and immigrants. One officer died and two were wounded by a gunman who pledged loyalty to the Islamic State.

Filled with fresh worries about security, voters may have been drawn by Le Pen’s growling message about refugees and terror suspects. Macron, a newcomer who is far more conversant with boardrooms than he is with situation rooms, has sought to boost his security bona fides.

A former investment banker and a product of France’s elite educational institutions, he has described himself as a candidate of neither the left nor the right, and he has never held an elected office. His agenda marries social liberalism with proposals that would dilute France’s traditionally robust protections for workers. And — despite prevailing winds that make pro-E.U. sentiment an unlikely campaign strategy — he has embraced the union and said he wants to make it stronger.

“I’m hoping for the renewal of the French political scene,” said Catherine Grevelink, 56, who oversees legal issues at a bank and voted for Macron in Saint-Cloud. “He’s very intelligent. Now we have to see how this comes out as he governs, if he is president.”

Either of the winning candidates would face questions about governing, since neither has a party structure in France’s Parliament. Macron’s movement is too new to have any lawmakers, and Le Pen would face steep challenges in capturing a majority of the National Assembly in elections scheduled for June 11.

That could potentially be a brake to her more ambitious plans, such as taking France out of the European Union. E.U. membership is enshrined in the constitution, and any change would require approval in both houses of Parliament.

Sunday’s result is a vindication of Le Pen’s years-long strategy to destigmatize her party after decades in which it lurked on France’s far-right fringe. Her father notoriously described the Nazi gas chambers as “a detail” of World War II. But Le Pen, 48, sought to make inroads among France’s large Jewish community and also depicted herself as the single true defender of French workers.

“The laws are there already, but no one applies them, as the attack in Paris showed,” said Martine Le Roy, 62, a retired insurance worker from Henin-Beaumont. She said she was supporting the anti-immigrant, hard-line Le Pen because she was worried about security.

Even as Macron and Le Pen advanced to the next round, the sheer uncertainty in the lead-up to Sunday’s vote was a measure of the unmooring of French political life.

“We’ve had two consecutive presidents, Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, very different orientations, very different policies, but still we have the same economic problems,” said Bruno Cautrès, who studies voting behavior at the Center for Political Research at Sciences Po in Paris. “It has been one of the best arguments of Marine Le Pen: ‘Why not me?’ ”

Although most opinion polls suggest that Macron would win at least 60 percent of a head-to-head vote against Le Pen, an unforeseeable event — such as a large-scale terrorist attack — could shift votes in Le Pen's direction. And the far-left candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who electrified crowds of young voters with his soak-the-rich message, notably held back Sunday from asking his supporters to vote for Macron in the runoff, raising the prospect that some of his boosters — 19.6 percent of Sunday's voters — could stay home or even vote for Le Pen. Backers of other candidates could also swing to Le Pen.

If Le Pen ultimately falls to Macron, she will still have taken the far-right further than any prior candidate in one of Europe’s pillar nations. If her rival is elected but fails to live up to expectations, she could seize the presidency in the next election in five years, analysts said.

“If she does well, she could be even stronger in 2022,” said Jean-Yves Camus, an expert on the French far right at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.

In the health care debate, the president was going to force a House vote on the package and dare skeptical Republicans to vote against replacing Obamacare, before abandoning that plan in the face of defeat.

And now, in the government funding debate, he's backing off his previous demand that Congress approve funding for his border wall. As The Washington Post's Philip Rucker, Robert Costa and David Weigel report:

But with a Friday deadline looming to pass a new spending bill, the Trump administration projected confidence that a shutdown would be avoided. In the face of fierce Democratic opposition to funding the wall’s construction, White House officials signaled Monday that the president may be open to an agreement that includes money for border security if not specifically for a wall, with an emphasis on technology and border agents rather than a structure. Trump showed even more flexibility Monday afternoon, telling conservative journalists in a private meeting that he was open to delaying funding for wall construction until September, a White House official confirmed.

The wall, of course, was the biggest applause line for Trump throughout his campaign — often taking the form of a call-and-response with his approving crowds. And given how divisive it is, inserting it into must-pass legislation like a government funding bill seemed to be the best way to get what Trump wants.

With less than a week to pass a new spending bill, negotiations between the White House, Republicans and Democrats are ramping up to avoid a government shutdown (Video: Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post, Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/The Washington Post)

That's what the White House tried. Office of Management and Budget Chairman Mick Mulvaney said last week that any government-funding bill must include funding for the border wall. Throughout the weekend, top White House aides including Mulvaney suggested Trump might veto a spending bill that doesn't fund his border wall. Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told The Post on Sunday that Trump's insistence on that point remained strong.

Fast forward a little more than 24 hours, and Trump apparently abandoned that demand. With still four days to go in the funding battle, he showed his hard-line stance wasn't so hard-line, after all. Basically, he had his bluff called — again.

Share this article Share

He took what is likely his best chance at getting funding for something he promised to voters dozens upon dozens of times, and he didn't even bring it close to the finish line to make Democrats sweat. Indeed, the likelihood that Congress is going to agree to fund the wall at a later date seems considerably less than it would be this week. Trump has essentially taken his wall and turned it into a metaphorical wall — substituting increased enforcement — rather than a brick-and-mortar one.

This kind of bluffing and having it called is undoubtedly something Trump is used to in the business and real estate worlds. But in the political world, you are negotiating with the same people over and over again. And the lesson of the first two big congressional debates is that when Trump says a bill must contain XYZ, he doesn't really mean it; it's just posturing. And that doesn't bode well for future Trump demands.

During the last government shutdown in 2013, when Republicans demanded defunding Planned Parenthood Obamacare, they were at least willing to follow through on that demand. The government was closed for more than two weeks before the GOP relented. That served notice to Democrats that Republicans were at the very least willing to go all-in on their strategy and follow through — that they weren't bluffing when they made such demands in order for a bill to pass. And that made their threats on other things seem more legitimate.

Trump has shown no such inclination to make it so people take his demands at face value. And given what's happened in the first two legislative debates, the next time he draws a line in the sand, you can bet lawmakers know how easily it can be raked over."

The change is one of several major revisions to the federal tax code that the White House will propose when it provides an outline of the tax-overhaul pitch Trump will make to Congress and the American people as he nears his 100th day in office.

Trump will call for a sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate, from 35 percent to 15 percent. He will also propose lowering the tax rate for millions of small businesses that now file their tax returns under the individual tax code, two people familiar with the plan said.

These companies, often referred to as ""pass throughs"" or S corporations, would be subject to the 15 percent rate proposed for corporations. Many pass throughs are small, family-owned businesses. But they can also be large — such as parts of Trump's own real estate empire or law firms with partners who earn more than a million dollars annually. The White House is expected to pursue safeguards to ensure that companies like law firms can't take advantage of this new tax rate and allow their highly paid partners to pay much lower tax bills.

Trump’s proposed tax changes will not all be rolled out Wednesday. White House officials are also working to develop an expanded Child and Dependent Care Credit, which they hope would benefit low- and middle-income families facing substantial burdens in paying for child care. Trump had touted a tax measure for child care during the campaign, but it was criticized as not significantly benefiting families of modest means.

White House officials think these changes will give Americans and companies more money to spend, expand the economy and create more jobs.

The existing standard deduction Americans can claim is $6,300 for individuals and $12,600 for married couples filing jointly. The precise level of Trump’s new proposal could not be ascertained, but it was significantly higher, the two people said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plan has not yet been made public.

During the campaign, Trump proposed raising the standard deduction to $15,000 for individuals and $30,000 for families.

Like other parts of Trump’s tax proposal, an increase in the standard deduction would lead to a large loss of government revenue.

502 Bad Gateway

A standard deduction works like this: If a couple filing jointly earns $70,000, they deduct $12,600 from their income, adjusting their income to $57,400. They then would pay taxes on the $57,400 in income, not the $70,000 they earned. Increasing the standard deduction would reduce their taxable income, ensuring that they can keep more of their money. A taxpayer who claims the standard deduction cannot also itemize deductions for items such as mortgage interest or charitable giving. But if the standard deduction is large enough, many would be likely to bypass the itemized deduction.

The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated last year that if Trump raised the standard deduction as much as he proposed during the campaign, about 27 million of the 45 million tax filers who itemized their tax breaks in 2017 would instead opt to take the standardized deduction, creating a much simpler process.

This would also match one of the goals outlined by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. He has said that filing taxes has become too complicated for many Americans and that his goal would be for many Americans to be able to file their taxes on a “large postcard.”

White House officials including Vice President Pence also met late Tuesday with congressional leaders and said they wanted to pass a tax-code overhaul through a process known as “reconciliation,” a person familiar with the meeting said, which means they could achieve the changes with only Republican votes.

They also said they were going to push for steep cuts in tax rates but would be willing to raise some new revenue with other changes to the tax code. The White House on Wednesday is expected to reiterate this openness to new revenue without getting into specifics of which tax changes it would seek, as that could create a fierce corporate blowback based on which exemptions could be cut.

Congressional Republicans praised President Trump’s ambitious effort to overhaul the tax code and slash corporate income tax rates to 15 percent.

But they cautioned that some parts of the plan might go too far, illustrating the challenges the president continues to face in his own party as he seeks political support for one of his top domestic priorities.

Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), who head Congress’s tax-writing panels, said they were open to Trump’s plan to push forward with sharp cuts in the rates that businesses pay but suggested that changes might be needed.

“I think the bolder the better in tax reform,” said Brady, who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee. “I’m excited that the president is going for a very ambitious tax plan.”

Hatch, meanwhile, said the White House appears to be “stuck on” the idea that certain small businesses, known as S corporations, should have their tax rates lowered to 15 percent, just like large businesses. S corporations pay the same tax rates that individuals and families pay, with a top rate of close to 40 percent.

“I’m open to good ideas,” Hatch said. “The question is: Is that a good idea.”

Meanwhile, Democrats denounced the 15 percent corporate tax rate and criticized Mnuchin, who said that faster economic growth would generate enough new tax revenue to compensate for the corporate rate cuts.

Asked whether the 15 percent target was workable, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) told reporters: “It is, if you want to blow a hole in the federal budget and cut a whole lot of things like Meals on Wheels and Lake Erie restoration and then lie about the growth rate of the economy.”

He said that the Trump administration would have to do something “huge” such as scrapping mortgage interest deductions, adopting a border adjustment tax or relying on “outrageously inaccurate projections.”

The Trump tax package has won the support of most of the business community, but divisions remain.

The biggest winners from the corporate tax cut would include companies in industries such as retailing, construction and services that have had trouble taking advantage of the loopholes in the existing tax code.

The list of losers from tax reform could include technology companies, domestic oil and gas drillers, utilities and pharmaceutical firms that have been adept at playing the current system by using loopholes to deduct interest payments, expense their equipment and research, and transfer profits to foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Under the Trump plan, many of those tax breaks would be eliminated in return for lowering the rate.

“Retail companies are the ones who pay closest to the rate of 35 percent,” said Len Burman, a fellow and tax expert at the Urban Institute. “They can’t ship their profits overseas. They can’t take advantage of the research and experimentation credit.”

A study of 2016 data for all profitable publicly listed companies by Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, showed that U.S. firms pay vastly different income tax rates.

On average, engineering and construction firms, food wholesalers and publishers paid about 34 percent. At the other end, oil and natural gas companies paid 7 to 8 percent on average.

""The U.S. tax code is filled with all kinds of ornaments"" that help the oil and gas industry, said Damodaran. A decades-old depletion allowance, for example, allows companies to deduct money as a natural resource is produced and sold. This comes on top of other deductions for various expenses.

A Treasury Department study last year based on tax returns for 2007-2011 showed that debt-laden utilities paid only 10 percent in taxes, while construction firms and retailers paid 27 percent.""Retailers pay a higher effective tax rate of any sector in the United States,"" said David French, the head of government relations at the National Retail Federation. ""But the devil is in the details.""

With many key pieces of the Trump tax plan still missing, French is worried that Trump might propose something to offset the lost revenue from cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. A border adjustment tax, such as the one House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) favors, would more than offset the benefits of a rate cut to 15 percent, French said, ""while others would see their taxes go to zero.""

French said that he expects a middle-class tax cut and business tax reform, but he does not expect Trump to unveil a complete package with offsetting items. ""I don't think that's going to be in the president's plan,"" French said. ""I expect it will be big-picture, high-level, without a lot of details.""

""There are so many special interests involved,"" said Ed Yardeni, an investment strategist and president of Yardeni Research. ""This is going to be a real test of whether he's going to be able to drain the swamp or whether he's going to pump more water in.""

Among the other big losers could be companies such as utilities or cable companies that have accumulated large debts and currently can deduct interest payments. A lower tax rate would make those tax deductions less useful.

In a report to investors in December, a team of JPMorgan analysts said that ""we see reform to the corporate tax code as currently envisioned . . . as an overall net negative"" for big utilities. The analysts said that because the utilities had large amounts of debt, they would be hurt more than other companies.

A big corporate tax cut could also create a crisis for individual income taxes. Without a matching cut in individual income tax rates, individuals would be able to change the structure of their pay checks so that the payments went through limited liability companies that would pay no more than 15 percent under the business tax cut, a rate far lower than the top individual rate of 39.6 percent.

That's similar to what basketball coach Bill Self did after Kansas exempted entrepreneurs from paying taxes and eliminated the business tax. Self, the coach of the University of Kansas Jayhawks, put about 90 percent of his pay package into a corporate entity to sidestep the taxes he would have paid if it were all considered simply salary, according to a report by radio station KCUR-FM.

""Whenever a lower rate is imposed on one kind of economic activity versus another, that low-rate activity all of a sudden becomes a lot more important,"" Burman said. ""A lot of tax sheltering was done to make ordinary income look like capital gains.""

He added, ""An associate professor in the Kansas philosophy department probably pays a higher tax rate than Bill Self.""

But if Trump cuts individual income taxes to match the cut in corporate rates, that would create an enormous shortfall in tax revenue and a ballooning of the budget deficit."

http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/03/politics/trump-religious-liberty-executive-order/",0,"NEW YORK — President Trump’s new executive order was the talk of the night at a gala Thursday for religious freedom advocates at the Pierre Hotel, located just blocks from Trump Tower. Sipping cocktails and eating crab cake and salmon hors d’oeuvres, guests appeared divided over whether Trump’s order should be viewed as a clear win or a steep disappointment.

Seated under dimmed chandeliers, many advocates said their expectations were high, since Trump has repeatedly promised he would champion Christians’ religious freedom. Instead, several people at a dinner hosted by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty said the text of the order doesn’t accomplish very much at all.

Earlier this week, many advocates believed that the order would contain language included in an early draft leaked in February. The early draft included grant exemptions for religious believers, schools and corporations to federal laws they disagree with, including LGBT and abortion rights laws. Instead, Trump said he would target the Johnson Amendment, a law that effectively bars politicking from the pulpit. The move was praised by several evangelical pastors who have been supportive of him, but Trump’s decision frustrated many people at the gala.

“It’s irrelevant, it’s offensive, it’s ignored by churches anyway,” said Robert P. George, a Princeton University professor who is well respected in this crowd. “He got enthusiasm in return for getting nothing.”

This annual event of more than 500 people draws some of the “who’s who” in religious freedom advocacy, especially Catholics and evangelicals but also some Muslims, Sikhs, Mormons and Jews. The Becket Fund was behind the high-profile Supreme Court case involving Hobby Lobby, which fought the Obama administration on an Obamacare mandate to cover contraceptives.

The firm has also defended Little Sisters of the Poor on the same contraception issue, and a Becket Fund lawyer who has worked on the case said she was pleased with Thursday’s order. During a reception Thursday at the Rose Garden, Trump told the nuns, “Your long ordeal will soon be over, okay?”

A spokeswoman for the nuns said they were nervous when it appeared last week that the Justice Department didn’t seem to be changing direction on the mandate yet, but she said they were pleased with Trump’s words and the executive order.

“We’re taking him at his word until we can’t,” spokeswoman Constance Veit said. “We have to be happy with every step forward.”

But others at the gala were not thrilled with the order. One of the guests, Ryan Anderson, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, was planning to attend the Rose Garden ceremony in which Trump signed the order, but he decided against it once he learned what the text would be.

“For the people in this room, the Johnson Amendment is not a priority,” he said. “We should say thank you, but [what the executive order does] should have been totally expected.”

Several religious freedom experts and observers said Thursday they don’t expect the executive order to change anything.

The Johnson Amendment is so rarely enforced that the language in the executive order about free speech is practically meaningless, said John Inazu, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis.

“For a stark contrast, think about the immediate consequences to real people of Trump’s immigration order,” Inazu said in an email. The provision that could affect the Little Sisters of the Poor instructs agencies to “consider issuing amended regulations,” something Trump didn’t need an executive order to do.

The executive order doesn’t hint that pastors should be allowed to endorse from the pulpit, said Douglas Laycock, a professor at University of Virginia Law and an expert on religious freedom. It suggests churches should not be found guilty of implied endorsements where secular organizations would not be, but Laycock says he doesn’t hear of stories where that has happened.

“But the IRS does jawbone churches in a way that it does not appear to jawbone secular nonprofits. Maybe that’s what it’s supposed to be about,” he wrote in an email. “The three agencies will likely do something for the Little Sisters, but no one knows what, and this order in itself does nothing.”

In his Rose Garden remarks, said Charles Haynes, a religious freedom expert at the Newseum, Trump appeared to misunderstand the current IRS regulations to mean that religious leaders are kept from speaking about political or public policy issues. Religious leaders can endorse candidates or parties, but they can’t do it from the pulpit or in the name of the church.

The executive order tells various Cabinet secretaries to come up with regulations protecting religious liberty consistent with current law but it doesn’t necessarily change the status quo, which Haynes described as “all talk and no action.”

“President Trump may think theatrics in the Rose Garden will satisfy his base, but somehow I doubt it,” Haynes said.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which many might expect would oppose the executive order, said Thursday that it had no plans to file a lawsuit. The ACLU’s executive director, Anthony Romero, said in a statement that the order was “an elaborate photo-op with no discernible policy outcome.”

At Thursday’s gala, evangelical author and radio host Eric Metaxas, who endorsed Trump, threw up his hands and said he didn’t know what to think about the executive order. The order had pleased many evangelical pastors who had dinner with the president and key members of his staff on Wednesday night where he first announced his plans.

The order shows how Trump delivers on his campaign promises, said Franklin Graham, president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan’s Purse. Graham’s ministries were audited by the IRS four years ago after they took out ads urging people to support political candidates who believe marriage should be reserved for a man and a woman. Speaking by telephone Thursday, Graham said he won’t change the way he runs his ministries, but he sees that as “protection” from the IRS.

“We should not be muzzled for speaking out on political issues just because we’re people of faith,” he said. Like other religious conservatives, Graham said that while he would like to see more protections for business owners, he was pleased with Thursday’s outcome.

“Could more be done? Yes. I think we’ll take what we can take when we can get it,” Graham said. “Eighty percent is better than nothing.”

Graham called African American churches “smart” because “they just ignored that amendment all together. They’ve been having politicians in their pulpits for years,” he said. “White pastors should’ve just ignored it but they didn’t.”

According a 2016 survey the Pew Research Center, just 14 percent of Americans heard their clergy speak for or against a candidate last spring or summer, compared with 29 percent of black Protestants who had heard their clergy speak out directly about specific political candidates.

Eugene F. Rivers III, a black Pentecostal minister in Boston who was attending Thursday’s gala, said the Johnson Amendment has not been on the list of pastors’ concerns. Defending religious freedoms of the black church, which serves the poor in many communities across the country, should be a priority, said Rivers, who is director of the Seymour Institute for Black Church and Policy Studies. Rivers said religious groups were treated like “useful idiots” during the Obama administration, but he wasn’t thrilled with this particular executive order either.

“While we understand the political motivation of our white evangelical brothers, there’s probably a more sophisticated approach to religious freedom,” Rivers said.

Now he has to figure out how to govern from there. Macron's victory on Sunday as a 39-year-old political newcomer who enjoyed no party backing and faced a wave of populist anger was improbable enough.

But the task he began confronting Monday is even more difficult. He must figure out how to translate the poetry of a campaign built on borrowing the best ideas from either end of the political spectrum into the prose of governing in a way that doesn’t alienate everyone.

At stake is not only his presidency and the future of a nation of 67 million, but also mainstream politics across the Western world. By thoroughly defeating far-right leader Marine Le Pen, Macron instantly became a symbol among those in Europe and North America who are seeking a new style of politics that can break the populist fever.

If he fails to govern effectively from the middle, the extremes could soon rise again.

“It’s a huge challenge,” said Dominique Moïsi, a senior adviser at the Paris-based Institut Montaigne, a think tank that is close to Macron. “He’s trying to renew politics, to do it in a different way. I think he can pull it off. But there’s no doubt it will be difficult.”

Macron will have little time to figure out his strategy. He's due to be inaugurated Sunday and will barely have the chance to unpack bags at the ElyseePalace before he once again hits the campaign trail.

This time, Macron will be advocating not for himself but for the 577 representatives of his movement seeking seats in National Assembly elections next month.

Their fate and Macron’s are intimately linked. Without a parliamentary majority, or something close to it, France’s new president will have little chance of enacting his ambitious agenda. A poor showing in next month’s vote could doom his young government before it really even starts.

Normally, the parliamentary vote that follows a presidential election in France is considered something of a formality — a chance for voters to reiterate their choice and give the president the legislative backing he needs. But not this year.

After a bruising and fragmented campaign — Macron won less than a quarter of the vote in the first round, and most supporters said they were voting against his opponent rather than for him in the second round — it’s not clear whether voters will want to give him a free hand.

There’s also the problem that Macron’s movement — En Marche, or Onward — is starting from zero, not having existed the last time France chose its lawmakers.

The party will now have to select its candidates — without overly relying on the entrenched political clique that Macron railed against during his campaign.

“There’s a contradiction in Macronism. He wants to renew the way we do politics. But for now those who support him are politicians who have been in the game for a while,” said Eddy Fougier, a researcher at the Institute for International Relations and Strategies. “He’s trying to make something new out of the old.”

Fougier said En Marche candidates would likely end up being a combination of familiar political names, as moderate lawmakers from the traditional center-right and center-left parties defect to Macron, and political newcomers from civil society.

Richard Ferrand, secretary general of En Marche, told journalists on Monday that the party would announce the names of its candidates Thursday. Half will be women, he said, and half will have never held elected office.

Ferrand now represents the Socialist Party in Parliament, but said he would run this year under Macron’s banner.

Macron himself was the economy minister under Socialist President François Hollande. But too many ex-Socialists, Fougier said, would be politically fatal for Macron, who must prove to voters that he’s not “the second coming of Hollande.”

That was the charge that Le Pen leveled at her opponent throughout the campaign. For months, Macron carefully avoided any association with his deeply unpopular former mentor.

But on Monday it was unavoidable. A raucous celebration among Macron supporters Sunday night — which also served as a pep rally for the European Union — gave way Monday morning to a somber procession on the Champs-Elysees as the nation remembered its war dead on Victory in Europe day.

Macron and Hollande together laid a wreath, with the outgoing president making time to pat Macron on the back and offer an apparently heartfelt ""Bravo"" — a sentiment echoed by leaders from around the world, including Russian President Vladi­mir Putin.

In a message to Macron — who has taken a tough line with Moscow, and whose campaign was the victim of a suspected Russian hacking attack in the campaign’s closing hours — Putin urged the president-elect to “overcome mutual distrust” and wished him “strong health.”

President Trump congratulated Macron in a phone call Monday, the White House said, and the two agreed to meet at the May 25 NATO gathering in Brussels.

But domestically, the bon­homie of Macron’s win was already giving way to the usual bare-knuckled politics.

Le Pen, for one, had barely finished conceding defeat in the presidential race Sunday night when she announced her party would be the “primary force of opposition” to Macron’s government. (She did, however, take at least a little time off from politics, shimmying with supporters to the tune of the Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.”)

The remnants of the Socialists will also be gunning for Macron in the parliamentary vote. So, too, will the center-right Republican party, which was widely expected to win the presidency this year before its candidate, former prime minister François Fillon, stumbled badly. Polls show the party is Macron’s closest challenger in the parliamentary vote.

Once lawmakers have been elected, Macron will start pushing the agenda he campaigned on. With anything less than an En Marche majority in the multi­party Parliament, he’ll have to opportunistically seek out allies across the aisle to avoid gridlock.

Macron’s platform includes elements designed to appeal to either side of the political spectrum: smaller class sizes in public schools and a shift to cleaner energy sources to satisfy the left; sharp reductions in government bureaucracy and a more flexible labor system to appeal to the right.

The latter will be especially important to Macron’s success. The president-elect has said that loosening the country’s notoriously rigid employment system will be key to unlocking greater economic growth and ultimately bringing down chronically high levels of joblessness.

But his push for reform could provoke an early showdown with France’s influential labor unions — as Macron knows well from his earlier tangles with the unions as economy minister.

Many observers are betting against the new president’s ability to deliver. But Moïsi, the analyst whose think tank is close to Macron, said that especially after the last election, no one should be too quick to count him out.

""He has cards to play: his character, his timing, the fact that the global economy, especially in Europe, is picking up,"" Moïsi said. ""The French are politically ready for sacrifices and reforms as long as there's someone in Elysee Palace with credibility, energy and optimism. There's a dynamic behind him that may carry him through.""

http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/03/politics/obamacare-pre-existing-conditions/",0,"Republicans have settled on a bold, new strategy for not replacing Obamacare. They're making the moderates in their caucus kill their plan instead of the ultra-conservatives. And it's working! Now this plan might seem strange when Republicans have spent the last seven years acting like Obamacare was the worst thing to happen to the country since the British burned down the White House in 1814. But it's a little less so if you listen to what their individual members are actually saying.

Some Republicans, you see, are philosophically opposed to the very idea of Obamacare giving health insurance to the poor and sick, while others are only politically opposed to the idea of a president named Obama doing so. If anything, they think that Obamacare doesn't go far enough to keep deductibles down. Which, as I've said before, means that the GOP is stuck in an old Woody Allen joke: It thinks the problem with Obamacare, metaphorically speaking, is that the food is terrible and the portions are too small. Good luck putting those together.

Not that it's stopped Republicans from trying. The first version of their plan was just a tax cut masquerading as a health-care proposal that still somehow managed to alienate both the center and right wing of their party. It would have slashed taxes by $1 trillion over a decade and paid for that by chopping $839 billion off of Medicaid and $300 billion off of Obamacare's subsidies, which themselves would have been reconfigured to help the young and affluent at the expense of the old and poor. And it had no chance of passing. That's because the 24 million people the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates would have lost coverage as a result were enough to scare off GOP moderates, and the fact that it would have kept all of Obamacare's protections for the sick in place was enough to tick off the far-right House Freedom Caucus. They think the best way to lower premiums for healthy people is to increase them for sick people.

So they went back to the drawing board. The second edition of their plan was — stop me if you've heard this before — just a tax cut masquerading as a health-care proposal that still somehow managed to alienate both the center and right wing of their party. The only difference from before is that it would have allowed insurance companies to sell plans that didn't cover things like mental health, maternity care, prescription drugs and hospitalizations. This still wasn't enough to get the House Freedom Caucus on board, though, because letting insurance companies sell plans that didn't cover these ""essential benefits"" without letting them discriminate against the sick would mean that only the sick would want those benefits — making them unaffordable for everybody.

So they got even more familiar with the drawing board. The latest iteration of their plan is just a tax cut masquerading as a health-care proposal — but one that has managed to alienate just the center and not the right wing of the party. Finally, a breakthrough. They were able to do this while keeping the same basic framework — the one that would cost 24 million people their coverage — by saying that states could now opt out of all of Obamacare's regulations. Insurance companies would once again be allowed to make plans unaffordable for the sick and unusable for the rest. And that might have the added bonus, as the Brookings Institution's Matthew Fiedler points out, of undermining protections against catastrophic costs in not only the individual market but also the employer-based one. This is the liberty the House Freedom Caucus wants.

It's no surprise, then, that moderate Republicans who didn't like this bill when it ""only"" took health insurance away from the old and poor don't like it any more now that it would take health insurance away from the sick as well. Enough of them are already against it that it almost certainly won't pass. Which brings us to the GOP's two fundamental laws of health care. The first is that Republicans can't get the far right's support without losing the center right's — and vice versa — so that no matter what they do, they can't pass a bill. And the second is that the only Obamacare replacement GOP moderates would support is, yes, Obamacare. If you want people with preexisting conditions to be able to get covered — and they do now — then you either have to have the government do so directly or use a combination of carrots and sticks in the form of subsidies and mandates to get the private sector to. There's no conservative alternative to Obamacare, in other words, because Obamacare is the conservative alternative.

That's why it's only a matter of time until Republicans settle on an even bolder and newer strategy for not replacing Obamacare: admitting that, for many of them, the only real problem with the law was its name."

Secretary of State Brian Kemp, an immigration hard-liner who won Trump’s support less than a week before the vote, defeated Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle in a runoff that resonated loudly beyond the state’s borders. Kemp led Cagle by more than 2 to 1, with most of the votes tallied.

“We had the momentum in this race, but those endorsements by the president and the vice president poured gasoline on the fire,” Kemp said in his victory speech.

Kemp advances to a showdown against Democratic Party nominee Stacey Abrams, who, if she wins, will be the first female African American governor of any state. The victory by Kemp instantly turned the general election race into a sharp contrast capturing the cultural, racial and political divides that have gripped the country in the Trump era — all in a rapidly diversifying state.

With both parties trying to put their best foot forward for November's general election, here are five things to watch in this summer's preliminary elections. (Video: Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post, Photo: Chuck Burton/The Washington Post)

In a morning tweet, Trump congratulated Kemp on his “very big win” and launched a broadside against Abrams, calling her “crime loving” and “weak” on the military, among other things.

Congratulations to Brian Kemp on your very big win in Georgia last night. Wow, 69-30, those are big numbers. Now go win against the open border, crime loving opponent that the Democrats have given you. She is weak on Vets, the Military and the 2nd Amendment. Win! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2018

Abrams soon fired back on Twitter, saying she was “proud to join the company” of three other Democrats — Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, Sen. Doug Jones (Ala.) and Rep. Conor Lamb (Pa.) — whom Trump had “campaigned against all the way to victory.”

Kemp’s victory served as the latest indication of Trump’s dominance in the Republican Party. His endorsement has proved to be a valuable commodity in primaries from the Deep South to the Northeast in recent months.

In Georgia, however, Republicans were left to ponder whether Trump was strengthening the party’s hand ahead of the November election or weakening it. Kemp ran as a Trump-style conservative in a state where the president only narrowly eclipsed the 50 percent mark in 2016. The president’s move put him at odds with many Republican elected officials, including outgoing Gov. Nathan Deal, who backed Cagle.

Cagle conceded the race to Kemp just 90 minutes after polls closed. “I committed to him my full, undivided support,” he said.

As voters headed to the polls Tuesday morning, Trump reiterated his choice, tweeting: “Today is the day to vote for Brian Kemp. Will be great for Georgia, full Endorsement!”

The president first gave his political blessing to Kemp last Wednesday, backing the candidate running as a self-described “politically incorrect conservative .” Over the weekend, Vice President Pence flew to the state to campaign for Kemp, arguing that he would “bring the kind of leadership to the statehouse that President Donald Trump has brought to the White House.”

The White House imprimatur came as a blow to Cagle, the longtime favorite for the nomination. He finished first in the May 22 primary, but his edge faded in a contest that was shaped by embarrassing audio recordings, accusations of “fake news” and Trump’s involvement.

As he navigated his way through the crowded primary, with rivals tagging him as the “establishment” candidate, Cagle made moves to appease the right, including a fight to punish Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines for its criticism of the National Rifle Association, as well as support for a tax break for private schools in an effort to weaken another candidate for governor.

That became a genuine controversy in June, when conservative gubernatorial challenger Clay Tippins released a recording of Cagle admitting that he had backed the measure specifically to hurt a third candidate, Hunter Hill.

“It ain’t about public policy. It’s about . . . politics. There’s a group that was getting ready to put $3 million behind Hunter Hill,” Cagle said on the recording. “Is it bad public policy? Between you and me, it is.”

Cagle began to dip in the polls after that recording was aired; Hill would go on to endorse Kemp as the candidate who “won’t sell public policy to the highest bidder.” And Tippins wasn’t done, wounding Cagle again with audio of the front-runner saying that Kemp was running to be the “craziest” candidate in the race.

“It sounds like Casey Cagle’s gotten like Hillary Clinton,” Kemp told reporters this month. “I would ask all those crazies to vote Brian Kemp for governor in the Republican runoff.”

Kemp has eagerly waded into the culture wars in his campaign, running ads bragging that liberals did not like it when he stood for the national anthem or displayed his guns.

In perhaps his most famous spot, released before the first round of voting, Kemp boasted about having a big truck — “just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take them home myself.”

Cagle fought back by portraying himself as the true conservative in the race. In his final attack ad, he accused Kemp, who has been secretary of state for eight years, of “20 years of failure.” In another ad, Cagle was pictured rallying a crowd of conservatives — a few wearing “Make America Great Again” caps — against the negative stories.

“Dirty tricks and fake news are what we’ve come to expect,” Cagle said. “I’ll never apologize for outlawing sanctuary cities or for stopping liberals from taking the values that make our country great.”

Georgia Republicans have held the governor’s mansion since 2003, with legislative majorities that have made Democrats largely irrelevant in state politics. But the smash-mouth nature of the contest has emboldened Democrats, who think that the GOP’s race to the right will alienate the suburban voters who are drifting away from the party in the Trump era.

“The race for #GAGov may change, but our values never will,” Abrams tweeted after Kemp’s win. “Service, faith & family guide our vision for GA: Affordable health care. Excellent public schools for every child. An economy that works for all.”

Abrams has raised a hefty $6 million for the race — nearly $3 million of it since winning the primary. Trump’s 50.44 percent share of the vote in the 2016 election was the lowest for a Republican presidential nominee in two decades. Democrats have increased their share of the vote since then in local elections.

A former minority leader of the Georgia House, she won the Democratic primary while surrounding herself with leaders representing women, labor, the LGBT community and causes on the left — predicting at one rally that a rising coalition of minorities and liberal whites would “turn the state of Georgia, and the nation, blue again.”

Georgia’s Hispanic population has grown to nearly 10 percent of the state’s, according to a recent Census Bureau estimate. African Americans make up nearly a third of the state’s population.

Kemp and fellow Republicans on Tuesday started accelerating efforts to tie Abrams to national Democratic figures, including former presidential nominee Clinton. Their strategy is in line with the GOP’s playbook in other states that Trump won.

Further down the ballot Tuesday, Democrats were picking nominees in two suburban Atlanta congressional districts that were crafted to elect Republicans but swung away from the president’s party in 2016.

In the 7th Congressional District, former congressional aide Carolyn Bourdeaux defeated education company chief executive David Kim for the right to challenge Rep. Rob Woodall (R). In the 6th Congressional District, where first-time candidate Jon Ossoff lost a close special election last year, gun-control activist Lucy McBath defeated Kevin Abel.

Until 2016, neither district was particularly competitive. While Rep. Karen Handel (R) defeated Ossoff in the 6th District, Trump won just 48.3 percent of the vote there and just 51.1 percent in the 7th District — down from the 60 percent that Mitt Romney had won in both districts in 2012."

The E.U. retaliated on June 22 with levies on iconic U.S. goods such as bourbon and Harley-Davidson motorcycles — and Mr. Trump raised the ante by threatening a 25 percent tariff on European auto imports. All the while, he pursued tariffs against other trading partners such as Canada, China and Mexico, which were striking back against U.S. agricultural and industrial goods produced in heartland states where Republican senators and members of Congress face difficult midterm elections. It did not help Mr. Trump’s cause that U.S.-based auto manufacturers who would purportedly benefit from tariff protection did not want it — and said so loud and clear . The administration’s proposal to hand farm country a $12 billion trade-war bailout also fell flat , with Republican senators chorusing their opposition.

With U.S. industry, U.S. agriculture, long-standing European trading partners and members of his own party all telling Mr. Trump to cool it, he did something he rarely does — listen. The “deal” the president trumpeted on Wednesday in the company of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was his face-saving off-ramp. It amounts to little more than a mutual promise to talk about reducing trade barriers on both sides of the Atlantic, and to impose no new ones in the meantime. Tariffs on industrial goods other than autos would be targeted for elimination. Europe embellished it with a pledge to buy more American soybeans, thus offsetting China’s tariffs on that product, and to import more U.S. natural gas in the distant future. Considering that the negotiating agenda Mr. Trump and Mr. Juncker sketched resembles the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership that President Barack Obama tried to launch with Europe, you could almost say that all Mr. Trump has to show for his trade war with the European “foe” is a return to his predecessor’s policy, plus some beans."
4010,4010,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/08/01/trump-is-leading-a-hate-movement-against-the-media/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d01bfdc82ca6,0,"THE MORNING PLUM: When the owner of a Virginia restaurant asked the White House press secretary to leave out of dismay over the administration’s policies, the civility refs threw a blizzard of flags onto the field. The refrain was that, no matter how deeply felt our political differences may be, keeping the litigation of those differences civil is essential to preventing our political life from spiraling into dysfunction.

On Tuesday, CNN’s Jim Acosta — one of President Trump’s favorite human targets — and other members of the media were abused and heckled by Trump supporters at a rally in Florida. Videos of the event — see here or here — show the crowd at one point loudly chanting “CNN sucks,” with many angrily brandishing middle fingers in the direction of the living, breathing members of the press corps.

Advertisement

Trump’s son, Eric Trump, tweeted out video of the “CNN sucks” chant, with the hashtag #Truth, while directly singling out Acosta. And the president himself retweeted his son. The president’s son is actively encouraging Trump supporters to direct rage and abuse toward working journalists, and the president is joining in, helping to spread the word.

You might think it reeks of “whataboutism” to juxtapose this event with the expulsion of Sarah Huckabee Sanders. On the contrary, I’d like to argue that both these events belong in the same category: They both were the direct result of Trump’s nonstop and very deliberate efforts to provoke as much rage and division as he can, in as many quarters as he can. The profound imbalance and asymmetry revealed by the juxtaposition of the two situations is the real story here.

After the Tampa rally, Acosta worried aloud that all this anger could result in “somebody getting hurt.” We don’t know whether it will come to that, but it is impossible to watch those videos without concluding that it’s a serious possibility. The president commands an enormous megaphone. Instead of concluding that such an outcome is to be avoided, and recognizing a responsibility as the bearer of that megaphone to use his influence to make that so, he is actively stoking the anger, with nonstop attacks on the press for the simple act of holding his administration accountable, and now, by approvingly drawing attention to one of the most flagrant displays of it yet.

Jay Rosen calls all of this a “hate movement against journalists” that is essential to Trump’s political style, and urges them to recognize it as such. And Trump’s approving retweet of his son does appear to confirm that he believes all this anger benefits him politically, probably by energizing and consolidating the base heading into the midterms.

But we should expand that point to note that Trump plainly sees political gain in provocation on as many fronts as possible. When Trump pardoned former sheriff Joe Arpaio despite his lawless and racist civil rights abuses, Trump had grown persuaded that it was “a way of pleasing his political base.” When Trump refused to unambiguously condemn white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, choosing instead to stoke racial tensions further, Stephen K. Bannon candidly declared that those tensions would help Trump politically.

There can be no doubt that Trump sees benefit in riling up his supporters with decisions like those, regardless of the anger that it unleashes on the other side. Indeed, that anger, coming from the “right” people, the liberals and the elitists, is useful, because it further provokes the anger of his own supporters. At a minimum, we know Trump recognizes no institutional responsibility to try to dial down these tensions where possible. Indeed, it’s worse: The deliberate goal, as Bannon has put it, is “to throw gasoline on the resistance.”

The provocations, of course, also take the form of policy, with severe human consequences: Trump’s hard-line immigration agenda is spreading fear and suffering in immigrant communities, and lest you think this is merely rooted in good-faith differences over how to handle immigration enforcement, Trump also layers the ritual dehumanization of immigrants on top of that cruelty. All this has crystallized in his horrible family separation policy, and even here, Trump reportedly claimed that “my people love it.”

The asymmetry is the story

You cannot seriously assess the relative civility of both sides of the Trumpian divide without placing these full-scale and calculated provocations, coming from the very top, front and center. As acts of civil disobedience go, the Sanders expulsion was relatively restrained, a use of very limited clout to protest the powerful, that is, to protest a presidency and an agenda that is provoking widespread fury and deep, searing tensions along multiple cultural and racial fault lines — again, in many cases deliberately.

Indeed, when Sanders was asked to leave, the exchange was reportedly civil. The real tell came after, as Brian Beutler points out: The White House whipped up a campaign of retributive rage at the restaurant owner. Whether you agree with the expulsion or not, the White House took deliberate action to turn it into a major and divisive cultural event, in a manner similar to Trump’s multiple other provocations.

Advertisement

The Acosta affair reveals that the asymmetry here is the story. Trump is now actively encouraging his supporters to direct their fury and abuse toward those whose institutional role is to hold the powerful accountable. Early on in this presidency, the savvy response to Trump’s assaults on the press was to treat them as mere gamesmanship: Trump doesn’t really mean any of this; it’s all a big show; behind the scenes, our media and political elites are just as chummy as ever. That comfortable illusion stopped being sustainable long ago. Now the possibility cannot be dismissed that it could end up getting shattered more violently than we expect.

* TRUMP’S TRADE WAR SET TO ESCALATE AGAIN: Bloomberg News reports that Trump officials may ratchet up the tariffs on China:

Officials are considering more than doubling planned tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports, people familiar with the deliberations said. The U.S. had threatened an additional $200 billion with levies of 10 percent, a level the administration may raise to 25 percent in a Federal Register notice in coming days, one of the people said.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is in talks with Chinese officials to find a way out, but as Bloomberg notes, this represents “yet another increase in tension.” Trump’s totally got this.

* CHINA VOWS RETALIATION: Reuters reports on the Chinese response:

“If the United States takes further escalatory steps, China will inevitably take countermeasures and we will resolutely protect our legitimate rights,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing. Investors fear an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing could hit global growth.

As it is, Chinese retaliatory tariffs are already directly aimed at industries with many jobs in counties carried by Trump. This is likely to get worse.

* TRUMP MAY SLASH REFUGEE LEVELS AGAIN: The New York Times reports that Trump administration officials are mulling a cut in refugee levels from 45,000 to as low as 20,000:

A “migration crisis” was gripping the country, [one] official said, and the administration was instead prioritizing asylum cases in which a person is already in the United States and claims a credible fear of returning home. … The official noted that there was a backlog of 700,000 asylum cases, asserting that “most asylum seekers are illegal immigrants,” and that there were high costs and “enormous security challenges” in admitting people to the United States on humanitarian grounds.

A “migration crisis,” eh? This rationale should come under intense scrutiny, and as always, it’s likely the real rationale is just to keep as many refugees out as possible.

* TRUMP ISN’T TAKING RUSSIAN SABOTAGE SERIOUSLY: The Associated Press reports that Trump is facing increasing criticism for not taking the prospect of Russian sabotage of the midterm elections seriously enough:

Republicans and Democrats have criticized the administration’s response as fragmented, without enough coordination across federal agencies. … Trump himself rarely talks about the issue. And in the nearly two years since Russians were found to have hacked into U.S. election systems and manipulated social media to influence public opinion, the White House has held two meetings on election security.

And in his refusal to take this seriously, Trump is in direct contradiction of his own director of national intelligence.

* DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING ON HEALTH CARE: Margot Sanger-Katz has a good piece reporting that Democratic senators in tough races, and numerous Democratic House candidates, are relentlessly talking to audiences about Obamacare’s protections for preexisting conditions:

After the Republicans’ failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Democrats have detected a newfound concern that the consumer protections established under the law might go away. And that fear has turned into a potent campaign theme. … The issue is coming up in House races across the country. … Analysis of television ads through May from the Wesleyan Media Project found that health care was the most common subject of Democratic campaign ads.

But wait, didn’t the pundits tell us that Democrats are running only on anti-Trump hatred?

* TRUMP LIES … AND LIES … AND LIES: The Post fact-checking team updates its grand tally, and now calculates that Trump has now made 4,229 false or misleading claims:

The average number of claims per day keeps climbing the longer Trump stays in office. In fact, in June and July, the president averaged 16 claims a day. Put another way: In his first year as president, Trump made 2,140 false or misleading claims. Now, just six months later, he has almost doubled that total."

U.S. District Court Judge Robert S. Lasnik granted a temporary restraining order Tuesday night barring a trove of downloadable information about creating the do-it-yourself weapons.

Eight attorneys general and the District of Columbia argued that the instructions posed a national security threat. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) on Tuesday also issued a cease-and-desist order against the man who was scheduled to post them online.

“In a major victory for common sense and public safety, a federal judge just granted our request for a nationwide temporary restraining order — blocking the Trump administration from allowing the distribution of materials to easily 3-D print guns,” New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said in a statement. “As we argued in the suit we filed yesterday, it is — simply — crazy to give criminals the tools to build untraceable, undetectable 3-D printed guns at the touch of a button. Yet that’s exactly what the Trump administration decided to allow.”

Josh Blackman, a lawyer who represents Cody Wilson, the founder of the nonprofit that planned to post the instructions, said the restraining order violates protected First Amendment rights.

“We were disappointed in the ruling and view it as a massive prior restraint of free speech,” Blackman said.

Lasnik will hold a hearing on Aug. 10 to determine whether the order should be made permanent.

The legislative and legal maneuvers aimed to prevent Defense Distributed, a Texas nonprofit organization, from posting the schematics for 3-D-printed guns on the Internet. The firearms, which are mostly made of plastic, are untraceable because they do not have serial numbers, would not require a background check to print and are easily destroyed after use. The available blueprints include guides for making guns akin to assault-style rifles such as AR-15s and AR-10s, a pistol called the Liberator, and a Ruger 10/22.

The technology could herald an era of DIY guns that can be produced — and amassed — in secret.

The Pennsylvania attorney general also sued Defense Distributed on Sunday, and the company agreed to temporarily block Pennsylvania users from its website. Democrats in the House and Senate also filed legislation that would in effect ban guns constructed from 3-D-printed material.

But despite the efforts, some of the plans went online Friday, according to Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. He said about 1,000 people had, within days, already downloaded 3-D plans for AR-15 semiautomatic rifles. Defense Distributed agreed not to upload new files.

In a tweet, President Trump said the guns do not “seem to make much sense.” Trump said he is “looking into” the guns’ availability and said he spoke with the National Rifle Association.

Deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters Tuesday that it is illegal to own or make a “wholly plastic gun of any kind,” including on a 3-D printer. Gidley said that the administration supports the law and that it “will continue to look at all options available to us to do what is necessary to protect Americans while also supporting the First and Second Amendments. . . . The President is committed to the safety and security of all Americans and considers this his highest responsibility.”

Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement that many have “wrongly claimed” that 3-D printing will lead to the production and “widespread proliferation” of undetectable plastic guns.

“Regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the Internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years,” Cox said, noting that federal law makes it “unlawful to manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer or receive an undetectable firearm.”

It is legal to make a firearm for personal use without a license, though some — such as those that have short barrels, for example — require a tax payment and advance approval from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It is illegal to make a gun from 10 or more imported parts, and it is illegal to make guns that can’t be detected by metal detectors or X-ray machines.

The battle over the blueprints started in 2013, when Cody Wilson, the founder of Defense Distributed, made the first fully 3-D-printed pistol and posted the design files online. The federal government alleged that violated federal law. Uploading the files, it argued, was tantamount to an illegal export of firearms.

Wilson sued, and the federal government shocked all involved by reversing its position. It settled with Wilson on June 29, agreeing to pay $40,000 in legal fees and exempting the company from the regulations, allowing it to post the blueprints online. His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday night’s ruling.

Twenty-one attorneys general signed a letter asking Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to withdraw from the settlement and block the plans from going online.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said U.S. citizens have been legally able to download the files for years and that the State Department was involved because it controls access to U.S. defense technology.

Wilson has maintained that this is a First Amendment case, claiming that the government’s attempts to block the publication of the information on the Web amounts to prior restraint barred by Supreme Court precedent. Blackman, Wilson’s attorney, compared the state government’s attempts to block his client’s website to the Pentagon Papers case, in which the Nixon administration unsuccessfully tried to stop the New York Times and The Washington Post from publishing the contents of a leaked Vietnam War report.

Nauert said the Justice Department recommended that the case settle because it would probably be lost on First Amendment grounds.

Wilson filed suit against the New Jersey attorney general and the Los Angeles city attorney in recent days, arguing that his case is about “access to information,” not gun regulations.

A group of gun-control groups filed suit trying to block publication of the schematics; their case was thrown out by a federal judge.

Opponents blamed the Trump administration for allowing them to go online.

“.@POTUS has imperiled the lives of untold numbers of innocent children, teachers, religious worshippers, movie-goers, and music lovers, not to mention bystanders. Plastic guns are untraceable, undetectable, and uncontrollable. These inevitable deaths will be on his hands,” said Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), who was shot five times in the Jonestown massacre in 1978.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she believes that Congress needs to take action on the guns.

“This is a dangerous development, and the idea of allowing terrorists and criminals to be able to manufacture their own firearms using 3-D printers is very serious,” she said.

Correction: An earlier version of this article reported that it is legal to make a firearm for personal use without a license if one makes a tax payment and gets advance approval from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Only some homemade guns require a tax payment and advance approval. The article has been updated."

But economists cautioned that the higher growth is probably a blip. The economy expanded at an annualized rate of 4.1 percent from April to June, the fastest growth since the third quarter of 2014 and a sharp jump from the first three months of the year, when the economy grew at a tepid 2.2 percent rate, according to the Commerce Department.

Trump cheered the numbers Friday, holding an impromptu news conference outside the White House, touting the “amazing” growth from his tax and trade policies.

“We’re going to get a lot higher than these numbers and these are great numbers,” Trump said, flanked by his economic team. “We are now on track to hit an average GDP annual growth of over 3 percent and it could be substantially over 3 percent.”

Most independent economists say this quarter’s growth was juiced by stimulus from the trillion-dollar tax cut and a one-time rush by foreign companies to stock up on U.S. goods before Trump’s trade war escalated and tariffs kicked in on many products. Consumer spending was also solid.

But the widespread expectation is that growth will be significantly lower in the third and fourth quarters, probably falling short of Trump’s 3 percent goal for the year.

“The bottom line takeaway is that this growth is not sustainable and it will slow in the second half of the year,” said Lakshman Achuthan, co-founder of the Economic Cycle Research Institute. “President Trump should celebrate this number because it is going to ease from here.”

The federal government will release its initial estimate of third quarter growth Oct. 26, just 11 days before voters go to the polls, making it a key test of whether high growth appears to be sustainable.

“Trump has to be careful not to overhype this. There are still areas of the country that have not fully come back and that’s Trump’s constituency,” said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. “Wage growth has been anemic.”

Although many economists warn that Trump’s trade war will hurt U.S. growth, they say it temporarily boosted growth in the spring as foreign firms rushed to make purchases before the tariffs took effect. Exports added more than a percentage point to growth, something that hasn’t happened in years and is unlikely to repeat.

Soybean exports exploded in the second quarter, as customers in several countries scrambled to snatch up supplies before new foreign taxes on U.S. soybeans went into effect, part of a broad retaliation against Trump’s tariffs on a range of foreign products.

Economists expect the ongoing trade war to curtail growth later this year as foreign companies buy less from the United States.

Trump said the higher growth will carry on.

“These numbers are very, very sustainable,” he said Friday. “This isn’t a one-time shot.”

The Trump administration has repeatedly predicted growth will be 3 percent a year for years to come, a projection most mainstream economists see as overly optimistic.

The Federal Reserve predicts annual growth will be 2.8 percent this year, fall back to 2.4 percent in 2019, and drop to 2 percent in 2020 as the stimulus from the tax cuts and added government spending fade.

Trump cast the growth under his administration as far stronger than what occurred under Barack Obama or George W. Bush, but the data does not back that up.

“Over the last 12 months, the economy has grown by 2.8 percent, which is a bit better than it has done recently, but is in no way the strongest growth during this expansion,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. The U.S. economy grew by 2.9 percent in 2015 and 2006, and more than 3 percent in 2004 and 2005.

Economists say the encouraging part of Friday’s report is that the fiscal stimulus does appear to be driving more Americans to buy things, as expected.

“Trump deserves some credit. It’s unmistakable the tax bill and regulatory changes fed into this,” said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a Republican and former director of the Congressional Budget Office.

Personal consumption was strong in the second quarter, probably aided by the reduction in taxes for many Americans and the increase in optimism about the economy, especially among Republicans.

“While we always expected a bounce back in consumption, it was more powerful than anticipated and speaks to the impact of an increasingly tight labor market and strong job growth on consumer income and household’s confidence,” said Brian Coulton, chief economist at the ratings agency Fitch.

Business investment in equipment and structures was also positive, although the lion’s share of the growth was coming from Americans opening their wallets. A bump in federal government spending also added to the pickup in growth this spring as Congress approved additional money for the military and domestic programs.

But many economists expect economic growth to slow."

He's stating official White House policy. The White House just made that abundantly clear. Four times in two days, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was offered the opportunity by reporters to clarify whether the president really thinks journalists are the enemy of Americans, or that it's wrong for people to harass journalists doing their job. It wouldn't be the first time an official White House statement contradicted something the president said or tweeted.

But four times in two days, Sanders refused to say that the media is not the enemy of the people or to condemn people who heckled a CNN reporter Tuesday in Tampa, to the point where he feared someone was going to get hurt.

Just a sample of the sad scene we faced at the Trump rally in Tampa. I’m very worried that the hostility whipped up by Trump and some in conservative media will result in somebody getting hurt. We should not treat our fellow Americans this way. The press is not the enemy. pic.twitter.com/IhSRw5Ui3R — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) August 1, 2018

Instead, the White House press secretary ticked off a list of sometimes-inaccurate and sometimes-unrelated grievances about how these hyperpartisan times have affected her life and the president's life, and why they blame journalists for that.

“The media continues to ratchet up the verbal assault against the president and everyone in his administration,” Sanders said.

Basically: The White House thinks that journalists are the enemy of the people.

I don't need to get into here why this is a problem; that's Democracy 101.

But it's worth spending a moment on where we are, both because having this debate in the first place is not normal and because it is shaping up to be a front line in the political battle between right and left in 2018.

In a week full of tension between journalists and Trump and Trump supporters, the most heady moment so far came Thursday, when the journalist at the center of so many attacks from the right (including from the president himself), CNN's Jim Acosta, twice asked Sanders if she would say that the media is not the enemy of the people.

He was following up on an earlier question in the briefing about how Ivanka Trump said she doesn't agree with her father that the press is the country's enemy. Trump later tried to square her statement with his own by claiming he doesn't think all media is the enemy, just most of it.

""... [I]t would be a good thing if you were to say right here at this briefing that the press — the people who are gathered in this room right now, doing their jobs every day, asking questions of the people like the ones you brought forward earlier — are not the enemy of the people,” Acosta said. “I think we deserve that.”

Instead, Sanders looked down at her notes and appeared to read a prepared statement about her perceived grievances with the media; how, among other things, she was cruelly made fun of by a comedian at the 2018 White House Correspondents' Association dinner. (The association said Michelle Wolf's performance “was not in the spirit"" of the mission of promoting the free press.)

I mention Sanders reading from her notes because it's a telling detail that she had something ready to go on this. It suggests she knew that she was going to be asked about Trump's views on the media, she had talked about it with the president, and they decided not to back down, even on the basic question of whether the media contributes a public good to U.S. democracy.

Not that her response was a surprise. On Wednesday, a reporter asked Sanders if she would condemn the heckling of Acosta at Trump's rally. The president tweeted the heckling to his 53.5 million followers.

Rather than denounce what happened to Acosta, Sanders used that opportunity to rip the media. She didn't help her contention when she seized on a debunked story about the hunt for Osama bin Laden.

Acosta tried again. His question is worth sharing in full because it felt like a moment that may stand out in the dozens of daily contentious moments between the Trump White House and journalists:

You did not say in the course of your remarks you just made that the press is not the enemy of the people. Are we to take it from what you just said — we all get put through the ringer, we all get put in the meat grinder in this town, and you're no exception. I'm sorry that happened to you; I wish that would not have happened — but for the sake of this room, the people who are in this room, this democracy, this country, all the people around the world who are watching, what are you saying Sarah, and the White House for the United States of America, the president of the United States should not refer to us as the enemy of the American people. His own daughter acknowledged that and all I'm asking you to do, Sarah, is to acknowledge that right now and right here.

Sanders did not take him up on that: “I appreciate your passion, I share it. I addressed this question, I addressed my personal feelings. I'm here to speak on behalf of the president. He's made his comments clear.”

Acosta walked out of the press briefing before it was over. He was downright exasperated.

I walked out of the end of that briefing because I am totally saddened by what just happened. Sarah Sanders was repeatedly given a chance to say the press is not the enemy and she wouldn't do it. Shameful. — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) August 2, 2018

Bashing the media to gain leverage with one's supporters is a tactic as old as American politics. But Trump has taken it to new heights by using language that dictators of history also have seize on. He's exploited heavy public skepticism in journalism to cast journalists as the main villains when things go wrong in his administration. As The Fix's Eugene Scott wrote after a man gunned down journalists at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis in June:

Those disinclined to trust the media get reinforcement when highly influential politicians and partisan media figures elevate the critiques, sometimes making personal jabs at journalists’ motives and their character. What may start as a difference of opinion eventually becomes a direct assault on the humanity of those in the media — something that those following press freedom issues have witnessed in other parts of the world.

A sitting Republican senator, Jeff Flake (Ariz.), started out 2018 by comparing Trump to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin over his attacks on the media.

At the same time, there is less room for journalists to make mistakes now that Trump has made them a central character in his own political story. On Wednesday a Politico reporter apologized for calling the Trump supporters cursing out Acosta “garbage people.” His apology made national headlines."

Cindy Laporta said that in 2015, Manafort’s right-hand man, Rick Gates, told her his boss couldn’t afford to pay his taxes. To ease that burden, she said, Gates instructed her to misrepresent $900,000 in income as a business loan.

“I had a couple of choices at that point,” Laporta said. “I could have refused to file the tax return,” which she said could lead to litigation with Manafort’s firm.

“I could have called Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates liars,” she said. “But Mr. Manafort was a longtime client of the firm and I did not want to do that, either.”

Laporta, who testified after she was granted immunity, said “I very much regret” the decision to go along with a plan that she estimated saved Manafort at least $400,000 in taxes.

It was the fourth day of trial in a packed federal courtroom in Alexandria in which Manafort, President Trump’s onetime campaign chairman, is fighting bank and tax fraud charges. Prosecutors allege he failed to pay taxes on millions of dollars he made from his work for a Russia-friendly Ukrainian political party, then lied about his income to get loans when the cash stopped coming in.

Manafort, wearing a blue suit, blue shirt and purple tie, looked engaged during Friday’s proceedings — sometimes taking notes, sometimes looking at the attorneys or witnesses and sometimes staring straight ahead.

Laporta, the accountant, described a conference call with Gates in which he said Manafort could not afford to pay his taxes and discussed the possibility of reducing them by reporting a loan from an entity in Cyprus called Telmar Investments that prosecutors contend Manafort controlled. Laporta testified she did not believe such a loan actually existed.

Laporta said she asked Gates for a record of the loan and he provided a two-page document that bore what she said was Manafort’s signature.

She testified that she also helped Manafort obtain millions of dolllars in loans fraudulently, including by representing rental property as a second home, sending a bank a loan-forgiveness letter she believed to be forged, and telling another bank that Manafort expected a $2.4 million payment when she had “no idea” if that was true.

Defense attorneys have sought to cast Manafort as a dupe of his business partner, Gates, who was accused in the same indictment as Manafort and has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and lying to the FBI.

Prosecutors hoped to convince jurors that Manafort, not his business partner, his bookkeeper or anyone else, was primarily responsible for alleged tax dodges and bank fraud.

Earlier Friday, another of Manafort’s accountants took the stand, and a prosecutor asked him who among Manafort’s circle was in charge of financial decisions.

Share this article Share

The tax preparer, Philip Ayliff, replied decisively: “Mr. Manafort.”

Assistant U.S. Attorney Uzo Asonye drilled into what Ayliff knew about the relationship between Manafort and Gates. Ayliff said Gates was “working closely with Mr. Manafort,” and was Manafort’s “right hand” adviser.

Asonye guided jurors through the details of the alleged tax fraud, showing them Manafort’s personal and business tax returns. Even as testimony turned complicated, the jurors appeared to pay careful attention. Several took copious notes in black notebooks, and virtually all looked at the monitors in front of them as attorneys zoomed in on portions of documents they sought to highlight.

During recent years, Manafort reported making healthy incomes — $504,744 in 2010; $3,071,409 in 2011; $5,361,007 in 2012; $1,910,928 in 2013; $2,984,210 in 2014. But prosecutors say he was making millions more from his work in Ukraine, stashing it in foreign bank accounts and using it to buy luxuries such as a now infamous $15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket.

Asonye flashed the tax returns, one by one, in front of the jurors, asking Ayliff in relation to each: How many foreign bank accounts did Manafort report having?

“None,” Ayliff said, as the exercise was repeated five times.

The prosecution turned to emails to show Manafort’s failure to report the bank accounts was no mere mistake. One 2011 email showed Ayliff asking Manafort whether he had any interest in a foreign bank account. Manafort responded that he did not. Ayliff testified that his firm relied on the representations of Gates and Manafort, and that the men never told him of the foreign accounts.

Under defense cross-examination, Ayliff acknowledged that reporting requirements for foreign bank accounts can be complicated. Lead defense attorney Kevin Downing pointed to emails about a foreign telecommunications firm in which Manafort invested but over which he had no decision-making authority. His accountants determined that his investment was not large enough to trigger foreign bank account reporting requirements.

“Did you have difficulty getting information?” Downing asked.

“Yes,” Ayliff said.

“Primarily that information was provided by Mr. Gates, is that correct?” Downing asked.

“Yes,” Ayliff said.

Downing displayed a financial document that featured large block letters at the top: “This is a loan … per Rick Gates call.”

The trial is expected to resume Monday afternoon."

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/08/02/france-outlaws-catcalling-gender-based-harassment-fines/895550002/",0,"In July, video footage from a shocking scene recorded on CCTV in Paris went viral. A 22-year-old student is walking close to her house when a man calls out to her in front of a cafe with outdoor seating. She briefly keeps walking, then turns around to confront him. And then he slaps her across the face.

The student, Marie Laguerre, published the footage on her Twitter account and wrote that she was hit by the man “because I responded to his harassment.” Some restaurant patrons jumped up in response to his behavior, but the man walked away.

In the aftermath of that incident, French lawmakers passed a bill this week that bans gender-based harassment, both on the streets and on public transit, in an effort to prevent such incidents from occurring. The law also implemented a fining system: Perpetrators could pay the equivalent of $105 to around $875, depending on the case.

The bill is part of a larger government push to curb harassment, which included implementing initial $105 fines for street harassment in March.

But as Washington Post correspondent James McAuley reported this week, support for the new measures was fueled by France grappling with its own #MeToo movement over the past year, which included a social media campaign that encouraged French women to name their harassers publicly.

The law passed this week is not only about street harassment. The legislation includes new protections for rape victims under age 15 by introducing the idea of “abuse of vulnerability.”

Last year, a French court acquitted a man accused of raping an 11-year-old girl because it could not determine that she had been forced into the act or threatened with violence. Another similar incident took place in February, prompting widespread calls for changes to provisions that advocates said did not do enough to protect minors.

Under the terms of the new law, taking photos under someone's clothes without permission will also be punishable by a fine of more than $17,000. The practice is commonly referred to as “upskirting.”

But Laguerre told the Associated Press that the law is “almost a joke” and won't do enough to put an end to predatory behavior on France's streets.

“I don’t think it’s realistic because it means having police officers on every street,” she said."

Trump also has threatened to pull the clearance of Bruce Ohr, a senior Justice Department official, a move that former officials said would amount to an unprecedented attack on career civil servants and mark a significant escalation in the president’s campaign to retaliate against his real and perceived critics.

If Brennan files suit, Trump said, “it will then be very easy to get all of his records, texts, emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did, but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt.”

In revoking Brennan’s clearance last week, Trump accused the longtime intelligence officer of abusing his status by criticizing the administration. The president later acknowledged in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he had moved against Brennan in part because of his role in the beginning of the investigation into whether Trump’s campaign conspired with the Russian government. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is now leading that inquiry.

Brennan has long been among Trump’s most vocal critics, questioning his fitness for office and even his loyalty to the United States when he called Trump “treasonous” for his attitude toward Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Helsinki last month.

But even former officials who would not countenance Brennan’s choice of words have rushed to defend his right to use them. Not since dozens of former national security officials questioned Trump’s credentials during the 2016 campaign have so many from their ranks taken a stand against him, accusing him of an assault on basic democratic values. ​

Trump’s tweet on Monday came as a bipartisan outcry over his revocation of Brennan’s security clearance continued to grow, with the release of a statement of opposition signed by more than 175 people who had held a wide range of national security jobs. Several dozen former CIA officers, as well as former directors who served under presidents of both parties, had signed public letters of opposition.

“Whether people agree with Brennan or not, everyone seems to agree he has a right to speak his mind,” said Nick Shapiro, a former CIA deputy chief of staff and current Brennan spokesman, who signed one of the letters last week.

Trump was said to be relishing the outrage of so many former officials, many of whom, he has told advisers, didn’t vote for him.

“He loves this fight,” a senior White House official said.

Anne Gruner, a former CIA analyst and senior manager who voted for Trump, said she added her name to the list because the president is jeopardizing national security by trying to intimidate current and former officials into silence.

Gruner said that revoking the clearance of an actively serving official such as Ohr could send a particular chill through the national security bureaucracy and might lead analysts not to share important information with the president if they thought it would upset him.

“The cardinal rule for CIA analysts is to ‘speak truth to power.’ But the president’s actions make that riskier,” she said.

Officials have prepared the paperwork to revoke more clearances. But within the White House there were signs that support for the president’s attacks is waning.

Share this article Share

Donald McGahn, the White House legal counsel, has expressed some qualms internally about the clearance revocations, and John Bolton, the national security adviser, and John Eisenberg, the legal adviser for the National Security Council, have not been involved in the clearance decisions, according to White House officials who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

McGahn has argued that the White House should have a formal process for revoking a clearance, rather than taking action solely at the president’s command and without a specific accusation of violating rules about protecting classified information, the officials said.

Advertisement

White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly also has expressed concern about revoking more clearances, the officials said.

“There isn’t a lot of support for going past Brennan,” said a senior White House official, who noted particular resistance to pulling Ohr’s because he is a current Justice Department official.

“You can defend Brennan if you watch him on TV and see how out there he is,” one of these people said. “It gets tougher after that.”

Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, introduced legislation Monday that would prohibit federal money from being used to revoke a clearance, except for reasons spelled out in existing regulations. It is unclear whether the measure, which Warner offered as an amendment to a Defense Department spending bill being debated this week, will get a vote.

For former officials, such as Brennan, keeping a security clearance lets them consult with current leaders about national security matters, lending their perspective or explaining how they handled a particular challenge. But it does not give them unfettered access to classified information. As it is for current employees, access is based on the “need to know” about a particular program or operation, experts said.

Trump has alleged that Brennan “leveraged his status as a former high-ranking official with access to highly sensitive information to make a series of unfounded and outrageous allegations — wild outbursts on the Internet and television — about this administration,” according to a statement read last week by the White House press secretary.

Trump also has said that clearances have become moneymakers. He has lately taken aim at Ohr and his wife, a Russia specialist who has done some work for Fusion GPS, the firm behind a dossier on Trump’s Russia ties that has been part of the counterintelligence investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign.

“Will Bruce Ohr, whose family received big money for helping to create the phony, dirty and discredited Dossier, ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions ‘Justice’ Department?” he wrote on Twitter. “A total joke!”

National security experts and lawyers have said that Trump has the power to grant and deny clearances as he sees fit. But in taking away Brennan’s, Trump offered no evidence that Brennan had violated the terms of his lifelong agreements to protect classified information — agreements that bind him as a former CIA officer even if he doesn’t have a clearance.

“The president is using an important tool of national security for political ends, and to punish a critic,” said David S. Cohen, who served as Brennan’s deputy at the CIA. “I think that crosses two lines. It’s the politicization of national security. And it’s an insult to what people in the national security community have dedicated themselves to defend, the right to free expression.”

4115,4115,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/08/22/what-might-michael-cohen-tell-robert-mueller/?utm_term=.57ae5f7ef5b5,0,"This article has been updated. In the hours after Donald Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to various crimes on Tuesday, his attorney Lanny Davis appeared on a number of television shows and granted other interviews centered on a common theme: Cohen has information that could be of interest to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.

This isn’t by itself surprising, of course. Cohen served the Trump Organization for years and Trump directly during the campaign and for some months afterward. Cohen has already implicated Trump in efforts to violate campaign finance laws to cover up affairs in which Trump allegedly participated. That he might be willing and able to implicate him in other ways comes as little shock.

The question, though, is how. What information might Cohen possess that could help Mueller better understand how the Trump campaign might have interacted with Russian interference efforts in 2016?

The hints from Cohen and his allies

During his media blitz, Davis made one consistent claim. On MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” Davis said Cohen had “knowledge about the computer crime of hacking and whether or not Mr. Trump knew ahead of time about that crime and even cheered it on.” To The Washington Post, Davis elaborated somewhat: “If there is a conversation and a plan for there to be dirt on Hillary Clinton, and then someone knows the way you’re willing to get the dirt is a Russian agent called WikiLeaks . . . and then WikiLeaks hacks into an email account, which is a crime, then you have committed a crime of conspiracy.”

Advertisement

This is all vague, which could be (as Davis claims) to protect attorney-client privilege and could be (as skeptics might claim) because Davis — a Democrat and Clinton ally — wants Mueller to give Cohen a deal in which the threat of prison time is removed. The assertion to Maddow could simply result in a statement like, “No, Trump didn’t know about the hacking, though he did publicly cheer it on in a news conference.” The claim Davis made to our Isaac Stanley-Becker about WikiLeaks includes an allegation about possible hacking by WikiLeaks, which comes from way out of the blue.

Regardless, maybe Cohen knows that Trump knew more about hacking efforts earlier than he has claimed. Hard to say from Davis’s comments — but it’s also not hard to believe that he might have.

We know, too, that Cohen has alleged (through intermediaries) that he has information about Trump being aware of the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in advance. That allegation emerged late last month and would be important for reasons that extend beyond revealing Trump as having lied about his awareness of the meeting. Experts who’ve spoken with The Post note that it’s illegal for a campaign to accept things of value from a foreign actor, including negative information about a political opponent. It’s illegal, too, to solicit any such valuable thing, a prohibition that includes being aware of and encouraging a contribution. If Trump knew about the meeting, he could be accused of having participated in a criminal conspiracy.

It’s very unlikely Trump would be indicted on such a charge, especially given how speculative it is. It’s worth noting that Cohen’s presentation of what happened during the campaign falls into the same category: His revealing that Trump was intimately involved in decisions to pay hush money to the president’s alleged mistresses almost certainly wouldn’t result in criminal charges.

We can speculate in all sorts of ways about what Cohen might be able to offer. He was centrally involved in many decision made by Trump before and after the campaign. Real estate deals, business arrangements, possibly other agreements with other individuals over the years. Cohen may be more knowledgeable about certain parts of Trump’s finances than Trump’s accountants or than is revealed in Trump’s tax returns. It’s hard to know.

Remember, too, that Cohen’s testimony to Mueller would be important for another reason: It would add a new layer of understanding to a lot of what has been asserted by other witnesses. Cohen could describe his interactions with Trump before the Trump Tower meeting in a way that makes clear that other witnesses had lied to investigators from the FBI, giving them new leverage over those witnesses to try to get to the truth about what the campaign was up to.

Or maybe Cohen knows something even more squarely in Mueller’s purview.

What the dossier alleges

Cohen is a prominent figure in the dossier of reports written by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, which was first published by BuzzFeed last year. This dossier has become a focal point of questions about Russian interference and any cooperation the Trump campaign may have provided. Trump’s defenders justifiably point out that the dossier is full of allegations for which there’s no outside evidence. It is, in short, a collection of things Steele heard from his sources meant to spur further investigation.

In the context of this week’s developments, it’s worth walking through what Steele’s reports indicate about Cohen and the extent to which any of the assertions have been validated.

Advertisement

Cohen, the reports claim, played “a key role in the secret TRUMP campaign/Kremlin relationship.” The documents allege that Cohen stepped into the role of primary liaison with Russia in August 2016 after Paul Manafort resigned from the campaign following new reports about his relationship with a pro-Russian politician in Ukraine. Cohen, a report from October reads, “was heavily engaged in a cover up and damage limitation operation in the attempt to prevent the full details of [Trump’s] relationship with Russia being exposed.”

Per “a Kremlin insider” who spoke with Steele, Cohen met with “Kremlin representatives” in August or September of that year in Prague. That alleged meeting may have taken place at Rossotrudnichestvo, a Russian center for science and culture in the city. Attendees may have included Konstantin Kosachev, a member of the upper chamber of Russia’s legislature, and Oleg Solodukhin, who works for Rossotrudnichestvo. Steele’s reports indicate that the meeting was originally supposed to be in Moscow, but that was judged too risky.

Another report indicates that Cohen was accompanied by “3 colleagues” to the meeting. The agenda included questions about how “deniable cash payments were to be made to hackers who had worked in Europe under Kremlin direction against the [Hillary Clinton] campaign and various contingencies for covering up these operations and Moscow’s secret liaison with the [Trump] team more generally.” The dossier alleges that Cohen was aware of a company that had targeted Democratic leaders by planting bugs and stealing data. In the meeting, the two sides allegedly agreed to protect that operation and to have “Romanian hackers” be paid off and cease their work.

We can overlay any number of theories onto this presentation of what might have happened. The initial release of files stolen from the Democratic National Committee involved a Russian intelligence officer claiming to be Romanian, for example, though that was publicly known at the time of Steele’s report. The government’s description of Cohen’s crimes released in conjunction with his plea deal on Tuesday includes a reimbursement to Cohen of $50,000 for “ ’tech services,’ which in fact related to work COHEN had solicited from a technology company during and in connection with the campaign.” It’s not clear what that was.

All of it, though, stems from Cohen having traveled to Prague in the late summer of 2016. In April, McClatchy reported that Mueller’s team uncovered evidence of such a visit, but that hasn’t been otherwise confirmed.

Obviously, Cohen might be able to do so.

Update: That just got a lot more unlikely. In an interview with Bloomberg, Davis stated flatly that Cohen “has never been to Prague in his life.”

The fairest assumption is that the dossier’s allegations are more likely untrue than true. Cohen may not have any information about any link between the Trump campaign and Russia that’s more serious than what’s known publicly. He may have information that adds a little shading to the picture of what happened but doesn’t offer anything earth-shattering."

Ellis at approximately 11 a.m. inquiring what the jury should do if it could not reach a decision on “a single count.” When the verdict finally came in, the jury was hung on 10 counts but convicted on the remaining eight counts relating to tax and bank fraud.

President Trump, even while the unsequestered jury was out, had expressed outrage over Manafort’s trial. He’s a”good man,” Trump said of the man now convicted of swindling millions of dollars from the Treasury and committing multiple counts of bank fraud. Intermittently, Trump would declare that the trial had nothing to do with him and that Manafort was only with the campaign for a short time. “Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time,” he tweeted on June 3 (one of a batch of four tweets that day) regarding the man who ran Trump’s campaign for four critical months, including during the Republican National Convention. While the jury was deliberating, Trump declared that the prosecutors were “enjoying ruining people’s lives.” On August 1 he tweeted:

That was only one of six tweets that day relating to Manafort and/or Robert S. Mueller III’s team. Last Friday, with the jury deliberating, Trump again told the press corps that Manafort was a “very good person.”

Whatever Trump hoped to accomplish by those tweets — or if he simply could not restrain himself — the Manafort conviction comes as a staggering blow to Trump, who repeatedly vouched for Manafort and declared the Mueller investigation to be a witch hunt. Sorry, but the jury convicted a witch today, to borrow Trump’s term.

The anti-corruption group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released a statement, which read, “The president’s former campaign chairman has just been convicted of very serious crimes. Paul Manafort engaged in corrupt behavior and illicit self-enrichment for years, and it appears he tried to use the Trump campaign as a way to get out of a major financial hole.” CREW added, “It remains to be seen how many others in the orbit of the Trump campaign and administration are implicated in corrupt conduct; it seems far too prevalent. We applaud the Department of Justice on this important conviction.” And CREW noted, “This is just the latest conviction for Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation, as multiple defendants have already pleaded guilty, and it likely will not be the last. This investigation is moving quickly and effectively, and it will continue bringing us closer to the truth.”

In the short run, this may not change much. Manafort is scheduled to begin another trial in September on matters hitting rather close to home — the White House — for Trump. Whereas the judge in Virginia essentially barred any mention of Russia or the Trump campaign, Manafort’s attachments and work for Russian-connected Ukranian oligarchs will be front and center in the next trial. The notion that no one on the campaign had connections to any Russia-related figures likely will be thoroughly debunked.

The question that now must vex Trump is whether Manafort will “flip,” and hence if Trump should pardon him before he gets a chance. There are many reasons why pardoning Manafort would be a disaster. For one thing, he could still be subpoenaed to testify and be subject to perjury charges if he lies under oath. (You cannot pardon someone prospectively.) Once pardoned, Manafort would lose the Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify on the grounds it would incriminate him. Moreover, a Manafort pardon would cement in the minds of many Americans — including the prosecutors — that Trump is bent on covering up something relating to Russia. If Trump tried to do this before the midterms, a firestorm would ensue, putting at risk many more congressional Republican (who have never stood up to the president)."

John McCain probably won’t end well either. The president was reportedly disinvited to McCain’s funeral months ago, after McCain’s battle with brain cancer took a turn for the worse, and now the veteran Arizona Republican senator has decided to discontinue medical treatment.

Throughout McCain’s illness, Trump has continued to publicly snub him — including a recent appearance in which the president declined to say McCain’s name when signing a bill that was named for him. As of late Friday, Trump had said nothing about McCain’s medical decision.

Trump does not want to comment on McCain before he dies, White House officials said, and there was no effort to publish a statement Friday as many politicians released supportive comments on the ailing senator.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and President Trump have been at odds with each other for a while. Here's a look at their war of words. (Video: Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)

Their increasingly combative relationship has served as a metaphor of sorts for the Republican Party: the former Vietnam POW and “proud conservative” who fell short to Barack Obama in his run for president in 2008 versus the loud draft avoider who rapidly seized control of the GOP and White House eight years later.

McCain rarely disguised his distaste for Trump as the real estate developer ran for president on a platform that included attacks on immigrants and U.S. allies. In July 2015, after then-candidate Trump rallied an estimated 15,000 in Phoenix and claimed to represent a “silent majority,” McCain said Trump had “fired up the crazies” in his state. The battle was on.

By the end of that month, Trump had disparaged McCain’s Vietnam War service, saying McCain was “not a war hero” despite spending more than five years as a POW and enduring torture.

“He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured,” Trump said during a forum in Ames, Iowa.

Trump refused to apologize at the time, despite criticism from nearly every corner, and has never retracted the statement. He has occasionally told people that he does not regret the comment.

“The reality is that John McCain the politician has made America less safe, sent our brave soldiers into wrongheaded foreign adventures, covered up for President Obama with the VA scandal and has spent most of his time in the Senate pushing amnesty,” Trump wrote in an op-ed for USA Today that month. “He would rather protect the Iraqi border than Arizona’s.”

McCain did eventually endorse Trump in 2016, then withdrew his support weeks before the election after the emergence of an “Access Hollywood” tape where Trump is recorded bragging about groping women.

Trump’s immediate and angry response: “The very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!”

In office, McCain has supported much of Trump’s economic and national security agenda, despite his misgivings about Trump’s dismissive approach to traditional U.S. alliances. But he has also shown frustration toward Trump’s White House, dismissing nominees abruptly from his office or growing angry at senior West Wing aides.

McCain crossed the White House last year over the GOP attempt to repeal Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and Trump has never forgiven him. After the vote, Trump said that McCain voted no out of a personal vendetta against him and that he would never vote yes to something that helped Trump.

He repeatedly told advisers that McCain should step down from the seat and let the Republican governor appoint another senator. Trump has also told White House aides that his supporters are not big fans of McCain and boasted that he became president while McCain did not.

Trump’s retelling of the health-care vote, usually without mentioning McCain by name, has continued throughout the senator’s more than year-long treatment for brain cancer. The 81-year-old’s family said Friday that he is discontinuing treatment.

“Obamacare, we got rid of the individual mandate, which is the most unpopular aspect,” Trump said during a political speech Aug. 13 in Utica, N.Y. “I would have gotten rid of everything, but as you know one of our, one of our wonderful senators said, ‘thumbs down,’ at 2 o’clock in the morning.”

Trump’s aggrieved references to the health-care vote “never stops being gross,” McCain’s daughter Meghan wrote on Twitter in June.

“I’ve let him know several times that was beneath the office and it doesn’t reflect well on him,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham, a South Carolina Republican and longtime McCain friend, said of Trump’s attacks. “He’s an American hero by any stretch of the imagination, and I don’t see how it helps the president.”

Graham said Trump “feels like he helped McCain in his primary, and John is sort of picking on him.”

In May, Trump and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to apologize for an aide’s remark that McCain’s opposition to Gina Haspel, nominee for CIA director, “doesn’t matter” because “he’s dying anyway.”

The aide, Kelly Sadler, left her job the next month, but White House aides said her departure was not a punishment for the remark. Trump told advisers he did not care if she apologized or not and was more determined to suss out who leaked the comments, calling advisers in for a West Wing scolding.

During occasional Oval Office conversations about McCain’s health or status in the Senate, Trump would usually say nothing, current and former officials said. He grew angry regularly that McCain was portrayed as the “good guy” in the news media and he as the “bad guy,” according to a former senior administration official who spoke to Trump about McCain.

Trump has fumed to friends about McCain’s role in receiving research compiled by a former British intelligence officer that alleged Russia had potentially compromising information about Trump. He has complained that McCain has criticized him over Russia and foreign policy, questioning his expertise and noting that he won the presidency and McCain did not.

“Even a remote risk that the President of the United States might be vulnerable to Russian extortion had to be investigated,” McCain wrote in what he called his last book, “The Restless Wave,” published this year.

“I could not independently verify any of it, and so I did what any American who cares about our nation’s security should have done. I put the dossier in my office safe, called the office of the director of the FBI, Jim Comey, and asked for a meeting,” McCain wrote.

McCain’s assessments became more withering the longer Trump was in office.

In August 2017, McCain denounced white supremacists who held a deadly rally in Charlottesville after Trump had said the event was attended by “fine people on both sides.”

“White supremacists aren’t patriots, they’re traitors — Americans must unite against hatred & bigotry,” McCain tweeted at the time.

In accepting the Freedom Medal at the National Constitutional Center in October, McCain condemned “half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems,” a clear dig at Trump.

Asked about McCain’s remarks the following day, Trump said “people have to be careful, because at some point I fight back.”

“You know, I’m being very nice, I’m being very, very nice, but at some point I fight back and it won’t be pretty,” Trump said in a WMAL radio interview.

Not long afterward, McCain appeared to take a shot at Trump for avoiding the draft during the Vietnam War.

“One aspect of the [Vietnam] conflict by the way that I will never ever countenance is that we drafted the lowest income level of America, and the highest income level found a doctor that would say that they had a bone spur,” McCain said during an interview with CSPAN.

McCain did not mention Trump by name, but his meaning appeared clear. Trump received five wartime deferments, including one in which a doctor diagnosed him with bone spurs.

Finally in July, McCain pilloried Trump for his chummy performance alongside Russian President Vladi­mir Putin at a news conference in Helsinki, calling it “one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.”

The U.S. president had rhetorically embraced Putin and appeared to side with him over U.S. intelligence officials on Moscow’s aggressive election interference.

“The damage inflicted by President Trump’s naivete, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate,” McCain said. “No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant.”"

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/08/24/rep-duncan-hunters-indictment-threatens-dynasty/1077312002/",0,"EVER SINCE 2016, when federal election officials questioned why the campaign of Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.) had paid more than $1,300 to an online video game site and the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that the campaign paid $600 for the family’s pet rabbit to fly, it was clear there were problems with the congressman’s use of his campaign dollars. That became even more apparent after the House Ethics Committee issued a report in March saying Mr. Hunter may have used campaign funds for personal use.

None of that, though, really prepared us — and we suspect, others — for the full extent of greed and grubbiness that was detailed by federal prosecutors as they charged Mr. Hunter and his wife, Margaret, with misuse of tens of thousands of dollars of campaign funds.

The 47-page indictment released Tuesday by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Diego spells out 60 criminal counts, ranging from illegal use of campaign funds to conspiracy, wire fraud and falsifying records. Page after page after page lays out how the couple, their personal bank accounts regularly overdrawn, allegedly spent more than $250,000 in campaign donations from 2009 to 2016 for the benefit of themselves and their children.

Expenditures ranged from the mundane ($32.31 for family groceries) to the mind-boggling ($14,261 for a family Thanksgiving vacation in Italy). To hide the personal payments, prosecutors said family dental bills were listed as charitable contributions to “Smiles for Life,” tickets to SeaWorld were called an “educational tour,” and clothing purchases at a golf course were camouflaged as golf “balls for wounded warriors.” And when the campaign treasurer warned the couple about their spending — suggesting Ms. Hunter give up a campaign credit card and threatening to resign — he was ignored and lied to. “Yessir- All good. ” was Mr. Hunter’s assurance to the treasurer that spending was campaign-related, the indictment said.

Follow this author Editorial Board 's opinions Follow

Mr. Hunter’s campaign released a statement calling the indictment politically motivated and linking it to his support for President Trump; he was one of the first sitting members of Congress to endorse Mr. Trump in 2016. Mr. Hunter’s campaign said he has no plans to drop out of his reelection race. It’s worth noting that the U.S. Attorney’s Office that brought the charges against Mr. Hunter is run by Adam L. Braverman, a Trump administration appointee. Also, Mr. Hunter’s willingness to point the finger at others was pretty well established when questions first arose about his campaign funds. He tried to pin the blame for the video game purchases on his son, claiming the boy had mixed up credit cards.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has removed Mr. Hunter from the three House committees he serves on. That’s not enough. The Republican leadership should make clear to Mr. Hunter that he needs to go. If not, it will be up to voters in his California district to make that happen."
4143,4143,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/08/28/fair-elections-just-won-a-victory-in-the-courts-now-the-republican-assault-begins/,0,"On Monday, a federal appeals court struck down a congressional district map drawn by Republican legislators in North Carolina, one of the most brazenly gerrymandered states in the country, saying that it violated the First and 14th Amendment rights of voters who were being denied the ability to select representatives of their choosing. The state may now have to quickly redraw its maps in time for the election in November, which could determine who controls the House of Representatives and therefore what becomes of the remainder of President Trump’s term in office. Perhaps even more significantly, this could be the final victory advocates of democratic representation get in our courts before Republicans take firm control of the Supreme Court and begin a long-planned, scorched-earth campaign against the right to vote in America.

That may sound like hyperbole, but it isn’t.

Let’s begin with what happened in North Carolina. After the GOP took control of the state legislature in 2010, it went on an orgy of conservative legislating, including redrawing the state’s congressional maps to make it virtually impossible for Democrats to achieve representation that even approximates their actual strength in the state.

Gerrymandering is here to stay. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, says Post opinion writer Robert Gebelhoff. (Video: Adriana Usero, Danielle Kunitz, Robert Gebelhoff/The Washington Post)

When the maps were struck down as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander meant to disenfranchise minority voters, the legislature essentially redrew them in the same way, but now making it clear that they were only trying to disenfranchise Democrats, not minorities. And they didn’t try to hide what they were doing. At a hearing on the subject, the Republican legislator leading the process said that he would have gone further had it been possible: “I propose that we draw the maps to give a partisan advantage to 10 Republicans and three Democrats, because I do not believe it’s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.”

As repugnantly undemocratic as that is, the Supreme Court has never explicitly ruled partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional. Back in June, justices had a chance when they ruled on two cases, one involving a Republican gerrymander in Wisconsin and the other a Democratic gerrymander in Maryland. But they punted, rejecting both cases on procedural grounds. The near-universal interpretation was that the court’s liberals wanted to rule partisan gerrymanders unconstitutional and the court’s conservatives didn’t, while Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote, just couldn’t decide. Or more specifically, Kennedy was inclined to strike down partisan gerrymandering, but wasn’t convinced that there exists an objective standard that courts can use to determine when a gerrymandered map goes too far to advantage one party.

Follow this author Paul Waldman 's opinions Follow

Just a few weeks later, Kennedy retired. For now, the Supreme Court is divided 4-4.

So here’s what’s likely to happen. North Carolina Republicans will appeal this ruling to the Supreme Court, arguing that at a minimum the appeals court’s decision should be stayed until after November so that the election can be held with the old maps. The most compelling thing in their favor, apart from the short time frame involved, is that primaries have already taken place; you’d not only have to draw new maps (which can be done quickly with the software tools we have), you’d have to have another primary election.

The appeals court acknowledged this problem in its decision, and left open multiple possibilities for how to resolve it. It set a short deadline for the legislature to come up with a new map, but also noted the bad faith with which the legislature has been operating, and therefore said it might appoint a special master to draw a new map. It even raised the possibility of having the November election serve as the primary, and then holding another election soon after.

While they’re figuring that out, the Supreme Court could deadlock 4-4 on the Republicans’ appeal. If that happens, the decision of the lower court will stand.

What does that mean for the rest of us? Given how much momentum Democrats have right now, an election with fair maps in North Carolina could change the 10-3 Republican advantage into something like a 7-6 Democratic advantage. Those extra four Democratic seats could well determine who controls the House. And if Democrats do take control, everything in Washington changes.

But why do I say this could be the last victory for democratic representation before we enter a long, dark period for voting rights? Because at some point, Kennedy’s seat will be filled, either with Brett Kavanaugh or someone else appointed by Donald Trump. We know that person will be as hostile to fair representation as the other Republican appointees on the Supreme Court, who have been friendly to every restriction on voting rights that has come before them. The new swing vote on the court will belong to Chief Justice John Roberts, the man who wrote the decision eviscerating the Voting Rights Act on the grounds that racial discrimination in elections isn’t much of a problem anymore.

As former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum recently wrote, “If conservatives become convinced that they cannot win democratically, they will not abandon conservatism. They will reject democracy.” Indeed, they already have, with gusto. When they gain power, one of the first things they do is move to ensure that even if the voters reject them, they will still be able to hold that power. They pass voter-ID laws, they purge voter rolls, they construct partisan gerrymanders and they pack courts with judges who will ratify it all. We shouldn’t forget that the inevitable 5-4 Supreme Court decisions upholding state Republican efforts to rig elections will be possible only because the court itself has been rigged, by the decision of Mitch McConnell and the entire Republican Party to simply refuse to allow Barack Obama to fill a vacancy that occurred while he was president."
4153,4153,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2018/08/21/animal-crackers-have-been-caged-for-116-years-pressure-on-nabisco-helped-free-them/?utm_term=.7293c1cdf614,0,"After more than a century of imprisonment, Barnum’s cracker creatures are roaming free — until they meet their mushy demise in the mouths of children, anyway. After pressure from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Nabisco has rolled out a redesign of its Barnum’s animal crackers box — which takes its name from the famed circus — that historically featured animals behind bars. Now, the box shows the animals in formation, asserting their freedom on the savanna.

“We’re always looking at how we do things to ensure we’re staying relevant for our consumers,” said Kimberly Fontes, a spokeswoman for Mondelez International, Nabisco’s parent company. “It seemed like the right time for the next evolution in the brand’s design.”

In an April 2016 letter, PETA implored Nabisco, the company that makes the crackers, to change its advertising, as public resistance to circuses grew because of allegations about abuse of circus animals.

“Given the egregious cruelty inherent in circuses that use animals and the public’s swelling opposition to the exploitation of animals used for entertainment, we urge Nabisco to update its packaging in order to show animals who are free to roam in their natural habitats,” the letter read.

PETA pointed to other companies — Lucky Brand Jeans and American Eagle — that had also recently dropped products that used circus imagery. A few months later, after correspondence with Mondelez, PETA even sent a mock-up of a cage-free design, with a classic group of animals in a natural setting, in a style consistent with the original product.

“The final design they ended up using is remarkably similar to the one our design team created,” said Ben Williamson, a PETA media director. “The new box for the animal crackers reflects that society no longer tolerates the chaining and caging of wild animals.”

The crackers’ namesake, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, spent decades traveling the country with its troupes of animals and performers — although neither namesake Phineas Barnum or the circus ever saw a cut of the snack’s profits. But Ringling Bros. had long struggled with protests and legal disputes from animal rights activists. In 2015, the company announced that it would no longer use elephants as part of its shows. At the time, the chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment — which operated the circus — said that Ringling Bros.’ declining ticket sales dwindled even further after the elephants were taken offstage. “The Greatest Show on Earth” took down its tents in May 2017 after a 146-year run.

The Humane Society of the United States, one of the many organizations that has clashed with circuses over alleged animal cruelty, is rejoicing over the new look of the Nabisco box.

Share this article Share

“Today’s consumers are savvy shoppers and they want to buy products that are consistent with their values,” said Debbie Leahy, a manager of captive wildlife protection at the Humane Society. “We’re glad to see that Nabisco is keeping up with the times.”

Revamping a product as classic as Barnum’s Animals is more challenging than you’d think, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin. Since the crackers hit U.S. shelves in 1902, both the product and packaging have been remarkably unchanged. The brand’s endurance speaks to the power of nostalgia, Scheinbaum said, so altering it can be risky.

“Some consumer brands can give a sense of comfort and reliability,” Scheinbaum said. “If grandparents down to grandchildren can experience it the same way, that’s a good signal for the brand from a common-sense perspective that it must be a good product.”

Barnum’s animal crackers have always been aimed at children, Scheinbaum said. Their boxes have always been bright red and yellow, with a familiar crew of circus animals — elephants, lions, zebras, with some wild cards such as polar bears — in caged circus wagons. Past iterations have had little wheels that allow the box to stand up like a wagon and strings that served as a handle or let them hang from Christmas trees as ornaments. Over the years, dozens of animals have been rendered in the crunchy, classic form. In a 1995 interview, Nabisco product manager Greg Price told the New York Times that the inclusion of 16 endangered species was meant to teach kids about vulnerable creatures as they munched.

“Our hope was that children will line them up, match them up with the names on the box, learn about them and then decapitate them,” Price said.

Nabisco has even produced limited edition redesigns to bring attention to animal-related issues and organizations, like the American Zoo and Aquarium Association and the World Wildlife Fund. Nabisco even partnered with fashion designer Lilly Pulitzer on a box to promote tiger conservation efforts in 2010.

In addition to the liberated animals, the new package is also more transparent about nutrition facts than older versions, outlining serving size and saturated fat, sugar and sodium content. Still, the new design is familiar — same colors, same creatures — and reassures consumers with, “New look, same taste!”

“When brands want to come up with the times and modernize, that’s great, but it’s important to be in keeping with a consistent look and feel with the colors, the font and the copy,” Scheinbaum said. “It gives people a promise of consistency.”

Nabisco declined to answer how many boxes of Barnum’s animal crackers it sells each year. But with its update to the iconic snack, Nabisco hopes that kids and families will be learning from — and chomping on — the crackers for decades to come."
4168,4168,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/08/29/why-the-gop-is-winning-the-battle-over-paul-ryan/,0,"TAMPA -- Say what you want about Paul Ryan's politics; even Democrats in Congress struggle to find a negative word to say about him. At least, that's what Republicans have been arguing for the last two weeks. And when it comes to the American public, it appears to be true. A new Washington Post-Pew Research Center poll asked Americans to say what one word comes to mind when they think about the GOP vice presidential nominee. And people have a hard time finding negative things to say about him.

None of the top nine words people use to describe Ryan are are negative, and six of the nine are positive (""intelligent,"" ""good,"" ""energetic,"" ""honest,"" etc.).

Not until you get to the 10th- and 11th-most-cited words do Democrats' attempts to define Ryan begin to register. That's the point at which people start describing Ryan as an ""idiot"" and ""extremist.""

And of the top 27 most-cited words, twice as many are positive -- 16 -- as negative -- eight.

All of this from a guy who starts out with positive marks, though not overwhelmingly so. In fact, the positive words used to describe Ryan suggest a politician whose favorable rating is far better than it currently is.

In other words, it seems clear that many people have processed positive GOP messages about his intellect and his life story.

More than anything, though, it shows that Democratic attacks have yet to really sink in. Respondents actually offered nearly as many negative words as positive words, but the negative reviews are far more diffuse. Most negative words were only mentioned a handful of times, with little consensus on what's bad about Ryan.

If Democrats' efforts to label Ryan as an extremist who wants to end Medicare were really catching on, we would be seeing ""extreme"" and ""Medicare"" up higher. (In fact, ""Medicare"" wasn't even mentioned.)

As Ryan gets ready to take the stage at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night, Republican efforts to make sure people know Ryan is a serious and respected politician and person seem to have registered more than Democratic attacks on his record.

People still have bad things to say about him, but the picture Democrats drew of an extreme Medicare terminator is hardly the prevailing view of Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick.

The dramatic and previously untold scene is recounted in “Fear,” a forthcoming book by Bob Woodward that paints a harrowing portrait of the Trump presidency, based on in-depth interviews with administration officials and other principals.

Woodward writes that his book is drawn from hundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand participants and witnesses that were conducted on “deep background,” meaning the information could be used but he would not reveal who provided it. His account is also drawn from meeting notes, personal diaries and government documents.

Woodward depicts Trump’s anger and paranoia about the Russia inquiry as unrelenting, at times paralyzing the West Wing for entire days. Learning of the appointment of Mueller in May 2017, Trump groused, “Everybody’s trying to get me”— part of a venting period that shellshocked aides compared to Richard Nixon’s final days as president.

The 448-page book was obtained by The Washington Post. Woodward, an associate editor at The Post, sought an interview with Trump through several intermediaries to no avail. The president called Woodward in early August, after the manuscript had been completed, to say he wanted to participate. The president complained that it would be a “bad book,” according to an audio recording of the conversation. Woodward replied that his work would be “tough” but factual and based on his reporting.

The book’s title is derived from a remark that then-candidate Trump made in an interview with Woodward and Post political reporter Robert Costa in 2016. Trump said, “Real power is, I don’t even want to use the word, ‘Fear.’ ”

A central theme of the book is the stealthy machinations used by those in Trump’s inner sanctum to try to control his impulses and prevent disasters, both for the president personally and for the nation he was elected to lead.

Woodward describes “an administrative coup d’etat” and a “nervous breakdown” of the executive branch, with senior aides conspiring to pluck official papers from the president’s desk so he couldn’t see or sign them.

Again and again, Woodward recounts at length how Trump’s national security team was shaken by his lack of curiosity and knowledge about world affairs and his contempt for the mainstream perspectives of military and intelligence leaders.

At a National Security Council meeting on Jan. 19, Trump disregarded the significance of the massive U.S. military presence on the Korean Peninsula, including a special intelligence operation that allows the United States to detect a North Korean missile launch in seven seconds vs. 15 minutes from Alaska, according to Woodward. Trump questioned why the government was spending resources in the region at all.

“We’re doing this in order to prevent World War III,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told him.

After Trump left the meeting, Woodward recounts, “Mattis was particularly exasperated and alarmed, telling close associates that the president acted like — and had the understanding of — ‘a fifth- or sixth-grader.’ ”

In Woodward’s telling, many top advisers were repeatedly unnerved by Trump’s actions and expressed dim views of him. “Secretaries of defense don’t always get to choose the president they work for,” Mattis told friends at one point, prompting laughter as he explained Trump’s tendency to go off on tangents about subjects such as immigration and the news media.

Inside the White House, Woodward portrays an unsteady executive detached from the conventions of governing and prone to snapping at high-ranking staff members, whom he unsettled and belittled on a daily basis.

White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly frequently lost his temper and told colleagues that he thought the president was “unhinged,” Woodward writes. In one small group meeting, Kelly said of Trump: “He’s an idiot. It’s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He’s gone off the rails. We’re in Crazytown. I don’t even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I’ve ever had.”

Reince Priebus, Kelly’s predecessor, fretted that he could do little to constrain Trump from sparking chaos. Woodward writes that Priebus dubbed the presidential bedroom, where Trump obsessively watched cable news and tweeted, “the devil’s workshop” and said early mornings and Sunday evenings, when the president often set off tweetstorms, were “the witching hour.”

Trump apparently had little regard for Priebus. He once instructed then-staff secretary Rob Porter to ignore Priebus, even though Porter reported to the chief of staff, saying that Priebus was “‘like a little rat. He just scurries around.’ ”

Few in Trump’s orbit were protected from the president’s insults. He often mocked then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster behind his back, puffing up his chest and exaggerating his breathing as he impersonated the retired Army general, and once said McMaster dresses in cheap suits, “like a beer salesman.”

Trump told Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a wealthy investor eight years his senior: “I don’t trust you. I don’t want you doing any more negotiations. . . . You’re past your prime.”

A near-constant subject of withering presidential attacks was Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Trump told Porter that Sessions was a “traitor” for recusing himself from overseeing the Russia investigation, Woodward writes. Mocking Sessions’s accent, Trump added: “This guy is mentally retarded. He’s this dumb Southerner. . . . He couldn’t even be a one-person country lawyer down in Alabama.”

At a dinner with Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, among others, Trump lashed out at a vocal critic, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). He painted the former Navy pilot as cowardly, falsely suggesting he took an early release from a prisoner-of-war camp in Vietnam because of his father’s military rank and left others behind.

Mattis swiftly corrected his boss: “No, Mr. President, I think you’ve got it reversed.” The defense secretary explained that McCain, who died Aug. 25, had in fact turned down early release and was brutally tortured during his five years at the “Hanoi Hilton.”

“Oh, okay,” Trump replied, according to Woodward’s account.

With Trump’s rage and defiance impossible to contain, Cabinet members and other senior officials learned to act discreetly. Woodward describes an alliance among Trump’s traditionalists — including Mattis and Gary Cohn, the president’s former top economic adviser — to stymie what they considered dangerous acts.

“It felt like we were walking along the edge of the cliff perpetually,” Porter is quoted as saying. “Other times, we would fall over the edge, and an action would be taken.”

After Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launched a chemical attack on civilians in April 2017, Trump called Mattis and said he wanted to assassinate the dictator. “Let’s fucking kill him! Let’s go in. Let’s kill the fucking lot of them,” Trump said, according to Woodward.

Mattis told the president that he would get right on it. But after hanging up the phone, he told a senior aide: “We’re not going to do any of that. We’re going to be much more measured.” The national security team developed options for the more conventional airstrike that Trump ultimately ordered.

Cohn, a Wall Street veteran, tried to tamp down Trump’s strident nationalism regarding trade. According to Woodward, Cohn “stole a letter off Trump’s desk” that the president was intending to sign to formally withdraw the United States from a trade agreement with South Korea. Cohn later told an associate that he removed the letter to protect national security and that Trump did not notice that it was missing.

Cohn made a similar play to prevent Trump from pulling the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, something the president has long threatened to do. In spring 2017, Trump was eager to withdraw from NAFTA and told Porter: “Why aren’t we getting this done? Do your job. It’s tap, tap, tap. You’re just tapping me along. I want to do this.”

Under orders from the president, Porter drafted a notification letter withdrawing from NAFTA. But he and other advisers worried that it could trigger an economic and foreign relations crisis. So Porter consulted Cohn, who told him, according to Woodward: “I can stop this. I’ll just take the paper off his desk.”

Despite repeated threats by Trump, the United States has remained in both pacts. The administration continues to negotiate new terms with South Korea as well as with its NAFTA partners, Canada and Mexico.

Cohn came to regard the president as “a professional liar” and threatened to resign in August 2017 over Trump’s handling of a deadly white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville. Cohn, who is Jewish, was especially shaken when one of his daughters found a swastika on her college dorm room.

Trump was sharply criticized for initially saying that “both sides” were to blame. At the urging of advisers, he then condemned white supremacists and neo-Nazis but almost immediately told aides, “That was the biggest fucking mistake I’ve made” and the “worst speech I’ve ever given,” according to Woodward’s account.

When Cohn met with Trump to deliver his resignation letter after Charlottesville, the president told him, “This is treason,” and persuaded his economic adviser to stay on. Kelly then confided to Cohn that he shared Cohn’s horror at Trump’s handling of the tragedy — and shared Cohn’s fury with Trump.

“I would have taken that resignation letter and shoved it up his ass six different times,” Kelly told Cohn, according to Woodward. Kelly himself has threatened to quit several times but has not done so.

Woodward illustrates how the dread in Trump’s orbit became all-encompassing over the course of Trump’s first year in office, leaving some staff members and Cabinet members confounded by the president’s lack of understanding about how government functions and his inability and unwillingness to learn.

At one point, Porter, who departed in February amid domestic abuse allegations, is quoted as saying, “This was no longer a presidency. This is no longer a White House. This is a man being who he is.”

Such moments of panic are a routine feature but not the thrust of Woodward’s book, which mostly focuses on substantive decisions and internal disagreements, including tensions with North Korea as well as the future of U.S. policy in Afghanistan.

Woodward recounts repeated episodes of anxiety inside the government over Trump’s handling of the North Korean nuclear threat. One month into his presidency, Trump asked Dunford for a plan for a preemptive military strike on North Korea, which rattled the combat veteran.

In the fall of 2017, as Trump intensified a war of words with Kim Jong Un, nicknaming North Korea’s dictator “Little Rocket Man” in a speech at the United Nations, aides worried the president might be provoking Kim. But, Woodward writes, Trump told Porter that he saw the situation as a contest of wills: “This is all about leader versus leader. Man versus man. Me versus Kim.”

The book also details Trump’s impatience with the war in Afghanistan, which had become the United States’ longest conflict. At a July 2017 National Security Council meeting, Trump dressed down his generals and other advisers for 25 minutes, complaining that the United States was losing, according to Woodward.

“The soldiers on the ground could run things much better than you,” Trump told them. “They could do a much better job. I don’t know what the hell we’re doing.” He went on to ask: “How many more deaths? How many more lost limbs? How much longer are we going to be there?”

The president’s family members, while sometimes touted as his key advisers by other Trump chroniclers, are minor players in Woodward’s account, popping up occasionally in the West Wing and vexing adversaries.

Woodward recounts an expletive-laden altercation between Ivanka Trump, the president’s eldest daughter and senior adviser, and Stephen K. Bannon, then the chief White House strategist.

“You’re a goddamn staffer!” Bannon screamed at her, telling her that she had to work through Priebus like other aides. “You walk around this place and act like you’re in charge, and you’re not. You’re on staff!”

Ivanka Trump, who had special access to the president and worked around Priebus, replied: “I’m not a staffer! I’ll never be a staffer. I’m the first daughter.”

Such tensions boiled among many of Trump’s core advisers. Priebus is quoted as describing Trump officials not as rivals but as “natural predators.”

“When you put a snake and a rat and a falcon and a rabbit and a shark and a seal in a zoo without walls, things start getting nasty and bloody,” Priebus says.

Hovering over the White House was Mueller’s inquiry, which deeply embarrassed the president. Woodward describes Trump calling his Egyptian counterpart to secure the release of an imprisoned charity worker and President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi saying: “Donald, I’m worried about this investigation. Are you going to be around?”

Trump relayed the conversation to Dowd and said it was “like a kick in the nuts,” according to Woodward.

The book vividly recounts the ongoing debate between Trump and his attorneys about whether the president would sit for an interview with Mueller. On March 5, Dowd and Trump attorney Jay Sekulow met in Mueller’s office with the special counsel and his deputy, James Quarles, where Dowd and Sekulow reenacted Trump’s January practice session.

Dowd then explained to Mueller and Quarles why he was trying to keep the president from testifying: “I’m not going to sit there and let him look like an idiot. And you publish that transcript, because everything leaks in Washington, and the guys overseas are going to say, ‘I told you he was an idiot. I told you he was a goddamn dumbbell. What are we dealing with this idiot for?’ ”

“John, I understand,” Mueller replied, according to Woodward.

Later that month, Dowd told Trump: “Don’t testify. It’s either that or an orange jumpsuit.”

But Trump, concerned about the optics of a president refusing to testify and convinced that he could handle Mueller’s questions, had by then decided otherwise.

“I’ll be a real good witness,” Trump told Dowd, according to Woodward.

“You are not a good witness,” Dowd replied. “Mr. President, I’m afraid I just can’t help you.”"

Most of the articles on the study funded by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health focused on one particular number: 4,645 “excess deaths” from Sept. 20 through Dec. 31, 2017. The report stirred outrage and anger. Here’s a widely cited tweet that attempted to put the number in perspective:

Harvard report says 4645 people died in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria. For perspective on this:

1833 deaths attributed to Hurricane Katrina

2411 total US combat deaths in Afghanistan

2977 deaths as a result of 9/11 attacks

4424 total US combat deaths in Iraq War — David Rothkopf (@djrothkopf) May 29, 2018

But there’s a problem: This is not a verified number, unlike body counts in wars. The Harvard study offers only an estimate – a midpoint along a broad range of possibilities. It is not based on death records, only estimates of deaths from people who were interviewed in a survey.

Advertisement

In effect, the researchers took one number – 15 deaths identified from a survey of 3,299 households – and extrapolated that to come up with 4,645 deaths across the island. That number came with a very large caveat, clearly identified in the report, but few news media accounts bothered to explain the nuances.

Here’s why you need to be very, very careful with this figure.

The Facts

Few disagree that the official death toll is far too low. The Puerto Rican government has already asked researchers at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health to examine death certificate and mortality data to come up with a better number. That report is due to be completed in the coming months.

There have been several attempts already to estimate the actual death toll. Here’s a sampling:

Advertisement

The New York Times calculated 1,052 deaths through October.

The Center for Investigative Reporting calculated 985 through October.

University of Puerto Rico-Mayagüez professors calculated 822, with a 95 percent confidence range that the total was somewhere between 605 and 1,039.

Pennsylvania State University professors calculated excess deaths of about 500 in September, or a total of 1,085 if the same pattern held in October. That estimate was based on six weeks of mortality records.

A Latino USA analysis, using updated data from Puerto Rico’s Department of Health, calculated 1,194 excess deaths in September and October.

Notice a consistent pattern? All of the estimates are roughly around 1,000 deaths, which is still about 15 times higher than the official count.

These figures are also based on actual data, not estimates, though researchers have been stymied in obtaining complete November and December data because the government halted access until the completion of the formal report ordered by the government.

The Harvard study took a different approach. The researchers surveyed a random sample of 3,299 households, representing 9,522 people, and obtained answers from about 93 percent. The survey participants identified 38 people who died after the hurricane through December. Of that number, three died directly from medical complications, illness or trauma because of the hurricane, and 12 died because of the interruption of medical services in the aftermath. The other 23 deaths were reported to be unrelated to the storm.

From that base of survey data, the researchers extrapolated to the whole island and came up with a range of excess deaths. That range is 793 to 8,498, with a 95 percent confidence interval. This means, according to the researchers, that “if one had unlimited resources, and continued to take random samples, 95 percent of the resulting confidence intervals would include the actual death count.” The widely reported number of 4,645 is simply the midpoint and is no more or less valid than any other number in the range. (Note: the third sentence has been rewritten to directly quote from the document, as various experts have contacted The Fact Checker with differing definitions of a 95-percent confidence interval.)

In response to questions, the researchers posted a document that includes this question: Does your study say that 4,645 died? The answer: “No. We provide a 95% confidence interval of 793 to 8,498, and 4,645 falls in the middle of this range.”

The researchers said the confidence interval is so large because “deaths are relatively rare events,” and so many more households would need to be surveyed to narrow the range: “This was a quick study on a limited budget. With more time and resources, we would recommend a larger sample size in order to narrow the range of estimates.” They also noted they did not have access to the demographic registry data, like other researchers, because the government stopped sharing data.

“Their sampling appears to be well done, but relatively small for their purpose, leading to a large margin of error,” said Roberto Rivera, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayagüez who co-wrote the study that calculated a range of 605 to 1,039 deaths. “Most reports on the new study have focused on the number 4,645. But the authors of the paper included a margin-of-error-based confidence interval: 800 to 8,500. This interval is the most important part of their results. First, it is evidence that the death toll is much greater than 64. Secondly, it shows that the margin of error is very large.”

Steven Kopits of Princeton Policy Advisers, an advisory firm, is a critic of the Harvard study. He notes that the available registry data, which still is incomplete, indicates 654 excess deaths above the previous year through December. (Note: More recent data released by Puerto Rico after this fact check was published suggests the number is closer to 1,400.) On the face of it, he said, the Harvard number makes little sense because that means 3,000 bodies would be missing – when only 45 were reported as missing as of December.

“With the power outage following the hurricane, residents in ill health and near death died prematurely for lack of access to life-sustaining services like respirators, dialysis and air conditioning,” he said. “These deaths were principally attributable to an extended loss of power. On the other hand, most of these people were under the care of family or professional staff, and their deaths were recorded in near real time. Virtually all those who died in 2017 have been properly accounted for. There are materially no missing bodies.”

He suspects that because the “vast majority of those who died prematurely would have died in a few months even absent the hurricane,” the number of excess deaths should “decrease month by month and probably disappear entirely — from a statistical perspective — within a year.”

Another critic is Donald Berry, professor of biostatistics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. “The results are statistically weak and nearly useless, at least insofar as number of deaths is concerned,” he said. “Another way of conveying the confidence interval 793 to 8498 is 4645+/-3852. The error is almost as big as the estimate.” He also faulted the researchers for using a different methodology — official deaths for all of Puerto Rico— as a comparison for 2016. “They should have used deaths in 2016 only the same 104 barrios they considered in 2017,” he said.

In a statement about the Harvard study, GWU’s Milken Institute, which is conducting the official study for the Puerto Rican government, urged caution about the numbers. The institute noted that it will use “actual data about death,” such as death certificates, which it described as “a more accurate way to assess mortality.” The statement noted the Milken study “is expected to provide a narrower range of uncertainty around the estimated excess deaths tied to Hurricane Maria.”

[Update, June 1: Under pressure, the Puerto Rican health department suddenly released the long-hidden death figures, showing an increase of 561 deaths in September over the same month in 2016, an increase of 683 deaths in October, an increase of 187 in November and a decline of 34 in December. That adds up to a 1,397 increase in that four-month period. Kopits on June 4 published an updated analysis based on the new numbers.]

[Update, Aug. 7: In a research note published in the Journal of American Medical Association, Alexis R. Santos-Lozada of Pennsylvania University and a colleague reported that the inclusion of the December deaths indicated an excess death toll of 1,139. The note added that the Harvard result was “based on a survey that underestimated prehurricane mortality, overestimated posthurricane mortality, and had a large CI (confidence interval), indicating a high level of uncertainty. Future studies would benefit from careful analysis of deaths from vital records rather than surveys.”]

[Update, Aug. 10: In a report to Congress, Puerto Rico estimated there were 1,427 more deaths from September to December 2017 than the average for the same time period over the previous four years. The official death toll of 64 will remain unchanged until the GWU study is completed.]

[Update, Aug. 28: GWU’s Milken Institute released its report, estimating excess deaths at between 2,658 and 3,290, with a midpoint of 2,975, in the six months after the storm made landfall. This is a longer period of research than previous studies; GWU estimated 2,098 excess deaths through December (the period also covered by the Harvard study) and 1,271 for September and October (the period covered by most of the other studies). GWU said it counted until February because people continued to die at anomalous rates long after the storm, as the island struggled with infrastructure failures and political infighting. After the release of the report, the government of Puerto Rico embraced 2,975 as the official death toll.]

The Bottom Line

All too often, the news media grabs onto a number in an academic report and puts it in headlines, ignoring the caveats deep in the report. Given that this report is based on a survey, with potentially huge margins of error, it should be treated cautiously. Five other studies, based on preliminary death certificate data, have all come up with much lower numbers – about 1,000 in the two weeks after the storm.

Advertisement

That’s still 15 times higher than the official count, which is bad enough. But it’s an egregious example of false precision to cite the “4,645” number without explaining how fuzzy the number really is.

Given the large confidence interval for the Harvard study, it seems more likely that the true number is closer to the lower limit in the range, along the lines of previous studies – and not the number that has been so prominently in the news.

Those absorbing the impact of these historical aftershocks rarely grasp the epochal changes in real time. Who could have imagined during their commute home on the night of Nov. 21, 1963, that an event in Dallas the next day would shake the postwar order guaranteed by America’s victory in World War II? Even after Lee Harvey Oswald’s shots rang out from the Texas School Book Depository, could anyone have foreseen the collapse of such an ordered age soon overtaken by the anarchy of Vietnam, the murders of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy, the race riots, Chicago, Kent State, Watergate, postindustrial rot and the cultural chaos set loose across the country by these events?

And could even the most insightful observer have foreseen — while staring at the billowing smoke set against New York’s brilliant September sky — the avalanche of strategic blunders set in motion by Osama bin Laden’s attack on the United States?

Of course not. But two wars, three presidents and 17 years later, the tragic lessons of that time are still lost on our leaders.

On Sept. 10, 2001, the United States dominated the world stage in a way no other country had since the height of the Roman and British empires. NATO’s long twilight struggle against the Soviet Union ended with Russia in ruins. The Japanese economic miracle, predicted by some to turn America into little more than a granary for Japan, had flatlined. And a rising China was still struggling with a multitude of internal security concerns and was eclipsed on the world stage by the Pax Americana. The United States deployed a dazzling display of both soft- and hard-power assets across the globe.

On the eve of bin Laden’s attacks, America’s gross domestic product was nearly 10 times China’s and 40 times Russia’s. The U.S. military machine was unparalleled, with the Pentagon spending more on national defense than the next 15 countries combined. And despite those staggering outlays, Washington was running a $125 billion surplus.

Seventeen years later, endless wars abroad and reckless policies at home have produced annual deficits approaching $1 trillion. President Trump’s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America’s existence. And while the United States has been mired in endless wars and bloody occupations over the past 17 years, China has used that same period to aggressively develop economic partnerships across Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa. Perhaps that is one reason China will soon overtake the United States as the world’s largest economy.

Any discussion of policy failures since 2001 must begin with George W. Bush’s decision to invade Iraq even though no evidence linked Saddam Hussein’s regime to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Even a majority of Senate Democrats voted for a resolution supporting the Iraq invasion, and more than 70 percent of Americans agreed. But we were wrong. That war cost nearly 5,000 American lives, $2 trillion and inestimable damage to America’s credibility across the globe.

The excesses of Bush’s military adventurism led to his successor, President Barack Obama, placing the United States in a defensive crouch for the better part of eight years. The commander in chief defined his foreign policy approach this way: “Don’t do stupid [stuff].” Even Democratic foreign policy experts would quietly complain that their president’s strategic retreat from the world would come at great cost. The ignoring of crossed red lines, the rise of the Islamic State and the deaths of 500,000 Syrians proved Obama’s Democratic critics right.

Sixteen years of strategic missteps have been followed by the maniacal moves of a man who has savaged America’s vital alliances, provided comfort to hostile foreign powers, attacked our intelligence and military communities, and lent a sympathetic ear to neo-Nazis and white supremacists across the globe.

For those of us still believing that Islamic extremists hate America because of the freedoms we guarantee to all people, the gravest threat Trump poses to our national security is the damage done daily to America’s image. As the New York Times’s Roger Cohen wrote the month after Trump’s election, “America is an idea. Strip freedom, human rights, democracy and the rule of law from what the United States represents to the world and America itself is gutted.”

Osama bin Laden was killed by SEAL Team 6 before he accomplished that goal. Other tyrants who tried to do the same were consigned to the ash heap of history. The question for voters this fall is whether their country will move beyond this troubled chapter in history or whether they will continue supporting a politician who has done more damage to the dream of America than any foreign adversary ever could."

Kavanaugh after a woman publicly accused him of sexual assault decades ago, an allegation that triggered the most concrete signs yet of Republican resistance to President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. With the nomination suddenly in doubt, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) was working to arrange follow-up calls with Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who said he assaulted her when the two were in high school.

Sens. Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and Bob Corker (Tenn.), Republicans who are retiring at the end of this term, joined Democrats in urging a delay in the vote until the committee hears from Ford. The panel is scheduled to vote Thursday afternoon on Kavanaugh’s nomination.

The Washington Post published a story Sunday afternoon that included an interview with Ford. The report marked the first time her identity had been revealed publicly and her first public comments about the allegation.

Ford told The Post that one summer in the early 1980s, ­Kavanaugh and a friend — both “stumbling drunk,” Ford alleges — corralled her in a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County, Md.

While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.

Kavanaugh “categorically and unequivocally” denied the accusation in a statement, and the White House maintained on Sunday that it is not withdrawing its nomination. The developments marked the latest chapter of a contentious battle over Trump’s nominee that has grown increasingly divisive as it approaches its final stages.

In an interview with The Post, Flake said that Ford “must be heard” before a committee vote.

“I’ve made it clear that I’m not comfortable moving ahead with the vote on Thursday if we have not heard her side of the story or explored this further,” said Flake, who is one of the committee’s 21 members. Republicans hold an 11-to-10 majority on the panel, and Flake’s opposition to a vote could stall the nomination.

Flake would not specify what form the communication with Ford should take or how he would vote. But he emphasized the significance of the allegations.

“For me, we can’t vote until we hear more,” he said.

In a statement to The Post, Feinstein said: “I agree with Senator Flake that we should delay this week’s vote. There’s a lot of information we don’t know and the FBI should have the time it needs to investigate this new material. Staff calls aren’t the appropriate way to handle this.”

In a statement, Corker said a delay “would be best for all involved, including the nominee. If she does want to be heard, she should do so promptly.”

Senate Republicans hold a 51-49 majority and cannot afford the loss of two or more senators voting for Kavanaugh’s confirmation unless they can pick up Democratic votes.

Judiciary Committee spokesman Taylor Foy said in a statement that “given the late addendum to the background file and revelations of Dr. Ford’s identity, Chairman Grassley is actively working to set up such follow-up calls with Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford ahead of Thursday’s scheduled vote.”

Republicans reached out to Democrats on Sunday to try to schedule separate calls for Monday with Kavanaugh and Ford. But Democrats had not agreed, officials familiar with the back-and-forth said, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) demanded that the FBI reopen its background investigation of Kavanaugh, 53.

Garrett Ventry, another spokesman for committee Republicans, said in response: “Democrats have chosen once again to call for delay.”

The allegation injects uncertainty into the prospects for Trump’s second nominee for the court, roils the midterm elections — which have seen a record number of women seek elected office — and carries high-stakes implications for the court.

If the White House withdrew the nomination or Kavanaugh bowed out, the Senate would not have enough time to confirm a justice before the new court session begins Oct. 1, leaving it with eight justices. The court operated with eight justices for about 14 months after the February 2016 death of Antonin Scalia and Republicans’ subsequent refusal to consider Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s pick.

Any new nominee may have to wait until after the midterm elections, with increasing signs that Democrats could capture the Senate majority. Senate Republicans had argued that the position of red-state Democrats on Kavanaugh would be a factor in their reelection — an issue that would be moot if the nomination is scuttled.

Republicans face a potential backlash from female voters, especially suburban women, if they press ahead despite the allegation. In 1991, outrage over the Senate confirmation of Clarence Thomas despite allegations of sexual misconduct from his former colleague Anita Hill was among the factors that led to the election of dozens of female candidates.

Twenty-seven years later, the Senate is considering another Supreme Court nominee in the #MeToo era, which has seen a wave of allegations that have cost many prominent men in business, the media and Congress their jobs.

Earlier Sunday, Republicans had signaled that they planned to try to confirm Kavanaugh by the end of the month.

Foy issued a statement vouching for Kavanaugh’s integrity and saying it was “disturbing that these uncorroborated allegations from more than 35 years ago, during high school, would surface on the eve of a committee vote after Democrats sat on them since July.”

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said he agreed with the committee’s concerns about the “substance and process” regarding Ford’s allegation — although he said he would “gladly” listen to her if she wanted to talk to lawmakers.

“If the committee is to hear from Ms. Ford, it should be done immediately so the process can continue as scheduled,” Graham, a member of the committee, said Sunday afternoon.

Senate Democrats in leadership and on the committee swiftly called for a delay.

“To railroad a vote now would be an insult to the women of America and the integrity of the Supreme Court,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.

In a tweet after The Post’s report, Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) said it was “a very brave step” by Ford to come forward.

“It is more important than ever to hit the pause button on Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote until we can fully investigate these serious and disturbing allegations. We cannot rush to move forward under this cloud,” said Jones, a potentially key swing vote who has not announced whether he will support Kavanaugh’s nomination.

A representative for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not comment.

Hours before The Post’s report was published Sunday, Jones, a centrist Democrat, and two Republican colleagues argued that the allegation against Kavanaugh — which at that point Ford had not confirmed publicly — should have been raised sooner in the Senate and predicted that it would not prevent the chamber from moving forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination.

In televised interviews, Jones, Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) expressed concerns that a letter outlining the allegation that Feinstein received was not shared with fellow lawmakers earlier in Kavanaugh’s nomination process.

Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that now that Ford has shared her story, “it is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation. This should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nominee.”

The FBI doesn’t plan to investigate the allegation as a criminal matter, but Feinstein wants the bureau to review it as part of Kavanaugh’s background check, a spokesman said.

Feinstein also wrote an op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times on Sunday formalizing her opposition to Kavanaugh’s nomination and briefly referencing her decision to share the letter’s contents with the FBI.

Many Democratic senators have declared their opposition to Kavanaugh, but not a single Republican has publicly opposed him.

The two most closely watched Republican senators are Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), moderates who favor abortion rights and have broken ranks with their party in the past, including during the failed Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act last year."

Kavanaugh of sexual assault decades ago wants the FBI to investigate her allegation before she testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee — a demand that came as President Trump and Senate Republicans increasingly rallied to the defense of the embattled Supreme Court nominee. “A full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions,” lawyers for the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, said in a letter to the panel late Tuesday.

The committee had invited Kavanaugh and Ford to testify at a public hearing Monday, but Ford’s response raises questions about whether the GOP will proceed with the session and ultimately the vote on Kavanaugh, who was nominated in July to replace the retired Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. The two-page letter does not explicitly say she will not attend if there is no FBI probe.

Many Republican officials maintained Tuesday that such a hearing would be Kavanaugh’s best chance at preserving his nomination to the high court, since it would give the judge — who seems determined to fight the allegation — an opportunity to respond to the claims. But Democrats, like Ford, argued that the scheduled Monday session should be delayed until the FBI further investigates her allegation.

The letter from Ford’s lawyers described death threats and harassment since The Washington Post published her account Sunday.

“In the 36 hours since her name became public, Dr. Ford has received a stunning amount of support from her community and from fellow citizens across our country. At the same time, however, her worst fears have materialized,” the letter said. “She has been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats. As a result of these kind of threats, her family was forced to relocate out of their home. Her email has been hacked, and she has been impersonated online.”

The letter also refers to Ford testifying “at the same table” as Kavanaugh, although a spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said it was never the plan, nor was it conveyed to Ford and her attorneys, to have them testify together.

In a statement late Tuesday night, Grassley disputed that the FBI would need to investigate before Ford appeared before the committee and said: “The invitation for Monday still stands.”

“Dr. Ford’s testimony would reflect her personal knowledge and memory of events,” Grassley said. “Nothing the FBI or any other investigator does would have any bearing on what Dr. Ford tells the committee, so there is no reason for any further delay.”

The FBI declined to comment Tuesday after the letter from Ford’s lawyers was made public. The Justice Department said previously that the FBI updated Kavanaugh’s background-check file to include the allegation and suggested that that is the extent of what the agency plans to do.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, urged Republicans to delay Monday’s hearing after Ford’s lawyers sent their response. The high-stakes hearing was set without consultation with Ford, although Grassley’s office has said his staff offered Ford multiple dates for a potential hearing.

“I agree with her 100 percent that the rushed process to hold a hearing on Monday has been unfair and is reminiscent of the treatment of Anita Hill,” Feinstein said, referring to the woman who testified in 1991 that now-Justice Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her. “I also agree that we need the facts before senators — not staff or lawyers — speak to witnesses.”

Earlier, Democrats protested Republicans’ decision to limit the witnesses at Monday’s hearing to just Ford and Kavanaugh, saying it would turn the testimony into a “he said, she said” spectacle.

At a White House news conference Tuesday afternoon, Trump encouraged the hearing to proceed so Ford can “state her case,” but he predicted that the public setting would ultimately exonerate Kavanaugh and expressed sympathy for his nominee.

“I feel so badly for him that he’s going through this,” Trump said. “. . . This is not a man that deserves this.”

He called Kavanaugh “a great gentleman” and lamented that his wife and daughters are experiencing the public airing of accusations that Trump said Feinstein should have brought up earlier in his confirmation process. Feinstein has said she kept the accusation confidential at Ford’s request.

Though Kavanaugh’s confirmation prospects looked shaky earlier this week after Ford’s allegations became public, senior Republicans on Tuesday were increasingly determined to press forward with his nomination.

“All I can say is that we’re bringing this to a close,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). “They’ve had tons of time to do this. This has been a drive-by shooting when it comes to Kavanaugh. . . . I’ll listen to the lady, but we’re going to bring this to a close.”

Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a close Kavanaugh friend who introduced him at his confirmation hearings this month, said, “Obviously, the process was very unfair.” He added: “I’m not blaming [Ford], I’m blaming the Democrats who misused this process.”

And Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, sharply questioned Ford’s credibility. Speaking to reporters, Cornyn said he was concerned by “gaps” in the account of Ford, who told The Washington Post that, at a house party in the early 1980s when the two were in high school, Kavanaugh drunkenly pinned her to a bed, groped her and put his hand over her mouth to stifle her screams.

“The problem is, Dr. Ford can’t remember when it was, where it was or how it came to be,” Cornyn told reporters at the Capitol.

Asked whether he was questioning the accuser’s account, Cornyn said, “There are some gaps there that need to be filled.”

In another part of the dispute, Democrats insisted that Mark Judge, a Kavanaugh friend from their time at Georgetown Preparatory School, should appear before the panel to testify about the alleged incident.

Republicans “have just completely tried to ram this thing through,” said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), a former chairman of the committee. “This is more of the same.”

Judge, who Ford said was in the room at the time of the alleged assault, said in a letter to the committee that he did not wish to speak publicly. In the letter, relayed by his attorney, Judge said that he has “no memory of this alleged incident.”

“Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school, but I do not recall the party described in Dr. Ford’s letter,” Judge said. “More to the point, I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes.”

GOP staffers on the Judiciary Committee continued reaching out to other potential witnesses mentioned in The Post’s report Sunday, as Kavanaugh visited the White House for the second day in a row Tuesday. Trump said he had not spoken to him.

The coordination and preparation for Monday’s hearing has largely been centered on the White House. Kavanaugh and White House counsel Donald McGahn, along with other White House officials, met Monday and Tuesday for hours, monitoring news coverage and talking through their strategy, as Kavanaugh personally called senators to press his case.

White House officials engaged in a two-hour practice session, known as a murder board, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building with Kavanaugh, where he answered questions on his past, his partying, his dating and the accuser’s account. Participants included McGahn, deputy chief of staff Bill Shine, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Raj Shah, who is leading communications.

It was unclear whether Monday’s hearing would take place if Ford formally turns down the committee’s invitation. Cornyn said that if Ford “doesn’t want to participate, then we can’t force her.” A committee vote on Kavanaugh, initially scheduled for Thursday but subsequently canceled, could occur “a couple days” after that hearing, Cornyn said.

The charged political dynamics ahead of November’s midterm elections hovered as some Democrats running for reelection in states won by Trump in 2016 shied away from reporters, as did some moderate Republicans worried about potentially alienating independent voters and women.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) was first elected in the 1992 “year of the woman” following the 1991 hearings for Thomas. She said Republicans risk another Democratic surge if they aggressively target Kavanaugh’s accuser.

“They’re on very fragile ground,” Murray said. “If women and men believe someone who has courageously come forward isn’t being treated fairly, there will be a reaction, you can count on that.”

More than 140 female friends of Ford signed a letter Tuesday defending the Palo Alto University professor and her character. “Christine’s bravery and sacrifice in coming forward with her story while knowing the all-but-certain to follow devastating consequences for and retaliation against her and family does not surprise those of us who know her,” the letter read. “We are all very proud of Christine, grateful to have her as a member of our community, and stand in solidarity with her.”

While many Republicans remain confident that Kavanaugh will be confirmed, there have been private discussions among some lawmakers about whether the GOP should have a backup plan if he withdraws from the process or fails to secure the necessary votes.

But any private skepticism was outweighed by public vows to stand by Kavanaugh as he fought the allegation.

“He’s not going to withdraw,” Cornyn insisted. “I talked to him yesterday, and he’s determined to testify and tell his side of the story.”

He added, “Our Plan B is the same as our Plan A: Judge Kavanaugh.”"

His outburst could raise fresh questions about whether Trump will force a government shutdown in just 10 days, when funding for numerous programs expires. His top advisers have assured congressional leaders that Trump would not do this, but lawmakers have remained wary because Trump has openly toyed with the idea of shutting down the government numerous times.

This is the second time in recent days Trump has suggested Republican leaders are being duped by Democrats when it comes to wall funding, openly questioning the GOP’s calculated strategy to avoid a shutdown.

Earlier this week, the Senate passed a short-term spending bill that would keep the government running through Dec. 7. It aims to avert a government shutdown at the end of the month and includes far less funding than Trump sought for his long-promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

“I want to know, where is the money for Border Security and the WALL in this ridiculous Spending Bill, and where will it come from after the Midterms?” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Dems are obstructing Law Enforcement and Border Security. REPUBLICANS MUST FINALLY GET TOUGH!”

I want to know, where is the money for Border Security and the WALL in this ridiculous Spending Bill, and where will it come from after the Midterms? Dems are obstructing Law Enforcement and Border Security. REPUBLICANS MUST FINALLY GET TOUGH! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2018

The 93-to-7 vote in the Senate came less than two weeks before the Sept. 30 deadline when government funding expires unless Congress and Trump intervene.

Share this article Share

The House is expected to take up the bill next week, and Trump’s tweet injected further uncertainty into the process. It remains unclear whether he would sign the bill.

Senate Democrats have agreed to $1.6 billion for Trump’s wall in 2019, far short of the $5 billion that Trump is seeking. Convinced they do not have the votes in the Senate to get Trump the money he wants, GOP leaders elected to put off a fight over Trump’s signature campaign issue until after the midterms.

But Trump’s tweet on Thursday raises the question many Republicans so far have been unwilling to answer: how can they assure him they will be able to secure wall funding after the midterm elections?

If Republicans lose control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, or even if they keep control but lose a number of seats, the new Congress will not be sworn in until early January. This will put enormous pressure on lawmakers from both parties during the lame duck session of Congress that runs between the midterm elections and early 2019, as they will be jostling for power.

The president has toyed repeatedly with shutting down the government to try to get more funding for the border wall, at times saying there would not be a shutdown and other times saying he would welcome one. Congressional Republicans are convinced that a shutdown just ahead of the midterms would be disastrous.

The construction of a wall along the Mexico border was one of Trump’s top campaign promises.

Although he long vowed it would be paid for by the Mexican government, he has since demanded that Congress pay for the wall, saying the money would somehow be recouped later from Mexico. The Mexican government has repeatedly refused to pay for the wall."

Kavanaugh’s background, a stunning turnaround in an emotional battle over sexual assault allegations that has shaken the Senate and reverberated across the country. The dramatic developments capped an extraordinary day on Capitol Hill, which began with a sense of momentum for Kavanaugh but then sharply changed when one of Trump’s fiercest Republican critics, Sen. Jeff Flake (Ariz.), who at first endorsed the nominee, emerged from a private meeting with Democrats to call for a renewed inquiry into misconduct allegations.

Flake’s move puts in doubt the fate of Kavanaugh, who has in recent days drawn strong support from Trump and other top Republicans, but now faces another week of scrutiny and must watch as senators in both parties endure mounting pressure from their ­respective bases to either rally to his side or block his confirmation.

Conservatives have demanded that Republicans confirm Trump’s second Supreme Court pick, a judge who could shift the high court to the right for a generation, or face political consequences in midterm elections in six weeks with the control of Congress at stake.

The delay once again thrusts the FBI, an increasing target of Trump’s ire, into the center of a politically charged controversy.

Flake, who at one point Friday was confronted by two women who tearfully and angrily urged him to consider the pain of sexual assault survivors, was soon joined by Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), and hailed by Democrats for forcing a one-week delay in the nomination process to allow for the federal inquiry.

“There’s lingering doubt out there among a lot of people that we haven’t taken every measure that we should to make sure that these allegations are dealt with,” Flake told reporters Friday after the Senate Judiciary Committee said it requested the White House call for an FBI probe. “That’s what this effort is about.”

The request for a supplemental FBI background check will almost certainly delay Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote beyond Tuesday, the tentative date eyed by Senate GOP leaders. But Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had no choice but to placate the small core of undecided senators whom Trump has little power to influence.

Late Friday, by voice vote, the Senate took an initial step to move ahead on the nomination. Barring no major revelations from the FBI, the Senate could vote on confirming Kavanaugh next weekend, days after the start of the high court’s session.

The FBI has already cleared Kavanaugh through six background checks for his previous public-service jobs, a point the nominee underscored in a statement Friday while adding, “I’ve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate.”

Trump said the investigation “must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week.” The Judiciary Committee said the probe would cover “current credible allegations,” although committee spokesmen did not respond to a request to elaborate on what those accusations are.

The rapid-fire events Friday came a day after dramatic, searing testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault when both were in high school, and from the nominee, who denied the allegation in an emotional presentation.

Attorneys for Ford praised the decision to reopen the probe and added, “No artificial limits as to time or scope should be imposed on this investigation.”

The announcement followed a vote along party lines by the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination — an 11-to-10 roll call that was left significantly in doubt amid a contentious yet odd debate as senators dashed into an anteroom behind the hearing space.

The committee fight already was tense, as several Democrats — including Sens. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Mazie Hirono (Hawaii), Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) — walked out in protest. Flake often appeared conflicted and pained as senators engaged in a contentious debate over the nomination.

After Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) implored Republicans to join Democrats in calling for an FBI probe, Flake walked over and gestured to Coons to join him in the anteroom. The two close friends, as well as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), left — prompting immediate speculation about whether they were working on a deal to delay the vote.

The curiosity inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building hearing room grew as more and more senators shuffled in and out of the back room for the discussions, which Collins called into via phone. Besieged by colleagues, Flake and Coons even sought privacy for their conversations in one of the Senate’s old-fashioned phone booths.

Share this article Share

The senators eventually returned, and Flake announced that he would still vote to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination, on the condition that a final vote would be delayed no more than a week to allow for an investigation.

Shortly afterward, Murkowski, Collins and Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said they supported his call for a limited FBI probe. Manchin said in a statement that “the American people have been pulled apart by this entire spectacle.”

“What I’m encouraged by is that in an anteroom, back-hall conversation — first with Sen. Flake and then with Sen. [Dianne] Feinstein and then with many other senators of both parties, there was broad agreement that this committee has been too divided and too partisan with this process,” Coons said.

Senate Republican leaders have yet to lock down the minimum 50 votes to confirm Kavanaugh. Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) announced late Thursday that he would oppose the nominee, and on Friday, Sen. Joe Donnelly (Ind.) — one of just three Democratic senators who supported now-Justice Neil M. Gorsuch in April 2017 — said he would reject Kavanaugh as well.

Collins and Murkowski have not declared a position on Kavanaugh’s nomination; neither has Manchin nor Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.).

Trump told advisers in meetings Thursday and Friday that prolonging the vote doesn’t help Kavanaugh but that if an FBI check came up clean, he could use that as a cudgel to get more votes. But the biggest concern in the White House is that with more time, more women, more accusations and more stories could emerge.

“It’s not the FBI investigation that sparks the fear like it is just another week of this,” one White House official said. “How much longer is this sustainable?”

On Thursday, Trump was elated with Kavanaugh’s fiery testimony, in which he defended his character while furiously denying the allegations. Trump was “fired up” in a phone call with McConnell about Kavanaugh’s ultimate confirmation, according to two people familiar with the call, and said senators needed to take the vote.

It was a reversal from an earlier call with McConnell in which Trump was upset as Ford delivered her emotional testimony, according to the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

McConnell, as well as White House counsel Donald McGahn, has urged Trump to hold his fire and let the confirmation battle play out, advisers to both men said. Both Trump and McGahn had told others that they did not want an FBI investigation, two senior officials said — but that it was inevitable once it became clear that Kavanaugh could not be confirmed without one.

McGahn and informal Trump judicial adviser Leonard Leo — rather than the president — have been calling senators. McGahn has told others that he has good relationships with Collins and Murkowski.

Trump is telling advisers that he wants to stick by Kavanaugh. But he also says that “Republicans have been played like a fool,” according to a senior White House official. Still, one official involved in the confirmation process said that while Trump has expressed some frustration with the timing, he generally believes that McGahn and McConnell have the Supreme Court and other judicial nomination fights figured out.

Mark Judge, a friend and high school classmate of Kavanaugh’s, is likely to be a prominent figure in any inquiry by the FBI. Ford claims he was present when Kavanaugh allegedly attacked her. Another Kavanaugh accuser alleges that Judge and Kavanaugh sought on multiple occasions in high school to drug inebriated girls for nonconsensual sex with multiple boys — an accusation Kavanaugh has strongly denied.

“If the FBI or any law enforcement agency requests Mr. Judge’s cooperation, he will answer any and all questions posed to him,” Judge’s lawyer Barbara Van Gelder said.

Judge met with his lawyer Friday morning in Washington, after returning from Bethany Beach, Del. The Washington Post found him there Monday, where his lawyer said he had fled to try to avoid an avalanche of media requests and criticism.

Judge told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday that he either does not recall or flatly rejects the allegations about his and Kavanaugh’s behavior in high school.

“All I can say is that next week, this will be over,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said. “I really believe, I believe he will be on the court.”"

Kavanaugh moved closer to confirmation as the Senate prepared for a key vote Friday, with Republicans arguing that an FBI report on sexual misconduct allegations exonerated the judge. Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) and Jeff Flake (Ariz.) — two decisive Republican votes — indicated Thursday that the additional FBI probe was adequate, although they both cautioned they would continue to read the closely held report. Flake also told reporters that “we’ve seen no additional corroborating information” to bolster the allegation from Christine Blasey Ford, who in emotional testimony last week said that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers.

Satisfying Flake and Collins, as well as a third Republican, Lisa Murkowski, would be more than enough to confirm Kavanaugh in a 51-49 Republican-controlled Senate. The senator from Alaska, facing pressure from Native Americans in her state, has not said how she will vote.

Even as dozens of anti-Kavanaugh protesters descended on Capitol Hill, Republicans barreled toward end-of-the-week votes on President Trump’s nominee that could cement the court’s conservative majority for a generation.

“I’m sensing we’re in a good place,” said Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the No. 3 Senate Republican, a day ahead of a key procedural vote. Noting the handful of GOP senators who had been on the fence, Thune said the FBI probe “was sufficiently thorough to satisfy the concerns that some of them had voiced.”

Democrats were nearly unanimous in their opposition. One moderate Democrat facing a tough reelection in a Republican state — Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) — announced she will oppose Kavanaugh.

That left only one potential Democratic vote for Kavanaugh — Sen. Joe Manchin III — who has yet to announce his position. The West Virginia lawmaker was reviewing the FBI report in a secure room at the Capitol on Thursday afternoon and said he would return Friday to study it more.

Potentially complicating attendance matters for Republicans is that Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) announced Thursday he plans to be at his daughter’s wedding back home on Saturday — the same day as the final confirmation vote for Kavanaugh.

But Daines’s vote will not be needed Saturday unless one Republican defects and Democrats stay unified against Kavanaugh. In that case, a Saturday evening session could be held open for hours into Sunday so Daines, who supports Kavanaugh, could return to Washington after the wedding and cast his vote.

The latest background check on Kavanaugh — the seventh of his public-service career — only deepened the bitter, partisan rift over his nomination since July. Democrats and Republicans offered sharply diverging assessments of the report, with Republicans asserting it cleared Kavanaugh and Democrats contending it was too limited in scope.

The sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, which he has vehemently denied, were the focal point of Heitkamp’s lengthy statement on why she will vote against Trump’s second Supreme Court pick. Heitkamp said she also questions Kavanaugh’s temperament after watching his combative testimony last week.

“When I listened to Dr. Ford testify, I heard the voices of women I have known throughout my life who have similar stories of sexual assault and abuse,” said Heitkamp, who served as her state’s attorney general for eight years. “Countless North Dakotans and others close to me have since reached out and told me their stories of being raped or sexually assaulted — and expressed the same anguish and fear. I’m in awe of their courage, too.”

In Boca Raton, Fla., retired Justice John Paul Stevens, a Republican, also raised concerns about Kavanaugh’s temperament, according to the Palm Beach Post.

“I thought [Kavanaugh] had the qualifications for the Supreme Court should he be selected,” Stevens said. “I’ve changed my views for reasons that have no relationship to his intellectual ability. . . . I feel his performance in the hearings ultimately changed my mind.”

Kavanaugh addressed the issue in an extraordinary op-ed in the Wall Street Journal published Thursday night, acknowledging that he was “very emotional” during his testimony and “I said a few things I should not have said.”

“Going forward, you can count on me to be the same kind of judge and person I have been for my entire 28-year legal career: hardworking, even-keeled, open-minded, independent and dedicated to the Constitution and the public good,” Kavanaugh wrote.

Meanwhile, Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), echoing most Senate Republicans, said Thursday that the FBI report included “no hint of misconduct,” while senior Democrats called it incomplete and suggested that the White House limited the probe to protect Kavanaugh.

That anger spread to the halls of the Hart Senate Office Building, where by late Thursday afternoon hundreds of Kavanaugh opponents — including comedian Amy Schumer and actress Emily Ratajkowski — had gathered to protest his possible confirmation, according to organizers. Police also closed the central Hart atrium, barring staffers and the public from entering.

Earlier in the afternoon, protesters had gathered outside the Supreme Court and marched to the Senate to stage a sit-in. Some sat in the atrium and held a circular banner reading “We Believe All Survivors.” They held posters reading “Kavanaugh Lied Under Oath,” “Unfit to Serve,” “Cancel Kavanaugh.” And others unfurled banners from balconies.

“What do we want? Justice!” the protesters roared, refusing to leave. “When do we want it? Now!”

Neither Ford nor Kavanaugh were interviewed by the FBI for what senators said was a 46-page report that delayed the roiled confirmation process by a week. Lawyers for Kavanaugh’s accusers also criticized the probe, saying the FBI had declined to interview witnesses they suggested.

Grassley said he was “absolutely” satisfied with the report despite the lack of interviews with Ford and Kavanaugh: “If the FBI felt they needed to question them, they would have.”

But Murkowski, one of the three closely watched GOP votes, said Thursday afternoon that she did not yet know whether the FBI had been thorough enough in its investigation or spoken to enough witnesses. “What would be helpful for me is kind of a list of those interviewed,” she said. “We were not done, we’re not done in there.”

Senators who reviewed the report said it includes information from FBI interviews with nine witnesses. Five of the witnesses interviewed were related to the allegation from Ford, while the other four had to do with a claim from Deborah Ramirez, who accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her while they were students at Yale University. White House spokesman Raj Shah said Thursday morning that FBI agents contacted 10 witnesses, although nine were interviewed.

The report also included details about the mass of information that flooded into the FBI tip line, Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said. He said that several hundred calls were reviewed by the bureau to determine whether the tips were related to the investigation.

Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said that nine of the report’s 46 pages came from a three-hour interview with Mark Judge, a former classmate of Kavanaugh’s whom Ford claims was present at the time of the alleged assault in the early 1980s. Judge has denied her claim.

“I would say there were actually some other witnesses that probably because of their relationship with Dr. Ford, were maybe more impactful,” Corker said. “Generally, they were sympathetic and wishing they could [corroborate]; they could not.”

Thune also said that the report showed that FBI agents had asked “pretty specific” questions, in some cases using a calendar kept by Kavanaugh. “I think they really tried to find out as much as they could, matching up dates and places.” And to flesh out some key passages, Judiciary Committee staffers were reading communications between two people detailed in the report aloud, so senators could visualize the conversation, Rounds said.

Democrats were infuriated that the probe was, in their view, severely limited and lacked interviews with key witnesses.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters that “the most notable part of this report is what’s not in it.” And Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the report prompts “even more serious doubts in my mind” about Kavanaugh’s truthfulness.

“To say that this investigation exonerates Judge Kavanaugh, or to say that this is a complete investigation, is patently false,” Schumer said. “Chairman Grassley’s claim that there is no hint of misconduct in these documents is just not true.”

Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) seemed to acknowledge that there was no corroboration for Ford’s charges in the FBI report, but he blamed the scope of the investigation.

“You can’t find what you don’t look for,” he said, adding that “this falls short of my expectations for this investigation.”

The FBI interviewed three people who Ford said attended the gathering where she said she was assaulted, as well as two other friends of Kavanaugh’s who were listed on his calendar as attending a gathering on July 1 of the same summer that Ford said she believes the alleged assault occurred.

But Ford was never focused on July 1 as the date that the assault occurred, a member of her legal team told The Washington Post this week, emphasizing that the FBI would have known that if agents had interviewed Ford.

On Thursday afternoon, attorneys for Ford released a letter they wrote to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, ticking off the names of eight witnesses who wanted to be interviewed about Ford’s allegation. The list included Ford’s husband, Russell; Jeremiah Hanafin, the former FBI agent who conducted Ford’s polygraph exam; and friends of Ford’s whom she confided in about her accusation.

“The ‘investigation’ conducted over the past five days is a stain on the process, on the FBI and on our American ideal of justice,” the lawyers wrote in the four-page letter to Wray.

A lawyer for Ramirez sent a letter on Thursday to Wray making similar claims. The letter noted that Ramirez had been interviewed by the FBI for two hours Sunday in Colorado and later provided a list of 20 people who might corroborate her account of Kavanaugh’s behavior.

“Fewer than four days later, however, the FBI apparently has concluded its investigation — without permitting its agents to investigate,” Ramirez’s lawyer William Pittard wrote. “We are deeply disappointed by this failure.”

In morning tweets, Trump decried what he said was “harsh and unfair treatment” of Kavanaugh, who has undergone previous FBI background checks for other federal jobs, and accused Democrats of obstructing the confirmation process.

“This is now the 7th. time the FBI has investigated Judge Kavanaugh,” Trump wrote. “If we made it 100, it would still not be good enough for the Obstructionist Democrats.”

During a speech on the Senate floor, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) highlighted the way Republicans had rallied around Kavanaugh despite an onslaught of unproven allegations.

“Some commentators have called this our Atticus Finch moment,” he said, referring to the white lawyer in the classic novel “To Kill a Mockingbird,” who defends a black man accused of raping a young white woman in Alabama in the 1930s. Despite significant evidence of his innocence, the black man is convicted and is later killed when he tries to flee his captors.

“We all remember that Atticus Finch was a lawyer who did not believe that a mere accusation was synonymous with guilt,” Cornyn said. “We could learn from Atticus Finch now, during this time when there has been such a vicious and unrelenting attack on the integrity and good name of this nominee.”"

It’s where Steve Doocy once told Trump he was glad they were friends, and where Brian Kilmeade remarked that Trump looked very “big” on TV. It’s the couch where Ainsley Earhardt sat one morning last year and reminded people that Trump “is the boss” — after he fired the FBI director and upset many people who were not co-hosts of Trump’s favorite morning show.

But on Wednesday, assuming Trump was watching “Fox & Friends” as he so often does, he would have heard a rare public scolding from the couch.

“Last night, he chose to blow it,” Kilmeade said as Doocy and Earhardt looked at him with silent concern.

Kilmeade meant a political rally Trump spoke at the previous evening, amid the latest public crisis to engulf his administration: sexual assault accusations against the president’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett M. Kavanaugh.

Trump had digressed in the middle of his stump speech in Mississippi to mock one of Kavanaugh’s accusers, Christine Blasey Ford. “ ‘Upstairs? Downstairs? Where was it?’ ” Trump said to the crowd, referencing Ford’s recent testimony in which she told senators Kavanaugh tried to rape her at a high school party in the 1980s. “ ‘I don’t know. But I had one beer. That’s the only thing I remember.' ”

The crowd laughed.

But the next morning, even Republican senators who have supported Kavanaugh’s nomination condemned Trump’s comedy bit.

And in a rarity, Kilmeade joined them — even if he wrapped his criticism in several layers of support for the president and his nominee.

“We don’t know how she knows Brett M. Kavanaugh; we don’t know what house it took place in,” he said of Ford’s allegation. “Is that enough to destroy someone’s career, life and reputation?”

“However, the tactic of the president laying low has been lauded by all sides,” Kilmeade continued, regarding the previous week-and-a-half in which Trump had mostly refrained from attacking the nominee’s multiple accusers. “Last night he chose to blow it, as the FBI is handing in the report as early as today. . . . As much as the crowd loved it, I wonder about the wisdom, tactically, of him doing that.”

A note about Kilmeade: He is arguably the most rebellious of the “Fox & Friends” co-hosts, not that it’s a particularly high bar.

In a Los Angeles Times report — one of many that have described the president’s love of the show and the co-hosts' reciprocal fondness for the president — Kilmeade argued that he has taken Trump to task many times.

“Kilmeade ... disapproves of Trump calling the news media ‘the enemy,’ ” the Times wrote, for example.

Another: When Trump complained on Twitter this summer about “many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity,” Kilmeade made an issue of it on the show.

Share this article Share

“I don’t understand this tweet,” he told a guest. “Would you really say ‘foolishness and stupidity’ is a correct characterization?”

A month later, in August, Kilmeade lamented that former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman had “outsmarted the president” by writing a tell-all book about his chaotic administration.

Trump has “taken the bait and gone out and directly tweeted at her,” Kilmeade said, worrying that attacking Newman would only help sell more copies of her book.

Was @foxandfriends just named the most influential show in news? You deserve it - three great people! The many Fake News Hate Shows should study your formula for success! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2017

But Kilmeade rarely presses such criticisms, and they are vastly outnumbered by the times he has defended the president or praised him.

Witness what happened on the show immediately after he called out Trump’s public mockery of Ford:

“Well, there were holes in her story,” Earhardt told Kilmeade, seated beside him on the big sofa.

Doocy agreed with her.

When the camera cut back to Kilmeade, he maintained that “sexual assault is deadly serious.”

But, he added, many of the other accusations endangering Kavanaugh’s nomination amounted to “college kids acting like many college kids.”

“Fox & Friends” then moved on from the topic entirely. A few minutes later, Kilmeade was talking about how easy it would be for Trump to win reelection.

“He’s going to have a very strong report card,” he said."
4309,4309,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/07/kavanaughs-non-answer-same-sex-marriage-many-heard-troubling-answer/,0,"Since President Trump nominated Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, gay Americans have been among those most concerned about the implications of his confirmation. This past summer, the Human Rights Campaign launched a “Stop Kavanaugh” video hoping to encourage Americans to express their disapproval of the judge. The organization released a statement saying that ""his record is clear: Brett Kavanaugh poses a direct threat to LGBTQ equality, reproductive rights, affordable health care, immigrants’ rights, workers’ rights and so much more.”

But for some, Kavanaugh's record is not clear, as he had not commented on every ruling related to LGBT issues — and, perhaps more relevant, every decision coming out of the Trump administration impacting LGBT Americans.

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), one of the more liberal members of Congress on gay rights issues, took up their baton on Thursday when she questioned Kavanaugh about his views on the court case that extended marriage rights to gay Americans, known as Obergefell v. Hodges.

Advertisement

HARRIS: My question is very specific. Can you comment on your personal opinion on whether Obergefell was correctly decided? It’s a yes or no. Please.

KAVANAUGH: In Masterpiece Cakeshop, and this is, I think, relevant to your question, Justice Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion joined by Chief Justice [John G.] Roberts [Jr.] and Justice [Samuel A.] Alito [Jr.] and Justice [Neil M.] Gorsuch and Justice [Stephen G.] Breyer and Justice [Elena] Kagan, the days of discriminating against gay and lesbian Americans, or treating gay and lesbian Americans as inferior in dignity and worth, are over. [Editor's note: Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission is a case in which the Supreme Court ruled for a Colorado baker who refused to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.]

HARRIS: Do you agree with that statement?

Advertisement

KAVANAUGH: That is the precedent of the Supreme Court agreed with by —

HARRIS: Sir, I’m asking your opinion. You’re the nominee right now, and so it is probative of your ability to serve on the highest court in our land. So I’m asking you a very specific question. Either you’re willing to answer it or not. And if you’re not willing to answer it, we can move on. But do you believe Obegefell was correctly decided?

KAVANAUGH: Each of the justices have declined as a matter of judicial independence — each of them — to answer questions in that line of cases.

HARRIS: So you will not answer them?

Share this article Share

KAVANAUGH: Following the precedent set by those eight justices, they’ve all declined when asked to answer that question.

HARRIS: Thank you.

Kavanaugh has also been accused of giving non-answers — or at least indirect answers — to topics related to abortion, affirmative action and other subjects of high significance to liberal lawmakers. Even beyond the topics that matter most to those fighting culture wars, Kavanaugh generally gave non-answers to most questions about the opinions of specific cases.

Advertisement

To Harris, who built her career in communities with some of the country’s most visible LGBT populations, Kavanaugh’s non-answer was an answer itself. However, to be fair to the judge, the lawmaker initially cut him off more than once, perhaps preventing him from giving an answer that his defenders may have considered more direct.

After the hearing, Harris tweeted:

“Obergefell was one of the great moments in the history of the Supreme Court of the United States. Full stop.”

And other advocates for gay rights shared her sentiment.

Good point. If #Kavanaugh could say Brown v Board was one of the greatest moments in #SCOTUS history, why won’t he say Obergefell, which established LGBT marriage equality, was similarly one of the great moments in the Court’s history? https://t.co/ysIQln2cbR — Maya Harris (@mayaharris_) September 6, 2018

#Kavanaugh's refusal to disavow, in any context, anti-#LGBT discrimination speaks volumes: he is telling us where he stands on LGBT equality & what we can expect. https://t.co/Zx7W9N1gJU — Shannon Minter (@shannonminter5) September 7, 2018

In some ways, the 2016 presidential election pitted white evangelicals and gay-rights activists against one another, as both sides were hoping to have judges and justices nominated that interpreted the law in ways that protect the rights of their respective communities.

Advertisement

For many Americans, the right to marry seems like settled law. But to the gay community, fears that the ruling is anything but decided are very real, considering the number of people who voted for Trump with the hope that he would appoint judges who would overturn decisions popular with more liberal Americans.

Conservative Christians feared judicial power that interfered with their ability to express their religious convictions in areas related to LGBT issues. And many gay Americans feared that judges would allow for further discrimination against gay people under the guise of religious objections."
4320,4320,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/02/amazon-announces-it-will-boost-minimum-wage-all-workers-after-facing-criticism/?utm_term=.974a3853751b,0,"Amazon.com announced Tuesday that it will raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour for all employees, a move that comes after the tech giant faced harsh criticism for how much it pays its workers and raises the stakes for retailers struggling to attract workers in a tight labor market.

The pay increase will affect 250,000 Amazon employees and 100,000 seasonal employees hired at Amazon sites during the holiday season. It will impact full-time and part-time workers, as well as Whole Foods Market employees, and will take effect Nov. 1.

“We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do and decided we want to lead,” Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos said in a statement. “We’re excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.”

The median Amazon worker was paid $28,446 last year, according to company filings, which translates to about $13.68 an hour.

Amazon has faced criticism over the years for what some say are poor working conditions in its warehouses, the hubs the company has set up nationwide for rapid delivery of online purchases. (Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has lashed out at Amazon recently, saying the company does not pay a “living wage” and leaves some dependent on safety-net programs such as food stamps and Medicaid. He attacked Bezos, the world’s richest person, and introduced introduced a bill last month called the “Stop BEZOS Act” that would require Amazon and other large employers to cover the costs of food stamps, public housing, Medicaid and other federal assistance received by employees.

""Today I want to give credit where credit is due, and that is that Mr. Bezos and Amazon have done the right thing,” Sanders said in an interview Tuesday. “This is a significant step forward for many thousands of Amazon employees.”

Sanders said Amazon’s efforts were likely to have “a ripple effect all over the economy” by putting pressure on competitors like Walmart, where the starting hourly wage is $11, to follow suit.

“Not only does this make a difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Amazon employees, it also sends a message to the fast food industry, the airline industry and the retail industry in general that the time is now to begin paying workers a living wage,” he said.

Thank you @SenSanders. We’re excited about this, and also hope others will join in. https://t.co/kasWkkOhWo — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) October 2, 2018

In its announcement Tuesday, Amazon said it would lobby for an increase in the federal minimum wage, which has been $7.25 for a decade. The online giant is the country’s second-largest private employer, behind Walmart. Last month it became the country’s second publicly traded company to be valued at more than $1 trillion.

“We will be working to gain congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage. The current rate of $7.25 was set nearly a decade ago,” said Jay Carney, senior vice president of global corporate affairs for the company. “We intend to advocate for a minimum-wage increase that will have a profound impact on the lives of tens of millions of people and families across this country.”

The Obama administration had called for raising the minimum wage to $10.10, but the proposal went nowhere during an era of divided government. Many business groups and conservatives argue that $15 an hour is too high, especially in places outside urban centers that have a lower cost of living.

But given the tight labor market -- job openings have outpaced hirings for several months -- economists said it makes both economic and political sense of Amazon to raise wages now, as it prepares to hire 100,000 temporary workers for the holiday season.

“We have a tight labor market, and these are tough jobs with high turnover rates,” said Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist at the University of California at Berkeley. “You add in that Amazon is competing for workers, and it makes sense that it is raising wages.”

Other companies also have moved to raise wages as the unemployment rate, currently 3.9 percent, falls to historic lows. Target announced earlier this year that it would raise its starting wage to $12 an hour with a plan to increase it to $15 by 2020. Facebook also boosted its minimum wage for its contracted workforce — janitorial staff, food-service workers and other similar staff — to $15 an hour, while Costco now pays $14 an hour.

In exchange for higher pay, Amazon said it would stop giving workers shares of company stock as part of their compensation package. “We’ve heard from our...employees that they prefer the predictability and immediacy of cash"" to restricted stock units, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

Amazon said on Tuesday that all employees, including those who already make $15 an hour, will receive pay increases as a result of its new policy. The Post reported last week that Amazon had begun giving raises of 25 cents to 55 cents an hour to workers at its fulfillment centers nationwide.

A cadre of advisers, confidants and lawmakers all urged him — implored him, really — not to personally attack the women who had accused Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexual assault. So he did it anyway. Addressing thousands at a boisterous rally in Mississippi, Trump relied on his own visceral sense of the moment and mocked Christine Blasey Ford for gaps in her memory, directly impugning the accuser’s credibility.

Establishment Republicans initially reacted with horror. But Trump’s 36-second off-script jeremiad proved a key turning point toward victory for the polarizing nominee, White House officials and Kavanaugh allies said, turbocharging momentum behind Kavanaugh just as his fate appeared most in doubt.

Tuesday evening in Southhaven, Miss., Trump laid into Ford with the ruthlessness of an attack dog and the pacing of a stand-up comedian. The crowd roared with laughter and applause. Aides privately crowed as footage of the performance was played and replayed many times over, shifting the national discussion from scrutiny of Kavanaugh’s honesty and drinking habits to doubts about Ford’s memory. And in Washington, Republican senators — though they condemned Trump’s mockery of Ford — felt emboldened to aggressively demand Kavanaugh’s confirmation, which became a near-certainty Friday and looks to become official with a vote Saturday.

Advertisement

“As long as he was willing to go to the mat for him, it fortified probably people up here, too,” said Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the chamber’s third-ranking Republican leader.

The three-week maelstrom — from when Ford first shared her story with The Washington Post to Saturday’s expected confirmation vote — fused the nation’s cultural reckoning over sexual assault with tribal politics, carrying ramifications not only for next month’s midterm elections but for the long-term identities of both political parties.

At the center, as always, was Trump, who used his bully pulpit to champion Kavanaugh and accused men everywhere. Initially restraining his combative impulses and deferring to the Senate on process, the president ultimately followed his own gut as if he were, in the description of one aide, “a strategic boogeyman.”

The result is likely to be, according to counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, “a crowning achievement of his presidency.”

“If people look at this as an apocalyptic fight, he’s the ultimate fighter who doesn’t give up, doesn’t give in and doesn’t back down, even if there’s an avalanche of criticism and vicious, vile reactions from the other side,” Conway said.

Yet for all of Trump’s public declarations, the actual deciders of Kavanaugh’s fate were a trio of Senate Republicans with an independent streak — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona — whose demands for an FBI investigation prolonged the process but also ended up ensuring Kavanaugh’s confirmation.

Republican leaders, who for nearly two years have accommodated Trump’s brushfires in service to a shared agenda, plowed through the chaos to fulfill a wish of the movement right: replacing the Supreme Court seat held by swing vote Anthony M. Kennedy with a conservative ideologue.

The GOP’s hardball approach left Democrats shaken and defeated.

“They are succeeding because they have broken all the rules and norms,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). “They adopted the strategy that the best defense is a good offense.”

This portrait of Kavanaugh’s fraught confirmation process is the result of interviews with more than two dozen senators, Senate staffers, White House officials and outside Republican advisers, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss behind-the-scenes machinations.

After three weeks of uncertainty and pitched partisanship, it was Collins on Friday who all but determined the outcome in an extraordinary 44-minute address on the Senate floor.

The Maine moderate had signaled her thinking earlier with a “yea” on a procedural vote to move forward, before sitting down to lunch with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in the members-only Senate dining room.

Collins struck defiant notes in defense of Kavanaugh and lambasted liberal activists and senators, whom she argued never gave the nominee a fair shake. Although she said she found Ford’s testimony “sincere, painful and compelling” and believes she has survived a sexual assault, she explained in some detail that she did not see any substantiating witnesses or evidence for her claims that Kavanaugh was the aggressor.

The final words of her address were the ones many GOP leaders had been longing to hear: “I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.”

McConnell led the Republican senators — nearly two dozen in attendance — in a standing ovation. One by one, Collins’s compatriots celebrated her decision. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) enveloped Collins in a giant bear hug.

Within moments, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) became the only Democrat to say he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh, and coupled with Flake’s earlier expression of support all but guaranteed the nominee’s ascension to the Supreme Court.

'I don't even know him'

From the moment Kennedy announced his retirement on June 27, the White House realized the battle to fill his seat would be far more difficult than the one for Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to replace the late Antonin Scalia. Picking a successor for Kennedy’s swing seat gave Trump an opportunity to solidify a conservative majority on the court for decades to come — and White House advisers decided they would need to mount a vigorous political campaign.

The chief strategist was Donald McGahn, the White House counsel who has had a tempestuous relationship with Trump but rose up through the conservative movement.

Trump, too, understood the stakes, aides said. If he could solidify the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, the president calculated, that move alone could permanently endear him to Republican voters — especially evangelical Christians — and override doubts about how he conducts himself in office.

Trump had no particular personal affinity for Kavanaugh, although a dinner was arranged between the two men and their wives to cultivate a relationship. “I don’t even know him,” the president told the Mississippi crowd, “so it’s not like, ‘Oh, gee, I want to protect my friend.’ ”

Nevertheless, Trump felt invested in Kavanaugh, and he entrusted McGahn, with whom the president barely was on speaking terms, to muscle through this final victory before departing the White House later this fall.

“Kavanaugh’s an establishment guy. He was a Bush guy,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), referencing the nominee’s experience as White House staff secretary under President George W. Bush. “There was a lot of pushback, you know — ‘Don’t go [down] that road,’ ‘That’s not why you won,’ and he said, ‘Wait a minute. I want to pick the best people to be on the court I can,’ and he said he was incredibly impressed by his background, just the whole package of Kavanaugh.”

McGahn built a war room on the fourth floor of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building staffed with nearly a dozen lawyers, two communications operatives and a stable of Kavanaugh’s former law clerks. A farm team at the Justice Department conducted research and drafted talking points. Leonard Leo, a longtime leader of the conservative Federalist Society, and to a more limited degree Republican lawyer William A. Burck, were key advisers. And an assortment of well-funded outside groups, including the Judicial Crisis Network, worked to buff Kavanaugh’s public image through television and online advertisements and surrogate media appearances.

The team treated Kavanaugh like they would a presidential candidate, including choreographing his public movements. When Kavanaugh visited Capitol Hill, McGahn and an entourage of clerks and aides accompanied the judge to meetings with senators and devised routes to avoid interactions with protesters.

Still, even the Kavanaugh operation drew pointed criticism from Republican allies on Capitol Hill and others in Trump’s orbit, who at times privately questioned everything from the selection of Kavanaugh himself to the war room’s ability to effectively manage a bloody-knuckled partisan brawl.

'Speak from your heart'

The story of Kavanaugh’s nomination can be told in two parts. Until Sept. 16, he was a milquetoast Bush Republican whose confirmation hearings had failed to animate much of the country. But that Sunday, when The Washington Post published Ford’s detailed account of sexual assault when she and Kavanaugh were teenagers in suburban Maryland, the Supreme Court nomination gripped the nation — casting Kavanaugh as a predator with a drinking problem for some and an unfairly smeared folk hero for others.

The initial Ford allegations momentarily sent the White House reeling, as they scrambled to assess her credibility and the veracity of her claims. The president was immediately advised, including by Conway, not to attack Ford, but to say that she deserved to be heard — a line he stuck to for several days.

In the coming day, stories of Kavanaugh’s alleged debauchery as a high school and college student dribbled out from former classmates, as well as two additional claims of sexual misconduct: Deborah Ramirez claimed in the New Yorker that Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her as an undergraduate at Yale University, and Julie Swetnick, represented by attorney and potential Democratic presidential candidate Michael Avenatti, suggested that Kavanaugh had been present at parties where women were gang-raped.

But the additional claims had an unexpected effect: Widely deemed less credible than Ford’s assault allegation, they gave Kavanaugh’s supporters fresh ammunition to cast all of the charges as a political hit job.

Kavanaugh, a former political staffer who had micromanaged his confirmation process and media coverage of his nomination, was eager to defend himself publicly — and McGahn, McConnell, Trump and other advisers were encouraging him to do just that. Kavanaugh and his wife, Ashley, sat for a television interview with Fox News Channel’s Martha MacCallum.

The interview was widely criticized — “objectively a horrible idea,” in the words of one White House official. Kavanaugh appeared wooden and dispassionate, sticking only to a few talking points, and Trump, an avid consumer and critic of television news, thought he appeared weak and unconvincing.

But the Kavanaugh team believed the Monday sit-down served its purpose: He was on camera denying allegations in clips that helped fill the news vacuum in the run-up to that Thursday’s scheduled Senate testimony from him and Ford.

“It filled the void,” a second White House official said.

Then came the whiplash — more than eight hours of Senate testimony, first from Ford, then from Kavanaugh, that captivated the nation and even left the president seesawing from fatalism to enthusiasm about Kavanaugh’s confirmation prospects.

When Ford had finally finished, McGahn spoke privately to Kavanaugh, who had not watched, urging him to be passionate. “Speak from your heart,” McGahn advised the nominee, according to someone familiar with their discussion.

Kavanaugh roared into the committee room and shouted his opening statement, which he had personally written the night before with the help of one trusted clerk. The hotly defiant performance was so effective in the eyes of his advisers — and, perhaps most importantly, of the president — that a group gathered in Vice President Pence’s Capitol Hill office began to cheer and pump their fists. Some even had tears in their eyes.

'It fired up his base'

The hearing galvanized activists on both sides and left jittery senators — including Flake, one of 11 Republicans on the Judiciary Committee — torn between competing accounts and party loyalties.

Flake, who has repeatedly criticized Trump’s rhetoric and had been positioning himself as the pivotal swing vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination, decided to vote “yes” last Friday to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination from the committee to the full Senate floor.

But Flake was confronted that day in a Senate elevator by two women who tearfully accused him of dismissing credible allegations of assault. He told fellow senators the FBI should reopen its background investigation to review the sexual misconduct allegations.

Flake, along with Murkowski and Collins, met with McConnell and the committee’s Republican members in the leader’s Capitol office and said they would not vote to confirm Kavanaugh until there had been an FBI investigation. The trio laid out the scope of the probe, which would take no more than one week and which they decided would not include Swetnick’s claims.

“How do we confine it to credible allegations versus any number of things that we would’ve expected to come out?” recalled Senate Judiciary member Thom Tillis (R-N.C.).

McConnell spoke with Trump and convinced him that the only option was to delay a vote and move forward with the FBI probe, according to people familiar with their conversation.

McConnell understood that Murkowski, who generally keeps her own counsel, was the true wild card. After being personally lobbied by sexual assault survivors from Alaska, she announced Friday morning that she would not vote to confirm Kavanaugh.

In the closing days of the Kavanaugh fight, Trump’s role was mostly public-facing. His aides conceded that the president would not have much sway with the trio of Republicans who were on the bubble.

“I think in terms of the people that we needed to in the end win over, it’s sometimes the less said is better,” Thune said, referring to Trump’s role.

On the campaign trail, however, Trump ratcheted up the partisan warfare at his rallies. In Mississippi, the president — already fuming over a New York Times investigation into his family’s allegedly fraudulent tax schemes — felt the media was not properly scrutinizing Ford’s account and decided to engage.

“How did you get home? ‘I don’t remember,’ ” Trump said, reenacting Ford’s hearing. “How did you get there? ‘I don’t remember.’ Where is the place? ‘I don’t remember.’ How many years ago was it? ‘I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know.’ ”

The riff lasted less than a minute, but had lasting ramifications. The senators whose votes Kavanaugh was wooing said they were aghast at the president’s rally-stage behavior. But Kavanaugh allies saw a clear benefit: An argument by the president that bucked up Kavanaugh, discredited Ford and became a clarion call for conservatives.

More than two dozen Trump supporters interviewed at the president’s campaign rally Thursday in Minnesota said they wish he had not gone after Ford, fretting that doing so was not presidential. Yet many also acknowledged the president had simply spoken aloud what many of them thought privately.

“There are things he says that I wish he wouldn’t say, but I will take it — for all that he has done, I’ll take it,” said Matthew Hoffland, 24, a web developer from Sparta, Wis. “It fired up his base.”"

The news caught 4chan and Reddit trolls mid-post. On the pro-Trump r/The_Donald board, someone had just written out a sexual fantasy in which Swift and Kanye West hooked up because “Trump being the best president is actually something they both agree on.” The author edited the post minutes later: “NVM didn’t realize Taylor sold out to the left.”

Missives about Swift’s perceived betrayal of conservatism clogged far-right message boards. Some simply refused to believe what she had written to her 112 million Instagram followers Sunday evening — a 400-word condemnation of “systemic racism,” homophobia and Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the GOP Senate candidate in her home state of Tennessee, complete with Swift’s endorsement of two Democrats: Phil Bredesen, the party’s Senate candidate, and Rep. Jim Cooper.

“This is more than likely from Democratic MK ultra forces from above,” m3Me_Magic wrote on The_Donald. “I highly doubt Swift decided to become political at the 11th hour all on her own.”

That a 28-year-old celebrity — even one who had previously kept her politics private — would weigh in on a potentially crucial midterm election seems much less strange than the story of how the far-right Internet came to believe Swift was their secret ally — “our girl,” as many put it.

The delusion traces back to the middle of the Obama administration, 2011, when a certain fraction of 4chan users convinced themselves that Swift had let them name her cat.

In some ways, it’s not much different from how every other conspiracy theory arises out of nonsense on that anonymous message board:

Among the hundreds of thousands of posts written on 4chan that November, one was a kitten-naming contest. The winning name was Meredith, which — lo and behold — was also the name of Swift’s new kitten, according to a People Magazine article that 4chan users subsequently passed around in astonishment.

The fact that Swift had named her kitten Meredith at least three days before the contest was held made little difference to those who convinced themselves she was a secret 4chan user. Amateur sleuths began sifting through the website in search of more supposed secret messages from the pop star, coming up with a photo of someone’s window blinds that looked like Swift’s and an anonymous message from a “conservative” “entertainer” who claimed to be “one of the 50 most famous people on the planet.”

A myth that began with a kitten took a dark turn a few years later, when a neo-Nazi blogger came across a joke meme that mashed up photos of Swift with quotes from Adolf Hitler. He apparently mistook these as authentic and published them on the Daily Stormer under the headline: “Aryan Goddess Taylor Swift: Nazi Avatar of the White European People.”

Probably not many people believed Swift was a Nazi — but between the 4chan rumors and the Daily Stormer memes, a vague but widespread belief spread across right-wing circles that the star was on their side.

“Swift is very white and very blonde,” Milo Yiannopoulos wrote on Breitbart in 2016. “She was born on, and grew up in, a Christmas tree farm in rural Pennsylvania. You heard me right: a Christmas tree farm. Little wonder the tradition-oriented alt-right are swooning.”

More than swooning — they were expecting.

“Taylor Swift will soon come out of the MAGA closet,” reads a typical post from that era on The_Donald, complete with a doctored photo of the star in a “Make America Great Again” hat.

“Taylor Swift is secretly based,” a user called MrGreggle wrote on Reddit last year, after learning she had sent flowers to a police officer injured in the Las Vegas massacre. “She gets flak all the time for refusing to become a leftist spokesperson and she let 4chan name her cat.”

To be sure, there were warning signs, if anyone cared to look. “I’ve never seen this country so happy about a political decision in my entire time of being alive,” she told Rolling Stone at age 19, after the election of Barack Obama. She came out for gun control in March. She was shown on Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” cover in 2017 as one of the “silence breakers” fighting back against sexual harassment. The cover story cited her legal battle with former radio DJ David Mueller, whom she accused of sexual misconduct.

But hope springs eternal until it suddenly goes dry, which it did abruptly Sunday night.

MrGreggle redistributed his allegiance to the libertarian punk musician Michale Graves after seeing Swift’s Instagram post. Another regular on The_Donald who had once sung her praises claimed he didn’t listen to her.

“I would say 90% of T_D thought she was ‘our girl,’” added dieselnut, who a few hours earlier had been celebrating photos of police “groping” women protesting Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh. “No hard feelings fellas, but let’s not claim them as our own until they prove they love America.”

“GG, you just lost over half of your fanbase, including me,” SwimmingJunky wrote in one of The_Donald’s most popular posts Monday morning, up-voted by thousands of people. (Even the president said Monday that he likes Swift’s music ""about 25 percent less now, OK?”)

And where there was not despondency, there was anger.

“Nobody pisses off 4chan,” wrote MartianSpaceCat. “She will regret this move for that reason alone.”

Maybe. Even on a good day, 4chan’s overtly misogynistic /pol/ board is awash in rants from men angry at “feminists” and “social justice warriors” they believe have taken over society.

As you’d expect, the mood was more foul than usual after the forum’s imaginary protege declared her real feelings. The Washington Post’s language policies prevent linking to most of what 4chan had to say.

Suffice to say, a meme of Pepe the Frog openly weeping with a gun to his head appeared in one of the most popular threads, more or less summing up the mood."

(Video: Reuters) Iowa is one of the states hardest hit by President Trump's burgeoning trade war with China. The nation's corn-growing capital will also be home to a handful of tight races this November that could help determine not only the makeup of the House next year but for years to come.

So less than a month before Election Day, Trump traveled to southwest Iowa on Tuesday to try and bolster his and his party's fortunes there in November and beyond. He came to stump for Midwestern Republicans armed with a pledge to make good on a campaign promise poised to boost demand for corn grown by Iowa farmers worried recently about diminished trade with the huge Chinese market.

During a rally in Council Bluffs, Trump formally announced that he is directing the Environmental Protection Agency to allow for the year-round sale of gasoline containing a high blend of corn-based ethanol. Currently, gas stations are not permitted to sell that fuel mixture during the peak summertime driving season.

""My administration is protecting ethanol,"" Trump told a crowd of supporters, many wearing green-and-yellow ""Make Farmers Great Again"" hats.

Before Trump left on Air Force One, elected officials from Midwestern states gathered at the White House on Tuesday afternoon to be briefed on what one attendee, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), called afterward a ""very good victory for agriculture.""

E15 also supports energy independence and consumer choice at the pump. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/nODUp3ppPN — Joni Ernst (@SenJoniErnst) October 9, 2018

The ethanol industry, now able to check off an item long on their wish list, echoed that sentiment. ""This is a big day for us,"" said Geoff Cooper, head of the Renewable Fuels Association. ""This announcement is something we've been waiting on for really a few years now.""

Trump came to make his pitch for a series of Republican candidates running in tight races in Iowa. One of the Iowa Republicans whom Trump invited to speak on stage was Rep. David Young, who is in the midst of a tough reelection against Democrat Cindy Axne in Iowa's 3rd congressional district. The race is close, with the Cook Political Report rating it as a toss-up, since the district encompasses much of the Iowa Democratic Party's traditional stronghold of Des Moines, the state's biggest city. Also tight is the Iowa gubernatorial race, with incumbent Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds being edged out slightly by Democrat Fred Hubbell in recent polls. The state's next governor will play a role in shaping of Iowa's congressional districts after the 2020 Census.

Trump tried to drive a wedge between Republicans and Democrats on the issue of supporting government requirements that call for a certain portion of the nation's gasoline supply to contain the corn-based fuel. ""The Dems will end ethanol,"" Trump told Iowans on Tuesday.

But the issue breaks down much more along geographic rather than partisan lines, with both Midwestern Republicans and Democrats supporting the ethanol mandates. “I’m pleased that the Administration is finally making good on its promise,"" Axne said in a statement, ""but our farmers are still suffering from President Trump’s unnecessary tariffs.""

Indeed, with its many soybean, pork and corn producers, Iowa's farming sector is poised to be hit especially hard by retaliatory tariffs from China, Canada and elsewhere. GOP strategists are worried about the trade war initiated by Trump turning some farmers off to the party.

Advertisement

Instead, the ethanol issue divides Congress between representatives from corn-growing states like Iowa and oil-producing states like Texas. The petroleum industry and its allies regard the renewable fuel standards as an unnecessary burden on refiners and argue gasoline containing more ethanol will wear down car engines more quickly.

""I’m concerned consumers will pay more over time because of wear and tear on their vehicles and I believe that increased use of ethanol can contribute to more pollution during the summer months,"" Rep. Gene Green (D-Tex.) said in a statement.

That regional cleavage put Trump's former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, an Oklahoman, and Iowa's senators at loggerheads earlier this year after Pruitt proposed rewriting renewable-fuel rules. Grassley accused Pruitt of breaking Trump's promise during the 2016 GOP presidential primary to support ethanol.

Now with Pruitt gone after a series of spending and managing problems and Andrew Wheeler installed as acting administrator, Grassley suggested the EPA is running more in line with Trump's campaign pledge.

""We've got Wheeler at the head of the EPA. I think that's a big help,"" Grassley told reporters Tuesday. ""Wheeler's approach has been much more satisfying to me than Pruitt.""

Hillary Clinton this week offered what can only be described as a justification for incivility — at least temporarily until Democrats retake power. Then video surfaced of former attorney general Eric Holder urging Democrats to shed Michelle Obama’s “When they go low, we go high"" mantra for “When they go low, we kick them.”

This rekindles a months-old civility debate that I won’t re-litigate here; what’s most notable are the sources. Clinton and Holder are the very definition of establishment politicians, and they’re espousing a view that previously pitted an anxious, more anti-civility liberal base against a warier, more pro-civility party establishment. The fact that even they would go there suggests exasperation with Democrats' historically poor political lot has boiled over.

And it lays bare very uneasy choices the Democratic Party is confronting in this moment — starting with Brett M. Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court and stretching into the party probably winning back the House in November.

On a whole host of issues, including civility, investigating Kavanaugh and the Trump administration, and policy, Democrats are having a difficult time navigating a united path forward. They are torn between a base that sees how President Trump and the GOP have risen to power by brute political force, extremism and culture wars and feels the need to emulate that, and leaders who seem to genuinely believe that Democrats can’t do the same things.

In recent months, this internal discord has loomed over many issues, including single-payer health care, impeaching Trump, and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. In each instance, the party’s leaders broadly opposed what the base increasingly favored for fear of going too far left, alienating swing voters and losing the chance to govern in the first place.

On single-payer health care, potential Democratic presidential candidates jumped onboard almost in unison last year, even as the likes of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) shrugged it off. This despite 74 percent of Democratic voters supporting it in a Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll this year.

Share this article Share

Pelosi, Schumer and other Democratic leaders also have suggested that impeachment talk is premature, despite 75 percent of Democratic voters favoring that. Base support for abolishing ICE is lower, but 82 percent of liberals have a negative view of the agency. Party leaders have tempered this push, as well.

Among them, notably, is Rep. Luis Gutierrez (Ill.). The Chicago liberal has been a driving force behind the party’s immigration agenda in recent years, but he told the New York Times this week that calls to abolish ICE are a distraction and a gift to the other side. “I mean, you want to change the conversation from the inhumanity of caging children to abolishing ICE?” Gutierrez told the Times’s Robert Draper. “They must have been jumping for joy at the White House.”

Advertisement

Similarly, vulnerable Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) on Tuesday rebuked Clinton’s rhetoric in no uncertain terms. “That’s ridiculous,” she told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “I mean, I can’t imagine how you get anything done if you don’t bring civility back into politics, and that goes for both sides.”

And the Heitkamp example is illustrative. The path to the Senate majority runs through red states like hers, and she’s clearly wary of rhetoric like Clinton’s. Trump won 30 states in 2016. Similarly, in the House, the median district favored Trump by more than three points.

As I argued last year, the realities of the electoral map and how our population has sorted itself mean Democrats need to compete in red territory in a way that Republicans simply don’t in blue territory. There’s certainly an argument to be made that Democrats need to change things up, because their current approach doesn’t seem to be working. Perhaps going left and fighting fire with some fire could create a political realignment by expanding their base.

Advertisement

But it’s not so simple as emulating what Republicans have done. And change for change’s sake — especially when it’s cathartic rather than strategic — can backfire. The prospect of overreach is significantly nearer to Democrats' current political position than it is to Republicans' right now.

And we may be seeing that to some degree with Kavanaugh. Democrats who were upset about the GOP’s gamesmanship on Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court pick in 2016, waged a failed effort to stop the nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct, in the face of difficult odds. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) talked about his “I am Spartacus” moment, Democrats walked out of a committee session, and some Democrats were tempted to embrace an unsubstantiated, extremely lurid allegation put forward by Michael Avenatti.

Although Kavanaugh ended the process as a historically unpopular new justice, a CNN poll this week showed that Americans viewed Democrats' handling of the hearings slightly more dimly (disapproving 58 percent to 30 percent) than Republicans' (53 percent to 32 percent). And the whole thing has apparently fired up the GOP base in the red states that Democrats needed to win the Senate, perhaps foreclosing that.

They may not have won the Senate anyway, but it’s not at all clear that Democrats did themselves any favors by going all in to try to stop Kavanaugh. They still may have done it, given the stakes and the allegations, but political calculations factor into all of this."

https://www.acluga.org/en/press-releases/aclu-georgia-responds-reports-regarding-53000-voters-pending-registrations-due-exact",0,"Correction: An earlier version of this blog post misstated the location of Shelby County, Ala. This version has been updated. It isn’t often you get to watch an election being stolen in real time, but that might be what is happening right now in Georgia. When it comes to the nationwide, comprehensive, carefully planned Republican effort to suppress the votes of people who are likely to vote Democratic, particularly racial minorities, there is a menu of techniques Republicans employ — voter ID laws, voter purges, limiting early voting, closing polling places in heavily minority neighborhoods, and racial and partisan gerrymandering.

But what Brian Kemp is doing right now is truly unique.

Kemp, the Republican nominee for governor, is locked in an extremely tight race with Democrat Stacey Abrams. He also happens to be the secretary of state, the official in charge of all elections in Georgia. You might expect him to step down or recuse himself from overseeing his own election in the interest of fairness and public confidence that the fix is not in, but that’s not how Republicans do things. Kemp isn’t just overseeing the process, he’s apparently also doing everything he can to keep as many Democrats as possible from the polls in November.

Ben Nadler reports:

Two main policies overseen by Kemp have drawn criticism and legal challenges: Georgia’s “exact match” registration verification process and the mass cancellation of inactive voter registrations. According to records obtained from Kemp’s office through a public records request, [Marsha] Appling-Nunez’s application —like many of the 53,000 registrations on hold with Kemp’s office — was flagged because it ran afoul of the state’s “exact match” verification process. Under the policy, information on voter applications must precisely match information on file with the Georgia Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration. Election officials can place non-matching applications on hold. An application could be held because of an entry error or a dropped hyphen in a last name, for example. Appling-Nunez says she never saw any notice from Kemp’s office indicating a problem with her application. An analysis of the records obtained by The Associated Press reveals racial disparity in the process. Georgia’s population is approximately 32 percent black, according to the U.S. Census, but the list of voter registrations on hold with Kemp’s office is nearly 70 percent black.

Who could have predicted such a thing would happen!

Follow this author Paul Waldman 's opinions Follow

We know who: the Republicans in the state legislature who passed the law and the Republican who’s implementing it. In fact, they passed their “exact match” law in 2017 after Kemp settled a lawsuit charging that a previous version of “exact match” was racially discriminatory. Kemp agreed to stop using it, but then the Republican-led legislature stepped in and wrote a new version of it into law so that the suppression could continue.

President Trump has irreversibly changed the Republican Party. The upheaval might seem unusual, but political transformations crop up throughout U.S. history. (Video: Adriana Usero, Danielle Kunitz, Robert Gebelhoff/The Washington Post)

There’s one more interesting twist to this story. How does Kemp justify his racially discriminatory policy? He says the fact that so many black voters are getting their registrations put on hold is the fault of the New Georgia Project, which seeks to register voters and was founded five years ago by none other than Stacey Abrams. The New Georgia Project, Kemp’s office claims, “did not adequately train canvassers to ensure legible, complete forms.” And sure, black people are getting their registrations held up at much higher rates, but that’s just because of “the higher usage of one method of registration among one particular demographic group.”

Kemp also says that this whole thing is being stirred up by “outside agitators,” which just happens to be the same name segregationists called those campaigning for civil rights during the Jim Crow era. You can be sure that no one in Georgia misunderstands the reference.

We have to keep saying this: Suppressing the votes of Democrats is the whole point of these laws and procedures. Republicans claim to worry about “voter fraud,” and journalists dutifully repeat those claims because when one party says something over and over, you’re supposed to treat it as though it is serious. But everyone knows it’s nonsense. Voter fraud is almost nonexistent, and Republicans aren’t motivated by some deeply held abstract principle about the integrity of elections that they apply whether it helps them or not. It’s just a lie.

It’s also an example of how Republicans, who complain all the time about the stifling hand of big government, use their power to weaponize bureaucracy against people they don’t like. They impose “work requirements” on programs such as Medicaid, forcing recipients to navigate a bureaucratic maze in order to maintain their benefits — and if you make a mistake on a form, you can lose your health insurance. Did someone input an “i” in your name when it’s actually an “l”? Sorry, we’re suspending your registration. Haven’t voted in a couple of elections? We’re purging you from the rolls.

Advertisement

The final and perhaps cruelest piece of this puzzle is that Republicans have closed off the legal avenues for voters to challenge these discriminatory policies. In 2013, the Republican majority on the Supreme Court eviscerated the Voting Rights Act, in a case involving Shelby County, Ala. In a bit of head-spinning illogic, Chief Justice G. Roberts Jr. wrote that “largely because of the Voting Rights Act,” racial discrimination in voting had been greatly reduced, and therefore it was time to gut the Voting Rights Act. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted in her dissent, destroying the Voting Rights Act because it had succeeded in limiting discrimination was “like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.” Because of the Shelby County v. Holder decision, legal challenges to Kemp’s actions are unlikely to succeed.

So we may wind up in Georgia with the same situation we’ve seen over and over again. Republicans gain power, then enact a series of policies and laws to make it harder for Democrats to vote. Democrats undertake a herculean effort to register and turn out voters, but when subsequent elections are extremely close, it turns out that the Republican vote suppression efforts were enough to make the difference.

That could well happen in Georgia, where we could see the race decided by a few thousand votes and tens of thousands of legitimate voters kept from the polls. Abrams has based her strategy on registering and turning out as many Democratic voters as possible, including those who haven’t participated before. Kemp’s strategy involves being the most troglodytic Trumpite he can be — and using the powers of his office to put just enough of a thumb on the scale to ensure his victory.

If Kemp wins, Republicans around the country will celebrate it as further proof of the efficacy of their vote suppression strategy. And knowing that the Supreme Court is likely to endorse whatever new suppression tactics they come up with, they’ll move even more aggressively to restrict access to the ballot."

Lee fought for the continued enslavement of black bodies. It was for states' rights, yes, but it was for states' rights to own slaves. I find myself saddened by the state of our nation.”

On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the point of his comments about Lee, which were made during an anecdote about Ohio-born President Ulysses S. Grant, was to praise the Union general.

Robert Lee IV caused some controversy after a speech at the MTV Video Music Awards in August 2017, a few days after the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville — held to protest the city’s plan to remove a statue of the Confederate general — where counterprotester Heather Heyer was killed. Lee, dressed in a black cleric’s shirt and collar, introduced himself as the descendant of the general “whose statue was at the center of violence in Charlottesville.”

“Today, I call on all of us with privilege and power to answer God’s call to confront racism and white supremacy head on,” he said. “We can find inspiration in the Black Lives Matter movement, the women who marched in the Women’s March in January, and, especially, Heather Heyer, who died fighting for her beliefs.”

Lee said later that he resigned from his post at Bethany United Church of Christ in Winston-Salem, N.C., after some members raised concerns about the attention the congregation was receiving because of his outspokenness. Some church members were troubled by his comments praising the Black Lives Matter movement, the Women’s March and Heyer, he said in a statement.

Lee is also working on a book about his younger years as a Confederate flag-flying teenager and how he came to denounce white supremacy, he told the Raleigh News & Observer in a November interview. The working title: “A Sin by Any Other Name: On Race, My Love Letter to the South.""

The Confederate general’s legacy has been highly scrutinized, and fights over whether to keep monuments dedicated to him and his part in history have consumed cities throughout the country. Historians say leaders such as Lee and Stonewall Jackson defended the Confederacy, which “existed for one reason, and that was to protect the right of people to own other people.”

But one other descendant who came directly from Lee’s lineage has a less cynical view. Robert E. Lee V, the general’s great-great-grandson and an athletic director at a school in McLean, Va., said many people don’t understand his ancestor’s legacy.

“We were never taught in our family that Robert E. Lee was fighting for slavery. He was fighting for the state of Virginia and for his homeland. He was never fighting to keep the institution of slavery alive,” Robert E. Lee V told The Washington Post’s Mike Semel in 2017.

He also criticized the right-wing extremists who espouse and hide behind his ancestor’s name. Dividing the country was not what his great-great-grandfather stood for, Lee said, adding that after the Confederate was defeated in the Civil War, the general called for unity.

Journalists over the past two decades have encountered some terrible fates. American reporters Daniel Pearl, James Foley and Steven Sotloff were abducted and beheaded by Islamist terrorists. Investigative reporters Anna Politkovskaya from Russia, Javier Valdez from Mexico and Daphne Caruana Galizia from Malta were all victims of targeted assassination.

But if what is alleged about the disappearance on Oct. 2 of Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi is true — that he was lured into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, then murdered and dismembered by a team dispatched by the Saudi royal court — it would be in a category of depravity all its own.

What makes Khashoggi’s alleged murder so chilling is its sheer brazenness.

Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) says there must be consequence for the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist who resided in Virginia. (Video: Kate Woodsome, Breanna Muir, Justin Scuiletti, Joy Yi/The Washington Post)

There is much we don’t know. Even if the intent was merely to abduct Khashoggi and not to kill him, how is it possible that Saudi Arabia — a vital U.S. ally that claims to be a responsible actor on the global stage — could consider such an action? Perhaps the reason is that those who use violence and repression to censor the media rarely face significant consequences.

Maybe this is also why so many journalists are being imprisoned and murdered. A record 262 journalists were jailed around the world at the end of last year, according to research by the Committee to Protect Journalists, the organization I lead. As the war in Syria has ebbed, the total number of journalists killed annually has come down from the low-to-mid 70s, but the number of murdered journalists has risen dramatically this year, to 27; there were 19 such deaths in all of 2016, and 18 last year. The suspects in the killings include criminal groups, terrorist organizations and governments. In about 90 percent of these cases, the perpetrators went unpunished.

Powerful forces around the world recognize the threat posed by independent information and are determined to control it. In areas of Mexico dominated by drug cartels, critical reporting is all but impossible. The Islamic State systematically hunted down and killed anyone who defied its blanket censorship. Governments, including those in Egypt and China, fear popular demonstrations and so suppress reporting on corruption and malfeasance that could bring people into the streets.

The crackdown is part of a broader global trend as Russia, North Korea and other authoritarian regimes have carried out extraterritorial attacks on their critics and faced only modest rebuke from the international community.

Meanwhile, a legitimate concern with the spread of disinformation and misinformation online is empowering the censors, including governments putting pressure on Internet companies to remove critical content they don’t like.

The crisis in press freedom is a threat to the global order. We live in the information age, yet the people who bring us news and information are being jailed, killed and censored at an unprecedented level. A decent respect for press freedom must be viewed as a guiding principle in international relations, a principle that cannot be sublimated to strategic considerations.

Governments that routinely violate the rights of journalists — either by tolerating violence against the press or perpetrating it themselves — must face significant consequences. That would include Myanmar, also known as Burma, which has sentenced two journalists from Reuters to seven years in prison in reprisal for their reporting on a massacre in which security forces were implicated.

The United States, where respect for press freedom is enshrined in the First Amendment, has a key role to play. Support for press freedom has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy with strong bipartisan support. Following the bitter vote to confirm Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, senators quickly came together to express their shared indignation at Khashoggi’s alleged murder. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Pence have also spoken out.

But one voice was largely missing until Wednesday. President Trump, who has cultivated a close relationship with the Saudi royal family, was slow to go beyond initially expressing “concern” before finally saying, on Wednesday, that “we cannot let this happen to reporters” and “we’re going to get to the bottom of it.” Better still would be an unequivocal demand that the Saudis come clean about Khashoggi’s disappearance. If anything remotely like what is alleged actually happened to Khashoggi, the president should ensure that it has profound and lasting consequences for the U.S.-Saudi relationship.

Of course, Trump has had an antagonistic relationship with the media and has mocked and attacked critical reporters. His regular denunciations of “fake news” are increasingly echoed by authoritarian leaders around the world. But that is all the more reason why speaking directly and forcefully about the Khashoggi disappearance would send a message to the Saudis that certain principles are inviolable. It would also send a message to all those around the world who routinely violate the rights of journalists and think they can get away with it that maybe – just maybe – they will be held to account."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has released a DNA test that suggests she has a distant Native American ancestor — a move that set off a fresh round of barbs Monday between the likely 2020 presidential contender and the current occupant of the Oval Office. A report distributed by Warren concludes that there is “strong evidence” that the senator had a Native American in her family tree dating back six to 10 generations, part of an extraordinary effort to discredit President Trump and others who have questioned her claims about her heritage.

The test results, after first being reported by the Boston Globe, were widely distributed to reporters Monday morning by Warren’s Senate campaign committee, along with a video on her upbringing and a link to a new “fact squad” website that seeks to debunk her critics.

The DNA analysis, by Carlos D. Bustamante, a Stanford University professor, concludes that “the vast majority” of Warren’s ancestry is European but that “the results strongly support the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor in the individual’s pedigree, likely in the range of 6-10 generations ago.”

Speaking to reporters Monday morning as he left the White House, Trump’s initial reaction to the DNA report was: “Who cares?”

“I hope she’s running for president because I think she’d be very easy,” he added. “I hope that she’s running. I do not think that she’d be difficult at all. She’ll destroy the country. She’ll make our country into Venezuela. With that being said, I don’t want to say bad things about her, because I hope she would be one of the people that would get through the process.”

Later, when asked whether he plans to honor a pledge he made in July to make a $1 million donation if Warren took a DNA test “and it shows you’re an Indian,” Trump laid out a new condition.

“I’ll only do it if I can test her personally,” Trump said during an exchange with reporters at an American Red Cross building in Macon, Ga., where he was touring areas hit by Hurricane Michael.

He added that testing Warren would “not be something I will enjoy doing, either.” It was not immediately clear what Trump meant by the comment.

Trump went on to mock Warren, saying that she “owes the country an apology.”

“How much? 1/1000th?” he said when asked about the DNA test results.

Trump has frequently mocked Warren’s claims about her heritage, calling her “Pocahontas.” During a freewheeling phone interview with Fox News last week, he asserted that the senator “faked her heritage,” adding: “I have more Indian blood in me than her, and I have none.”

In a tweet Monday morning, Warren reminded Trump of his promise to make a donation and chose a charity.

By the way, @realDonaldTrump: Remember saying on 7/5 that you’d give $1M to a charity of my choice if my DNA showed Native American ancestry? I remember – and here's the verdict. Please send the check to the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center: https://t.co/I6YQ9hf7Tv pic.twitter.com/J4gBamaeeo — Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 15, 2018

“Please send the check to the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center,” she wrote, describing the organization as “a nonprofit working to protect Native women from violence.”

Asked about his pledge Monday, Trump denied to reporters having made it.

“I didn’t say that. You better read it again,” Trump said as he left the White House en route to Florida to view hurricane damage.

At the July rally, Trump said, “I’m going to get one of those little [DNA testing] kits and in the middle of the [presidential] debate, when she proclaims she’s of Indian heritage.

“And we will say, ‘I will give you a million dollars, paid for by Trump, to your favorite charity, if you take the test and it shows you’re an Indian.’ And we’ll see what she does. I have a feeling she will say no, but we will hold it for the debates.”

After Trump spoke to reporters, Warren tweeted: “Having some memory problems, @realDonaldTrump? Should we call for a doctor?”

That timing in Bustamante’s DNA report fits Warren’s family lore, passed down during her Oklahoma upbringing, that her great-great-great-grandmother, O.C. Sarah Smith, was at least partially Native American, the Globe reported.

But the Republican National Committee seized on the report, suggesting that it did little to bolster her contention. The RNC pointed out that if Warren’s Native American ancestor was from 10 generations ago, that would make her less than 0.1 percent Native American.

“To put that in perspective, Warren might even be less Native American than the average European American,” the RNC said, pointing to a 2014 study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics that found that “European-Americans had genomes that were on average 98.6 percent European, .19 percent African, and .18 Native American.”

The video distributed by Warren’s campaign begins with Trump’s comments and features several of her relatives in Oklahoma, including some Republicans, saying they find them offensive.

Warren then narrates her family history.

“My mother was born in eastern Oklahoma,” she says. “It had been Indian territory until just a few years earlier, when it had become a state. My daddy always said he fell head over heels in love with my mother the first time he saw her.”

But she recounts that her father’s parents were “bitterly opposed” to a marriage because her mother’s family was partly Native American. So the couple eloped, she says.

The nearly six-minute video also tackles claims that Warren represented herself as a minority to advance as a law professor, a notion that White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, among others, have advanced.

The video shows Sanders making that claim from the White House briefing room and then shows interviews with several law professors who deny that Warren’s Native American heritage played a role in her hiring or advancement. Her colleagues also tout Warren’s skills as a teacher.

Bustamante, a genetics professor, is also featured in the video, which closes with Warren taking aim at Trump, saying: “Trump can say whatever he wants about me, but mocking Native Americans or any group to try to get at me, that’s not what America stands for.”

I took this test and released the results for anyone who cares to see because I’ve got nothing to hide. What are YOU hiding, @realDonaldTrump? Release your tax returns – or the Democratic-led House will do it for you soon enough. Tick-tock, Mr President. — Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 15, 2018

Later Monday morning on Twitter, Warren continued to goad Trump,

“I took this test and released the results for anyone who cares to see because I’ve got nothing to hide,” she wrote. “What are YOU hiding, @realDonaldTrump? Release your tax returns — or the Democratic-led House will do it for you soon enough. Tick-tock, Mr President.”

Warren previously cited family stories to claim Cherokee and Delaware Indian heritage, and her background has been publicly questioned since at least 2012.

In a February speech to the National Congress of American Indians, Warren rebuked Trump’s persistent mockery of her as “Pocahontas” and spoke in detail about her family’s history.

In August, she made her personnel files available to the Boston Globe, showing that ethnicity was not a factor in her rise as a law professor.

Warren has been building an expansive shadow war room designed to help elect Democrats across the country in next month’s midterm elections and bolster her presence in key states that hold 2020 nominating contests.

She has deployed staffers to all four early primary or caucus states — two to New Hampshire and one each to Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada — as well as to traditional powerhouses such as Ohio, Florida, Michigan and Wisconsin.

Warren is seeking reelection herself in Massachusetts next month and is expected to easily win a second Senate term.

She has said she will “take a hard look”at running for president after the midterms."

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-18/trump-vows-military-will-close-mexican-border-to-stop-migrants?srnd=premium",0,"Facing a sharp increase in unauthorized immigration, President Trump on Thursday lashed out at Democrats and the leaders of Latin American nations, seeking to deflect blame and mitigate political damage by riling up his base just weeks before the midterm elections. The president’s mounting frustration was evident in a series of tweets in which he threatened to summon the military to guard the southern border, cut off aid to Central American nations and upend a recent trade deal with Mexico if those governments fail to stop a large caravan of migrants from Honduras making its way toward the United States.

Trump likely lacks the legal authority to carry out all of those drastic measures without congressional approval, but the threats highlighted the potentially perilous political implications for the White House as voters prepare to go to the polls with Republican control of Congress in the balance. In recent campaign rallies, Trump has sought to rally conservatives by asserting falsely that Democrats are in favor of “open borders” and that they favor increased crime.

“All Democrats fault for weak laws!” Trump wrote in one tweet, adding later: “Can you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?” The second tweet included a video clip of unknown origin that showed men, speaking Spanish, handing out slips of paper to people in lines carrying bags. The footage was identical to a clip posted by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who claimed it showed cash payments to Hondurans to join the caravan and suggested, without evidence, that the money came from a Democratic megadonor.

Republicans are facing a difficult election on Nov. 6, with polls showing Democrats holding an advantage on the general ballot and prognosticators favoring them to win control of the House. As pressure mounts, nerves have begun to fray inside the White House, with national security adviser John Bolton and Chief of Staff John F. Kelly engaging in a shouting match over immigration just outside the Oval Office on Thursday, according to White House aides.

Bolton had accused Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen of not doing enough to stem the surge in border crossings, and Kelly, who preceded Nielsen in the homeland security job and handpicked her as his successor, came to her defense, aides said. They described the argument as profane and loud enough to draw stares from others in the West Wing.

A White House official said Nielsen came to Bolton’s office after the fight and the two had a positive conversation about her department and the border.

While some GOP leaders in the House had initially hoped to focus their election message on the economy, Trump has continued to highlight immigration, confident that his hard-line views on enforcement will motivate his base and carry significant crossover appeal to independent and moderate voters who helped him win in 2016.

Many Republican candidates, especially in Senate races in states Trump won in 2016, have modeled attack ads on Trump’s rhetoric, aiming to raise public fears over the dangers of illegal immigration. Recent polls show that voters in both parties rank immigration among the top issues that will affect their choices in next month’s elections.

“The border is a big issue for Republican base voters who are already energized after Kavanaugh,” said Chris Wilson, a ­Republican pollster working on battleground races, referring to the contentious Supreme Court confirmation battle over Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. “A reminder that illegal immigration is a real problem and that we just don’t know who is entering our country can only boost Republican interest.”

Democrats dismissed Trump’s accusations as a sign of weakness from a president desperate to escape electoral consequences for failing to make good on his signature campaign promise to reduce illegal immigration.

Border Patrol agents arrested more than 16,000 immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border in September, the highest total on record and an increase of 80 percent since July, when Trump reversed his administration’s policy of separating immigrant children from their parents after a public outcry.

In all, more than 107,000 family members were taken into custody in fiscal 2018, obliterating the previous high of just under 78,000 in 2016.

“It’s pretty clear that the things this administration has attempted to address the situation at the border are failing,” said Cecilia Muñoz, an analyst at the think tank New America who served as a White House domestic policy adviser in the Obama administration. “As is typical, this president is trying to lay the blame elsewhere.”

The immigration increase this year, after a sharp drop in the first six months of his presidency, has complicated Trump’s immigration message. In response, he has exhorted aides to enact more extreme policies, including making it more difficult for immigrants to seek asylum protections and measures aimed at increasing criminal prosecutions of unauthorized border-crossers.

The White House is also considering a new policy, known as “binary choice,” which would detain migrant families together and give parents a choice — stay in immigration jail with their child for months or years as their asylum case proceeds, or allow their child to be assigned to a government shelter while a relative or guardian can apply to gain custody.

In his tweets Thursday, Trump aimed to ramp up pressure on foreign governments.

“In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught — and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!” Trump said in one tweet.

In another, he suggested that the “onslaught” of immigrants could undermine a recently announced reworked trade deal with Mexico and Canada, writing that immigration is “far more important to me, as President, than Trade.”

The new deal, which replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement, has yet to be signed by the three countries. Congress is not expected to ratify it before next year.

In recent years, Mexico has detained and deported far more Central Americans attempting to cross Mexico on the way to the United States. Still, Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala remains relatively easy for migrants to cross.

In the wake of Trump’s warnings, the Mexican government signaled that it would take a more restrictive stance on the caravan of migrants this time. Planeloads of federal police have arrived at Mexico’s southern border and are positioned at crossing points. The Mexican Foreign Ministry requested assistance Thursday from the U.N. Refugee Agency in processing Central American refu­gee claims.

The incoming government of Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who takes office in December, campaigned on a softer approach to migrants, saying that protecting their human rights should be a top priority and that they shouldn’t be treated like criminals.

But in response to the latest caravan from Honduras, said to number up to 4,000 people, top officials on López Obrador’s transition team have suggested that they would move to block such large groups of people.

“Mexico can’t say that any caravan can pass to the United States,” Marcelo Ebrard, the incoming foreign minister, said Thursday on Mexican radio.

Mexican government leaders are “trying to perform a very difficult balancing act — on one hand with Trump watching and on the other hand with the Mexican population watching,” said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a professor at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City.

Immigration is likely to be discussed Friday when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to meet with outgoing Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto.

In Washington, no matter how the midterm elections play out, the issue could come to a head in December.

Trump had threatened to force a partial government shutdown in the fall to force Congress to authorize billions of dollars for his proposed border wall. Instead, he signed a stopgap spending measure, setting up a potential fight over the wall in the congressional session between the election and the new Congress.

“Any purely enforcement-oriented solution will only move the needle in the short term,” said Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney who served as an aide to Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “Over the long-term, in order to solve that, he has to either be realistic about a bi­partisan solution and work with Congress — or continue to demagogue it as a political issue, but that’s not going to solve it.”"
4384,4384,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/10/19/president-trump-greenlights-assaults-on-reporters/?noredirect=on,0,"When he was called to the podium at a rally in Missoula, Mont., on Thursday night, Rep. Greg Gianforte had this to say to the main speaker: “Let me just say, on behalf of all of Montana, Mr. President, thank you for giving us hope again.” With that, Mr. President delivered his message of hope by endorsing the physical abuse of journalists.

“Never wrestle him. You understand that? Never. Any guy who can do a body-slam. He’s my kind of,” said President Trump, mimicking the act of body-slamming someone,”he’s my guy. … So I was in Rome with a lot of the leaders from other countries … And I heard about it. And we endorsed Greg very early, but I had heard that he body-slammed a reporter.”

Applause and cheers rose from the audience.

“And he was way up. And he was way up, and I said … ‘Oh, this is terrible, he’s going to lose the election.’ Then I said, ‘Well, wait a minute, I know Montana pretty well, I think it might help him.’ And it did. Nah, he’s a great guy. Tough cookie.”

Want to know what a “tough cookie” is Gianforte? He’s such a “tough cookie” that when Ben Jacobs, a reporter for the Guardian, approached him in May 2017 with a question about health-care policy, Gianforte tried to duck the question. When pressed, he simply short-circuited, grabbed Jacobs, slammed him to the floor and cheap-shotted him. He’s that much of a “tough cookie.”

The Erik Wemple Blog has written about the incident too many times, thanks in part to Trump himself, who last month, at another Montana rally, asserted that Gianforte had fought for the state”in more ways than one.” He also credited with being a “true champion” and a “fighter and a winner.”

Follow this author Erik Wemple 's opinions Follow

Apparently Trump doesn’t find much of a distinction between “fighting” and “attacking a defenseless reporter who’s just trying to get a question answered.”

The latter is a criminal offense, which is why the body-slam ended up on a court of law. The congressman pleaded guilty to the offense but received no jail time, instead getting a sentence of community service, anger management and a fine. He also apologized for his behavior, calling it “unprofessional, unacceptable and unlawful.” The regret at least appeared genuine, and surely Gianforte wished he’d put this much-covered episode behind him.

The problem is that it impressed Trump. A congressman who’s a sufficiently “tough cookie” to assault an unsuspecting reporter, and then go on to win an election: That’s just too irresistible a sequence for a demagogue with an arena full of people to fire up. Just think of all the people out there learning, perhaps for the first time, how to impress the president of the United States. Go out there and show him what a “tough cookie” you are.

In a statement last year, Jacobs himself said, “While I have no doubt that actions like these were an aberration for Congressman-elect Gianforte personally, I worry that, in the context of our political debate, they have become increasingly common. In recent years, our discourse has grown increasingly rancorous and increasingly vile. This needs to stop.”

It hasn’t, and it won’t so long as Trump remains president. With most incorrigible and corrupt people, there’s always a hope that, when they come face to face with the awfulness of their ways, they might just retreat. It has become clear that with Trump, there’s no such hope. In late summer came the news that a 68-year-old California man, Robert Chain, had allegedly made a series of death threats against journalists at the Boston Globe while invoking the anti-media language of the president. “You’re the enemy of the people, and we’re going to kill every f—ing one of you,” Chain allegedly said in one threat.

Yet Trump plows ahead. Guardian US Editor John Mulholland released this statement:

The president of the United States tonight applauded the assault on an American journalist who works for the Guardian. To celebrate an attack on a journalist who was simply doing his job is an attack on the first amendment by someone who has taken an oath to defend it. In the aftermath of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, it runs the risk of inviting other assaults on journalists both here and across the world where they often face far greater threats. We hope decent people will denounce these comments and that the president will see fit to apologize for them.

Decent people are already denouncing these comments. As for a presidential apology, well, that would be a sign of weakness from a man who admires “tough cookies.”"

The Bedford Police Department said a suspicious package was discovered Monday afternoon by an “employee of the residence.” Police didn’t specify who owned the home, but town records show that it is co-owned by Soros Fund Management, a family office operated by Soros. Inside the package was what appeared to be an explosive device, police said. The employee placed the material in a wooded area and notified authorities at 3:45 p.m. Monday.

Authorities in Bedford — which includes the hamlet of Katonah, where the residence is located — said an “extensive investigation commenced,” also involving the Westchester County Police Department, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the FBI. The case has since been turned over to the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force. The FBI’s New York office said in a tweet late Monday that it was investigating and that there was no threat to the public.

We are conducting an investigation at and around a residence in Bedford, NY. There is no threat to public safety, and we have no further comment at this time. — FBI New York (@NewYorkFBI) October 23, 2018

The Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization run by Soros, didn’t immediately return a request for comment. The Times of Israel reported that Soros, a billionaire hedge fund manager and prominent donor to Democratic and other causes, was not home at the time.

The 88-year-old Holocaust survivor has funneled much of his fortune into liberal projects worldwide, including in his native Hungary, which has taken an illiberal, nationalist turn under Prime Minister Viktor Orban. After he won reelection in April, Orban wasted no time in pushing a “Stop Soros” bill designed to crack down on nongovernmental organizations, think tanks and other liberal institutions. Justified in the name of deterring illegal immigration, the measure was passed in June.

The Hungarian government’s attack on Soros, which relies on anti-Semitic tropes, has fed into a conspiracy theory that casts the Jewish philanthropist as the director of a global cabal intent on flooding the West with migrants and undermining national sovereignty. Soros has become an archrival invoked by autocrats and far-right activists worldwide.

President Trump bought into the conspiracy theory this month when he tweeted that protesters opposing the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court were “paid for by Soros and others.”

The very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad. Don’t fall for it! Also, look at all of the professionally made identical signs.

It was a claim also made by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and by Rudolph W. Giuliani, a lawyer for Trump. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York, retweeted a message calling Soros the “anti-Christ.”"
4418,4418,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/10/24/migrant-caravan-updates/?utm_term=.410bbab3c492,0,"Large groups of Central American migrants are traveling north through Mexico, defying President Trump. Although Trump has described the groups as “invaders,” those making the journey are unarmed, and many are women and children who say their goal is to seek asylum in the United States. We have been tracking the caravans' advance through Mexico and U.S. preparations for their arrival at the border. What you need to know:

Several hundred members of the first caravan have arrived in Tijuana, and thousands more are expected to arrive in the coming days

The Pentagon has deployed nearly 6,000 troops to the border in anticipation of the caravan’s arrival

The Trump administration will deny asylum to anyone who crosses the border illegally, urging migrants to come to ports of entry

Why is the caravan going all the way to Tijuana to reach the U.S. border? One reason is “El Chapo.”

Last week, after caravan members recuperated for several days at a Mexico City sports complex, they held a vote. The group opted to travel all the way to Tijuana, Mexico’s largest border city, instead of taking a much shorter route toward the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas.

So why would they decide to go more than twice as far to reach the U.S. border?

The simplest explanation is that the activist group guiding the caravan, Pueblo Sin Fronteras (People Without Borders), has a strong support network in California, a “sanctuary” state where local officials and courts are more sympathetic to migrants.

But there’s another, idiosyncratic reason the caravan is going all the way to Tijuana: its reputation as a safer route, where migrants are less vulnerable to the kidnapping gangs and extortionists that prey on Central Americans.

This has to do, in no small part, with the legacy of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, the indicted Mexican drug kingpin whose federal grand jury trial began this week in New York.

Over nearly three decades, Guzmán built the Sinaloa drug cartel into the world’s wealthiest and most powerful trafficking organization. And despite his capture, the Sinaloa group continues to dominate the most lucrative drug smuggling routes along Mexico’s Pacific coast and into California, including the grand jewel of the North American narcotics trade, the San Ysidro port of entry. Which is also the destination for the migrant caravan.

Connecting Tijuana to California, San Ysidro is the world’s busiest border crossing, receiving nearly 100,000 northbound vehicles and pedestrians a day. It is also the single largest gateway for high-value narcotics into the United States, accounting for nearly half of the hard drugs-- heroin, cocaine, fentanyl and methamphetamine-- seized along the entire border, smuggled mostly in fake vehicle compartments.

Under Guzmán, Sinaloa waged sanguinary warfare against its rivals, eventually winning control of the entire western portion of the U.S.-Mexico border. But Sinaloa became so dominant in the North American drug trade that the criminal groups along Mexico’s eastern border (opposite Texas) developed a different criminal portfolio, especially starting in the late 2000s, in order to compete.

The two most powerful groups there, the Gulf Cartel and its now-diminished but still-dreaded rival, Los Zetas, were overshadowed and outsmarted by Guzmán in the drug trade, so they looked to diversify into other sources of revenue. Central American migration to the United States was increasing, and these groups saw tens of thousands of Hondurans, Guatemala and Salvadorans passing through areas under their control to reach the Rio Grande. Many were riding on freight trains and buses. It wasn’t hard to find them.

In 2010, Los Zetas kidnapped and massacred 72 migrants on a remote ranch an hour south of the U.S. border, an act of horrifying depravity with a ruthless business objective. The group was determined to extract profits from every migrant and smuggling guide passing through its territory. Anyone who didn’t pay risked kidnapping, torture and death. And those who didn’t pay enough could be abducted and held for ransom until relatives living in the United States handed over their life savings. They knew that almost everyone heading north had a relative or loved one financing the journey.

Their reign of terror has taken a terrible toll. Mexican human rights officials have discovered more than 1,300 mass graves since 2007, and an untold number of Central American migrants have gone missing in the Gulf Coast Mexican states of Veracruz and Tamaulipas along the route to south Texas.

This sordid state of affairs never fully developed along Mexico’s Pacific Coast and the areas under the control of Guzmán Sinaloa cartel. The Sinaloans would sometimes abduct young men and impress them into service as drug mules, fitting them with marijuana-stuffed backpacks for a grueling trek through the Arizona desert. But some Central Americans viewed this as a mutually beneficial arrangement. A free guided trip into the United States was the price for carrying Sinaloan brick weed.

You would also hear from many Mexicans that Guzmán was a drug kingpin who lived by a code, like the Sicilian mob bosses or the Omar character in “The Wire.” A tunnel-digging, meth-making, cocaine-shipping mastermind, and a killer, but not a monster who kidnaps and butchers humble Central American migrants. This appeared to explain, more than anything, why Central Americans were routinely murdered and disappeared in one part of Mexico but not (or far less) in another.

So when it came time last week for caravan members to pick between a shorter route to Texas or a much longer one to Tijuana, they chose the latter.

One leads to the migrant version of Mordor. The other is merely dangerous.

Hasn’t illegal immigration declined by a lot? Why all the fuss over a few thousand people in caravans?

In 2000, the year before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. Border Patrol made 1.6 million arrests along the Mexico border, a record. The agency had fewer than half as many agents in the field then, and in several areas along the border those agents would spend an entire shift rounding up and deporting large numbers of migrants who were overwhelmingly from Mexico and male.

The Arizona deserts were the border’s busiest place, and agents in the Tucson sector made more than 50,000 arrests every month that year. As one agent who worked during that era told The Post, “it was like a riot every night.”

The prevailing currents at the border have completely changed since then. Last year, the Border Patrol made 303,916 apprehensions, the lowest level since 1971, and while that figure jumped to 396,579 during the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, border arrests remain far closer to historic lows. (See table below.)

So what’s the big deal with a few thousand people in a caravan? Why is the Trump administration claiming there is a “crisis” at the border?

The big change — and the thing that is so galling to Border Patrol agents and the Trump administration more broadly — is that the government now has an extremely difficult time detaining and deporting the migrants taken into custody. They’re Central American families and kids seeking asylum, not Mexican laborers who are, by comparison, easy to deport.

Basically, the government’s enforcement model is being short-circuited by Central American migrants who, unlike Mexican nationals, cannot be bused to the border and deported. This new wave of migrants consists increasingly of parents with children who request humanitarian protection and express a fear of return, steps that slow or stop their deportation.

This is the administrative path to a shot at a better life in America.

Most migrants who arrive with children turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents and go through a screening to see if their fears are “credible.” They typically spend a few days in custody, and then they are released pending a court appearance for their asylum claims, because courts have limited the government’s ability to hold kids in immigration jails for longer than 20 days.

This is the model the Trump administration abhors as “catch and release” even as the practice has become its de facto enforcement policy at the border.

One result is that more than half of all those taken into custody along the Mexico border today are family groups or underage minors traveling alone. And the number of “family units” (consisting of at least one parent and child) is at a record high.

So while the migrant caravans moving their way north — perhaps 5,000 to 10,000 travelers in total — amount to only 10 to 20 percent of the 50,000 or so people arrested along the border each month, they symbolize what has become, for the Trump administration, a real crisis for its enforcement model.

This is why we’re also likely to see new administrative attempts to tighten the asylum process, perhaps in the coming days, while the caravans remain more than 600 miles from the U.S. border.

Trump is threatening to jail caravan migrants in “massive tent cities” and warned that U.S. troops could fire on anyone throwing rocks. Did that scare anyone?

The Washington Post’s Michael E. Miller spoke to caravan members late Thursday, as news of Trump’s speech reached their encampment in Matias Romero Avendano, Mexico. Here’s his dispatch:

The migrants were resting in a soggy sports field on the edge of town, a few miles from where Mexican families celebrated the Day of the Dead in the town cemetery. “They won’t shoot because we’re not criminals,” Erik Miranda, 39, said of Trump’s threat that U.S. troops would open fire if attacked with rocks. “I lived there for 15 years. I know the United States is a country of laws.” Miranda said he had been deported from America twice despite asking for asylum after being shot three times by the 18th Street gang in his native Honduras. “If the caravan reaches the border and enters, these people will have their day in court in front of a judge,” he said. Miranda said he would not try to enter the United States again but instead was hoping to reach Mexico City, where he planned to request asylum. “How horrible,” Daniela Carbajal, 27, said when told of Trump’s threat. “I’m not justifying throwing rocks but remember: We have children among us.” As she spoke, her 9-year-old son, Oscar, watched a video advising migrants of their rights, his head poking out of an orange tent Carbajal and her husband had just bought for 150 pesos. Inside, her 3-year-old daughter, Karla, was sound asleep.

Could Trump’s military deployment turn lethal, and under what circumstances are U.S. troops authorized to use force?

Share this article Share

Trump’s threats carry a not-so-veiled suggestion of military force. Such a scenario has long been promoted by extremists who believe lethal violence is an acceptable response to illegal border crossings. And the president himself repeatedly depicts the migrants in warlike terms, characterizing their journey as an “invasion” consisting of “tough fighters” who “fought back hard and viciously against Mexico,” according to his tweets.

All of this raises a disturbing question: Under what circumstances would U.S. troops open fire?

The Pentagon has been deeply wary of such a scenario. The 2,000 or so National Guard troops who have been assigned to the border since April are not supposed to make arrests or carry weapons, as a general rule. And active-duty forces are limited by the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th-century law curbing troops' ability to carry out law enforcement duties on U.S. soil.

At the border, the use of active-duty forces has also been haunted by a 1997 fatal shooting of a teenage shepherd — an American citizen — who U.S. Marines thought was a drug runner.

The new deployment, an operation the Pentagon is calling “Faithful Patriot,” appears less troubled by such a possibility. The troops — at least 5,200 but maybe more — will include armed units, and their rules of engagement appear to be significantly less restrictive.

The latest caravan groups have acted more unruly and confrontational toward authorities in their path. One contingent broke through a gate at the Guatemala-Mexico border last month, and members of a second caravan pelted Mexican police with bottles and stones. A man from Honduras died in the clashes, apparently struck in the head by a rubber bullet.

If a large part of the caravan reaches the U.S. border — by no means a sure thing — U.S. authorities fear a large crowd could attempt to overrun U.S. barriers and enter the country by force. But that alone would not be sufficient to justify a lethal response from troops.

As The Post’s Paul Sonne, Dan Lamothe and Missy Ryan report, citing Pentagon planning documents, “troops will deploy with a mixture of lethal and nonlethal weapons and are authorized to use deadly force in defense of ‘all persons, foreign or domestic, who are faced with imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm, and where lesser means have failed or cannot be reasonably employed.’”

That said, the soldiers are supposed to operate in an auxiliary role. The Border Patrol and U.S. customs officers will be the ones making arrests and potentially confronting caravan members if they attempt to enter the country unlawfully.

Among the activities the soldiers are supposed to carry out: constructing barriers and fencing, providing helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to transport Border Patrol agents and providing medical care.

How did this caravan get so big?

The United Nations estimated that more than 7,000 people have joined the caravan, although the size of the group appears to be fluid. Most of those traveling north are from Honduras, where the caravan originated. There has been no evidence of any “Middle Easterners” in the group’s ranks, as Trump has alleged.

Predictions about how many of its members will eventually reach the U.S. border are difficult to make. It is probable that the caravan’s size will remain elastic as some drop out or turn back, and others join in.

It’s important to remember that more than 50,000 people were taken into custody last month along the U.S.-Mexico border, so even if 5,000 caravan members go all the way, they would represent a fraction of current flows. As one Homeland Security official put it: “We get a caravan every day.”

Many of the migrants have told reporters that their decision to leave was made in a flash. They had been waiting for an opportunity to come along but could not afford to attempt the journey any other way. The cost of hiring a “coyote” smuggling guide to go from Central America to the United States can exceed $10,000. But grabbing a backpack and hitting the road with a mass movement? That’s free.

And on a route beset by kidnapping gangs, extortionists and other predatory criminals, joining a caravan offers a degree of protection. There’s safety in numbers, and the processions attract many police officers.

Why doesn’t the Mexican government stop the caravan?

The Trump administration is leaning hard on Mexico to make a stand and block the group’s advance. There are several reasons that has not happened — and remains unlikely to happen anytime soon.

A big one: The six-year term of President Enrique Peña Nieto will end Dec. 1. He is one of the most unpopular presidents in recent Mexican history. He has little incentive to use escalating force on impoverished Central Americans to appease Trump. That would be humiliating for him.

Mexico already is taking steps it has not in the past, soliciting help from the United Nations to screen and process asylum seekers, and the government says that more than 1,000 caravan members have done so. Mexican federal police officers also held off the caravan at the border with Guatemala last week, although many of those migrants simply waded through the river to continue their journey.

It is important to note that there is little stigma in Mexico to joining a caravan like this in hopes of reaching the United States. Poor Central American migrants are treated more like pilgrims than criminals. When they arrive in Mexican towns, people offer food, clothing and other donations as a way to support them and to encourage them to move on.

In a heavily Catholic country, and at a time when Pope Francis has urged sympathy and support for migrants worldwide, many Mexicans think they have a moral duty to help the caravan. An attempt by their government to repress the caravan by force would clash with that sentiment and court political disaster.

Trump’s show of force at the border is an election ploy, right?

The president’s political calculation here is impossible to ignore. He seems determined to make the caravan appear as dangerous and threatening as possible — and to cast himself as a kind of border sheriff. He has claimed, without evidence, that “Middle Easterners” have infiltrated the group. Administration officials insist that the caravan is full of gang members and criminals, again without proof, because, well, odds are that bad people are mixed in.

That said, the migrant caravan, and another one with about 3,000 people that crossed into Mexico on Monday, have stirred up some bona fide fretting at the Department of Homeland Security. The scenes from the Guatemala-Mexico border last week, in which thousands of people broke down a border gate and forced their way into Mexico, are nightmare scenarios for DHS.

The White House wants a travel ban for the Mexico border. How would that work?

The Post and other media outlets have reported on a plan under consideration at the White House that would use the president’s executive powers to deny entry to Central Americans, and restrict or suspend their ability to seek asylum in the United States. Details of the proposal remain sketchy, but draft versions would rely on the same legal provisions the administration used during the travel ban in early 2017.

By citing national security concerns, Trump could refuse entry to certain Central American nationals or another subgroup, including members of the caravan. Trump is also weighing a measure that would deny asylum seekers the ability to seek humanitarian relief once they reach U.S. soil, according to administration officials and people familiar with the proposals.

Both moves would land the administration in federal court “in about five minutes,” one former Homeland Security official said, and it’s not hard to imagine lower court judges slapping an injunction on a White House “border ban” in about as much time.

Trump already won legal victories on this front. Wouldn’t a ban on Central Americans and asylum denials stop the caravan?

Not likely. The administration’s biggest challenge at the border is not that too many Central American migrants are being allowed in or that they are easily winning asylum. Rather, those who cross illegally — between ports of entry — must be taken into custody. U.S. detention capacity is nearly maxed, and U.S. courts limit the government’s ability to keep children in immigration jails beyond 20 days.

It is not as though huge numbers of Central Americans are winning asylum, either. The latest statistics show that fewer than 10 percent of Central American applicants are granted asylum by an immigration judge, but it is the act of coming over, applying for it and waiting for the legal process to play out that has become such an alluring way for impoverished migrants to live and work in the United States, if only for a few years.

That brings us the big flaw with the Trump administration’s proposal for a “ban.”

It is one thing to do it at a foreign airport thousands of miles away. It is another to try it on the banks of the Rio Grande. If members of the caravan reach the U.S. border and are denied the ability to approach ports of entry — the official crossings — they probably will go to the river or into the desert where they can walk across.

Then they will be on U.S. soil. The Border Patrol will have to take them into custody. Unless Mexico agrees to take them back, the migrants would have to be held in detention until they can be deported. But if the migrants are accompanied by children, the government has virtually nowhere to put them.

Didn’t Trump already deploy the National Guard to the border?

Yes. Trump sent U.S. troops to the border this spring, when another caravan piqued his anger and fueled similarly bombastic tweets. At the time, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis authorized the deployment of up to 4,000 National Guard troops but restricted their activities — so they don’t make arrests, carry weapons or interact with migrants.

About 1,600 Guard troops remain along the border, mostly in Texas.

U.S. Border Patrol officials insist that the Guard troops are a big help, saying they free up agents to concentrate on drug interdiction and enforcement duties “along the front line.""

The Guard forces fly drones, monitor sensors and operate other surveillance equipment. They perform data entry tasks at Border Patrol stations. Others have been assigned more mundane jobs such as clearing vegetation and tending to horse stables.

Isn’t that what happened with the last caravan — the one that angered Trump earlier this year?

Yes. That caravan, organized by a migration activist group, Pueblo Sin Fronteras, grew to about 1,500 people at one point. About 400 ended up crossing into the United States to seek asylum.

The big difference? That caravan was organized. It had leaders, legal advisers and a support network in the United States and Mexico. Most important, it had chartered buses.

Rather than attempting to cross in the Rio Grande Valley — the closest place, geographically, to Central America — that caravan traveled all the way to Tijuana. That made sense, because it had a large contingent of supporters on the California side. The caravan’s legal advisers steered members to the U.S. ports of entry, where it is legal to enter the United States to request asylum."

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/10/29/pittsburgh-shooting-some-jewish-leaders-dont-want-trump-visit/1805115002/",0,"More than 35,000 people have signed an open letter to President Trump from the leaders of a Pittsburgh-based Jewish group who say the president will not be welcome in the city unless he denounces white nationalism and stops “targeting” minorities after a mass shooting Saturday at a local synagogue left 11 dead.

Nevertheless, the White House announced Trump would travel to Pittsburgh on Tuesday, ignoring the letter as well as a plea from Pittsburgh’s mayor that the president at least refrain from visiting “while we are burying the dead.” The first of the funerals for the 11 shooting victims is expected to take place Tuesday.

The open letter, which was published and shared on Sunday, was written by 11 members of the Pittsburgh affiliate of Bend the Arc, a national organization for progressive Jews focused on social justice, following what is being called the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. The shooting at Tree of Life synagogue also left several people injured, including law enforcement.

“For the past three years your words and your policies have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,” the Jewish leaders wrote. “You yourself called the murderer evil, but yesterday’s violence is the direct culmination of your influence.""

The letter continued: “Our Jewish community is not the only group you have targeted. You have also deliberately undermined the safety of people of color, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Yesterday’s massacre is not the first act of terror you incited against a minority group in our country.”

The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the letter.

Trump has continued tweeting incendiary statements since the synagogue massacre, indicating he does not intend to tone down his rhetoric. On Sunday night and Monday morning, the president blamed “Fake News” for causing division, hatred and “great anger” in the country. He reinstated his controversial branding of the press as “the true Enemy of the People.”

In a subsequent tweet, Trump congratulated the newly elected president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right nationalist with a history of denigrating women, gays and minorities. He also once again amplified unsubstantiated statements about the Central American migrant caravan, claiming without evidence there were gang members and “some very bad people” mixed into the group and warning it was an impending “invasion” of the United States.

During a television appearance Monday morning, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway responded to another request for the president to stay away from Pittsburgh from Lynette Lederman, the former president of Tree of Life synagogue, who has said she considers Trump a “purveyor of hate speech.”

“I know that she’s very grief stricken, I can imagine, and my heartfelt condolences go to her, and everybody in that congregation regardless of politics,” Conway said on CNN. “Many people are welcoming the president to go there and to help heal.”

On Saturday, Trump strongly condemned the shooting as “pure evil,” adding the “vile, hate-filled poison of anti-Semitism” and all other forms of prejudice must be rejected, The Washington Post reported. The president also announced he would be making a visit to Pittsburgh.

...This evil Anti-Semitic attack is an assault on humanity. It will take all of us working together to extract the poison of Anti-Semitism from our world. We must unite to conquer hate. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2018

News of the president’s possible travel plans did not sit well with Joshua Friedman, who is one of the leaders of Bend the Arc’s Pittsburgh chapter.

“My immediate reaction was he is not welcome here,” Friedman, who does not attend services at Tree of Life, told The Post in a Sunday phone interview. “I immediately wrote to the rest of our steering committee that he is not welcome, we have to make that clear.”

Four boldfaced lines stand out from the rest of the letter’s 338 words.

“President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism.”

“President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you stop targeting and endangering all minorities.”

“President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you cease your assault on immigrants and refugees.”

“President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you commit yourself to compassionate, democratic policies that recognize the dignity of all of us.”

Bend the Arc was founded in 2012 as an advocacy organization. Three years later, with the help of Alexander Soros, son of liberal philanthropist George Soros, the group launched the first Jewish political action committee focused on dealing solely with domestic issues, the Forward reported. According to its website, the group supports “everyone threatened by the Trump agenda,” and Alexander Soros is the chair of its board of directors. The Pittsburgh chapter was created shortly after the 2016 election, Friedman said.

On Sunday, Friedman read the letter, which is also signed by the group’s other 10 leaders, aloud in front of the White House during an afternoon vigil organized by Bend the Arc. To his surprise, he said the crowd began reading the boldfaced sentences with him.

“People are on board,” Friedman said, describing the experience as “powerful” and “energizing.” “People are hearing the words. People understand why we need do this.”

In recent days, Trump’s critics have alleged his incendiary rhetoric has contributed to the current climate of violence — a claim the president and members of the GOP vehemently oppose. Last week, more than 10 pipe bombs were discovered nationwide targeting people including former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama as well as employees at CNN. Cesar Sayoc, who is suspected of mailing the bombs, is a vocal Trump supporter who often ranted about people or organizations the president clashed with, The Post reported.

After the shooting at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, many politicians condemned the violence and blamed divisive political rhetoric around the country. (Video: Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)

Trump has also come under fierce criticism for failing to condemn white supremacists, such as the ones present in Charlottesville last year. After violence broke out at the city’s Unite the Right rally in August 2017, leaving one woman dead and many others injured, the president said he thought there was “blame on both sides,” The Post’s David Nakamura reported.

Robert Bowers, the man arrested after Saturday’s deadly mass shooting, was active on a social media site known to be frequented by white supremacists, neo-Nazis and others with extreme beliefs that may not be tolerated on more-mainstream platforms, The Post reported. A user with Bowers’s name espoused anti-Semitic views — comparing Jews to Satan, for example — and often expressed racism against African Americans, using the n-word in nearly 20 posts.

“We feel like there have been multiple communities under attack in the United States from the vitriol that the president has been spreading,” Friedman said. “It was the Jewish community’s turn. Blowback from his words came and cost people’s lives, and we said enough is enough.”

If the president decides to visit Pittsburgh without meeting the letter’s demands, Friedman said, he expects Trump will “only be met with derision.”

“We will let him know how unhappy we are with his presence, with his lack of leadership,” he said. “He will see all of Pittsburgh in the streets. It’s not just going to be the people that signed on to the letter. It’s going to be everybody.""

Friedman added, “If he’s going to come to our city, he’s going to come on our terms.”

In a key economic snapshot before Tuesday’s vote, the Labor Department’s monthly jobs report showed that the typical worker’s earnings rose by 3.1 percent in the past year — the biggest such leap since 2009.

Federal economists reported 250,000 new jobs in October, the 97th straight month of gains, and the unemployment rate remained at a nearly half-century low of 3.7 percent, underlining the strong fundamentals of the economy, despite stock market jitters.

Trump moved swiftly to claim credit for the figures, even though he called government jobs data “fake” many times during the 2016 presidential campaign.

“Wow! The U.S. added 250,000 Jobs in October — and this was despite the hurricanes. Unemployment at 3.7%. Wages UP!” he wrote on Twitter, telling reporters later in the day: “We had tremendous job numbers today. . . . That was shocking for a number of people, and that was a tremendous number by any standard.”

Trump and Republican candidates painted the jobs report as further proof of an economic boom, but many independent economists warn that growth has probably peaked and that it is likely there will be a slowdown, especially if trade tensions continue to escalate.

“Tax relief is helping our economy grow and Iowans are keeping more of their hard-earned money,” Rep. David Young (R-

Iowa), who is in one of the most competitive House races in the country against Democrat Cindy Axne, tweeted Friday after the jobs numbers came out.

A growing number of Wall Street analysts and economists say that the tax cuts and additional spending caused a temporary boost that will fade and leave future generations with a substantially larger debt burden.

“The economy peaked in the second quarter of this year and has been slowing for four to five months,” said David Kotok, chair of Cumberland Advisors. “The trade war is slowing the growth rate, because tariffs are a sales tax imposed on Americans by the U.S. government.”

Markets jumped immediately after the release of the report Friday but ended the day in the red, with the Dow Jones industrial average down almost 110 points mainly on concerns that the U.S.-China trade battle won’t end soon.

The strong jobs creation last month defied expectations, even by Trump’s top economist, Kevin Hassett, who said he had been bracing for a dip in hiring after Hurricane Michael pummeled the Florida panhandle and Georgia.

“We were expecting a number way below this, so it was a big surprise,” Hassett said. “We’ve got extraordinary job growth even in the face of literal head winds from a hurricane.”

Every major sector added employees, including manufacturing, where there has been evidence that the tariffs are starting to bite. Hispanic unemployment hit a new low of 4.4 percent.

“This is the best labor environment in over a decade,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM U.S., an international consulting firm.

African American unemployment, at 6.2 percent, is close to an all-time low, although it still remains nearly double the white unemployment rate.

The wage gains are coming at a time of record profits for U.S. companies after Trump and congressional Republicans enacted the biggest corporate tax rate cut in the nation’s history.

Although business profits are at an all-time high, the share of that income going to workers hangs near the lowest levels since the government began tracking it in the 1940s.

“We need to see stronger wage growth for a lot longer for workers to be able to claw back the labor share of corporate-sector income and for workers to really feel those benefits in their paycheck,” said Elise Gould, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.

Hassett predicted strong wage growth would “move even higher” than 3.1 percent next year as companies use their tax savings to invest more in factories, machines and other items that make workers more productive.

But the latest government data on business investment was weaker than expected, a sign companies might be holding off on spending because of uncertainty on trade.

Analysts say the robust job growth streak took off in 2014 and has largely kept pace since. The average number of monthly job gains in the final two years of the Obama administration was 211,000, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average so far under Trump is 196,000, a solid number given the low unemployment.

The country has 7.1 million job openings, a record high, the Labor Department announced Tuesday.

“Average wages are finally starting to pick up, especially for some lower-skilled positions,” said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor. “Maintenance workers, bank tellers, cashiers, cooks — employers are running out of workers for many of these roles.”

Health care, manufacturing, construction, transportation and warehousing fueled October’sparticularly strong job growth.

Employment at hospitals, nursing homes and other medical facilities surged by 36,000 positions.

Manufacturing jobs jumped by 32,000, with the largest gains stemming from goods production. Construction expanded by 30,000 roles, nearly half of which focus on residential homes.

Transportation and warehousing saw gains of 25,000, while leisure and hospitality recovered from September’s hurricane slowdown with 42,000 positions.

Some analysts have tied rising pay to moves by 18 states to increase their minimum wages at the start of the year.

Speaking Thursday at The Washington Post, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said he stands against that kind of policy at a national level. “My view is a federal minimum wage is a terrible idea. A terrible idea,” he said, claiming that pay restrictions hurts small businesses.

There is some concern that higher wages might fuel inflation if companies turn around and increase prices for consumers. But for now, inflation remains right around the Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent. If inflation rises next year, the Fed would probably respond with faster interest rate increases, which have tended to cause markets and the economy to choke in the past.

It’s likely that the October wage figure was slightly inflated because the severe hurricanes last year ended up depressing wages. So when the Labor Department calculated the year over year change for wages last month, it looked like a bigger jump than normal. because last year’s number was low.

Still, economists say wages are trending slightly higher. “I don’t want to play down the optimistic story here. Things are getting better. Wages are firming on a nominal basis for workers,” said Ernie Tedeschi, head of fiscal analysis at Evercore ISI and a former economist in the Obama administration.

Job growth in the United States slowed considerably in September, largely because of Hurricane Florence’s devastating run through the Carolinas. About 313,000 people did not clock in at work due to the rough weather.

Federal economists revised September’s job growth down to 118,000 from 134,000.

Business falters amid severe weather, according to a Federal Reserve study . It can take months for economic activity to pick back up."

The administration is eyeing unused money in the Army Corps of Engineers budget, specifically a disaster spending bill passed by Congress last year that includes $13.9 billion allocated but not spent for civil works projects, two people with knowledge of the developments said Thursday.

Trump has urged the Army Corps to determine how fast contracts could be signed and whether construction could begin within 45 days, according to one of the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the preparations.

The list includes dozens of flood control projects in areas affected by recent natural disasters, including the Texas coastline inundated by Hurricane Harvey and parts of Puerto Rico battered by Hurricane Maria. The military construction budget is also being looked at as a potential source for unspent funds, with billions more potentially available there.

The preparations are taking place with talks at an impasse over Trump’s demands for $5.7 billion to construct more than 200 miles of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats are staunchly opposed, leading to a partial government shutdown that on Saturday will become the longest in U.S. history.

Some 800,000 federal workers are about to miss their first paychecks since the shutdown began Dec. 22, and problems plaguing shuttered national parks, food inspection processes and other federal services are multiplying.

The Senate unanimously passed legislation Thursday that would guarantee back pay to furloughed federal workers once the shutdown ends, although thousands of government contractors who have been furloughed may never recoup their losses.

Trump, who walked out of a White House negotiating session Wednesday after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) refused to agree to pay for his wall, reiterated Thursday that he may declare a national emergency if Democrats don’t give him what he wants.

“Now if we don’t make a deal with Congress, most likely I will do that,” Trump said to Fox News host Sean Hannity about an emergency declaration in an interview that aired Thursday night. “I would actually say I would. I can’t imagine any reason why not because I’m allowed to do it. The law is 100 percent on my side.”

The president and members of his administration have been depicting a humanitarian and public safety crisis at the border, focusing on drugs flowing into the United States and violence by unauthorized immigrants. There was a significant uptick in border apprehensions in 2018, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, especially of immigrant families, but border apprehensions remain much lower than the high levels seen in the 1980s through the 2000s.

Asked about a timetable for a national emergency declaration, the president said he would see how it goes with Congress.

But on Capitol Hill there were no signs of progress, and instead lawmakers of both parties were bracing for Trump to declare a national emergency. Democrats were exploring their options on how to respond.

Democratic staffers from leadership offices and relevant committees met Thursday afternoon to discuss a potential response. According to an attendee, the meeting focused on undercutting any case that the border situation constituted a national emergency under the legal definition, and highlighting projects that might be put at risk if Trump were to raid other accounts to fund the wall.

House Democratic leadership staff has explored the possibility of a lawsuit against the administration. Although no final determinations have been made, the current thinking is that Congress probably would not have standing to sue, according to a leadership aide.

State attorneys general or people directly affected by a border wall — such as landowners who have property along the U.S.-Mexico boundary — would probably have to file the lawsuit, and the House could file a friend-of-the-court brief.

Pelosi declined to say how the House would respond to a national emergency declaration when questioned at a news conference Thursday.

“If and when the president does that, you’ll find out how we will react,” Pelosi said. “But I think the president will have problems on his own side of the aisle for exploiting the situation in a way that enhances his power.”

Indeed, a number of Republicans have expressed qualms or outright opposition about Trump declaring a national emergency, including members of the House Armed Services Committee who object to the prospect of the administration targeting funds within the Pentagon’s military construction budget.

Others cautioned against the administration taking executive action on an issue that should be Congress’s purview.

“It’s not the way to do it. I can understand why they’re looking at it,” said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho). “I don’t like the idea of pulling money out of defense and military construction and the Army Corps of Engineers. That’s not a good option.”

Asked Thursday whether she would support Trump invoking national security powers to start wall construction, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), an Appropriations Committee member, replied: “No.”

Dan Eberhart, a GOP donor who is often supportive of Trump, said, “Weaponizing a national emergency to achieve a policy objective is usually something that happens in banana republics, not George Washington’s republic.”

But other Republicans were ready for Trump to take the step.

In a statement Thursday, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) accused Pelosi of intransigence that has brought talks to an end, and said that “it is time for President Trump to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall/barrier.”

“I hope it works,” Graham added.

“There’s no question, it’s perfectly legal,” said Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.). “I wish we didn’t have to.”

While most Democrats said Trump would be acting recklessly and illegally if he declared a national emergency, some were open to the approach.

“Honestly I would be glad, because then it would get shut down in court and we could move on,” said Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.), a freshman who unseated a Republican in a swing suburban district. “Hopefully he figures that out pretty quick.”

One Democratic aide called an emergency declaration an “elegant way out of this mess” — one that would allow Trump and Republicans to declare to their most fervent supporters that they had taken Democrats to the brink, while Democrats would quickly move to tie up any construction in the courts.

The House and Senate could move quickly to pass a bill to reopen the government, predicated on assurances from Trump that he would sign the legislation.

However, conservative Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who talks frequently with Trump, cautioned that a declaration of a national emergency would not necessarily lead to reopening the government.

Many Democrats also say that an emergency declaration would benefit them politically by unifying their party while splitting Republicans, creating unease among some conservatives who have expressed discomfort with a president sidestepping Congress in a way they might see as similar to how President Barack Obama circumvented Congress on immigration.

The president has various powers to act unilaterally, some claimed as inherent in the Constitution, others specifically delegated by Congress. On Capitol Hill, most lawmakers and aides are anticipating a declaration under the 1976 National Emergencies Act, which set out a formal process for declaring an emergency — and for Congress revoking it.

To override an emergency declaration, both houses of Congress would have to pass a resolution doing so and present it to Trump for his signature — one he would presumably veto.

The administration can expect a flood of court challenges if it proposes to build a wall without explicit congressional authorization. Indeed, a number of organizations are preparing for litigation, just waiting to see exactly what the president does.

“The use of emergency powers to build a wall is unlawful, and we are prepared to sue as needed,” said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants’ Rights Project, which has helped obtain dozens of court orders blocking Trump administration immigration policies.

“There’s going to be a lot of lawsuits,” said Brian Segee, senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity. “We are preparing” for possible litigation now, he said.

Even as the discussions over a national emergency declaration were taking place, a final glimmer of hope for a way out of the impasse was extinguished when Graham declared talks over among a small group of Republican senators who had been meeting to discuss some kind of broader deal to end the shutdown.

These deal-minded Senate Republicans had shuttled Thursday morning between meetings with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Vice President Pence, batting around a proposal that would include Trump’s desired $5.7 billion in wall funding, and a renewable, three-year status for certain immigrants brought illegally to the country as children, along with other provisions.

But by midafternoon Thursday, Pence poured cold water on the idea, telling reporters at the Capitol that Trump wanted to wait on trying to make a deal for “dreamers” until the Supreme Court had ruled on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the Obama-era program that granted protections to these immigrants.

Graham was glum afterward about where things stood, saying he has “never been more depressed about moving forward than right now.” Not long after that he issued his statement backing a national emergency declaration.

At the same time, House Democrats pressed forward with their strategy of passing individual spending bills to reopen portions of the federal government that have been closed in the shutdown.

The House on Thursday passed two more spending bills that would open parts of the government that have nothing to do with border security, largely with Democratic votes. A handful of Republicans joined Democrats in supporting those bills — 12 for a bill funding the departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, and 10 for a bill funding the Agriculture Department, the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies.

But Trump has made clear he would veto these bills, and McConnell has said repeatedly that he will not bring up any legislation that doesn’t have Trump’s support.

“There’s no wall, there’s no deal,” Pence told reporters on Capitol Hill."

Trump did so after a meeting with Putin in 2017 in Hamburg that was also attended by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. U.S. officials learned of Trump’s actions when a White House adviser and a senior State Department official sought information from the interpreter beyond a readout shared by Tillerson.

The constraints that Trump imposed are part of a broader pattern by the president of shielding his communications with Putin from public scrutiny and preventing even high-ranking officials in his own administration from fully knowing what he has told one of the United States’ main adversaries.

As a result, U.S. officials said there is no detailed record, even in classified files, of Trump’s face-to-face interactions with the Russian leader at five locations over the past two years. Such a gap would be unusual in any presidency, let alone one that Russia sought to install through what U.S. intelligence agencies have described as an unprecedented campaign of election interference.

Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is thought to be in the final stages of an investigation that has focused largely on whether Trump or his associates conspired with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. The new details about Trump’s continued secrecy underscore the extent to which little is known about his communications with Putin since becoming president.

After this story was published online, Trump said in an interview late Saturday with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro that he did not take particular steps to conceal his private meetings with Putin and attacked The Washington Post and its owner Jeffrey P. Bezos.

He said he talked with Putin about Israel, among other subjects. “Anyone could have listened to that meeting. That meeting is open for grabs,” he said, without offering specifics.

When Pirro asked if he is or has ever been working for Russia, Trump responded, “I think it’s the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked.”

Former U.S. officials said that Trump’s behavior is at odds with the known practices of previous presidents, who have relied on senior aides to witness meetings and take comprehensive notes then shared with other officials and departments.

Trump’s secrecy surrounding Putin “is not only unusual by historical standards, it is outrageous,” said Strobe Talbott, a former deputy secretary of state now at the Brookings Institution, who participated in more than a dozen meetings between President Bill Clinton and then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s. “It handicaps the U.S. government — the experts and advisers and Cabinet officers who are there to serve [the president] — and it certainly gives Putin much more scope to manipulate Trump.”

A White House spokesman disputed that characterization and said that the Trump administration has sought to “improve the relationship with Russia” after the Obama administration “pursued a flawed ‘reset’ policy that sought engagement for the sake of engagement.”

The Trump administration “has imposed significant new sanctions in response to Russian malign activities,” said the spokesman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity and noted that Tillerson in 2017 “gave a fulsome readout of the meeting immediately afterward to other U.S. officials in a private setting, as well as a readout to the press.”

Trump allies said the president thinks the presence of subordinates impairs his ability to establish a rapport with Putin and that his desire for secrecy may also be driven by embarrassing leaks that occurred early in his presidency.

The meeting in Hamburg happened several months after The Washington Post and other news organizations revealed details about what Trump had told senior Russian officials during a meeting with Russian officials in the Oval Office. Trump disclosed classified information about a terrorism plot, called former FBI director James B. Comey a “nut job” and said that firing Comey had removed “great pressure” on his relationship with Russia.

The White House launched internal leak hunts after that and other episodes and sharply curtailed the distribution within the National Security Council of memos on the president’s interactions with foreign leaders.

“Over time it got harder and harder, I think, because of a sense from Trump himself that the leaks of the call transcripts were harmful to him,” said a former administration official.

Senior Democratic lawmakers describe the cloak of secrecy surrounding Trump’s meetings with Putin as unprecedented and disturbing.

Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in an interview that his panel will form an investigative subcommittee whose targets will include seeking State Department records of Trump’s encounters with Putin, including a closed-door meeting with the Russian leader in Helsinki last summer.

“It’s been several months since Helsinki and we still don’t know what went on in that meeting,” Engel said. “It’s appalling. It just makes you want to scratch your head.”

The concerns have been compounded by actions and positions Trump has taken as president that are seen as favorable to the Kremlin. He has dismissed Russia’s election interference as a “hoax,” suggested that Russia was entitled to annex Crimea, repeatedly attacked NATO allies, resisted efforts to impose sanctions on Moscow, and begun to pull U.S. forces out of Syria — a move that critics see as effectively ceding ground to Russia.

At the same time, Trump’s decision to fire Comey and other attempts to contain the ongoing Russia investigation led the bureau in May 2017 to launch a counterintelligence investigation into whether he was seeking to help Russia and if so, why, a step first reported by the New York Times.

It is not clear whether Trump has taken notes from interpreters on other occasions, but several officials said they were never able to get a reliable readout of the president’s two-hour meeting in Helsinki. Unlike in Hamburg, Trump allowed no Cabinet officials or any aides to be in the room for that conversation.

Trump also had other private conversations with Putin at meetings of global leaders outside the presence of aides. He spoke at length with Putin at a banquet at the same 2017 global conference in Hamburg, where only Putin’s interpreter was present. Trump also had a brief conversation with ­Putin at a Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires last month.

Trump generally has allowed aides to listen to his phone conversations with Putin, although Russia has often been first to disclose those calls when they occur and release statements characterizing them in broad terms favorable to the Kremlin.

In an email, Tillerson said that he “was present for the entirety of the two presidents’ official bilateral meeting in Hamburg,” but he declined to discuss the meeting and did not respond to questions about whether Trump had instructed the interpreter to remain silent or had taken the interpreter’s notes.

In a news conference afterward, Tillerson said that the Trump-Putin meeting lasted more than two hours, covered the war in Syria and other subjects, and that Trump had “pressed President ­Putin on more than one occasion regarding Russian involvement” in election interference. “President Putin denied such involvement, as I think he has in the past,” Tillerson said.

Tillerson refused to say during the news conference whether Trump had rejected Putin’s claim or indicated that he believed the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia had interfered.

Tillerson’s account is at odds with the only detail that other administration officials were able to get from the interpreter, officials said. Though the interpreter refused to discuss the meeting, officials said, he conceded that Putin had denied any Russian involvement in the U.S. election and that Trump responded by saying, “I believe you.”

A White House spokesperson, responding to this detail from the Hamburg meeting, said: “The President has affirmed that he supports the conclusions in the 2017 Intel Community Assessment, and the President also issued a new executive order in September 2018 to ensure a whole of government effort to address any foreign attempts to interfere in US elections.”

Senior Trump administration officials said that White House officials including then-National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster were never able to obtain a comprehensive account of the meeting, even from Tillerson.

“We were frustrated because we didn’t get a readout,” a former senior administration official said. “The State Department and [National Security Council] were never comfortable” with Trump’s interactions with Putin, the official said. “God only knows what they were going to talk about or agree to.”

Because of the absence of any reliable record of Trump’s conversations with Putin, officials at times have had to rely on reports by U.S. intelligence agencies tracking the reaction in the Kremlin.

Previous presidents and senior advisers have often studied such reports to assess whether they had accomplished their objectives in meetings as well as to gain insights for future conversations.

U.S. intelligence agencies have been reluctant to call attention to such reports during Trump’s presidency because they have at times included comments by foreign officials disparaging the president or his advisers, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, a former senior administration official said.

“There was more of a reticence in the intelligence community going after those kinds of communications and reporting them,” said a former administration official who worked in the White House. “The feedback tended not to be positive.”

The interpreter at Hamburg revealed the restrictions that Trump had imposed when he was approached by administration officials at the hotel where the U.S. delegation was staying, officials said.

Among the officials who asked for details from the meeting were Fiona Hill, the senior Russia adviser at the NSC, and John Heffern, who was then serving at State as the acting assistant secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs.

The State Department did not respond to a request for comment from the interpreter. Heffern, who retired from State in 2017, declined to comment.

Through a spokesman, Hill declined a request for an interview.

There are conflicting accounts of the purpose of the conversation with the interpreter, with some officials saying that Hill was among those briefed by Tillerson and that she was merely seeking more nuanced information from the interpreter.

Others said the aim was to get a more meaningful readout than the scant information furnished by Tillerson. “I recall Fiona reporting that to me,” one former official said. A second former official present in Hamburg said that Tillerson “didn’t offer a briefing or call the ambassador or anybody together. He didn’t brief senior staff,” although he “gave a readout to the press.”

A similar issue arose in Helsinki, the setting for the first formal U.S.-Russia summit since Trump became president. Hill, national security adviser John Bolton and other U.S. officials took part in a preliminary meeting that included Trump, Putin and other senior Russian officials.

But Trump and Putin then met for two hours in private, accompanied only by their interpreters. Trump’s interpreter, Marina Gross, could be seen emerging from the meeting with pages of notes.

Alarmed by the secrecy of Trump’s meeting with Putin, several lawmakers subsequently sought to compel Gross to testify before Congress about what she witnessed. Others argued that forcing her to do so would violate the impartial role that interpreters play in diplomacy. Gross was not forced to testify. She was identified when members of Congress sought to speak with her. The interpreter in Hamburg has not been identified.

During a joint news conference with Putin afterward, Trump acknowledged discussing Syria policy and other subjects but also lashed out at the media and federal investigators, and he seemed to reject the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies by saying that he was persuaded by Putin’s “powerful” denial of election interference.

Previous presidents have required senior aides to attend meetings with adversaries including the Russian president largely to ensure that there are not misunderstandings and that others in the administration are able to follow up on any agreements or plans. Detailed notes that Talbot took of Clinton’s meetings with Yeltsin are among hundreds of documents declassified and released last year."

The address, scheduled for Jan. 29, would give Trump a prime-time televised platform to make his case for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, the sticking point in a partisan stalemate that has closed large parts of the government since Dec. 22.

Pelosi did not rescind her invitation for Trump to deliver the address, but in a letter to the president she suggested they work together to find a different date for it after the government has reopened, because of the security costs involved from federal agencies that are going without funding.

The White House made no comment about Pelosi’s letter, but Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen dismissed any security concerns, writing on Twitter: “The Department of Homeland Security and the US Secret Service are fully prepared to support and secure the State of the Union.”

The exchange over the State of the Union address came as White House officials were working to quell dissent on another front, urging Republican senators to hold off on signing a bipartisan letter that would call for an end to the government shutdown, now in its 26th day.

At the same time, a group of centrist-leaning House Democrats met with Trump at the White House and urged him to end the shutdown, a day after some of their colleagues had spurned a similar invitation from Trump.

And not long after that, some freshman House Democrats embarked on an improvised and somewhat chaotic hunt for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), leaving letters calling for an end to the shutdown at McConnell’s office in the Capitol, in the Senate Republican cloakroom and in the Russell Senate Office Building — holding impromptu news conferences along the way.

“Just vote. Vote yes, vote no, but vote. Do something,” Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.), one of the freshmen, pleaded outside McConnell’s office.

“The leader has spoken publicly many, many times on holding show votes,” McConnell spokesman Donald Stewart said in response, referring to McConnell’s opposition to taking up House-passed spending bills that would reopen the government but don’t have Trump’s support because they don’t fund his border wall.

Indeed, despite signs of interest on both sides of the aisle in bringing the shutdown to a close, the day ended with few signs of progress toward that goal.

There was no indication that Trump planned to yield on his demands for $5.7 billion in border wall funding — or agree to a short-term spending bill to reopen the government while negotiations continue, as a draft bipartisan letter circulating in the Senate was urging. And Democrats continued to reject border money beyond $1.3 billion for barriers and fences that would extend existing funding levels, insisting that they won’t even negotiate unless Trump signs a bill to reopen the government first.

Toward the end of the day, the House passed another stopgap spending bill to reopen the government without funding Trump’s wall. As with previous such bills, the White House issued a veto threat.

The developments left a number of lawmakers dejected.

“I said it could be protracted, and it is,” said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), arguing there could be no progress until Trump, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) sit down and negotiate in earnest. “Until that happens, the situation looks bleak,” he said.

Shelby likened the predicament to the play “Waiting for Godot.”

“Godot hasn’t shown up yet,” Shelby remarked, while acknowledging that in the play, Godot never does.

Pelosi’s letter on delaying the State of the Union argued that the agencies responsible for security have been “hamstrung” by furloughs.

“Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government re-opens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has re-opened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on January 29th,” Pelosi wrote.

State of the Union addresses are traditionally made to a joint session of Congress in the House chamber at the invitation of the House speaker. The House and Senate must pass a resolution to formalize the invitation — which has not happened this year.

Pelosi later told reporters that her letter was intended as a suggestion and that she was not rescinding an invitation for Trump to speak. She stressed that no address had ever been delivered during a government shutdown.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called Pelosi’s move “unbecoming.”

“It is not a security issue — that’s politics. It’s pure politics,” McCarthy said.

The shutdown is forcing some 800,000 federal workers to go without pay while having a variety of impacts on government functions, including at the IRS and the FDA. Trump signed legislation Wednesday to guarantee back salaries to furloughed workers once the government has reopened, but thousands of contract workers may never get paid.

Senior White House officials, meanwhile, were trying to tamp down any signs of division among Republicans as a bipartisan group in the Senate sought signatures on a letter asking Trump to allow the government to reopen for three weeks “to give Congress time to develop and vote on a bipartisan agreement that addresses your request.”

“We commit to working to advance legislation that can pass the Senate with substantial bipartisan support,” says the three-paragraph letter, a draft of which was obtained by The Washington Post. “This would include debating and voting on investments on the Southern border that are necessary, effective, and appropriate to accomplish that goal.”

In calls to GOP senators placed after word of the letter became public late Tuesday, Vice President Pence and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner made clear that the president is unwavering and would not support the letter’s call to reopen the government, despite mounting concerns about the political cost of the shutdown for his party, according to a White House aide and three congressional officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment about the private discussions.

“The president sees this as a capitulation, and he’s not going to walk away,” the White House aide said. Pence and Kushner reiterated that perspective in a call late Wednesday with lawmakers involved, according to an administration official who was not authorized to discuss the exchange publicly. As of Wednesday evening the bipartisan Senate letter still had not been released, and timing and signers remained uncertain.

Trump’s aversion to reopening the government while continuing talks was echoed by several conservative senators Wednesday, who expressed skepticism about the bipartisan effort.

Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) predicted that Trump would never agree to the short-term solution proposed by the bipartisan group. “You know when that’s going to happen? When you look outside your window and see donkeys fly,” Kennedy said.

Asked whether there’s anything more McConnell could be doing to end the shutdown, Kennedy replied: “Pray.”

Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), one of the senators signing onto the bipartisan letter, said that if Trump won’t agree to reopen government, he should declare a national emergency.

Trump had previously floated that idea, which could allow him to direct the military to construct a border wall without congressional consent. While it could be a way out of the impasse, Trump has been cooler to the idea more recently.

If Trump isn’t willing to reopen government, “I’m begging the president, please declare a national emergency,” Manchin said. “Please do it, Mr. President. Because we are in a political meltdown, and we’re trying everything.”

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a leader of the bipartisan effort who said he spoke with Pence on Wednesday, said the White House is “trying to figure out what the best play is.”

“I don’t see a way forward under the current construct,” Graham said, advocating for “a timeout from the shutdown” that would allow more productive talks about wall funding.

The new effort among the senators came as Trump met with a group of House Democrats and moderate House Republicans from the bipartisan “Problem Solvers” caucus.

In a statement afterward, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump and his team “had a constructive meeting” with the group.

“They listened to one another, and now both have a good understanding of what the other wants. We look forward to more conversations like this,” Sanders said.

Several Democratic lawmakers present offered similarly upbeat takes, though none pointed to specific progress made.

“I think that he [Trump] is willing [to negotiate]. I think Democratic leadership is willing to negotiate. We have just got to come up with some compromise,” said Rep. Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.). “I think there is a willingness on his part to open up the government, but we also have to talk about border security as well.”

But the effort by members of the “Problem Solvers” group to reach across the political divide that has paralyzed Washington earned scorn from some colleagues.

Trump’s assessment, delivered in a morning tweet, followed a segment Sunday night on CBS’s “60 Minutes” in which the billionaire Schultz confirmed that he is preparing to launch an independent 2020 campaign for president.

“Howard Schultz doesn’t have the ‘guts’ to run for President!” Trump wrote. “Watched him on @60Minutes last night and I agree with him that he is not the ‘smartest person.’ Besides, America already has that!”

During the interview, Schultz was asked what a chief executive of a global coffee chain knows about being commander in chief.

“I have a long history of recognizing I’m not the smartest person in the room, that in order to make great decisions about complex problems I have to recruit and attract people who are smarter than me and more experienced, more skilled, and we’ve got to create an understanding that we need a creative debate in the room to make these kind of decisions,” Schultz said.

Trump has repeatedly touted his own smarts both as a candidate and president, famously declaring “I alone can fix it” during his speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention.

A potential independent bid by Schultz has prompted mounting concerns among Democrats that such a move could help reelect Trump by siphoning off votes from the Democratic Party’s nominee.

In his tweet, Trump also alluded to a Starbucks location in Trump Tower in Manhattan.

The partial shutdown, which was the longest in U.S. history, ended Friday with Trump agreeing to temporarily reopen the government without any money for a wall.

Inside the West Wing over the weekend, Trump told advisers that declaring a national emergency may be his best option as he scrambles to assert himself in a divided government and secure wall funding, according to four people involved in the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.

One White House official described Trump’s decision to reopen the government as “clearing the deck” for executive action rather than a retreat. And a longtime confidant said Trump has grown increasingly frustrated by news coverage of his concession to Democrats and has been encouraged by conservative allies to escalate the fight.

A bipartisan, bicameral congressional committee has been charged with brokering an agreement on border security as part of a deal to keep the government open past Feb. 15, and a stalemate could trigger another shutdown.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Sunday, Trump said he thinks the committee’s chances of success are “less than 50-50,” although there are “a lot of very good people” on it.

He also said that another shutdown is “certainly an option” and voiced doubt that he would back any deal with less than $5.7 billion in border wall funding.

His consideration of such action comes as conservative commentators have lashed out at Trump and said he gave in to top Democrats on Friday, and as special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election has moved deeper into Trump’s inner circle, raising questions about the future of his presidency.

Some Republicans on Sunday waved Trump off potentially signing a declaration, following 35 days of enduring criticism as he held firm. Opinion polls show that the public blames Trump and Republicans more than Democrats for the shutdown.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called the prospect of a national-emergency declaration a “terrible idea,” reflecting widespread conservative unease about using executive powers in sweeping ways to achieve political ends, a tactic they have long criticized Democratic presidents of employing.

“It’s just not a good precedent to set in terms of action. It doesn’t mean that I don’t want border security. I do. I just think that’s the wrong way to achieve it,” Rubio said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) agreed. “I happen to agree with the president on barriers at the border and border security as an important first step, but there might be a future president that I don’t agree with that thinks something else is an emergency,” Blunt said on “Fox News Sunday,” adding that he hopes “the president doesn’t have to go there.”

Still, other Republicans said the GOP appetite for using emergency powers was stronger than the remarks of lawmakers on television suggested because of the expectation that the party’s base would applaud Trump for being bold.

“He’s certainly going to have Democratic opposition for partisan reasons and Republicans opposed based on the precedent it sets,” former White House legislative director Marc Short said in an interview. “But there is one thing some Republicans say to the media, and then there is what they say quietly to each other when the camera is not on: ‘I sure wish he’d do it.’ ”

Several White House officials said privately Sunday that Trump has argued that a national-emergency declaration in the coming weeks could pressure Congress to include wall funding as part of a broader legislative package next month and could signal to the GOP’s core voters that the president is going to extremes to secure funding for his campaign’s biggest pledge.

Mulvaney said that if the legislation Congress sends to the president’s desk is unsatisfactory, Trump could veto it.

“Yeah. I think he actually is,” Mulvaney said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” when asked whether Trump is prepared to bring about a shutdown next month.

After Trump agreed to reopen the government, a committee was charged with negotiating an agreement on border security as part of a new spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security.

Senate Republican leaders appointed to the committee Sen. Richard C. Shelby (Ala.), the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, along with GOP Sens. Blunt, Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) and John Hoeven (N.D.). Democratic leaders tapped Sens. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), Richard J. Durbin (Ill.) and Jon Tester (Mont.).

Ten House members have also been appointed to serve on the panel.

The White House Counsel’s Office, led by Pat Cipollone, has prepared drafts of declarations, and Trump spent much of Thursday night reviewing them in the White House residence as he watched TV coverage of the shutdown, according to two White House officials familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.

Angry with Democrats’ refusal to bend to his demands, in particular with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Trump pressed Cipollone for guidance about the potential legal repercussions and called friends, such as Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, to hear their views about the negotiations, the two officials said.

In the end, Trump backed off on Friday after being briefed by aides on mounting anxiety among Republican lawmakers over the shutdown and federal flight delays. Trump was wary of the prospect of both a shutdown showdown and court challenges over emergency powers unfolding at the same time, the officials added.

“Ultimately, he’ll be judged by what happens at the end of this process, not by what happened this week,” Mulvaney said on Fox.

The White House declined to comment about the internal deliberations or the president’s calls.

There are tensions in the White House about the political cost of using emergency powers. Senior adviser Jared Kushner has reservations and is hopeful that Democrats may eventually agree to work with the administration on a bipartisan immigration deal, while others, including White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, have talked up a national emergency as a way of prompting a reckoning on the issue, according to the four people familiar with the discussions.

Some Trump allies have urged the president to act, stoking his own instincts about using emergency powers, White House officials said.

“Come February the 15th, if the Democrats still say: ‘Go to hell on the wall, you get a dollar, that’s it,’ they basically tell Trump, ‘I’m not going to do with you what I did with Bush and Obama,’ then I hope he will go the emergency route,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told Fox News on Friday.

The Trump administration has spent weeks casting the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border as a security and humanitarian crisis that may necessitate the declaration of a national emergency, laying the groundwork in congressional briefings, news conferences and Trump’s address to the nation this month.

Trump argued on Sunday that illegal immigration was costing the country tens of billions of dollars a month, although it was not clear on what data he was basing his estimate.

“We are not even into February and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18,959,495,168,” he tweeted. “Cost Friday was $603,331,392.”

Trump has previously claimed that the cost of illegal immigration is more than $200 billion a year, without providing any evidence.

About 11 million people are estimated to be living in the United States without documentation. But on Sunday, Trump challenged that number, tweeting that “there are at least 25,772,342 illegal aliens, not the 11,000,000 that have been reported for years, in our Country. So ridiculous! DHS”

Asked on “Face the Nation” about that number, Mulvaney said he did not know where Trump was getting his information. But he argued that the figure “has to be larger than 11 million” because of the numbers of migrants who continue to cross into the United States each month.

“I think that number was accurate a couple of years ago. We know that it’s going up,” Mulvaney said.

As the negotiations begin anew, lawmakers from both parties stuck to their positions Sunday. Some Republicans, however, cautioned against another government shutdown over the wall.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said on “Face the Nation” that “absolutely nothing” was accomplished by partially shutting down the government."

The Democrats’ proposal was their opening bid in bipartisan House-Senate negotiations aimed at coming up with a deal to keep the government open when temporary funding runs out Feb. 15. It came just hours after Trump dug in on his conditions for signing off on such a deal, writing on Twitter that lawmakers would be “wasting their time” if they’re not considering a wall or physical barrier on the southern border.

But in a sign of how difficult it may be for lawmakers to strike a compromise that Trump can support, Democrats dismissed the president’s insistence on physical barriers on the border, arguing that security funds would be better spent elsewhere.

“We’ve seen that walls can and will be tunneled under, cut through or scaled,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.). “We cannot focus on archaic solutions in order to address this very modern problem. Technology works for securing the border.”

Aguilar spoke as 17 House members and senators from both parties met in the basement of the Capitol to open negotiations aimed at resolving the border wall standoff that led to the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history, which ended Friday after 35 days. The deal that temporarily ended the shutdown and reopened the government for three weeks also provided for the creation of the “conference committee” to negotiate over border security.

Trump has threatened that if the committee does not produce a solution he likes, he will shut down the government again, or declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress and use the military to build the border wall for which he long claimed Mexico would pay.

Having backed Trump through a politically disastrous shutdown that did not get him the $5.7 billion in border wall money he wants, Republicans have no desire to repeat the experience, and many do not favor an emergency declaration, either. Democrats, too, say they would like to see Congress reach a solution that both parties and the president can support.

But despite expressions of goodwill on all sides Wednesday as the committee met, with many lawmakers insisting that they share the same goals and agree more than they disagree, the gap between Trump and congressional Democrats on the fundamental issue of the wall yawned as wide as ever.

In fact, Democrats’ renunciation of any spending for physical barriers represented an entrenchment compared with where they’ve been in the past, when they supported spending bills for the Homeland Security Department containing some level of funding for fencing or other barriers on the border. Even the current stopgap spending bill that is keeping the government running through mid-February would allocate tens of millions over that time to build and repair pedestrian fencing along the border.

But Trump’s singular focus on a wall has made it politically toxic for Democrats, and their success in forcing him to accept a deal on their terms to temporarily end the shutdown has emboldened them against his demands.

Asked about Democrats’ newfound insistence that they cannot fund physical border barriers at all, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.), who chairs the Appropriations subcommittee on homeland security, said that “there’s a lot of new technology now that is available that was not available when we made other decisions.”

At the same time, Democrats suggested that they were open to eventual compromise on the issue.

House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) refused to say whether opposition to physical barriers was nonnegotiable for Democrats, responding at a news conference: “At this point, I’m certainly not going to give an answer to that question.”

Noting that negotiations were just getting underway, Lowey added: “We’re open to everyone’s facts and figures.”

House Democrats’ proposal includes funding for myriad other security measures along the border, including 1,000 additional customs officers, new imaging technology to scan vehicles for drugs and contraband, repairs at ports of entry, and changes aimed at reducing detentions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Republicans on the committee echoed some of the Democrats’ calls for improved technology to screen cargo and stop drug shipments, but they followed Trump in calling for physical barriers as part of an overall solution.

“Our Border Patrol tells us they need physical barriers to help them do their job — not from coast to coast, but strategically placed where traffic is highest,” said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.).

“It’s unfortunate the issue has become politicized,” Shelby added. “That has not always been the case.”

Compounding the challenge for members of the conference committee is the lack of clarity about what deal Trump would ultimately find acceptable. Republicans say they are unsure whether Trump would accept less than the $5.7 billion in wall funding he has been demanding, and if he would, what number would be acceptable to him.

Ahead of the committee meeting Wednesday, White House legislative affairs director Shahira Knight met behind closed doors with bipartisan members of the House “Problem Solvers” coalition where one lawmaker challenged her on that point.

Rep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.) said Knight contended that the White House had made its position clear on border security and immigration, but Costa said he disputed that.

“I challenged her,” he said. “I said, ‘That’s wonderful.’ She said — she used the term ‘secret sauce.’ I said, ‘Well, we all want to find out what the secret sauce is,’ I said, ‘but for many of us it’s not clear.’ ”

“I came out of that meeting with what I believe on her part was a sincere desire to work an agreement out,” Costa added. “But I think that the details, from my perspective, as to what would be the basis of that agreement, for me, was not clear.”

There has been discussion among some lawmakers of trying to widen the border negotiations to encompass more issues, such as a solution for undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children and whose Obama-era protections are being challenged in court by the Trump administration. But Lowey said the conference committee, which she is chairing, will focus on the narrower issues within the parameters of the Homeland Security spending bill.

Costa said there was discussion in the meeting with Knight about aiming for a larger deal, but ultimately, he said, “I don’t think there’s enough trust to go big.”

Also Wednesday, in a sign that House Democrats expect tense final days of negotiation, they delayed an issues retreat that had been slated to run in the last days up to the Feb. 15 shutdown deadline, postponing the retreat until spring."

Ralph Northam (D) met with his Cabinet early Monday morning and planned to speak with other administration officials as he considers resigning following two days of controversy over a racist photo in his medical school yearbook. All 140 members of the General Assembly returned to Richmond for the ongoing legislative session, trying to focus on deadlines for approving a state budget in an atmosphere of uncertainty and drama.

House Speaker Kirk Cox (R-Colonial Heights) renewed his call for Northam to step down but in a morning news conference expressed “hesitation” about the possibility that the legislature would try to force him out.

“I think there’s a rightful hesitation about removal from office,” Cox said. “Obviously you have to consider that to some degree you’re overturning an election. I think the constitutional provisions are very specific . . . it really does call for mental or physical incapacitation.”

Cox, who worked closely with Northam in last year’s session to pass Medicaid expansion, called this a “painful and heartbreaking moment for the commonwealth.” He said Republican leaders had resisted calling for resignation until later Saturday.

“It had become clear to us by then, regardless of the veracity of the photograph, the governor’s lost the confidence of the people and cannot effectively govern,” Cox said. The legislature’s Democratic caucuses were both quick to call for Northam to step down.

The drumbeat spread to the state’s public universities. The College of William and Mary on Monday announced that Northam would not attend Friday’s inauguration of new president Katherine Rowe, saying in a statement that “the Governor’s presence would fundamentally disrupt the sense of campus unity we aspire to and hope for with this event.”

University of Virginia president James Ryan issued a statement Sunday suggesting that Northam should resign, saying that if a leader’s “trust is lost, for whatever reason, it is exceedingly difficult to continue to lead. It seems we have reached that point.”

On Sunday night, the governor met with senior staffers of color to discuss his future following two days of defiance against the national clamor that he should resign. People familiar with that meeting said Northam had not reached a decision.

It was unclear who was present, but the group did not include Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D), who would become governor if Northam resigned, the people said. One Democratic official said the meeting was emotional in tone.

Calling the Sunday night meeting was a clear signal of Northam’s effort to weigh support within the administration as he evaluates his options. Although he pledged Saturday to stand his ground, he also said he would reconsider if he thought he could no longer be effective.

Northam spent much of Sunday in seclusion at his family home on the Eastern Shore as confidants delivered conflicting advice about whether he should resign or continue fighting to clear his name, according to people close to the governor.

Some of his strongest allies in Virginia’s Democratic Party took their calls for resignation to the national airwaves Sunday, arguing that the discovery of a racist photo on his 1984 medical school yearbook page had made him unable to continue to lead the state.

Even within the circle of his staunchest defenders, there was debate about whether he should step down, according to one person familiar with the situation who, like others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity. At least one senior staffer and one Cabinet member have reached out to private firms about job possibilities, according to a person who was approached by the two.

One of those urging Northam to stay and defend his honor is first lady Pam Northam, according to two people familiar with the situation.

Some supporters worked Sunday to track down evidence about the yearbook photo that they thought would prove Northam was not in the racist image, which showed two figures, one in blackface and the other in Ku Klux Klan garb, each holding a can of beer.

The uncertainty over what Northam would do next has left Richmond in limbo. No Virginia governor has failed to complete his term since the Civil War, and the current crisis comes as the state officials would rather focus on two big anniversaries — the arrival of the first Africans and the first meeting of representative government, both in 1619.

Lawmakers are working on the state budget in a somber climate of rumors and dismay. Northam is liked by Republicans and Democrats and had compiled a glittering list of accomplishments in his first year in office, but sentiment around the legislature was almost universal that he should step down.

Northam initially apologized Friday night after the racist image surfaced on the conservative website Big League Politics but reversed himself Saturday at a nationally televised news conference and insisted he was not in the photo.

After the news conference, in which he disclosed another incident in which he wore blackface to imitate Michael Jackson at a dance contest in 1984, Democrats in the General Assembly and in Virginia’s congressional delegation intensified their calls for him to resign.

Northam stood his ground in calls to longtime friends and colleagues Saturday night, saying he intended to stay and fight, according to three people who received those calls. Among them was state Sen. Richard Stuart (R-Stafford), a close friend and fishing buddy.

Stuart did not want to disclose what the governor told him. “But I can tell you I firmly believe that he is going to do everything he can to clear his name and do what he thinks is right in the face of this. I don’t think he’s going anywhere,” Stuart said.

Northam’s only public appearance Sunday was at his home church in Capeville on the Eastern Shore. The pastor at First Baptist Church, Kelvin Jones, is African American and had been in Richmond the day before to support Northam at the news conference.

Northam returned to Richmond on Sunday afternoon. A small circle of staffers and trusted advisers has been helping him handle the crisis, including chief of staff Clark Mercer and Brian Coy, a former spokesman who was a holdover from the administration of former governor Terry McAuliffe (D).

Fairfax, who had begun making preparations to take over as governor on Saturday when it seemed as though Northam might resign, spent Sunday with his family in Northern Virginia and returned to Richmond in the evening.

Party leaders, concerned that Northam will become a liability for 2020 Democratic hopefuls and threaten Democratic control of an important swing state, have been unrelenting in their demands that he step aside.

McAuliffe, who helped Northam win the state’s top office and under whom Northam served as lieutenant governor, said on Sunday that he was “heartbroken” over the discovery of the photo. But he said Northam’s insistence that he was not in the picture was irrelevant.

“It doesn’t matter whether he was in the photo or not in the photo at this point,” McAuliffe said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We have to close that chapter.”

McAuliffe, a possible 2020 presidential contender, also defended Northam, saying Northam will be remembered for doing some great things, including helping McAuliffe restore the voting rights of Virginians who completed their sentences for felonies. Many of the people whose voting rights were restored are African American.

But McAuliffe said part of Northam’s legacy should be choosing “the right moral course for Virginia” and resigning.

Host Jake Tapper noted that the nickname “Coonman” appeared in Northam’s Virginia Military Institute yearbook and cited other examples before asking McAuliffe if Northam is a racist.

“I have zero indication of that,” he said.

On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Rep. A. Donald McEachin (D-Va.), speaking as a member of Congressional Black Caucus leadership, said there is nothing Northam can do to persuade McEachin to give the governor more time in office.

“He’s lost the authority to lead,” said McEachin, who served in the Virginia Senate with Northam. “He’s lost the authority to govern. He has to resign. It’s in the best interest of the commonwealth. It’s in the best interest of the party.”

One Democratic official said the state party has had no contact with Northam since calling for him to step down on Saturday. Others said that Northam has lost the ability to lead even if he is not in the original photograph because of the way he flipped his story and because of the disclosure involving the dance contest.

The question of how the photo could have turned up on Northam’s page in the 1984 yearbook from Eastern Virginia Medical School without Northam’s knowledge remained a central mystery.

William Elwood, who helped lay out the school’s 1984 yearbook, said each student was responsible for submitting photos for his or her page in a sealed envelope.

“Every student would provide them — some big envelopes, some small — with their names written on the outside, and we would keep them sealed until it was time to design that student’s page,” recalled Elwood, 68, a retired family practice and emergency room doctor in Mississippi. “I don’t remember exactly after, but I think they were sealed up and given back” to the students, he said.

Elwood said he had served a tour in the Navy before college and so was 29 and more apt to hang out with a group of older students at Eastern Virginia. He said he didn’t know Northam or remember whether he had designed Northam’s yearbook page.

But the yearbook, he recalled, was a laborious project for seniors. Elwood had the time to help, he said, because he had taken a four-year path through medical school, giving him a lighter load his senior year.

Elwood said that in looking at the photo in recent days, he thinks it was probably done in jest. “People back then put on all kinds of costumes at parties,” he said. “I think it probably is a thing of humor more than politics or racist.”

But there was no excusing the photograph for Northam’s fellow Democrats, especially members of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus. Lamont Bagby, chair of the caucus, said despite his repeated calls for Northam to resign, impeachment isn’t publicly on the table yet.

“I encourage the governor to step aside so that we can start the healing process,” Bagby said on ABC’s “This Week.” “I’m not at a point where I want to publicly have a conversation about impeachment.”

Former Virginia congressman Jim Moran, a Democrat, emerged Sunday as virtually the only person defending Northam and encouraging the governor to ride it out.

“I hate to be on the other side of virtually all of my friends on this,” he said on “This Week.”

“But I do disagree with their judgment because I think it is a rush to judgment before we know all of the facts and before we’ve considered all of the consequences,” Moran said.

Moran said Northam should be given a chance to redeem himself and invoked President Lyndon B. Johnson’s ability to work with conservative Republicans because of his background in Texas.

“No untarnished liberal from the North could ever have gotten the Great Society programs passed,” Moran said, “but he was able to work with his Southern colleagues because he knew where they were coming from. We still have a conservative Republican legislature and, frankly, I think that Ralph will have the highest motivation possible to bring us further away from this horrible past of racism.”

Then Moran brought up Robert C. Byrd, the late senator from West Virginia, who was a member of the Ku Klux Klan in the early 1940s but, after many decades in the Senate, helped set aside land on the Mall for a memorial to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

“That’s the power of redemption,” Moran said."
