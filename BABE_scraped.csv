The 34-year-old actress took to Instagram recently to announce how she plans to change her lifestyle in response to the recent massive outbreak of wildfires in Australia.

In the first of two videos, Stone slammed Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for doing ""absolutely nothing"" to support relief efforts.

""I'm sitting in a dark room, wondering what the h-ll is happening. Our country is on fire,"" she said in the video. ""We've lost 14.5 million hectares and our prime minister has done absolutely nothing. Cold, calculated nothing. We don't have leaders, we have cowards. The leaders we have are the people around us, and that's what we have to become.""

Stone continued: ""We have to step up because this is war, this is a climate war, and for the first time, our enemy is not wearing a uniform that we'll be able to recognize. Our enemy is our own behavior.""

The actress then calls for ""corporate-wide, government-wide, systematic changes"" to take place in order to combat climate change before telling viewers, ""It's time to act.""

In the second video, Stone says that she's realized it's no longer logical for her to live in two separate countries, constantly flying between the two continents and creating carbon emissions harmful to the environment.

""From the very privileged position of having been granted a green card for the USA I have decided it’s environmentally unjust to pursue a life across two continents,"" wrote Stone in the caption. ""... This is my way of kicking off real 2020 change in my life. I’m aware it comes from a position of extreme privilege. Skin in the game.""

Additionally, she explained that she'll be pursuing environmentalism work.

""I'm going to be here in Australia, doing the work I can to make a difference here, because the time is now,"" Stone said in the video. ""Like I said, this is war, and we've got 10 years, so let's make these sacrifices, let's make these changes, let's put some skin in the game and say 'Yeah, I care and this is what I'm going to do about it.'""

She concluded: ""This is just the beginning for me.""

1,https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/law-and-order-is-a-debased-concept-used-to-cover-up-right-wing-crime-and-depravity-heres-why/,"Mark Twain's instruction to curious residents of Freedom Central is, by now, familiar: ""If you want to see the dregs of society, go down to the jail and watch the changing of the guard."" There is little doubt that the corrections officer who beats and torments the inmates under his supervision would use the phrase ""law and order"" as a defense for his own lawlessness. Almost any usage of that loaded term in American civic discourse serves as qualification for membership in a diner's club of hell.

Donald Trump, the latest political demagogue to employ the term as a rhetorical bludgeon against peaceful protesters, can look forward to sitting alongside Sen. Joseph McCarthy, former Alabama Gov. George Wallace, Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, who ordered police to attack political demonstrators at the 1968 Democratic convention, Richard Nixon and many foreign dictators in the annals of history — and if there is an afterlife, in the middle of the inferno.

Beyond the term's dark history and utility, there is also the rarely discussed fiction it is meant to disguise. In fact, the United States is one of the least lawful societies in the developed world, and that the bulletproof bullies who scream about ""law and order"" are typically society's most committed enablers of criminality and corruption.

The police lynching of George Floyd provoked widespread denunciation, with even ghouls like Rush Limbaugh and Mitch McConnell condemning the individual officers responsible for the death. What they do not want to acknowledge is the continuation of not only systemic racism within criminal justice, but also a culture of crime. Pundits on the American right delight in reciting the bromide, ""a few bad apples,"" as if they coined it, but they have seemingly forgotten the full cliché: ""One bad apple spoils the bunch.""

One need look no further than Buffalo, New York, to observe how the mold of a single fruit will soon spread to the rest. When two sadists in uniform shoved an elderly man to the ground for the crime of approaching them, causing him a critical head injury, their fellow cops made no attempt to help the victim. After the city of Buffalo suspended the perpetrators and charged them with assault, 57 officers resigned from the Emergency Response Team in support of their ""brothers"" whose version of ""law and order"" includes inflicting random violence on unarmed senior citizens.

The ""thin blue line"" code of policing that requires silence from police who witness acts of cruelty and illegality from their fellow officers is, among other things, an anti-democratic violation of the U.S. Constitution.

If the press could think beyond the narrow assumptions of political debate, and if the Democratic Party had more rhetorical daring, they might make it clear that Black Lives Matter, a formidable coalition of civil rights organizations, and tens of thousands of outraged citizens filling the streets in protest of police brutality, are on the side of the law. It is their opponents and critics who support and defend mutinous and dangerous breaches of constitutional order. John Adams famously declared that ""we are a nation of laws, not men."" Police officers, no matter the self-pitying cries of their union captains and the sputtering of their unofficial PR specialists on Fox News, are supposed to be subject to American law just as much as the citizens they purportedly protect.

It is not only cops who are often able to live outside the law. It is also the wealthy and well-connected sociopaths who poison the environment, exploit the poor and manipulate unprincipled political officials.

After the murder of George Floyd provoked civil unrest, Donald Trump and the Republican leaders of Congress bloviated extensively about ""law and order."" They would prefer their constituents to forget that it was only weeks earlier that they declared any future coronavirus relief package must include the innovative concept known as ""corporate immunity.""

Paul Bland, the executive director of Public Justice, a national public interest law firm, explains that the Republican plan ""would free corporations of any responsibility — even when a corporation's unreasonable and dangerous actions hurt people."" Under the system of corporate immunity, big business can violate the rights of its workers and consumers, endanger public safety and increase the risk of sickness and death for anyone in their facilities, without fear of legal penalty. So much for ""law and order.""

The Trump administration took advantage of the pandemic and mass protests to betray the law and threaten Americans, under the cover of a distracted press. The National Resources Defense Council reported on June 4 that Trump signed an ""unprecedented"" executive order that ""allows industry to skirt foundational environmental laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act, in order to rubber-stamp polluting projects.""

The NRDC warns that enabling corporations to bypass review requirements of NEPA will not only have ""catastrophic consequences for wildlife,"" but also, in the words of the organization's president, Gina McCarthy, ""harm our health and our communities.""

Tinpot tyrant Trump and his demented circle of enablers shout for ""law and order,"" and feigning concern for the damage or injury that might result from unruly protests. Circumvention of environmental regulations that could cause the sickness or death of thousands of people is of no concern.

The First Amendment is also not a priority for the right, for all its whimpering about ""freedom of speech."" Since the Black Lives Matter demonstrations began, activists have catalogued more than 600 incidents of police beating and harassing protesters without provocation, and almost 300 police attacks against journalists. Trump facilitated one of the most egregious violations of constitutional liberties when he and Attorney General Bill Barr ordered police and National Guard to use tear gas to drive peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square so the president could take a prom photo, Bible in hand like a bouquet, outside of St. John's Episcopal Church.

In his defense, Trump and his supporters have claimed that not all the protesters were peaceful, and that there were criminals among them. They've offered no evidence for this accusation, but their own record indicates that even when there is sufficient evidence for criminal charges, they are willing to look the other way, at least when the offenders are wealthy and friendly to the Trump administration.

The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University reports that Justice Department prosecutions of white-collar crime have fallen to their lowest point in 33 years.

David Sklansky, co-director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center and a former prosecutor, called the Syracuse study ""disturbing,"" and suggested that the decline reflects political priorities more than a drop in the crime rate in corporate boardrooms.

This code of silence around the current free-for-all for white-collar criminals exposes the insincerity of right-wing panic over looting. As Don Henley once put it, ""A man with a briefcase can steal more money than any man with a gun.""

As Trump has attempted to create chaos in the streets and encouraged a culture of criminality in corporate America, he has also presided over unprecedented corruption in the executive branch of the federal government. The president has personally fired four inspectors general, removing the most effective assurance against misuse of governmental authority and funds in the White House. Far from ""draining the swamp,"" as he promised in his campaign, and in direct contradiction of his ""law and order"" bluster, Trump has created a sewer of deception, corruption and criminality.

Conservatives display no compunction over their consistent violations of the law. Legal protections of free speech and assembly, the natural environment and worker safety are meaningless to the criminal element of American government. Their flagrant disregard for the Constitution is familiar to the victims of infamous FBI programs like Operation CHAOS and COINTELPRO. The only novelty in America's current days of fury is the widespread popularity of a movement to struggle for true equality under the law.

""We have one beautiful law,"" Trump recently said in his characteristically bizarre syntax and diction, repeating the word ""beautiful."" He went on to imply that the ""one law and order"" serves everyone. His actions, however, have shown that he and his supporters are consistently opposed to law but do indeed insist on order. The don't mean an order under the rule of law, but a social order that maintains their class at the top of the hierarchy, and those they would deem undesirable — the majority of the American people, but especially those who are black, Latino or Native American — fighting for scraps at the bottom. Tax cuts for the wealthy, the elimination of regulatory limits on corporate impulses of avarice and the destruction of all protections for citizens of average means have followed, according to a predictable script of economic control.

If Trump were even remotely sincere about ""one beautiful law,"" he would be out marching in the street alongside Black Lives Matter, rather than threatening its activists and protesters with ""vicious dogs."" Because the movement now in the streets is the most powerful force in American society currently demanding equal and fair enforcement of the law.",0
2,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/after-stephen-miller-s-white-nationalist-views-outed-latinos-ask-n1096071,"It wasn't the content of White House adviser Stephen Miller’s leaked emails that shocked Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat from El Paso, Texas, but the silence of her Republican colleagues that has followed.

Miller is the architect of President Donald Trump's hardline immigration policies that have separated children from parents, forced people seeking asylum in the U.S. to wait in Mexico under squalid conditions, instituted the Muslim ban and poured money from the military into border wall construction. The administration is currently under fire for the deaths of migrant children and teens who have died while in government custody.

In a trove of emails provided to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group, Miller cited and promoted white nationalist ideologies of white genocide, immigrants as criminals and eugenics, all of which were once considered fringe and extreme. White nationalists embrace white supremacist and white separatist views.

Three weeks after the emails were made public, Miller still is in the White House. Only Democrats have called on the White House to rid itself of white nationalism.

“It really has been jarring (that) the president’s enablers and Republicans have not stood up and said, Mr. President, this is unacceptable,” Escobar said in an interview. “I would implore my Republican colleagues to join us in calling for Stephen Miller’s resignation,” she said.

MIller's ideology has wide reach, consequences

Escobar represents El Paso, where a gunman opened fire in a Walmart on Aug. 3, killing 22 people and injuring 26.

Police have said the suspect in the El Paso shootings told them his target was “Mexicans.” They also said he posted an anti-immigrant, anti-Latino screed that stated the attack was a “response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas."" Some of the language in the screed is considered similar to words used by the president and state leaders.

After the shootings, Trump condemned white supremacy and said “hate has no place in America"" but did not mention that Latinos were targeted or that the victims were predominantly Latino in his speech.

Miller is more than helping reshape immigration policy.

With Miller's assistance, the administration is ""doing an end run around Congress to dismantle every aspect of the immigration system"" through executive actions and gutting regulations and replacing them with their own, said Doug Rand, an immigration policy adviser in the Obama White House and cofounder of Boundless Immigration, which uses technology to help immigrants obtain green cards and citizenship.

""Believe it or not, it's possible to be to the right of President Trump on immigration, and that's where Stephen Miller has spent his whole career,"" Rand said. ""He idealizes the 1924 law that banned immigrants from just about everywhere but Western Europe, and he is pulling every lever he can find throughout the federal government to accomplish the same outcome.""

Escobar has asked the Department of Homeland Security to audit its policies to determine which were influenced by Miller ""to show the motivations of the administration's immigration policies and shed light on the people that help craft them.""

Separately, 107 members of Congress signed a letter to Trump demanding he fire Miler.

""A documented white nationalist has no place in any administration, and especially not in such an influential position,"" the Democratic congressional members said in the letter.

There also are several petitions calling for Miller’s resignation, including one started by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that had more than 130,000 signatures as of this week.

Miller previously worked for former Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. — who served as Trump’s first attorney general — before joining the Trump campaign.

More tolerance for intolerance?

That he persists reflects a change in what the country and political leaders are willing to tolerate under a Trump administration.

At the start of the year, House Republicans removed Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, from committee assignments after he said in an interview with The New York Times: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”

When he said in 2013 that young immigrants had calves the size of cantaloupes, King drew condemnation from throughout the party, including from Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart and former Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both Florida Republicans. King has been repeatedly re-elected and is a Trump ally.

Diaz-Balart, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the three most senior Latino Republicans in Congress, either didn’t respond or declined to comment on the calls for Miller’s resignation.

Rubio and Diaz-Balart, both from immigrant families, have a moderate record on immigration. Miller even targeted Rubio in emails to get negative stories written about him by Breitbart. Rubio's response has been that he knew Miller wasn't a fan of his immigration policies.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment. The White House has defended Miller in previous statements to media, raising Miller’s Jewish background in that defense.

Ocasio-Cortez dismissed that defense in an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes saying ""the color of your skin and the identity you are born with does not absolve you of moral wrong.""

""I don't think any public servant should weaponize their identity in order to advance white nationalist ideas. Period. Punto. I don't care who you are,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. Having Miller at the helm of U.S. immigration policy means policies “will become more fascistic and we cannot allow that to be us,"" she said.

A rise in violent, white supremacist extremism

In his emails, Miller makes clear the esteem he holds for another period in the country, when President Calvin Coolidge signed the Immigration Act of 1924 that severely restricted immigration from certain parts of the world. Coolidge is admired by white nationalists, according to the SPLC.

The act was the nation's first comprehensive restrictive immigration policy that established the Border Patrol.

After being told that Fox radio host Mark Levin has said there should be no immigration for several years ""for assimilation purposes,"" Miller responds:

""Like Coolidge did. Kellyanne Conway poll says that is exactly what most Americans want after 40 years of non-stop record arrivals,"" according to emails posted by SPLC. Conway is an adviser to Trump.

In referencing the 1924 act, Miller is ""harkening to an era of racial violence,"" said Monica Muñoz Martinez, author of ""The Injustice Never Leaves You: Anti-Mexican Violence in Texas.""

FBI statistics released in November showed an increase in hate crimes and violence against Latinos.

In a September report, the Department of Homeland Security said while the country still faces threats from foreign terrorist organizations, “unfortunately, the severity and number of domestic threats have also grown.”

The agency said there has been a “concerning” rise in attacks by people motivated by racially and ethnically motivated violent extremism, including white supremacist violent extremism, anti-government and anti-authority violent extremism and other ideologies.

White supremacist violent extremists can generally be characterized by hatred for immigrants and ethnic minorities, often combining these prejudices with virulent anti-Semitism or anti-Muslim views, the DHS report states.

In a Sept. 6, 2015, email, Miller suggested Breitbart write about “The Camp of the Saints,” SPLC reported. The novel's theme is the end of white civilization by migrants who arrive from India.

Kathleen Belew, an expert on the white-power movement, said in an interview with NPR that Miller’s citation of the book is “clear evidence that this is a person who is immersed in trafficking in white nationalist ideology.”

“Voters across the country, constituents across the country who see their leaders standing in silence in the face of unprecedented racism and bigotry at the highest levels of government in our generation, they need to look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves: Is this acceptable?” Escobar said.

3,https://www.alternet.org/2019/07/fox-news-has-gone-so-deep-into-white-nationalism-that-donald-trump-now-believes-its-how-hell-win-in-2020/,"Donald Trump thinks white nationalism is going to win him the 2020 election. This much is clear. Trump's racist Twitter rant on Sunday — in which he suggested that four nonwhite congresswomen, three of whom were born in the United States, are ""originally"" from somewhere else and should therefore ""go back"" — might have seemed at first like a spontaneous eruption of racist rage from the simmering bigot in the White House.

Soon, however, it became clear that this was strategic. Trump thinks it's a winning move to echo the claims of David Duke and other white nationalists who believe the United States is for white people. He justified his racism by saying that ""many people agree with me,"" and by continuing to rave on Twitter about how the real purveyors of ""racist hatred"" are those who look askance at his embracing the rhetoric of Stormfront and the KKK.

As Heather Digby Parton argued for Salon, this is more than an explosion of racist anger. Trump ""believes that most Americans are as racist as he is and that he will be rewarded for this indecency with a second term.""

There's good reason to think Trump and his boosters are wrong about this. As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie pointed out on Twitter, ""Trump's popularity has taken its sharpest dips whenever he goes full racist,"" and that even that seemingly rock-solid level of support that sits right around 42% in opinion polls has dipped into the 30s when Trump openly aligns himself with white nationalist views. Thanks largely to his racism (as well as his stunning lack of competence), Trump has spent his entire term in office with lower overall approval ratings than any president in more than 60 years.

So where does Trump getting this idea that ever more extreme racism is the way to win over voters? One major source is likely his favorite TV network and the only source of information he tends to take seriously: Fox News.

For years now, Fox News has been mainstreaming arguments that used to be the province of fringe websites run by neo-Nazis and other groups who believe the U.S. is meant to be a country of white people and for white people — perhaps with others permitted in small numbers of they stay quiet and keep to themselves. Trump was a major factor in the early rumblings of white nationalism on the network, which gave him considerable airtime during his reality TV days to air conspiracy theories about Barack Obama's birth certificate. Such ""birther"" theories rested fairly obviously, in the first place, on the belief that black people cannot be ""real"" Americans.

Since Trump was elected, the Fox News programming that promotes white nationalist ideas has slowly grown both in airtime and in severity. At Salon, we sounded the alarm in the early months of Trump's presidency, when prime-time Fox News host Tucker Carlson began to experiment with segments that used euphemisms like ""Western civilization"" to package the idea that white people are inherently more civilized while people of color are a threat to national stability.

Since then, Carlson and many of other Fox News pundits have only grown bolder. ""Replacement theory"" — the white nationalist idea that has spurred multiple terrorist attacks, holding that white people will somehow be removed and ""replaced"" by people of color — used to be confined to fringe neo-Nazi websites with atrocious early-2000s design aesthetics. Now that's become a regular feature of slick Fox News segments, which suggest that immigrants of color are ""invading the country"" and can never be ""fully American,"" and that demographic changes from immigration are ""more change than human beings are designed to digest"" and inherently a threat to ""your neighborhood.""

The network also hypes the idea that nonwhite immigrants are dirty and diseased, as well as inherently criminal. (For about the 400th time: Immigrants, documented or otherwise, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. There is no serious dispute about this.) Furthermore, because many immigrants speak languages other than English and may eat unfamiliar food or bring cultural practices that appear foreign to some, American society will soon be ""tipping over a cliff.""

This is the same kind of rhetoric that was used to demonize the Irish and Italian immigrants of the past, who were seen as threats to American culture due to scary foreign practices like putting garlic in food and praying with the Rosary. One hardly needs to mention the bigotry and discrimination directed at Jewish immigrants, who were barred from certain neighborhoods and many commercial establishments well into the 20th century. Unfortunately, most of the Fox News audience for this rhetoric, the president included, doesn't know anything about that history, or care to learn.

It's true that Fox News ratings are high, and that is incredibly meaningful to Trump, who has a long-standing obsession with TV ratings dating back to his days as host of ""The Apprentice."" More important still, Trump tends to view TV ratings as the single most meaningful metric of public opinion, one that far outweighs more statistically significant measures like political polling.

In looking over Trump's Twitter obsession with TV ratings, it's clear that he believes — or at least pretends to believe — that ratings are tied tightly to alliance with his racist agenda. It's not just that he routinely mocks CNN and MSNBC for supposedly having poor ratings. Any TV product that deviates too far from a racist agenda, he believes, takes a ratings hit for it. When NFL players were protesting racism, Trump gleefully declared it was hurting TV ratings. When the Oscars tried to improve racial diversity and attendees decried Trump's bigotry, he gloated that it was the ""Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY"". He even repeatedly (and falsely) tried to argue that his inauguration ratings exceeded Barack Obama's.

The pattern is clear: Trump believes racism is more popular than anti-racism, because, he believes, racism gets TV viewers and anti-racism doesn't. And getting TV viewers is the only measurement he takes seriously.

By any measure of cable viewership, there is no denying that Fox News has disturbingly high ratings. Its daytime audience is 1.3 million viewers on average and the prime time shows pull 2.4 million people. That doesn't just outdo other cable news networks, but mainstays like TNT and HGTV. Carlson gets nearly 3 million viewers a night, numbers that far exceed his rabid fan base of open white nationalists. Racism does sell, and the audience for white nationalist rhetoric is not small.

But those numbers do not even come close to a majority of Americans, or even of American voters. Nearly 129 million Americans voted in 2016, meaning that only about 2% of the electorate is tuning into Carlson's show on any given night. By contrast, the CBS sitcom ""The Big Bang Theory"" has nearly 19 million viewers. Racism sells, sure — but exponentially less well than unfunny sitcoms with aggressive laugh tracks.

Trump's racism is wildly popular with his base, in other words, but a large majority of Americans find it repulsive. No amount of the president's obsessive dissection of cable ratings will change that. That's not to say Trump's opponents should become complacent or assume that his unpopularity will automatically translate into a 2020 defeat. Unfortunately, racists are dramatically overrepresented in politics, due to the outdated mechanism of the Electoral College, which is how Trump won the 2016 election while getting nearly 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton. He could certainly pull it off again.

Still, Trump's apparently adamant belief that white nationalism will pay off in electoral terms doesn't reflect any reputable political polling. It appears instead to be an artifact of his obsession with TV and with Fox News in particular. It's a closed loop of awfulness: The more Trump pushes his racist agenda, the more the network amplifies his message, and the more he believes his bigotry is massively popular. Unless and until Trump takes a decisive L in 2020, he's going to keep believing the majority of Americans are secretly on his side.",0
4,https://www.alternet.org/2019/08/a-new-low-washington-post-media-critic-blows-up-tucker-carlsons-absurd-lies-about-white-nationalism/,"On Saturday, August 3, El Paso became the scene of a terrorist attack that left 22 people dead — and the suspect, according to police, had written a manifesto indicating that he planned to target Latinos specifically because they were “invading” Texas. The attack has focused attention on the terrorist threat posed by white supremacists and white nationalists, but on Tuesday, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson insisted that white supremacy is a “hoax” — and with that comment, Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan asserts, Carlson has “hit a new low.”

To hear Carlson tell it, white supremacy isn’t a real problem in the United States. Carlson, on Tuesday, declared, “This is a hoax, just like the Russia hoax. It’s a conspiracy theory used to divide the country and keep a hold on power.”

In response, Sullivan writes in her August 7 column that former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation was no laughing matter — explaining that “the Russian attacks on America’s voting integrity, in order to help Donald Trump become president, are anything but a hoax, as the Mueller Report made abundantly clear.”

Most of Sullivan’s column, however, is devoted to Carlson’s ridiculous views on white supremacy and his use of “empirical evidence” (she uses that term sarcastically) to show that it isn’t a problem. Carlson said, “I’ve lived here 50 years, and I’ve never met anybody — not one person — who ascribes to white supremacy. I don’t know a single person who thinks that’s a good idea.”

Sullivan’s snarky response: “Hmm. Maybe his sample size is a bit flawed.” And the Post columnist goes on to state that not only is racism alive and well in the U.S. — it is one of the “core tenets of the opinion-mongers at Fox News,” including Carlson.

“Carlson’s nightly show does a great deal to portray nonwhites as the dangerous ‘other,’ a force to be beaten back to save America,” Sullivan writes. “His denials and rhetoric must be called out for the lies that they are.”

At Fox News, Sullivan notes, the word “invasion” has been used repeatedly to describe “migrants coming to America, generally people of color from countries south of the border.” And the manifesto that, according to police, was posted online the day of the El Paso terrorist attack, states, “This attack is a response to (the) Hispanic invasion of Texas.”

Sullivan not only calls out Carlson in her column, but also, “Fox and Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade —who, this week, insisted, “If you use the term ‘an invasion,’ that’s not anti-Hispanic. It’s a fact.” Sullivan’s response to Kilmeade: “No, it’s racist propaganda.”

Sullivan concludes her column by explaining where Carlson can find an example of a white supremacist.

“Tucker Carlson has become one of the most high-profile perpetrators of this appalling and divisive message, one constantly amplified by the president,” Sullivan writes. “So, if Carlson thinks he hasn’t met a single white supremacist, he might want to take a searching look in the mirror.”",0
5,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/gangster-capitalist-trump-is-running-a-mafia-state-and-things-are-about-to-get-worse-pulitzer-prize-winning-journalist/,"Time is broken in Donald Trump’s America. Minutes feel like hours, hours feel like days. Weeks are months, and months are years. And there is an overwhelming sense of time warped by dread as the country careens towards a dangerous climax on Election Day — whatever the outcome.Disorientation is a feature of life in a failing democracy where fascism is ascendant.

In a widely read conversation here at Salon during the first few weeks of the national pandemic lockdown and the implosion of America’s economy, journalist and bestselling author Chris Hedges warned that, compared to what may lie ahead, “these were the good times.”

This was before the coronavirus pandemic continued its deadly march where today more than 136,000 people are dead. Hedges’ warnings were also made before we saw the full horror of Trump’s willful incompetence, cruelty and sabotage, or his willingness to sacrifice millions of Americans — including, potentially, children — for “the economy,” capitalism and, of course, his own re-election. Hedges also issued his warning about “the good times” before Trump’s threats of martial law and using military forces against the George Floyd protests and people’s uprising. It was also before Donald Trump declared war on Independence Day weekend against any and all Americans who dare to oppose him.

I reached out to Hedges again and asked him, “Are these still the good times?”

Yes, he said, they are.

In our latest conversation, Hedges explains why this perilous moment in America will be looked back upon fondly, compared to what the future holds. He sees little hope in Joe Biden and the Democratic Party, which he believes have no substantive solutions for the social inequality and other institutional problems that spawned Donald Trump and his white neofascist movement. Hedges is also concerned that America is spiraling down into the type of ethno-political violence he personally witnessed in Yugoslavia during that country’s civil war in the 1990s.

But Hedges also sees hope for saving the United States from imminent tyranny. Where? In the George Floyd protests and the possibility of revolutionary change.

You can also listen to my conversation with Chris Hedges on my podcast “The Truth Report” or through the player embedded below.

As is customary, this conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

Under Donald Trump’s reign, America is a country run by a crime family. Trump and his Republicans have no moral authority. They are removing any oversight by firing inspectors general within the federal government, which has allowed Trump and his allies to loot coronavirus relief funds for billions of dollars. Trump and his cronies rage about “law and order” and locking up people who were looting during the George Floyd uprising — when in reality the plutocrats are looting an entire country and have been doing so for decades.

It’s a mafia state. There’s no control. There’s no regulation. The system is full of legalized bribery. The electoral process is corrupt as well. The courts are stacked with right-wing ideologues. The press has been bought off and corporatized. Many of our constitutional rights as Americans have been revoked by judicial fiat, including the right to privacy. Corporate money floods political campaigns in the name of “free speech.” The United States is a failed democracy and a mafia state, the natural result of what happens when capitalism is deregulated.

Trump, Mitch McConnell, the other Republicans and their gangster capitalist allies are telling the public that $1,200 in coronavirus relief money is adequate. But the billionaires and millionaires are the ones who received the majority of the “relief” funds. America’s billionaires are now $500 billion richer because of the coronavirus disaster. The average American is closer to homelessness. Neoliberal capitalism amounts to socialism for the rich and “free markets” for everyone else.

Mitch McConnell and the other elites really have not figured out what is happening in this moment of great crisis and upheaval. What we are seeing now in America is about so much more than people just being sick of the police murdering innocent people. It is a generational and class revolt. Yes, COVID certainly exacerbated it. But all of the kindling was already there. Chronic underemployment, massive consumer and student debt, being priced out of the for-profit health care system and the expansion of militarized police and the prison system.

This movement is multiracial. It is led by people of color, but certainly, there are a lot of young white people out there too, and my sense is that they are no longer buying into being gaslit by the elites anymore.

The empire always strikes back. What will that look like?

We have to acknowledge that the empire is tottering towards its collapse. So what is empire? Empire is the expression of white supremacy beyond our borders. The whole nature of empire is to go into the Middle East — previously into Vietnam, Latin America, the Philippines and elsewhere — and steal natural resources and exploit cheap labor in the name of white supremacy. And of course, we have an American society built on chattel slavery and genocide against indigenous peoples. What empires traditionally do at the end is they engage in what historians call “micro-militarism”.

At the end, as they slip into an irrevocable decline, empires engage in military adventurism in a desperate bid to bring back lost power, lost wealth and lost glory. America has done this in the Middle East. The result is that America has been hollowed out from the inside.

At the end stage, the elites need the tools that the empire perfected on people of color abroad. That is why we see the drones and militarized police and heavy weapons such as armored personnel carriers being used here in America against the country’s own citizens.

White supremacy hurts white folks. There are so many examples of this, from the way that federal and state resources are spent putting Black and brown people in prison in disproportionate numbers to how white racism hurts the overall economy. The police in Buffalo intentionally knocking down that older white man, who lay there bleeding from the head while the police walked over him like he was human garbage, was such a profound metaphor for how racism hurts white people. With the George Floyd protests and people’s uprising, white folks are seeing, again, that what Black and brown folks have been saying about police thuggery is true. Now the police are brutalizing white people.

People of color always, throughout American history, suffer first. They are the first to suffer — and they suffer disproportionately. But de-industrialization has now hit the white working class. The tools of control are now being used against them. Overall, I don’t so much fault the white racists. They are what they are. I fault the white liberals who really did not pay attention to what was happening to primarily poor people of color in urban areas.

Everything that is now enraging white progressives is not new — it goes back decades. But it was never really covered by the mainstream American news media. The liberal elites busied themselves with the boutique activism of “diversity” and “tolerance,” “multiculturalism” and the like. Sure, that is well and good, but not when such approaches are divorced from economic justice.

When you look at these multiracial, intergenerational protests, what do you see?

There has been mass economic disenfranchisement. There is a leadership crisis too among the Democrats and the so-called liberals.

For example, look at what the Congressional Black Caucus is doing. They are repeating the same kind of tired clichés about police reform we have heard for years. Most people participating in the George Floyd protests know that such reforms are useless. Empty symbolism. The mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser, paints “Black Lives Matter” in 35-foot-tall letters on a street near the White House. But at the same time, she’s pushing for a $45 million increase in the police budget and the construction of a $500 million new jail. I don’t think people are buying such a performance. I also don’t believe that people are buying Pelosi’s little kente-cloth, “take a knee in solidarity with Black Lives Matter” trick either.

In part, such actions have no credibility because younger white people no longer buy into the policies of the oligarchs which produced all of this extreme social inequality in the first place. People of color have long known this truth. Now younger white people are being forced into a new type of awareness and consciousness. That is a good thing.

I worry that the Democrats are setting themselves up for great failure and a crushing defeat with all this celebration of how Biden is leading Trump in these early polls. Polls are a snapshot in time. They are not predictive of the outcome on Election Day. Hillary Clinton and Mike Dukakis had double digit leads at various times, and they both lost to Republicans.

As embarrassing and awful as Trump is, he serves corporate power just like Joe Biden. The big corporate Democratic Party donors made it clear that if Bernie Sanders became the presidential nominee, they would support Trump. The donor class has created a system where they cannot fail. If it’s Trump or Biden, Goldman Sachs doesn’t lose, ExxonMobil doesn’t lose, Raytheon doesn’t lose, Citibank doesn’t lose. There is no way that they can lose. They have rigged the system so that their interests are always served.

Donald Trump tried to order the United States military to attack the American people several weeks ago because they dared to participate in massive protests against police brutality and social inequality. These protests continue and social movement scholars are now saying that the George Floyd protests may be the largest such mobilizations in American history. Trump tried to order martial law and the senior leaders of the United States military basically told him no. On one hand I am glad the military defied Trump. On the other hand, I am deeply concerned about such power in a democracy being normalized. Either way, America is not a healthy democracy.

The military does not want to be deployed in the streets. At present they are the most respected social and political institution in the country. The military gets even more money than they ask for from the Democrats and the Republicans. The military, quite correctly, saw that it would be disastrous for them to follow Trump’s commands to crack down and enact martial law.

As a practical matter, the military does not need to intervene against the George Floyd protesters and others who have taken to the streets because the American police are so highly militarized. In America there are SWAT teams who don’t look much different than Army Rangers knocking down doors in Afghanistan.

In many ways, the most potent anti-democratic force in the United States is the military. They are untouchable. The U.S. military cannot even be audited. Such power and influence are a classic symptom of the end of an empire. The Praetorian Guard can no longer be controlled by the supposed political leaders.

There have been incidents across the country in which white mobs attack Black Lives Matter protesters, anti-fascists and other Americans of conscience. These thugs are yelling Trump slogans, wearing his regalia and attacking with baseball bats and other weapons. The Trump street enforcers also have guns. Where do we go from here?

The more beleaguered Donald Trump becomes, the more he and the other racists and nativists will incite violence. America right now reminds me of Yugoslavia during the 1990s.

Donald Trump’s supporters are willing to kill and die for him. This is just the beginning of what is going to happen as Election Day approaches. You have been in war zones and countries torn apart by ethnic cleansing and genocide. What is the model for how a people turn on each other?

It begins with economic dysfunction, which is what happened in Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia went into de facto bankruptcy. The huge state factories closed, just like they did here in the United States. There was massive unemployment, the social bonds in the country were ruptured. There were bread lines. People lost everything, including a sense of identity. As a result, they retreated into these mythical narratives about themselves as Serbs, Croats and Muslims. In such a moment shared public discourse is impossible. These other identities and their myths have now superseded verifiable historical fact. That’s what happened in Yugoslavia, and that is very much part of what is happening in the United States.

Then there is the rise of demagogues who demonize a segment of the population and target them as the Other. Then the eliminationist rhetoric and violent rhetoric begins. After four years, people started shooting each other in Yugoslavia. The United States is approaching that point.

We spoke with each other several months ago during the first few weeks of the national coronavirus lockdown and economic collapse. You told me that as horrible as things were then, it was in fact “the good times.” Several months have gone by. Is the United States still experiencing “good times” as compared to what will happen in the future?

Yes, as compared to what is coming. The elites are not responding rationally to the coronavirus pandemic, the economic devastation and the myriad of other problems facing the United States right now. America’s ruling class is doing just what they did in 2008, which is to line their own pockets at the public’s expense and to cast the rest of the country — the working poor and the working class — aside as if they were human refuse. That is all very shortsighted, of course, because of the blowback. The ramifications are catastrophic. One would think that America’s elites would respond in a smarter way, if even for their own self-preservation. If elected president, Joe Biden certainly isn’t going to respond properly.

The George Floyd protests are more accurately described as a generational class revolt. I hope that the protesters and their allies win, because if we do not take power back from this American mafia state then there will be a very ugly type of tyranny in the country.

As Aristotle said, once you have oligarchic rule, there are only two choices. It is revolution or tyranny, and that’s it. I’m not naive enough to tell you the revolution is going to win, but I’m going to tell you that if it doesn’t win then there will be a very ugly corporate tyranny in the United States.

The American elites, the ruling class, has already rewritten all the laws.They already have the prison cells. They’ve already militarized the forces of internal security. They’ve already legitimized the revoking of basic rights like habeas corpus and due process. Americans are already the most watched, monitored, surveilled, photographed population in human history. The forces of tyranny are ready to go.

I’m more optimistic because I see the resistance in the streets, which wasn’t there a few weeks and months ago. That’s where hope lies. It lies in the streets. And I have got to acknowledge these people. They’re mostly young, incredibly courageous, they are out there braving economic misery, arrests, indiscriminate, brutal and often lethal police violence and COVID-19, and they’re fighting against injustice and the elites anyway. They’re all heroes in my book.",0

Many on the left were critical of Biden’s centrist record during the Democratic presidential primary, including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. But some liberals and progressives now find themselves warming up to Biden’s policy agenda, and Sanders recently told MSNBC that the “compromises” Biden has in mind on health care, the economy and other issues would, if implemented, make him “the most progressive president since FDR.”

Some of the specifics of Biden’s policy agenda are outlined by liberal Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent, who generally likes what he is hearing from the former vice president and ex-U.S. senator.

Sargent, in his column, explains that Biden’s economic plan “draws a stark contrast with (President Donald) Trump on two fronts — his failure to mobilize a robust federal response to the coronavirus pandemic, and his full-on embrace of GOP plutocracy…. The core of the Biden plan is a pledge to ‘use the full power of the federal government’ to ‘rebuild U.S. domestic manufacturing capacity’ and fortify ‘supply chains’ to ensure availability of ‘critical supplies’ in ‘future crises.’ It envisions $700 billion in new spending to stimulate demand for U.S.-manufactured products and on research into clean energy and digital technologies.”

The “U.S.-manufactured products” part is important. In 2016, “made in the U.S.A.” was a key element of Trump’s platform — and as conservative Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin noted this week, Biden is making U.S.-based manufacturing a priority.

Sargent notes that Biden’s “plan would tighten rules to ensure products purchased by the federal government are comprehensively made in the United States. The review would determine supply chain ‘vulnerabilities’ to reduce dependence on China for — among other things — medical supplies, and create a more robust domestic ‘stockpile’ and ‘manufacturing capacity’ in crisis conditions.”

Samuel Hammond, director of welfare policy at the Niskanen Center, explained: “The Trumpian approach is purely negative: throw tariffs up and hope manufacturing jobs will miraculously return. Biden’s approach is to level up American workers and make our supply chains more resilient. Trump just wants to turn back the clock on globalization.”

One of the many issues that Biden hotly debated with other presidential candidates during the Democratic primary debates was health care. All of the candidates said they wanted universal health coverage, but how they hoped to achieve it varied considerably. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren proposed abandoning private insurance in favor of a government-operated Medicare-for-all program, while Biden, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and other centrists argued in favor of an aggressive expansion of the Affordable Care Act of 2010.

NBC News reporter Marianna Sotomayor, this week, described Biden’s health care plan as “Affordable Care Act 2.0.” The plan would build on Obamacare, according to Sotomayor, and would allow Americans to either keep their private insurance or “buy into” a “Medicare-like” public option. Liberal economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has said that Biden’s “major expansion of Obamacare, which would probably get us close to universal coverage.”

Journalist Matthew Yglesias, in Vox, reports that Biden’s proposals on housing are receiving positive feedback from “Columbia University scholars” as well as Mary Cunningham, vice president for metropolitan housing and communities policy at the Urban Institute.

Cunningham told Vox: “Biden’s plan is bold, comprehensive and will go a long way in making sure every American has a home. It’s plainly obvious, in the middle of this pandemic, that home is more important than ever.”

Yglesias writes that according to Columbia scholars, Biden’s “housing plan agenda” could “cut child poverty by a third.” According to Yglesias, the “centerpiece” of Biden’s plan is to “take America’s biggest rental assistance program — Section 8 housing vouchers — and make it available to every family who qualifies. The current funding structure leaves out around 11 million people, simply because the pot allocated by Congress is too small.”

The Vox journalist explains that Stephanie Collyer and Chris Wimer of Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy, upon analyzing Biden’s housing plan, find that “the properly measured poverty rate falls by 22% under this proposal, while child poverty falls by 34%. Not bad for a policy that would cost just a fraction of Trump’s tax cuts.”",0
7,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/06/01/23-arrested-london-black-lives-matter-protests-police-assaulted/,"23 people were arrested for offences including assaulting police officers at the Antifa and Black Lives Matter demonstrations in London on Sunday.

The police offered very little resistance to the unauthorised demonstrations, which shut down streets, left commuters stranded among the crowds thronging the roads, paying absolutely no heed to the coronavirus lockdown regulations which have, up until now, been enforced with draconian enthusiasm. UK state broadcaster the BBC reported that 23 individuals were arrested in the course of the protest. Three were for breaching coronavirus lockdown rules, and two for assaulting police officers.

The demonstrations were said to have been held in aid of George Floyd, who died while being taken in custody in distance Minneapolis, on the other side of the Atlantic, by a police officer who has now been charged with third-degree murder and negligent manslaughter.

Video footage uploaded by MailOnline shows activists in London chanting “No justice, no peace!” and scuffling with officers as they lead away a woman in handcuffs near a police van, with at least one drawing his baton as the crowd becomes increasingly rowdy.

Scuffles elsewhere have been shared by outlets such as LBC News, whose reporter Rachel Gerrish reported seeing “drinks thrown, but barely any social distancing” while at the scene.

Officers have been engaging and consistently policing all gatherings this weekend, encouraging all to comply with the regulations to keep everyone safe. — Metropolitan Police (@metpoliceuk) May 31, 2020

The general posture of the Metropolitan Police towards activists, some of whom carried the Antifa banner and signs bearing slogans such as “THE UK IS NOT INNOCENT” and “BLACK RAGE IS JUSTIFIED”, has been one of appeasement, with the number of arrests very small compared to the number of people openly flouting lockdown regulations despite the continuing government policy on lockdown in response to the Wuhan virus pandemic.

Pictures and video of activists breaking the lockdown rules are readily available, with Breitbart London reporter Kurt Zindulka recording one taking up a megaphone and declaring: “It’s time to wake up and get out the house and fuck this place up, man. I’m tired of this shit. We need to burn this shit down. I don’t care what the London mayor says. The West is falling! The West is falling!”

But the police have expressed little interest in pursuing any of the lockdown breakers, at least publicly, merely tweeting that “Officers have been engaging and consistently policing all gatherings this weekend, encouraging all to comply with the regulations to keep everyone safe.”

8,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/olympic-swimming-sun-yang-banned-doping,"Chinese swimmer Sun Yang was banned for eight years on Friday and will miss the 2020 Tokyo Olympics because he broke anti-doping rules in a late-night incident in which a blood sample container was smashed with a hammer.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport found the three-time Olympic champion guilty of refusing to cooperate with sample collectors during a visit to his home in September 2018 that turned confrontational.

In a rare hearing in open court in November, evidence was presented of how a security guard instructed by Sun’s mother broke the casing around a vial of his blood. The swimmer lit the early-hours scene with his mobile phone.

“The athlete failed to establish that he had a compelling justification to destroy his sample collection containers and forego the doping control when, in his opinion, the collection protocol was not in compliance,” the CAS panel of three judges agreed in a unanimous verdict.

TOKYO ORGANIZERS, GOVERNMENT TAKE OFFENSIVE ON VIRUS THREAT

China's greatest ever swimmer, and one of its biggest sports stars, had asked CAS for a public trial.

A 10-hour hearing broadcast on the court’s website showed Sun to be evasive at times under questioning that was hampered by severe translation issues between Chinese and English. The CAS panel’s verdict was delayed until all parties got a verified translation.

The 6-foot, 7-inch (2-meter) Sun, the first Chinese swimmer to win Olympic gold, has long been a polarizing figure in the pool.

Rivals branded him a drug cheat at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and two competitors refused to stand with him on medal podiums at the 2019 world championships.

Now banned until February 2028, the 28-year-old Sun cannot defend his 200-meter freestyle title in Tokyo.

TOKYO ORGANIZERS, IOC GOING AHEAD AS PLANNED WITH OLYMPICS

The World Anti-Doping Agency went to CAS after a FINA tribunal only warned Sun. The first ruling was that anti-doping protocol was not followed, making the samples invalid, and cited doubts about credentials shown to him by the sample collection team.

“WADA ... is satisfied that justice in this case has been rendered,” the body's director general Olivier Niggli said in a statement.

Sun can now appeal to Switzerland’s supreme court, but on narrow procedural grounds. His lawyers have already had three federal appeals dismissed on legal process issues.

WADA requested a ban of between two and eight years for a second doping conviction. Sun served a three-month ban in 2014 imposed by Chinese authorities after testing positive for a stimulant that was banned at the time. The ban was not announced until after it ended.

That first case led to criticism of FINA for appearing to protect one of the sport’s biggest stars in a key market.

Swimming's governing body said it will make a statement later Friday.

Sun never missed a major event while banned in 2014. He added 200 gold at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics to the historic 400 and 1,500 titles he took in London four years earlier.

'MIRACLE ON ICE' 40 YEARS AGO WAS SO GREAT, TWO MOVIES WERE MADE ABOUT IT

He won a total of 11 golds in five straight world championships from 2011 to 2019, at each freestyle distance from 200 to 1,500. At three Asian Games from 2010 to 2018, he won nine gold medals.

The court ruled Friday that Sun can retain the two world titles he won in South Korea last July while the WADA appeal case against him was pending.

Days after the 2018 Asian Games, Sun was visited at his home by three officials sent by a Swedish firm to get blood and urine samples from him. International athletes must notify where and when they will be available for one hour each day, and Sun had suggested late on Sept. 4.

When FINA prosecuted Sun following the incident, its tribunal panel in January 2019 merely warned Sun and cited doubts about the officials’ credentials.

Although Sun and his entourage, including his mother, were criticized for their conduct, the FINA panel said the sample mission was void because anti-doping protocol was not followed. Technically, Sun was judged to be not properly notified of needing to give samples.

In the CAS hearing, questioning by judges and WADA’s lawyers revealed skepticism that an experienced athlete could claim to be so unfamiliar with the process and the paperwork.

9,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/01/02/ocean-cleanup-device-great-pacific-garbage-patch-breaks/2465082002/,"SAN FRANCISCO – A 60-foot chunk of the Ocean Cleanup device, deployed with much fanfare in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in October, has broken off and the entire plastic collection system will now be towed back to port for an overhaul and upgrade.

The break was discovered on Dec. 29 during a routine inspection by the cleanup system’s crew. A 60-foot end section of the 2,000-foot boom that corrals the plastic had detached, Boyan Slat, Cleanup’s CEO, posted on the Dutch non-profit’s blog on New Year’s Eve.

The fracture was caused by material fatigue, he wrote. That’s likely because of the intense action of the waves that puts tremendous stress on objects in the water.

“We will set sail as soon as an appropriate weather window is available,"" Slat said.

The Ocean Cleanup is a passive system involving a 2,000-foot floating series of connected 4-foot booms that form a giant horseshoe at the surface of the ocean. Below that hangs a 9-foot skirt that corrals the tiny pieces of plastic trash that float in the water. The action of the currents and waves is meant to push trash into the system’s center while the micro-plastic, as it's called, is captured by the hanging barrier.

The system was towed out to sea from its building berth on San Francisco Bay on Sept. 8, 2018, and was first deployed about 240 nautical miles offshore where it was tested for two weeks. It was then towed to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch nearly 1,400 miles off the West Coast, about halfway between California and Hawaii.

The non-profit is based in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, a center for marine engineering. But the prototype was built in San Francisco Bay in part because it’s close to the world’s largest ocean garbage area, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

The break is the second problem that’s popped up since the system was first deployed in October. In late November the group said it wasn’t holding on to the plastic it collected. The system was moving too slowly at times to keep the plastic inside the U-shaped device, allowing it to float out again. Sometimes the plastic even moves faster than the system, effectively outrunning it.

In his New Year’s Eve post, Slat wrote that he was “quite bummed about” the problem. However, he added that “setbacks like this are inevitable when pioneering new technology at a rapid pace. Being in port provides us with the opportunity to make upgrades to the system.”

The system – dubbed Wilson by the crew after the volleyball befriended by Tom Hanks in the movie ""Castaway"" – collected about 4,500 pounds of plastic during the past few weeks. That’s a far cry from the 2,200 pounds the group believed it would capture per week.

“We believe these teething troubles are solvable, and the cleanup of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch will be operational in 2019,” Slat wrote.

It’s not surprising that a long, floating object would suffer severe stress when subjected to an ocean environment.

“The ocean is always challenging,” said Kim Martini, a physical oceanographer who helps design scientific instruments that can withstand ocean stressors for Sea-Bird Scientific, a Seattle-based company.

More testing prior to deployment might have revealed the problems earlier, she said.

“They put something out that’s really big and it cost a lot of money. Just 2,000 kilograms of plastic is a pretty small return on investment for $20 million dollars,” she said.",1
10,https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/70-percent-of-americans-say-us-economic-system-unfairly-benefits-the-powerful/,"A 70% majority of Americans view the economy as unfairly favoring those with power, and large majorities also say politicians, giant corporations, and wealthy individuals wield too much power over the economy, according to Pew Research Center.

The idea of a ""rigged"" economy that both benefits and is shaped by the rich and powerful was a popular theme in 2016 and is sure to play a big role again this cycle with several Democratic candidates emphasizing it on the campaign trail. It's a particularly good focal point too because Pew found it resonates across income groups, including 66% of upper-income individuals, 69% of middle-income folks, and 73% of lower-income adults.

From a partisan standpoint, however, the issue plays differently. While large majorities of Democrats in all three income brackets say the system unfairly favors the powerful, Republicans are more divided by income group. ""Lower-income Republicans are far less likely than their higher-income GOP counterparts to say the economic system is generally fair (37% vs. 63%),"" writes Pew, suggesting that economic inequality is an issue that resonates with certain segments of the GOP.

On the related question of who wields too much power over the economy, more than 8 in 10 respondents agree that's true of politicians, large corporations, and wealthy individuals.",0
11,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/iowa-republicans-try-ax-transgender-protections-state-law-n1126426?cid=public-rss_20200130,"DES MOINES, Iowa — A bill proposed by a group of Republican lawmakers on Wednesday that would have amended the Iowa Civil Rights Act by removing protections against discrimination for transgender people is dead, a powerful committee chairman said.

Nine Republican House members sponsoring the bill introduced it Wednesday morning but by evening Republican Rep. Steven Holt, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee to which the bill was assigned, said he wouldn’t allow it to move forward to a subcommittee hearing.

“It’s dead,” Holt said. “It just would have had a lot of unintended consequences.”

Iowa law currently prohibits discrimination based on gender identity, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, ancestry and disability. Gender identity was added by lawmakers in 2007 when Democrats regained control of the Iowa Legislature and held the governor’s office with the election of Gov. Chet Culver. The GOP took control of the legislature in 2017.

Civil and gay rights advocates immediately criticized the measure.

“Allowing transgender Iowans to be fired from their jobs or denied housing simply because they are transgender is a new low, and they should be ashamed of themselves,” said Courtney Reyes, director of One Iowa Action, an LGBTQ advocacy group.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa said the bill attempts to roll back the clock.

“Discriminating against transgender people — or any Iowans — will not make them, or us, go away or stop being who they are. We’ll continue to remind legislators of the obvious: Transgender people already do exist; they aren’t going anywhere; and they have large communities of Iowans fighting for equality and dignity right alongside them,” said Mark Stringer, the group’s executive director.

Bill sponsor Republican Rep. Dean Fisher, a central Iowa farmer, said he proposed the measure to address “a whole host of issues” such as transgender women seeking to be incarcerated in women’s prisons.

It wasn’t immediately clear if the Iowa Department of Corrections has dealt with such requests. Spokesman Cord Overton said he would research the issue and attempt to provide an answer.

Fisher also cited concerns about transgender women participating in women’s sports, an issue not widely reported as a problem in Iowa.

“I think we’ve just got to nip this in the bud,” Fisher said.

He also raised concerns about an Iowa Supreme Court ruling last year that said the state couldn’t prevent Medicaid from paying for sex reassignment surgeries because it violated the Iowa Civil Rights Act. Republican lawmakers later amended the act specifically to say it doesn’t require government entities to pay for sex reassignment surgery. A lawsuit challenging that law on constitutional equal protection grounds was initially dismissed by a judge but continues to be litigated.

Holt said he respects Fisher’s viewpoint but the bill wouldn’t get a hearing needed to advance in the House.

Fisher did not immediately return a call.

The only group registered in favor of the bill is the The Family Leader, an evangelical Christian group that opposes gay marriage and abortion. Lobbyists for several other groups including the state’s largest public employee union oppose the bill.

The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ civil rights advocacy group, said at least 20 states prohibit employment, housing and public accommodation discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.

In the video, the handler could be seen wearing a Kaepernick jersey as dogs attacked him for demonstration purposes at an event held by the nonprofit National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum. ""Oh man, I will stand,” the handler could be heard saying after the dog attack. The comment, a reference to Kaepernick’s earlier decision to kneel for social justice during the playing of the national anthem at NFL games, earned him a few laughs from the crowd, but the Navy was not amused.

“The inherent message of this video is completely inconsistent with the values and ethos of Naval Special Warfare and the U.S. Navy,” a Navy spokesperson said in a statement about the incident. ""We are investigating the matter fully, and initial indications are that there were no active duty Navy personnel or equipment involved with this independent organization's event.""

When Kaepernick, who was then a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, took a knee during the national anthem four years ago, he was all but banned from the NFL and targeted with threats and profanities. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell recently did an about-face in light of protests throughout the nation following the death of George Floyd. A Black man, Floyd died in police custody May 25 after a Minneapolis cop kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes. “We were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,"" Goodell has since said.

Far be it for President Donald Trump to follow suit, though. He implied Kaepernick was a “son of a b---h” at an Alabama rally for Republican Sen. Luther Strange in September 2017, and he stood by his stance this year following Floyd’s death.

Trump said June 19 that if the NFL doesn’t “stand for our National Anthem and our Great American Flag, I won’t be watching!!!” It’s no mystery why people, even those representing powerful agencies, feel so emboldened to live out their cherished racist sentiments. The SEAL museum has failed to address the anti-Kaepernick videos in a public statement.

Although it isn't officially affiliated with the Navy SEALs, the museum has several retired SEALs on its board of directors and has apparently been mocking Kaepernick for years, ABC News reported. Another video taken in November 2018 at the museum's 33rd Annual Muster event shows an SUV with the words “TAKE A KNEE” and “NIKE” on it being used as a shooting target following the corporation’s decision to use Kaepernick in an ad.",0

In a video the New York Post obtained, white men in ""America Strong"" hats and wearing painted gold laurel wreaths associated with the Proud Boys attacked a man in all black, telling him to leave and shoving him when he tried.

""Get out! Get the f--- outta here!"" they shouted outside of Harry's Bar, a gathering spot for the Proud Boys The Washington Post reported. When shoved, the man took out a knife to protect himself and tried to run away, the New York Post reported. ""Get his ass!"" someone in the crowd shouted. Police response as the targetted man vanished into the crowd was: ""Stop guys stop — please stop.""





""Today I saw proud boys attack legal observers, call people cockroaches, and mace and assault random people. They can call themselves whatever they want, but they're the new KKK. They're domestic terrorists,"" Black Lives Matter protester Joshua Potash tweeted early Sunday. He also compared police reaction to the violence with their response to Black Lives Matter protesters and journalists in the wake of George Floyd's death. Floyd, a Black man, was killed when a white Minneapolis cop kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes on May 25. At least eight people were partially blinded the same day police went on a rampage targeting protesters on May 30. ""I've been at BLM marches all summer and fall where people are attacked and arrested by cops just for standing in the street. Tonight in DC dozens of Proud Boys maced and attacked people and cops didn't do shit,"" Potash said in another tweet.





Victims of the violence endured potentially life-threatening injuries D.C. fire spokesman Doug Buchanan told The Washington Post. D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham told protesters: ""We're doing the best we can."" He told the Post officers were deployed throughout downtown to keep Trump supporters and counterprotesters separated, but portions of the crowd seemed ""intent on conflict."" By 9 p.m., 23 people were arrested and one person had an unauthorized Taser, police said. In total, two police officers were hospitalized with moderate injuries and six others suffered injuries of unknown severity, the Post reported.

Bree Newsome Bass, a grassroots organizer, asked in one tweet: ""Is there a point at which all the people saying ""I never thought this could happen"" start listening to the people who've been saying for years that this was going to happen?"" Author Wajahat Ali tweeted: ""I can't even imagine hundreds of armed Muslims burning flags, beating up people, stabbing people in the streets of the nation's capital without dozens of folks being shot and killed by the police. Meanwhile it's Springtime for Proud Boys and White Supremacy right now.""





Journalist David Leavitt tweeted:

""The proud boys are domestic terrorists

The proud boys are domestic terrorists

The proud boys are domestic terrorists

The proud boys are domestic terrorists

The proud boys are domestic terrorists

The proud boys are domestic terrorists

The proud boys are domestic terrorists""

I concur.

14,https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/republicans-are-reeling-as-trump-comes-under-fire/,"A bold statement Wednesday from former Secretary of Defense Gen. James Mattis eviscerating Donald Trump has landed like a bomb in the Senate Republican caucus, sending members fleeing in all different directions.

While many Senate Republicans are doing their usual duck and dodge move, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska made some truly notable remarks about Mattis' contention that Trump is a threat to the U.S. Constitution.

""When I saw General Mattis' comments yesterday I felt like perhaps we are getting to a point where we can be more honest with the concerns that we might hold internally,"" Murkowski said, calling Mattis' words ""true, and honest, and necessary and overdue.""

Murkowski said she was ""struggling"" with whether to support Trump, adding: ""I think right now we are all struggling to find ways to express the words that need to be expressed appropriately, questions about who I'm going to vote for, not going to vote for, I think are distracting at the moment.""

Murkowski clearly isn't done talking yet, noting that she was ""working as one individual to form the right words.""

But Murkowski's acknowledgment that she is virtually alone in her caucus is accurate. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney is the only other Senate Republican so far to willingly remark on Mattis' excoriation of Trump, called the retired Marine four-star general ""an American patriot"" and his letter ""stunning and powerful.""

Practically every other Senate Republican is burying their head in the sand even as they refrain from criticizing a person of Mattis' stature.

As he left the Senate floor, GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell silently brushed past reporters inquiring about the letter. That's the second time this week McConnell has gone silent. He also couldn't bring himself to comment on whether he supported Trump's threat to use military force on American citizens.

Other members of the GOP caucus also shrank from questions. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa declined to comment. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas offered, ""I didn't see what he said."" Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, originally suggested Mattis had been duped and misquoted by the press. (Note: Mattis issued a lengthy statement of his own volition.) Told that Mattis actually wrote a letter and asked again whether he agreed with the content of it, Inhofe ducked. “I don’t agree that I should pass judgment on what he should be writing,” he said.

And then there's the simply next-level stupidity of Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Asked about Mattis' withering criticism of Trump forcibly clearing peaceful protesters for his bizarro photo op, Johnson offered: ""I still haven't seen any footage of how the crowd was cleared out."" Just a total news blackout over there in Johnson's bunker. Johnson did, however, say Mattis was ""free to express"" his opinion. Bold.

Don't expect any Senate Republicans to declare a meaningful break from Trump anytime soon. As conservative commentator George Will told MSNBC Wednesday, Senate Republicans have ""outsourced their consciences.""

But Murkowski's comments undoubtedly make life more difficult for vulnerable Republicans like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado. It's why McConnell and Ernst, who are both up for reelection, chose to just keep their traps shut. And although nearly every Republican has sold their souls to Trump, none of them want to cross someone with the moral authority of Gen. Mattis, who counseled Americans in no uncertain terms to abandon Trump.

""We can unite without him,"" Mattis wrote, an extraordinary comment for a man who spent 40 years deferring to the orders of U.S. presidents.",0

In an interview over the weekend with NBC affiliate WJAR in Providence, the Rev. Richard Bucci of Sacred Heart Church in West Warwick described abortion as ""the slaughter of innocent children.""

""We are not talking about any other moral issue, where some may make it a comparison between pedophilia and abortion,"" Bucci told the station. ""Pedophilia doesn't kill anyone, and this does.""

Bucci said more children have been killed by abortion than have been abused, adding, ""which is not to say that abuse is not a horrible thing.""

Sacred Heart Church declined to comment Wednesday, deferring to Bucci. NBC News reached out to Bucci for comment but did not immediately hear back. He later told WJAR his comments were taken out of context and that if anyone supports clergy sex abuse victims, it's him.

""It was imperfectly said,"" Bucci said. ""I should have said, 'In general, the child that's molested does not die physically,' and I should have said, 'but some have.'""

Rev. Richard Bucci of Sacred Heart Church in West Warwick, R.I. WJAR

Bucci's earlier comments to the TV station came after he put out a notice to Sacred Heart parishioners at the end of January listing the names of lawmakers who would not be allowed to receive communion at the church or participate in certain religious functions, such as acting as godparents or lectors at weddings.

The announcement came days after the Jan. 22 anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 establishing the right to abortion.

The priest's action also came months after Rhode Island in 2019 enacted the Reproductive Privacy Act to enshrine the right to abortion in state law.

The secretary of Sacred Heart Church provided a copy of the flyer to NBC News. Lawmakers' names appeared below the message:

""In accord with the teaching of the Catholic Church for 2000 years, the following members of the legislature may not receive Holy Communion, as are all the officers of the state of Rhode Island, as well as Rhode Island’s members of Congress. In addition, they will not be allowed to act as witnesses to marriage, godparents, or lectors at weddings, funerals or any other church function.”

Bucci discussed this announcement in an interview with the Providence Journal.

“If they are proud of what they have done, why do they want to keep it a secret?"" he said of lawmakers. ""We all hear about responsibility. Let them take responsibility. If they think this is a good and wholesome and holy thing ... they should be proud of it, and why should I hide that from my parishioners?""

Providence Bishop Thomas Tobin issued a statement Thursday, saying, ""It is never acceptable to underestimate the harm caused by sexual abuse of minors,"" but ""abortion is also a sinful, immoral act, an abominable crime.”

""In the current public discussion, I urge all parties to refrain from unhelpful, inflammatory rhetoric, and to reflect personally and prayerfully on the consequences of these grave matters,"" Tobin said.

On Monday, a diocese spokeswoman, Carolyn Cronin, told WJAR that the church provides ""detailed norms for preparation and reception"" for each sacrament, but that it is ""the pastor’s duty to apply them within his parish, in accord with church law.""

""Because the church entrusts to each pastor the duty of teaching, sanctifying, and governing his parish, the daily pastoral and administrative decisions are made at the local parish level,"" Cronin said.",0
16,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/conservative-activist-family-behind-grassroots-anti-quarantine-facebook-events-n1188021,"Protests against state stay-at-home orders have attracted a wide range of fringe activists and ardent Trump supporters. They have also attracted a family of political activists whom some Republican lawmakers have called ""scam artists.""

A family-run network of pro-gun groups is behind five of the largest Facebook groups dedicated to protesting the shelter-in-place restrictions, according to an NBC News analysis of Facebook groups and website registration information.

The groups were set up by four brothers — Chris, Ben, Aaron and Matthew Dorr — and have amassed more than 200,000 members collectively, including in states where they don't reside, according to an NBC News analysis based on public records searches and Facebook group registrations.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The Dorr brothers are known in conservative circles for running pro-gun and anti-abortion rights Facebook groups that bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars annually by antagonizing establishment conservative leaders and activists.

Their usual method is to attack established conservative groups from the right, including the National Rifle Association, and then make money by selling memberships in their groups or selling mailing lists of those who sign up, according to some conservative politicians and activists who have labeled the efforts as scams.

The Washington Post first reported on the Dorrs' role in the events.

The pages are just part of the more than 100 state-specific Facebook groups that have been created in the last two weeks to protest the stay-at-home orders, according to an unpublished analysis by First Draft, an organization that researches disinformation. The pages have organized at least 49 different events. Most of the groups are similarly named, and they have attracted more than 900,000 members in total.

The Dorrs' pages, however, follow a particularly uniform naming system, according to information openly available on Facebook. A Dorr brother created or is an administrator for the groups Pennsylvanians Against Excessive Quarantine, Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantine, New Yorkers Against Excessive Quarantine, Minnesotans Against Excessive Quarantine and Ohioans Against Excessive Quarantine.

Chris, Ben, Aaron and Matthew Dorr did not reply to requests for comment.

Ben Dorr told The Philadelphia Inquirer that the claims that his efforts are scams are ""fake news"" and that he plans to continue his work.

The network

The Facebook groups started by the Dorrs each promote state-specific websites, which were registered with the same private registrar, and use similar language in their descriptions.

""It's time to OPEN UP PENNSYLVANIA and STOP Gov Wolf's Excessive Quarantine!"" Pennsylvanians Against Excessive Quarantine's ""About"" section reads, referring to Gov. Tom Wolf. ""Politicians are on a power trip, controlling our lives, destroying our businesses, passing laws behind the cover of darkness and forcing us to hand over our freedoms and our livelihood!""

Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantines, a private Facebook group with about 97,000 members, is hosting a rally called ""Operation Gridlock"" in Madison next week. At least 300 people have indicated that they will go to the event, which lists Ben Dorr as its creator.

The websites, such as ReOpenPA.com and ReOpenMN.com, were initially shared by the same network of pro-gun and anti-vaccination sites, regardless of region, according to an analysis using the Facebook analytics tool CrowdTangle, which lets people track the spread of content on the platform.

For example, ReOpenPA.com and ReOpenMN.com were initially shared by the Dorr-affiliated Facebook groups Ohio Gun Owners, Pennsylvania Firearms Association, New York Firearms Association, a pro-Trump group called Ohio First and an anti-vaccine group called VaXism.

Data harvesting

The Dorrs' network of pages uses a strategy of data harvesting common in activist circles.

Their groups drive users to petitions on Dorr-registered websites, which collect users' email and home addresses. The groups repeatedly warn users not to use off-site petition platforms like Change.org.

The websites ask users to enter their information to push for change.

""Want to stop the madness? Want to stop Walz? The direct connect tech in the link below was very costly but we're providing because it was SO EFFECTIVE,"" a post on Minnesotans Against Excessive Quarantine wrote, referring to Gov. Tim Walz. ""Please, if you do nothing else. SEND. THAT. EMAIL.""

The site then collects the user's name and home and email addresses.

Aaron and Ben Dorr — residents of Minnesota and Iowa, respectively — are administrators of New Yorkers Against Excessive Quarantine, which has more than 23,000 members organizing against stay-at-home orders in New York.

Renee DiResta, the research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, said the Dorrs' setups ""ensure that they're in control of the audience and not so much a large infrastructure for feedback to the state.""

This sort of Facebook activity is common, DiResta said, and it allows for a small group with money and media manipulation skills to simulate the appearance of a much larger movement. It also allows the group to harvest email addresses for future political campaigns, which can be bought and sold.

NBC News found no evidence that the Dorrs had made money off the data collected through the groups.

But DiResta said the tactics are often used to capitalize on legitimate political activism.

""In this particular case, there's real momentum from grassroots people who are angry,"" she said. ""Recognizing that people are going to be searching for that, it provides an opportunity for someone who wants to piggyback on that outrage for, in this case, it seems like, outreach for future campaigns.""

The Dorrs

The Dorr brothers are known among mainstream conservative activists for inflammatory campaigns that harvest data.

The brothers are the founders or directors of or advisers to a string of nonprofit organizations across 12 states that have raised millions of dollars and made enemies of local Republicans and Second Amendment activists. The best-funded Dorr operations are Minnesota Gun Rights, Ohio Gun Owners and Iowa Gun Owners, according to tax filings. They founded a national organization in 2019, American Firearms Coalition, which attacks the NRA as being too soft on gun rights issues.

A 2019 investigation by Fox affiliate KMSP-TV of Minneapolis-St. Paul found that Minnesota Gun Rights continued to raise money through memberships, boasting hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual donations, although the IRS had revoked the group's tax-exempt status in 2016 for failing to file Form 990s. The IRS reinstated its tax-exempt status in 2019. According to tax documents, the group raised $273,000 in 2018, the most recent year for which it filed.

In February, Minnesota's Senate Republican Caucus launched a website warning voters against the Dorr-backed ""scams.""

""Over the last few years, several scammers have popped up in conservative politics in Minnesota,"" the website reads. ""On their face, it looks like they are doing the Lord's work — advocating for Second Amendment rights, pro-life views, election integrity and even supporting President Trump. But a little investigation reveals they are actually just building their own brand and raising money by cashing in on unsuspecting Minnesotans sympathetic to their message.""

According to the state Republicans, the Dorrs create pro-gun, anti-abortion rights and pro-Trump Facebook groups as part of a fundraising scheme but offer nothing in return.

Another Dorr-operated Facebook page and organization, Minnesota Right to Life, was called out by Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, the state's largest anti-abortion rights organization, which said it made false allegations against conservative legislators and raised money for an unpassable bill that it claimed would immediately end abortion.

""The Dorr brothers are established scam artists,"" according to an article on Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life's website. ""Nothing they say can be believed, and giving them your money will not advance the pro-life cause in any way.""",0
17,https://www.breitbart.com/news/judge-rules-against-us-womens-soccer-team-in-equal-pay-case-2/,"Los Angeles (AFP) – A federal judge dismissed the United States women’s soccer team’s bid for equal pay on Friday, rejecting claims the players had been underpaid in a crushing defeat for the reigning world champions.

In a 32-page ruling, Judge Gary Klausner of the US District Court for Central California in Los Angeles tossed the women’s claim of pay discrimination, ruling in favour of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF).

Klausner did allow the women’s case for unfair treatment in areas such as travel, housing and medical support to proceed to trial, set for June 16 in Los Angeles.

But the judge said the equal pay claims — the central plank of the case — had been dismissed because there was evidence the women had previously turned down an offer in the Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiations to be paid along the lines of the US men’s team.

“The history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players,” Klausner wrote.

“Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA (collective bargaining agreement) worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT’s pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure,” he said.

‘Shocked and disappointed’

The US women were left stunned by their defeat on the pay issue. The women had been seeking back pay of $66 million under the Equal Pay Act.

Prominent US women’s team star Megan Rapinoe said after learning of the court’s decision that the battle is not over.

“We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY,” she wrote on Twitter.

A spokeswoman for the players reacted with dismay following Friday’s ruling.

“We are shocked and disappointed with today’s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay,” spokeswoman Molly Levinson said.

“We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.

“We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them.”

USSF said Friday night it would continue to work with the women’s program to grow the game in the United States.

“We look forward to working with the Women’s National Team to chart a positive path forward and to grow the game both here at home and around the world,” it said.

“We are committed to continuing that work to ensure our Women’s National Team remains the best in the world.”

The increasingly acrimonious lawsuit had taken a dramatic turn in March, when a filing by lawyers for the federation argued that US men’s team players required a “higher level of skill based on speed and strength” than the women.

The filing triggered outrage amongst the women’s players while influential sponsors such as Coca-Cola voiced disgust at the remarks.

USSF President Carlos Cordeiro later resigned following the uproar, with Rapinoe accusing the USSF of “blatant sexism” in its legal filings.

The US women, who clinched back-to-back World Cup wins with victory at last year’s finals in France, had based their claim for back pay in the disparities between prize money distributed by FIFA at the men’s and women’s World Cups.

Germany’s men won $35 million for their victory in the 2014 World Cup while France earned $38 million after triumphing in Russia in 2018.

The United States women, victors in the 2015 and 2019 World Cups, earned total prize money of $6 million over the two tournaments.

The USSF argued in court that between the years 2015-2019, the women actually were paid more money than the men on both a cumulative and an average per game basis.

During that period the women’s national team received $24 million and an average of $220,747 per game while the men’s team received payments of $18 million and $212,639 per game.

Under the current CBA, which was signed in 2017, more than half the women’s team players receive an annual base salary of $167,000.",2
18,https://www.alternet.org/2020/02/judge-reverses-profoundly-disturbing-convictions-of-border-humanitarians/,"A federal judge in Tucson, Arizona delivered a blow Monday to the Trump administration's strategy of criminalizing humanitarian aid work along the southern border with her decision to overturn the convictions of four volunteers on religious freedom grounds.

U.S. District Judge Rosemary Márquez concluded in a 22-page opinion (pdf) that Natalie Hoffman, Oona Holcomb, Madeline Huse, and Zaachila Orozco-McCormick—volunteers with the religious aid group No More Deaths/No Más Muertes—had ""met their burden of establishing that their activities were exercises of their sincere religious beliefs"" under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).

In a bench trial last year, U.S. District Judge Bernardo Velasco found all four volunteers guilty of federal misdemeanors for entering the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge without a permit, driving on a restricted-access road, and leaving food and water for migrants. Velasco fined the volunteers $250 each and sentenced them to 15 months of unsupervised probation.

The refuge, located in the Sonoran Desert along the southern border, serves as a common—yet dangerous—route for migrants to cross into the United States. Márquez's opinion noted that the remains of more than 2,800 migrants were found in Pima County between 2000 and 2017, and the actual number of deaths in the area—often tied to dehydration and exposure to the extreme conditions—is believed to be much higher. In an effort to prevent more deaths, humanitarian aid volunteers leave supplies in the desert for those passing through.

Although the four volunteers in Monday's case were not charged with immigration-related offenses, the federal government asserted that it has a compelling interest in ""enforcing the border and controlling immigration,"" and claimed that the volunteers' actions ""furthered and encouraged illegal smuggling activity"" in the refuge. Addressing that issue, Márquez wrote:

The government seems to rely on a deterrence theory, reasoning that preventing clean water and food from being placed on the refuge would increase the risk of death or extreme illness for those seeking to cross unlawfully, which in turn would discourage or deter people from attempting to enter without authorization. In other words, the government claims a compelling interest in preventing defendants from interfering with a border enforcement strategy of deterrence by death. This gruesome logic is profoundly disturbing. It is also speculative and unsupported by evidence. As discussed above, 32 sets of human remains were recovered from the refuge in 2017 alone, and the government produced no evidence that these fatalities had any effect in deterring unlawful entry. Nor has the government produced evidence that increasing the death toll would have such an effect.

Thus, the judge concluded, ""the government failed to demonstrate that it furthered any compelling interest by prosecuting defendants.""

In a statement Tuesday, No More Deaths volunteer Alicia Dinsmore said that ""this ruling reaffirms what No More Deaths has always maintained: providing life-saving humanitarian aid is never a crime.""

""The reversal of the convictions is a victory for all people of conscience and righteousness who seek to end the death and suffering in the borderlands,"" Dinsmore added. ""People continue to die every day on Cabeza Prieta and we will continue to act on our moral imperative to do this vital work.""

The ruling also was welcomed Monday by professor Katherine Franke, faculty director of the Law, Rights, and Religion Project at Columbia Law School. Franke, who had filed a friend of the court brief in the case on behalf of seven religious liberty law scholars, said in a statement that ""we are quite pleased to see that Judge Márquez applied an analysis of the RFRA claim that mirrored the structure we provided in our brief.""

""Judge Márquez's opinion marks a significant defeat for the Department of Justice in its effort to protect religious liberty rights only when they advance the White House's political agenda,"" Franke noted. ""This is now the second time in several months that a federal judge has granted a faith-based defense raised by immigrants' rights activists who are being criminally prosecuted by the federal government for coming to the aid of people crossing the deadly Arizona desert.""

As the statement explained, in November 2019, U.S. District Judge Raner Collins granted the RFRA defense raised by No More Death's volunteer Scott Warren related to misdemeanor charges that arose from his humanitarian work. Last year, Warren also faced felony charges and up to 20 years in prison for providing food, water, clean clothes, and shelter to two men traveling through the Sonoran Desert.

Warren was acquitted of the felony charges at his second trial in November, just months after his first trial for those charges ended with a hung jury. The case garnered global attention, with human rights advocates worldwide demanding that federal prosecutors drop the charges and stop ""criminalizing compassion.""

Ryan Devereaux reported for The Intercept Tuesday that ""all told, Trump administration prosecutors, working alongside the U.S. Border Patrol and Fish and Wildlife officials, have brought charges against nine No More Deaths volunteers in the past two and a half years.""

Franke told Devereaux that although she expects the government to appeal Márquez's decision, the judge thoroughly and carefully analyzed the religious liberty claim.

""The government isn't going to roll over just because they lose a case or two,"" she said. ""But what we've got now is a developing record of careful analysis from federal courts on how RFRA ought to apply in contexts like this.""

U.S. District Judge Peter J. Messitte, of Maryland, ordered the preliminary injunction on the Trump administration’s executive order, which requires state and local governments to affirmatively consent to the receiving of refugees.

The decision comes less than a week after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said his state would not accept new refugees, making it the first in the nation to do so.

Messitte wrote in a 31-page decision that if the order were implemented, “many refugees may find themselves at least in limbo, denied services congressionally intended to help them effectively integrate into new homes.”

“Lest there be any doubt, giving State and Local Governments the power to consent to the resettlement of refugees — which is to say veto power to determine whether refugees will be received in their midst — flies in the face of clear Congressional intent,” he wrote.

Messitte wore that the court was persuaded that the plaintiffs in the case would likely be able to demonstrate the order was “arbitrary and capricious” as well as “inherently susceptible to hidden bias.”

The White House blasted the decision in a statement Wednesday as ""preposterous"" and an example of district courts ""run amok.""

""Another lawless district court has asserted its own preferred immigration policy in place of the laws of the United States,"" the statement said ""And, in so doing, robbed millions of American citizens of their voice and their say in a vital issue directly affecting their communities.""

The Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, which filed a challenge to the order in November along with two other refugee resettlement agencies, praised the judge’s decision.

""We're grateful to Judge Messitte for upholding the rule of law and ensuring that the United States remains a place of welcome for the world's most vulnerable,"" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of the refugee service, said in a statement.

""This injunction provides critical relief,"" she said. ""Those who have been waiting for years to reunite with their families and friends will no longer have to choose between their loved ones and the resettlement services that are so critical in their first months as new Americans.""

Last week, Abbott wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that Texas “cannot consent to initial refugee resettlement” for fiscal year 2020.

Since fiscal year 2010, “more refugees have been received in Texas than in any other state,” he wrote.

The Department of Justice declined to comment and the Texas governor's office did not immediately respond to request for comment on the judge's decision.

Governors in 42 other states have said they will consent to allow more refugees, according to the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.

On Monday, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, defended his decision to continue accepting refugees to a legislative committee after he was questioned by fellow GOP lawmakers.

“Each of you are leaders in your community. You've got a choice to make: You can create fear or you can help resolve fear,"" Hutchinson told lawmakers, according to The Associated Press. “I challenge you to help resolve fear, have the facts, and to talk about those.""

Republican state Sen. Trent Garner, who had requested the meeting with the governor, told NBC News on Wednesday he was ""disappointed"" in the judge's decision.

""I am disappointed that a federal judge has taken this decision out of the hands of the citizens of Arkansas,"" he said in an email. ""I appreciate President Trump’s leadership in giving local control back to the people so they could have a voice in this process. I hope that this will be overturned on appeal.""

In September, Trump announced the U.S. would receive only 18,000 refugees in fiscal year 2020, a historic low since the program began in 1980.

The president also ordered that refugees would be resettled in jurisdictions where state and local governments consented to receive them.

“State and local governments are best positioned to know the resources and capacities they may or may not have available to devote to sustainable resettlement, which maximizes the likelihood refugees placed in the area will become self-sufficient and free from long-term dependence on public assistance,” Trump said in the executive order.",0
20,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/thousands-foreign-students-u-s-student-visas-may-have-worked-n1109286?cid=public-rss_20200102,"WASHINGTON — A federal visa program allowing international students to work at firms in the United States after graduation appears to have been exploited by fake companies providing false employment verifications, according to an NBC News/NBC Bay Area investigation.

The F-1 visa program includes a component that allows students to stay in the U.S. to get practical work experience after obtaining their professional degrees. Many students, schools and employers use the program legitimately, as intended. But a recent federal prosecution revealed the potential for fraud, with a defendant admitting in court papers she had provided false employment records for nearly 2,700 students.

'It helps tremendously'

To understand the F-1 student visa program, it's helpful to see how it's supposed to work.

Fawaz Alshatti is a Kuwaiti national who came to the U.S. to study and has stayed to work as an architectural engineer.

""I decided to get some more experience and work in the U.S.,"" he said from his job at TK Architects in Kansas City, Missouri.

The company specializes in entertainment projects. Alshatti helps design systems for movie theaters, bowling alleys, restaurants and bars.

""It provided me with a great opportunity to work with people in this country and to gain such experience in a different work environment,"" he said.

He legally entered the U.S. as an international student after obtaining an F-1 student visa. Once he graduated, he applied to the visa's ""Optional Practical Training"" program, or OPT. It allows international students to work in the U.S. after getting their degrees for a period of 12-36 months.

His employer said the program is invaluable.

""Having international staff is a big benefit for us — both in terms of language (and) culture,"" Jack Muffoletto, who runs TK Architects, said. ""It helps tremendously.""

Alshatti got his undergraduate and two master's degrees from the University of Kansas, where he applied for the OPT program in June 2018, 60 days before the end of his study. Government regulations allow a narrow window for applying: from 90 days before the end of a student's study program to 60 days after.

Alshatti said the university was helpful throughout the application process. It has an office that provides support services to international students, advising them about immigration and study and work visa requirements.

He also said the university's advisers were strict about checking that students followed all the rules and requirements. ""They will contact maybe your employer, behind your back basically, that you don't actually know,"" he said. ""And then they'll make sure that you're actually doing what you're supposed to do. And you're actually doing something within your field, not even something outside your field.""

The university is a big participant in the F-1 OPT program. As of last month, of the 2,040 KU students who have active F-1 visa records, 330 have requested or obtained OPT authorizations.

The University of Kansas is a big participant in the F-1 OPT program, with 330 students having requested or obtained OPT authorizations. The university says the program is extremely important and beneficial to both employers and students. While a few students were found to have submitted spurious employment records, the vast majority used the program as intended. Nightly News

""It's extraordinarily important,"" Charles Bankart, KU's associate vice provost for international affairs, said. ""One of the things that an institution — especially public institutions as a whole — really pride themselves on and focus upon is career readiness. And we do a lot on campus over the course of a student's time here to expose them to experiential learning opportunities.""

Bankart said employers were struck by how OPT students bring a fresh cultural perspective into the workplace.

""It's one thing to train as an engineer or as an architect or a sociologist,"" he said. ""It's another thing to have a deeply informed cultural context there.""

Signs of trouble

While the OPT program draws rave reviews from some employers and universities, a joint investigation by NBC News and KNTV — NBC's Bay Area station — found that some of the companies on the government's list of top OPT employers appear to be illegitimate.

The list of top employers, prepared and released by the Department of Homeland Security's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), includes familiar names: Amazon, Google, Microsoft.

But then, there's one that's not so well-known: ""Findream, LLC.""

In fact, Findream's founder, a woman named Weiyun ""Kelly"" Huang, was charged with criminal fraud in federal court in Illinois.

According to court documents, Findream's alleged purpose was ""false verifications of employment"" for Chinese F-1 visa holders seeking work employment ""via the OPT program.""

An affidavit prepared by an FBI special agent alleges that a website associated with Findream described the OPT opportunity to prospective students as ""pretend' work."" If a document submission is ""well-prepared,"" the website said, ""it will look real"" and the U.S. government ""will think your status is legal.""

The FBI visited the company's listed office in Chicago and found it was bogus. It was ""a company on paper only,"" according to court documents.

At a change of plea hearing Dec. 20, Huang, a Chinese national, changed her plea to guilty on one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud.

Court records show Huang also agreed to plead guilty on behalf of the two entities that were co-defendants in the case, Findream, LLC and Sinocontech, LLC.

Huang admitted she and/or her co-conspirators submitted government forms falsely stating students were employed by the two entities.

The plea agreement states that between 2013 and 2019, ""defendant falsely and fraudulently represented"" that almost 2,700 F-1 visa holders in the U.S. were employed by Findream or Sinocontech, and that Huang and the two firms got about $1.5 million from their customers, creating ""a profit or gain of at least approximately $800,000.""

Huang faces a maximum five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. She is scheduled to be sentenced March 20.

Along with many other schools, the University of Kansas was fooled by Findream. After learning of the federal indictment, the university found seven students who'd reported Findream LLC as an employer.

Charles Bankart, the KU official, said everything seemed legitimate — and that it was ""impossible"" for schools to police this.

""You look at the documentation (and) everything is there,"" he said. ""All the boxes are checked. And the students acted in good faith. This was a registered organization…That's not the student's fault. That's not the institution's fault. That's not the government's fault. That's a crook.""

Part of a pattern?

Over several months, NBC News and KNTV searched for some of the other companies on the list. Several were hard to find. For example: Tellon Trading had incorporation records in the state of Georgia. But NBC News visited five addresses listed in those documents and found no sign of Tellon.

In California, investigative reporter Stephen Stock of KNTV picked up the trail — and couldn't find the company either.

The Student and Exchange Visitor Program recently revamped the methodology it uses to generate data on international students. It provided NBC News a preliminary look at the new data. In 2017, Tellon employed 877 OPT participants, compared to 647 in 2018. In 2017, Findream employed 500 OPT participants, compared to 312 in 2018.

According to government officials, the majority of OPT participants were only employed at Findream for a very short time, listing Findream as an employer for up to 14 days. It's likely, these officials say, that these students never worked for Findream, but may have initially listed it as their employer while they tried to obtain legitimate OPT employment.

Still, supporters of the OPT program argue that the number of students employed by questionable companies is a very small percentage of the total number of students participating in the program.

According to SEVP data, 204,633 students participated in OPT in 2017, and 200,162 did so in 2018.

""There's always people who want to exploit legal immigration,"" Rachel Canty, SEVP director, said.

SEVP, which is part of DHS' National Security Investigations Division, administratively oversees the international student visa programs, including the F-1 visa program and its OPT component. It uses the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) to track and monitor students, schools and employers.

Canty insisted the agency's systems of checks were working and said there were criminal investigations and convictions.

""We do a lot of back-end data analytics once we have the list of companies where people are working. We work with our partners to identify those [where] there may be issues,"" Canty said.

""We have criminal investigations and convictions all the time,"" she added.

In November, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported that an undercover probe had resulted in the arrest of about 250 foreign students. Many had been studying in the U.S. on F-1 visas through a program called ""Curricular Practical Training,"" or CPT. The students had enrolled at the University of Farmington near Detroit, despite knowing it was a fake school without classes or teachers. The students were unaware federal investigators had created the school as part of a sting operation.

Undercover video released by ICE in December shows several students agreeing to pay the University of Farmington to enroll after being told directly that ""it’s not legal.""

Canty also cited DHS' successful detection of three fictitious schools the U.S. Government Accountability Office had created and submitted fraudulent certification petitions for as part of a recent audit of SEVP's management of fraud risks.

But that same audit found other potential fraud risks, including a backlog of reviews of participating schools and no training about potential fraud risks for school officials the program relies on to report potential fraud. In September, ICE issued new guidance.

Officials at SEVP say they welcome scrutiny of potentially illegitimate companies, seeing it as a deterrent.

They note that the number of F-1 visa students participating in the OPT program through both Findream, LLC and Tellon Trading has decreased.

According to its new data: Tellon employed 877 OPT participants in 2017, and 647 OPT participants in 2018. Findream employed 500 OPT participants in 2017, and 312 OPT participants in 2018.

The OPT program is drawing scrutiny on multiple fronts. More than 100 colleges have signed on to an amicus brief opposing a lawsuit that's trying to end the program. The lawsuit was brought by the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers. The labor union claims that the DHS overstepped its authority by creating OPT, which it argues essentially establishes a foreign guest-worker program without congressional approval. The colleges say ending OPT would hurt their ability to attract international students.

But even supporters of international student visa programs say more needs to be done to address their vulnerabilities, not only fraud risks but also potential national security risks.

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, warns that student visa programs pose potential national security risks, and that nations engaging in active foreign espionage to try and steal U.S. intellectual property, such as China, may be exploiting their vulnerabilities.

""We need new tools to be able to figure out who are the individuals that control some of these phony companies, but we also need to make sure that we overall raise our game,"" Warner said. ""I think [in] the Findream case, we need to sort through was this a one-off? Was this part of a pattern? One of the things that we've seen — from the FBI, which they've finally declassified — if you look at all the counterespionage cases that are currently open, over 90 percent of those cases involve China.""

Warner said this type of fraud is increasingly on Congress' radar.

""We need the kind of anti-money-laundering, beneficial ownership legislation to become law so that we can penetrate to who actually owns these companies,"" he said.",0

BURRAGATE, Australia – A firefighter was killed by a falling tree while battling the Australian wildfire crisis overnight, and the prime minister on Sunday said his government was adapting and building resilience to the fire danger posed by climate change.

Bill Slade – one of the few professionals among mainly volunteer brigades battling blazes across southeast Australia – died on Saturday near Omeo in eastern Victoria state, Forest Fire Management Victoria Executive Director Chris Hardman said.

The 60-year-old married father of two was in November commended for 40 years of service with the forestry agency.

“Although we do have enormous experience in identifying hazardous trees, sometimes these tree failures can’t be predicted,” Hardman said. “Working on the fire ground in a forest environment is a dynamic, high-risk environment and it carries with it significant risk.”

The tragedy brings the death toll to at least 27 people in a crisis that has destroyed more than 2,000 homes and scorched an area larger than Indiana since September. Four of the casualties were firefighters.

Authorities are using relatively benign conditions forecast in southeast Australia for a week or more to consolidate containment lines around scores of fires that are likely to burn for weeks without heavy rainfall. The reprieve from severe fire conditions promises to be the longest of the current fire season.

'In the middle of it':Stories of survival as Australia battles deadly bushfires

The crisis has brought accusations that Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s conservative government needs to take more action to counter climate change, which experts say has worsened the blazes. Thousands of protesters rallied late Friday in Sydney and Melbourne, calling for Morrison to be fired and for Australia to take tougher action on global warming.

Morrison said his government was developing a national disaster risk reduction framework within the Department of Home Affairs that will deal with wildfires, cyclones, floods and drought. The government was currently working through the details of the framework with local governments.

“This is a longer-term risk framework model which deals with one of the big issues in response to climate changing and that is the resilience and the adaptation that we need in our community right across the country to deal with longer, hotter, drier seasons that increase the risk of bushfire,” Morrison told Australian Broadcasting Corp.

Morrison said his government accepted that climate change was leading to longer, hotter and drier summers, despite junior government lawmaker George Christensen posting on social media over the weekend that the cause of the latest fires was arson rather than man-made climate change. Another junior lawmaker Craig Kelly has also publicly denied any link between climate change and fire crisis.

State authorities have said a minority of fires are deliberately lit.

“The government’s policy is set by the Cabinet. Our party room has a broad range of views,” Morrison said of those within government ranks who reject mainstream climate science.

While the fire threat is most acute in rural communities, wildfire smoke that has choked some of Australia’s largest cities is a reminder to many urban Australians of the unfolding disaster.

The sails of the iconic Sydney Opera House were illuminated on Saturday night to show support for firefighters and wildfires-affected communities. The display included messages and photographs of firefighters who were fighting wildfires over the past few months.

22,https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/13/need-christian-nationalism-religious-neutrality-failed/,"A gaggle of representatives from theologically liberal denominations recently issued a statement against Christian nationalism in America, claiming that it threatens both American democracy and the ability of our religious communities to live in peace.

To be sure, Christian nationalism is an extremely odd place to find the threat to religious freedom in a world that increasingly makes demands like “shut up and wax that woman’s b-lls.” But the irony goes deeper than that. It’s not some stroke of blind chance that lead to religious freedom in the Christian West—it was, in fact, due to our Christian faith.

To be sure, although I know self-described Christian nationalists, I’m aware of no organized political movement for this statement to oppose and so, no standard definition. Nevertheless, I have never found the label to apply to some of what the statement opposes—calls for theocracy, a conflation of American and Christian identities, and certainly not a “cover for white supremacy,” which the statement tosses in to poison the well. I’ve no interest in contending on behalf of such things.

Nevertheless, until “Christian nationalism” coalesces into something more definitive, in my experience the phrase best describes something much simpler: a rejection of the religious neutrality of the late 20th century in favor of 1) a recognition that Christianity has had a unique and privileged influence on our American heritage that overshadows the influences of other faith traditions, 2) a conviction that a Christian understanding of the world should predominate over other worldviews in American civic life, and 3) an understanding that a nation that successfully excised or sufficiently diluted this influence could no longer be called “American” in the same sense as before. Although more general than what the statement condemns, this understanding would actually encompass many Americans, whether they accept the label or not.

Regardless of its other issues, the statement’s crosshairs certainly fall squarely on this simpler understanding as well. The statements condemns the preference for one religion over another, expresses the irrelevancy of religion for civic standing, and contends for all manner of religious neutrality in American civic life.

But our religious liberty never proceeded from attempts at religious neutrality. It came precisely from the privileged position that Christianity has historically held in America and in the West.

Early States Established Churches with Tax Support

The First Amendment forbids the establishment of a state church in the United States, but it in no way imposes the incoherent burden of religious neutrality on our civic institutions, nor demands that the right to free exercise of religion end when one crosses from private life into the public sphere. We are already experiencing the erosion of religious liberties that these erroneous presumptions have caused, with Christian business owners and officials forced to promulgate ideas they abhor and facilitate celebrations that are incompatible with the teachings of Jesus Christ.

Today, when the American left speaks about religious freedom at all, it speaks in terms of “freedom of worship” rather than of free exercise. But freedom of worship is nothing more than the right to go into a private building and follow one’s preferred liturgy on any day of the week so long as it is out of the public view.

The right of free exercise of religion cannot end there, for no religion on earth ends there. Life is a series of choices in which we each decide what’s most important to us. As we order these priorities, every knee eventually bows to something more important than the rest—the “god” we consider to be the Most Important Thing. Whatever the specific details of one’s god, the very nature of a god is that it is supreme—it lays claim to one’s entire life rather than merely one’s private life.

This is true regardless of whether one follows a traditional religion or even refers to one’s highest value as a “god” at all. Even the hedonist, whose god is personal pleasure, does not leave his worship of pleasure behind when he enters the public sphere. If he refrains from certain pursuits in the public eye, it is only because such restraint will net him more pleasure in the long run. Pleasure therefore remains the god that dictates his public activities.

So it is also with the Christian, the Muslim, the secular humanist, and the utilitarian. So when the follower of a god enters into civic life—as anything from a simple voter all the way up to president—he does not and cannot cease following that god. He will instead look to what that god demands of someone who holds the positions he occupies.

Different gods make different demands. One of the reasons theological liberals are so blind on this issue is their ignorant presumption that, at their root, all religions are basically the same—that they all worship the same God, proclaim the same general values and ideals, and merely have different cultural trappings or modes of expression. In such a fantasy, a neutral pluralism is conceivable, but reality is a different matter.

Although there is only one God, there are many gods (i.e., idols) in this world. The extent to which a person will support or even accept things like secular democracy and religious pluralism depends on that person’s god.

Apply This to Today’s Public Life

What then does that mean for American democracy and religious freedom? It means neither can ever be religiously neutral. Some gods demand such things; some gods merely tolerate them; and other gods abhor them. To embrace these things as worthy of our support and protection and prioritize them over other concerns is to favor some gods and therefore some religions above others.

Rather than submitting to a fantasy of religious neutrality, Christian nationalism accepts and adapts to this reality. After all, the Christian faith is the root from which our form of religious freedom grew, and the American nation is the heritage in which it is enfleshed. The positive forms of secularism and religious liberty that had been enjoyed in America grew out of the specifics of Christianity.

Christians, for example, have always held that there is a fundamental distinction between worldly government and the kingdom of heaven. Even the statement acknowledges this. You can see it in the teachings of Jesus—that his kingdom was not of this world, and that we should render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and to God the things that are God’s.

You can see it in St. Augustine, when he wrote of the City of Man and the City of God. You can see it in Martin Luther’s Two Kingdoms theology. You can see it in the Church of Rome’s doctrine of the Two Swords. Different Christian traditions have certainly differed as to how these two realms relate to one another, and some have separated them far more than others. Nevertheless, the distinction has always been there. Civil government can be disentangled from the church precisely because of that Christian distinction.

Every Religion Doesn’t Do Separation of Church and State

But not every religion makes that distinction. Islam, for example, is both a religion and a political ideology. It makes no real distinction between the two. The idea of the Ummah that Muhammad left his followers—a united religious community that transcends tribe and would one day encompass the entire world—has nothing within it to encourage secularism.

Even the simple idea that church and state have distinct authorities and responsibilities is by no means religious neutral.

Political conquest is Muhammad’s legacy because he explicitly commanded it of his devotees, and he established a sharia to which everyone is supposed to submit. According to Muhammad, a pertinent distinction among religions in the world is between Dar al Islam and Dar al Harb (the House of Islam and the House of War).

So in the end, even the simple idea that church and state have distinct authorities and responsibilities is by no means religious neutral. It blatantly gives Christianity a seat of privilege in the way government is organized, and it does so at the expense of some other religions.

The same can be said of American religious freedom. Americans have deliberately refrained from establishing a state church, and we allow extremely broad freedoms for the exercise of religion and the expression of religious ideas. This was a natural outgrowth of Christian ideas, since in Christianity, salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ—a faith that cannot be compelled by force. Accordingly, from the Christian perspective, there is very little point in using the state to enforce religious adherence.

Now, I’m neither claiming that Christians have always respected this reality nor that we’re the only ones who have. But this is precisely where the nationalism comes into the mix.

Western Toleration Comes from Christianity’s Growth

The Western tendency to tolerate different creeds proceeded from the blood and chaos that different Christians inflicted on one another during the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. It took considerable time and effort to accept this understanding and begin teaching our governments to loosen their grip on the religious habits of their citizens. This effort hinged on the experiences of many different groups of Christians who sought out places where they could freely adhere to their creeds.

So our religious freedom is not simply an abstract ideal floating in the ether, but a heritage—a specifically Christian one. It is precisely English Christians of that sort who learned this very Christian lesson and brought it with them to this land, where they eventually grew into their own Christian nation. It was also those Christians who decided to extend that Christian freedom to the believers on other creeds.

Our religious freedom is not simply an abstract ideal floating in the ether, but a heritage—a specifically Christian one.

Nevertheless, extending that freedom to other faiths never made it religiously neutral. On the contrary, we embedded our religious understanding of such freedom into the way we governed—blatantly privileging Christianity over other religions.

After all, in most other religions, goodness—however it may be conceived—proceeds from a person’s works as much or more than from his faith. State requirements to make the right sacrifices, participate in the right ceremonies, or live in the proper manner make a great deal more sense in other religions. Likewise, religions that demand the infidels be slaughtered wherever they may be found tend to be far less willing to allow those infidels the same kind of freedoms.

So even when America decides to allow the free exercise of all religions, that very decision privileges religions like Christianity, which are more focused on faith than on following specific laws. This can be seen in the way that free exercise has been judged through our history. In a post-9/11 world, it’s become abundantly clear that even flying planes into buildings can be an exercise of religion.

Where Religious Neutrality Ends

Nevertheless, though we put no prohibition on free exercise per se, we always drew the line at publicly immoral behaviors even when those behaviors are also religious duties for some. Certain faiths, for example, have explicitly allowed or encouraged bigamy, but for most of our history, this was never seriously considered an allowable matter of free exercise.

Not every religion sees the matter the same way. Not every religion even has a natural law tradition.

In decisions like that, the state was not and cannot be morally neutral, any more than it was or can be religiously neutral. In every decision, it weighs one set of goods against another and decides which is of more value.

In America, the weight of those past decisions have always been rooted in the values of the Christians who founded and cultivated this nation. Their substance is indelibly colored by Christianity. Our Declaration of Independence hinges the entire matter of independence on the “Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God” and ascribes our rights to endowment by the Creator.

These are by no means religiously neutral statements. They are not sectarian, grounded as they are in the language of natural law, but they are nevertheless grounded in a Christian understanding of that natural law. Not every religion sees the matter the same way. Not every religion even has a natural law tradition.

Common Objections Don’t Hold Water

Some would object to this line of thought, claiming that our nation really founded as much by deists rather than Christians. There were certainly a few prominent ones in the mix, but it doesn’t weaken my case in the slightest.

No nation is beholden to religious neutrality, no matter what freedoms it grants.

Deism itself was always an attempt to possess a Christian heritage without possessing a Christian faith. What’s more, the reason deism went defunct so quickly is that this attempt was almost immediately found to be a fool’s errand. The only remaining progeny of deism are those who returned to Christianity and those who proceeded down the road to atheism. Inasmuch as deists contributed to the founding of this nation, they were still operating under the inertia of the Christian heritage they had received.

Others would claim that our religious liberty is no longer Christian because many non-Christian nations have also provided measures of religious freedom. This is true, and I’m quite pleased that they’ve culturally appropriated religious liberty from the Christian West. I believe my heritage to be of value, so I think it’s great when others learn from it.

But that appropriation does not change where our own liberty came from. Neither does it change the fact that these other nations have modified religious liberty according to their own religious understandings. Israel, for example, allows for a great deal of religious liberty, but it is no more religiously neutral than America is. After all, simply believing that Jesus Christ is the messiah voids the right of return granted by Israel to other ethnic Jews. No nation is beholden to religious neutrality, no matter what freedoms it grants.

The Habit of Toleration Can Go Too Far

To be sure, our more recent history has seen a remarkable shift away from our Christian heritage and its moral wisdom. Under the guise of religious neutrality, too many Christians have been tricked into withholding their good judgment from matters of state. This has led to some profound changes, but there’s nothing religiously or morally neutral about them.

We have, for instance, allowed women to choose whether to murder their offspring, but this is not neutrality—in this, the state blatantly values personal autonomy and privacy more than it values love or the right to live. We have forced people to speak as though men are actually women or act as though two women can be married to one-another, but this is not neutral—it demands that Christians set aside their understanding of marriage and sex. Even something as simple as getting rid of blasphemy laws that respected the name of Jesus Christ was never “fair” or neutral—it only cleared the way for new blasphemy laws that respect sexual deviancy and other politically correct subjects du jour instead.

Christian nationalism is rising precisely because more and more Christians are realizing that we’ve been lied to on the matter. We were persuaded to set aside our heritage in public based on a faulty notion of neutrality and the expectation that everyone else would do the same. But everyone else has done no such thing, and we should never have expected or asked them to. We allowed our religious values to be replaced by others’ religious values and, unsurprisingly, have little to show for our foolishness.

If you Think Christianity Is Valuable, You’re a Nationalist

Christian nationalism is not an attempt to requisition the state to teach Christian theology—it would be even less competent at this than it is at all other types of education. Neither is it in any way an incitement to the largely hypothetical violence over which the statement’s authors wring their hands.

It is simply American Christians who believe that their religion is true and their nation valuable contending for their own convictions about goodness, truth, and beauty rather than for others’. We are not “merging” our two identities, as the statement alleges, but holding onto both of them in everything that we do.

Far from destroying American democracy and religious liberty, Christian nationalism embodies the very same spirit that built that heritage of ours in the first place.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 109,000 more women in the workforce than men.

However, a Gallup poll reports that women are still more likely to do laundry, clean the house, do grocery shopping, prepare meals, wash dishes and make decisions about furniture and decorations – even among younger generations who are reportedly more egalitarian as ever.

Although this may come as a shock to progressive-thinking millennials, experts aren’t surprised. According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report, current trends indicate that it’ll take at least 208 years for the U.S. to achieve true gender equality.

So why is it taking so long?

Stemming from childhood

Harry Reis, professor of psychology at the University of Rochester, said that gender roles change “very, very” slowly and are most likely a product of an individual’s upbringing as a child.

“It’s more convenient and comfortable for people to follow the gender roles that they’ve grown up with,” he said. “If you look at the studies, girls are asked to help out with activities than boys are.”

And he’s right. According to a 2017 analysis, girls who are 15 to 19 years old spend about 45 minutes doing household chores every day while boys in the same age group spend about 30 minutes.

Reis said that individuals are raised and socialized to do roles in a gender specific way. Even though parents nowadays are trying to teach their children more gender-neutral roles, he said it’s still a struggle for people.

Data shows that even better-educated parents aren’t more likely to ensure that their sons have the skills to care for their home, according to an analysis of the American Time Use Survey by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The second half of the Gender Revolution

Christin Munsch, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut, says that most millennial men say they’re for gender equality, but that it takes more than that to close the gender gap.

“On some level they believe that they want to be these good feminist men that share housework and responsibilities,” she said. “But I think when all that is said and done and it comes to practice on the day to day basis, there’s a reason why it’s not implemented.”

More and more men are in favor of women occupying male-dominated spaces, but are reluctant to enter spaces that have been historically designated as female.

One reason for that is because our society still values masculinity, Munsch speculates. She said that research has shown that male-designated jobs, such as business and engineering, pay more than most female-designated jobs.

Even men and women in the same profession get paid differently. According to Salary.com, a janitor can make up to $41,000 per year whereas a maid can make up to $35,000 per year.

Munsch speculates that another reason why men don’t contribute equally to household duties is because they’re not as motivated as women. A study conducted by the University of California and published in the peer-reviewed Sage Journals suggested that women are judged more harshly by society for a cluttered home than men.

“Women’s reputation takes a ding when things aren’t done,” Munsch said. “[Men] haven’t been doing it and no one is holding them accountable.”

Successful relationships

Sharing household chores is not just another step to eradicating gender inequality, it’s also a way to ensure a healthy relationship.

According to Munsch, relationships where men and women have a lot of inequality in terms of housework and income are less stable.

“We’re always assessing how equal the relationship is,” she said. “It’s uncomfortable when you’re over-benefiting or under-benefiting.”

Is tipping on the way out?:Here's why more travelers are joining the 'do not tip' movement

People feel frustrated when they feel their partners aren’t contributing enough to the relationship. On the flipside, their partners get equally frustrated when they feel like they’re not needed.

Munsch said distribution of duties varies by couple. There are definitely successful and happy relationships where men work full-time and women stay at home.

But most people want some sort of equality in their relationships and the only way to ensure that is if both people want to take on 100 percent of the work.

“Instead of counting, we’re both not keeping score at all but we’re trying to take as much off each other’s plates as possible,” she said.

The problem? Jeff Bezos is worth over $110 billion. Amazon is not just insanely profitable (thanks in part to worker conditions and business practices that are doing to the American workforce what mankind is doing to its namesake rain forest), but economy-bendingly, history-changingly successful.

The amount of $690,000, or One Million Australian Dollars, is the equivalent of Jeff Bezos sneezing pocket change out his nose and using Australia's sleeve to wipe it up. It is the Amazon equivalent of sending a Hallmark card. By all means, charity is good and Amazon and other mega-corporations contributing anything to anyone is also good, but if the message was big corporations will take care of this it came off a bit more as big corporations will do the bare minimum required to get a momentary publicity hit.

By way of context, what Amazon, King of All Retailers, is spending to combat Australian fires is roughly on par with the money raised by a single California woman trading nudes for fire donations.

It is also on par with the $516,000 donation toward fighting Australian wildfires pledged by Metallica and a $1 million donation by Elton John.

Amazon may be attempting to make a public statement, but its CEO famously spent $250 million buying his own newspaper. So $690,000 won't buy you a boat that most of the world’s billionaires would be caught dead on. Hell, $690,000 won't even buy you a Silicon Valley house.

People can't help but draw conclusions. A good one to draw might be ""The charity of the top 0.1 percent and of corporations both are vastly overstated and not even fractionally as useful as simply taxing them at the same effective rate as the rest of us pay, so maybe we should get on with that already.""

I know, I know: That's why Michael Bloomberg is now in the race, because far, far too many people were piping up with notions like that. What were we thinking.",0
25,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/06/24/soros-linked-group-of-wealthy-individuals-pen-letter-begging-for-a-moderate-wealth-tax/,"A group of 20 wealthy individuals – including left-wing financier George Soros – signed a letter Monday, begging for a wealth tax and arguing that the U.S has a “moral, ethical, and economic responsibility” to tax wealthy individuals more.

Although the letter is framed as a nonpartisan plea, it is linked to Soros and speaks highly of proposals put forth by Democrat candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

The signers call for “a moderate wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest one-tenth of the richest 1 percent of Americans — on us.”

The signers argue that the “moderate wealth tax” could help solve a plethora of issues. It could, they say, “address the climate crisis, improve the economy, improve health outcomes, fairly create opportunity, and strengthen our democratic freedoms.”



In addition to better rules on carbon pollution, more American investment is needed now to tackle climate change. This could both accelerate innovation and speed implementation of solutions that create a clean energy economy and a low-carbon future. A wealth tax asks those of us who have benefitted most from our economic system to help fix one of its most devastating and fatal flaws.

The letter also characterizes the proposed tax as “patriotic.”

In our republic, it is the patriotic duty of all Americans to contribute what they can to the success of the country, and the wealthiest are no exception. Others have put far more on the line for America. Those of us in the richest 1/10 of the richest 1% should be proudto payabit more of our fortune forward to America’s future. We’ll be fine—taking onthis tax is the least we can do to strengthen the country we love.

The letter is signed by Soros, as well as Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and others including: Louise J. Bowditch, Robert S. Bowditch, Abigail Disney, Sean Eldridge, Stephen R. English, Agnes Gund, Catherine Gund, Nick Hanauer, Arnold Hiatt, Molly Munger, Regan Pritzker, Justin Rosenstein, Stephen M.Silberstein, Ian T. Simmons, Liesel Pritzker Simmons, and Alexander Soros.

“We thought it would be a good idea,” Blue Haven Initiative co-founder Ian Simmons said, according to the New York Times. “Liesel and I decided to reach out to some other folks to see if they thought it was a good idea, too.”

While signers claim the letter “does not represent an endorsement of any presidential candidate,” it specifically references Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Pete Buttigieg (D), and Beto O’Rourke, seemingly pushing for and endorsing their various versions of a wealth tax.

The letter states:

Several candidates for President, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, MayorPete Buttigieg, and Representative Beto O’Rourke, are already supportive of the idea. The first specific candidate proposal, introduced by Senator Warren, would provide millions of families with a better shot at the American dream by taxing only 75,000 of the wealthiest families in the country.” The proposal is straightforward: It puts in place a tax of 2 cents on the dollar on assets after a $50 million exemption and an additional tax of 1 cent on the dollar on assets over $1 billion. If you have $49.9 million or less you are not paying the tax. It is estimated to generate nearly $3 trillion in tax revenue over ten years.”

There is currently no law barring wealthy individuals from voluntarily paying more in taxes.",2
26,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-denounce-democratic-move-to-tighten-gun-laws,"A group of House Republicans gathered Tuesday on Capitol Hill to express their anger over two bills proposed by their Democratic colleagues that, if passed, would drastically tighten federal gun laws.

The Republican lawmakers, who were joined by a group of Second Amendment supporters, lambasted the two bills – HR 8 and HR 1112 – as “ineffective” and far overreaching measures that would ultimately lead to guns being confiscated from lawful owners.

“This bill turns law abiding citizens into criminals and it’s one more step towards federalized gun registration and ultimately gun confiscation,” Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Ga., the House Minority Whip, said. “That’s been the intention of many of the people bringing this bill for a long time. They want true gun control and this is the first step and surely not the last.”

ILLINOIS DEMS INTRODUCE BILL REQUIRING GUN BUYERS TO REVEAL SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS BEFORE GETTING FIREARM LICENSE

Scalise became a victim of gun violence when he was severely wounded by a gunman who opened fire while lawmakers were practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity in June 2017.

HR 8, which was approved by the House Judiciary Committee earlier this month in a 23-15 vote along party lines, would expand the scope of federal background checks and require nearly all purchasers of firearms to undergo a background check – even if they were bought it at a gun show, online or in a private transaction. HR 1112, which passed the committee 21-14, would require gun dealers to wait 10 days to receive answers about a background check.

The bills were introduced a day before the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

“Although we know the issue of gun violence won’t be fixed overnight, there are steps Congress can and must take to address it,” Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. “Closing loopholes in the current background check system are long-overdue legislative measures that will help address this national crisis.”

While a handful of House Republicans have signed up in support of HR 8 – including Rep. Peter King of New York – the vast majority of GOP lawmakers opposed the legislation.

“Frankly HR-8 is taking the fears and concerns of a nation over gun violence and perpetrating a fraud upon them,” Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., said on Tuesday. “They are preying upon the very victims they are supposedly trying to help by putting a bill out there that will not help them. By constantly bringing up the mass violence instances such as schools and theaters and others. They are saying this will help.The reality is nothing in this bill would have stopped Parkland and nothing in this bill would have stopped the violence we have seen.”

The bills are part of the Democrats' efforts since retaking control of the House to move quickly to combat gun violence and they appear set to pass through the lower house of Congress. The legislation, however, is likely to meet a quick end once it lands in the Republican-controlled Senate.

For months after Washington state imposed one of the earliest and strictest COVID-19 lockdowns in March, Jim Gilliard didn't stray far from his modular home near Waitts Lake, 45 miles north of Spokane.

The retiree was at high risk from the coronavirus, both because of his age, 70, and his medical condition. Several years ago, he had a defibrillator implanted. So he mainly ventured out during the pandemic to shop for food.

There wasn't much else to do anyway. Gatherings in his county were limited to no more than 10 people, there was a mask mandate, movie theaters were closed and many nightclubs and concert venues were shuttered because of a state ban on all live entertainment, indoors and out.

An hour away in Idaho, life was more normal. The state left key COVID-19 regulations up to localities, many of which made masks optional. Even in places that required face coverings, enforcement was laxer than in Washington. High school sports, canceled for the fall in Washington, were on full display in Idaho. Most Idaho schools welcomed back students in person, in contrast to the remote learning prevailing in Washington. Businesses reopened earlier and with fewer restrictions. There were concerts and dances.

Weary of Washington's restrictions, thousands of residents made the easy drive over the border to vacation, shop and dine in Idaho. Gilliard resisted temptation until he learned that the annual Panhandle Bluesfest would go on as scheduled near Priest River, Idaho, on Sept. 12. A keyboardist who used to own a blues club just outside Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, Gilliard was buoyed after months of relative isolation by the prospect of hanging out with friends while listening to music on a remote mountainside surrounded by soaring pine trees and thick hemlocks. He decided to go.

A friend took a picture of Gilliard at the festival. Wearing a bandanna fashioned as a headband, a cut-off T-shirt and dark glasses, he was perched on a tree stump and pointing back at the camera. As was permitted by local regulations at the time, he was not wearing a mask, nor were about 10 people sitting together in the background.

As the number of COVID-19 cases skyrockets nationwide, the extent of the public health response varies from one state — and sometimes one town — to the next. The incongruous approaches and the lack of national standards have created confusion, conflict and a muddled public health message, likely hampering efforts to stop the spread of the virus. The country's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said last month that the country needs “a uniform approach"" to fighting the virus instead of a “disjointed"" one.

Nowhere are these regulatory disparities more counterproductive and jarring than in the border areas between restrictive and permissive states; for example, between Washington and Idaho, Minnesota and South Dakota, and Illinois and Iowa. In each pairing, one state has imposed tough and sometimes unpopular restrictions on behavior, only to be confounded by a neighbor's leniency. Like factories whose emissions boost asthma rates for miles around, a state's lax public health policies can wreak damage beyond its borders.

“In some ways, the whole country is essentially living with the strategy of the least effective states because states interconnect and one state not doing a good job will continue to spread the virus to other states,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. “States can't wall themselves off.""

A motorcycle rally in August in Sturgis, South Dakota, with half a million attendees from around the country spread COVID-19 to neighboring Minnesota and beyond, according to Melanie Firestone, an epidemic intelligence service officer for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who co-authored a report on the event's impact.

South Dakota “didn't have policies regarding mask use or event size, and we see that there was an impact in a state that did have such policies,"" Firestone said. “The findings from this outbreak support having consistent approaches across states. We are all in it together when it comes to stopping the spread of COVID-19.""

Viruses don't respect geographic boundaries. While some states require visitors, especially from high-risk areas, to be tested or quarantined, others like South Dakota have no such restrictions. Many people who are tired of strict COVID-19 measures in their states have escaped to areas where everyday life more closely resembles pre-pandemic times. There, with fewer protections, they're at risk of contracting the virus and bringing it back home.

After the Idaho concert, Gilliard started feeling ill and was diagnosed with the coronavirus. For about a week, he stayed in bed. As his condition worsened, he was admitted to a Spokane hospital and placed on a ventilator. He died on Oct. 15. His death certificate lists COVID-19 as the underlying cause.

Going to the Idaho festival likely killed Gilliard, his ex-wife, Robin Ball, said.

“If he had been wearing a mask, not shaking hands and keeping distance, he could probably be alive,"" she said. “He had been careful before that. He shouldn't have been up there.""

The degree of coronavirus regulation tends to track political lines. President-elect Joe Biden carried blue Washington state with 58% of the vote, while President Donald Trump easily won red Idaho with 64%. Trump has helped to fuel the patchwork response to the pandemic, criticizing the approaches of some states, praising others and at times contradicting the advice of his own coronavirus task force and Fauci.

“What really struck me [is] how hard it is to take the pandemic strategy as laid out by the White House with every state on its own and ... implement it because every state is not on its own, they are all interconnected,"" Jha said.

Biden has said he wants to implement national standards, such as required mask wearing, to help blunt the spread of COVID-19 while acknowledging the federal government lacks little power to do so. He hopes to work with governors and local officials to establish consistent standards across the country.

A lack of such consistency is affecting eastern Washington, which appears to be absorbing some of the costs — both human and economic — of Idaho's more laissez-faire approach to the virus. The rate of new cases in and around Spokane, near the Idaho border, is far higher than in Seattle and western Washington, which experienced one of the earliest outbreaks in the country in February. Although slightly more than half of recent COVID-19 cases in Spokane spread among households or personal contacts, Spokane Regional Health District epidemiologist Mark Springer said, “people bringing back COVID-19 from larger events in Idaho"" has been a problem. And with Idaho's rate of new cases now doubling Washington's, Idahoans who commute to the Spokane area pose an outsized danger. At the same time, Washington's shuttered businesses have ceded customers to their Idaho competitors.

Public schools in Washington have also suffered. After opening the school year with remote-only instruction, the Newport School District lost about one-fourth of its 1,200 students. Most of them opted either for specialized online-only programs or for nearby private and public schools across the border in Idaho, which offered in-person learning and sometimes didn't require masks or social distancing, said Newport Superintendent Dave Smith. The plunge in enrollment has led to a $1.2 million drop in funding, he said.

In early October, Newport began some in-person learning but had to return to remote instruction after a COVID-19 outbreak in the community. The source was traced to a Christian church and school only a few feet from the Washington border in Oldtown, Idaho.

“It's incredibly frustrating,"" Smith said. “I certainly think aligned standards across the nation would have changed our situation.""

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee recently called on “Idaho leaders to show some leadership"" and be more aggressive in combating COVID-19. He blamed the virus spread in Idaho for straining Washington hospitals. For their part, some in Idaho have complained that the rise of COVID-19 there has more to do with the influx of Washington residents over the summer and fall than with a lighter regulatory touch.

Many of those Washingtonians headed to Coeur d'Alene (pop. 52,400), the seat of Kootenai County and the largest city in northern Idaho. Despite some cancellations, many tourism activities went on as scheduled. The Spokesman-Review newspaper in Spokane ran a feature headlined, “A nearby escape: Coeur d'Alene Resort offers amenities for singles and families."" The resort, the article noted, was offering special packages for families that include a pizza-making experience, scenic cruise tickets and discount theme park tickets. In the resort garage, most of the license plates were from Idaho or Washington.

“Yes, the coronavirus exists,"" the article continued. “However, the luxe Coeur d'Alene Resort is open and taking steps to make an experience as safe as possible."" While employees wore masks, the article said, they were optional for guests and about two-thirds opted not to use them. The resort did not respond to requests for comment.

At a park in downtown Coeur d'Alene, a weekly concert series called Live After 5 attracted crowds all summer. Though attendance was lower than in prior years, it swelled as promoters targeted marketing to tourists, concert organizer Tyler Davis said. At one show in July, a member of the band surveyed the large gathering and said, “Look around you guys, it feels kind of normal tonight."" Groups of people danced in front of the stage, food trucks lined up along one side and vendors set up tents. Masks were “encouraged but not required.""

The day after that show, the Panhandle Health District encompassing five Idaho counties ordered a mask mandate in Kootenai. It required masks in indoor and outdoor public places when a social distance of 6 feet could not be maintained.

Springer, the epidemiologist, watched the flow of Spokane County residents to Idaho with concern. “The issue with Idaho is a somewhat significant one for us in that the restrictions are a pretty stark contrast between what is in Idaho and what we have in Washington,"" he said. “Coeur d'Alene is a sister community to us.""

Jim Gilliard was a popular figure in the blues music community around Spokane and northern Idaho. In the 1990s, he operated a music club outside Coeur d'Alene called Mad Daddy's Blues. He was a talented musician himself, playing keyboards in local blues bands, even after losing a finger and badly injuring two others in a table saw accident.

Gilliard was raised in New York City and Pennsylvania. His father, E. Thomas Gilliard, was an acclaimed ornithologist who served as curator of birds at the American Museum of Natural History and was often gone for months at a time on expeditions to New Guinea. After Gilliard met Ball, the two headed to Colorado and enjoyed life as ski bums, moving from resort to resort for a couple of years before eventually settling in Coeur d'Alene, and having a son. After they divorced two decades ago, she stayed in Coeur d'Alene and he ended up in the village of Valley, Washington. (pop. 164).

Gilliard was one of nearly 300 people who paid $25 each to attend the blues festival, which was held 2 miles up a mountain road outside Priest River, Idaho, a tourist town 6 miles from the Washington border.

Bonner County, where the concert was held, is a rural pocket of defiance against government public health mandates related to the coronavirus. When the local library instituted a mask requirement for users, mask-less demonstrators, some clutching small children, protested and tried to enter the library as staff members stood their ground and explained they were only trying to prevent people from getting sick. The county sheriff wrote to the governor criticizing lockdown orders early in the pandemic, alleging that public health officials misled the public and that “COVID-19 is nothing like the plague.""

Concert organizers Billy and Patty Mullaley said they waited until the end of June before deciding to go ahead with it. The only potential roadblock was getting liability insurance at an affordable price during a pandemic, which they were able to do after shopping around.

“At the time, there were not any restrictions"" on events like theirs in Idaho, Patty Mullaley said. “We did not take it lightly, having the event. We really put thought into it."" They bleached outhouses and the area around the concert stage offered plenty of space for social distancing, she said. Among those most grateful they went ahead, she said, were musicians who had been starved for gigs because of coronavirus-related cancellations. Featured acts included Sammy Eubanks, Coyote Kings and Tuck Foster and the Tumbling Dice.

Mullaley said the festival drew Washington residents eager for events banned in their own state. “From my experience, everyone and their dog from Washington was over here,"" she said. “Our COVID is probably from people coming over here from Washington.""

Few of the hundreds of people at the festival wore masks and many didn't stay socially distant, according to attendees. “Part of what made it magical was people were completely free and happy and not fearful at all,"" said Sylvia Soucy, who had COVID-19 earlier in the summer. People danced barefoot on the soft sand and mingled with friends, she said.

Mullaley said people socially distanced “as much as possible."" In the end, she said, “these were all adults"" who made individual decisions. Soucy agreed. “It was completely a choice all of us made,"" she said. The remote setting — no cellphone service, no electricity and surrounded by hundreds of acres of undeveloped forest — added to the temporary joy of escaping from the virus, Soucy said.

Soucy said she talked to Gilliard there and he was in good spirits, “glad that people were not worried about being able to get together there on the mountain."" Gilliard also chatted with other friends, including a former girlfriend, according to Soucy. Ball said the former girlfriend was diagnosed with COVID-19 shortly after the festival and notified Gilliard.

“I don't know why he let his guard down,"" Ball said. “I will never understand that."" In the end, she thinks it had to do with “a long summer of not having a lot of stuff to do. He had been so cautious for those seven or eight months. He just didn't feel like it was going to be a problem.""

The Mullaleys said they were unaware of anyone else from the concert getting COVID-19 around that time. But some Washington residents who tested positive for the coronavirus told contact tracers that they had attended the blues festival, according to Matt Schanz, the administrator of Northeast Tri County Health District, a public health agency in Washington covering counties near the Idaho border.

That doesn't definitively mean that they contracted the virus at the festival, he said. “We have 550 cases within three counties, and if you read the summary reports, a decent number of those have some affiliation with Idaho,"" Schanz said.

South Dakota has largely remained open for business during the pandemic. Gov. Kristi Noem, an ally of Trump's, has refused to impose a mask mandate, saying there are questions about its effectiveness. The state has not placed any restrictions on bars and restaurants and officials allowed the 10-day motorcycle rally in Sturgis. Such a rally would have been prohibited in Minnesota. Both Minnesota and South Dakota are in the top five states when it comes to rates of cases per capita over the last week.

The CDC advises that outdoor events are less risky than indoor ones. The Sturgis rally, which featured events in both settings, is now linked to at least 86 COVID-19 cases in Minnesota, including four people who were hospitalized and one death, according to a CDC report released in November. The report said the total is likely an undercount as some of those infected declined to share their close contacts with health officials.

“These findings highlight the far-reaching effects that gatherings in one area might have on another area,"" the researchers wrote. They added, “This rally not only had a direct impact on the health of attendees, but also led to subsequent SARS-CoV-2 transmission among household, social, and workplace contacts of rally attendees upon their return to Minnesota.""

Mike Kuhle, the mayor of Worthington, Minnesota, said South Dakota's approach to the pandemic “is a source of heartburn for me and sleepless nights."" His city is close to both the South Dakota and Iowa borders. In addition to worries about the virus spreading from South Dakota, Kuhle said, “during the lockdown people have gone to Sioux Falls for shopping. It's ugly for our businesses.""

A similar dynamic has played out in the Quad Cities area at the border of Illinois and Iowa. There, thousands of people cross bridges over the Mississippi River every day to work, visit family and shop in each state.

As cases in Iowa began to surge this summer, Gov. Kim Reynolds dismissed mask mandates as “feel-good"" measures that are difficult to enforce. Until recently, Iowa restaurants and gyms were allowed to operate at full capacity as long as social distancing measures were in place. There was no state-imposed limit on the size of social gatherings. Nicknamed “COVID Kim"" by her critics, Reynolds changed course in mid-November in the face of surging cases and hospitalizations, requiring masks.

Illinois clamped down earlier and harder, instituting a mask mandate at the end of April. Movie theaters opened in Iowa before those in Illinois. Iowa never closed its golf courses when neighboring states like Illinois did.

For Illinois businesses, the gap between the two states' regulations has been crushing, said Paul Rumler, the president of the Quad Cities Chamber.

“A river runs through it but otherwise this is one community,"" he said. On the Illinois side, “we have retailers and restaurants who want to be responsible corporate citizens and follow the guidelines knowing they are at a disadvantage from a business literally 3 miles away.""

Rumler said the chamber advocated for the two states to have a consistent approach to the pandemic to no avail. “If there was a federal standard, it would eliminate the confusion of our region,"" he said. “It would make our life a lot easier.""

Debbie Freiburg, a volunteer contact tracer for the county encompassing the Illinois side of the border, said the looser restrictions in Iowa offered Illinois residents the chance to “take a break"" from the virus.

“It's bad and the differences are huge, unfortunately,"" she said. “I can be in Iowa in 10 minutes, and there were a lot of us going shopping in Iowa.""

Freiburg, who retired to the area after working as a pediatric cancer nurse in Washington, D.C., said cases in her Illinois county have been tracked to Iowa, including several from a large wedding at a hotel just over the border.

Tensions between Washington and Idaho over their divergent responses to the pandemic escalated in October. As the count of COVID-19 cases climbed, the board of the Panhandle Health District in Idaho voted 4-3 to rescind the mask order it had imposed on Kootenai County three months before. Officials in Washington were stunned. Inslee, the governor, refused to rule out restrictions on border traffic.

The move by the health board came amid growing resistance in the state to mandatory public health measures to control the virus and skepticism that COVID-19 was even real.

A group of Idaho politicians, including Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, appeared in a video in October urging the state to limit restrictions. Sitting in a truck with an American flag draped over the side, McGeachin placed a gun over a Bible. “We recognize that all of us by nature are free and equal and have certain inalienable rights,"" she said. A legislator in the video said “the pandemic may or may not be occurring.""

State Rep. Tony Wisniewski, who represents Kootenai and also appeared in the video, urged the health board to make masks optional. He compared the mask mandate to what he said was a requirement in Nazi Germany to tell authorities if a neighbor was Jewish.

Health board member Allen Banks said he was “deeply suspicious"" of tests for COVID-19. In an email to a senator who had criticized the board's mask mandate, he wrote, “I hope you and the legislators who support your effort will continue to stand for truth rather than the fantasy of a phony disease based on a false test.""

Board member Walt Kirby, who had voted in July to approve the mask mandate initially, was the deciding vote. He opposed a mandate because people were “pretty damn nasty"" to him for supporting it before, he explained. “I am not going to vote for it, I am just not because no one is wearing the damn masks anyway,"" Kirby said, adding that he wears a mask. As for people who ignore the advice of public health experts, he said, “I am just sitting back and watching them catch it and die and hopefully I will live through it. You know I am 90 years old already and I am not getting involved in it anymore.""

Even as the requirement was rescinded, cases in Kootenai were soaring. The rate of hospitalizations in the border area in northern Idaho is nearly double the rate in the Spokane region. Overall, the number of new cases in Idaho per capita is almost twice that of Washington.

With the county mandate overturned, the city of Coeur d'Alene considered in late October whether to adopt one on its own. Mayor Steve Widmyer and the City Council were inundated with hundreds of emails and telephone calls, many from mask opponents.

“This is Idaho, not Washington or California,"" wrote one resident. “Let the people decide if they wish to mask up or not."" Another told the city leaders, “If you want to live with a mask 'muzzle' on your face move to California or Washington.""

Ball, Gilliard's ex-wife, urged Widmyer to support a mandate. “People come here so they don't have to wear a mask and fill our bars and businesses while spreading covid,"" she wrote.

In Coeur d'Alene, the mayor only votes to break a tie among the city councilors. Widmyer, who had complained that city officials “shouldn't have been put into this position,"" didn't have to vote, because the council approved the mandate 4-2 on Oct. 26. Protesters outside chanted, “No more masks, we will not comply,"" and the blowback has been swift. A group of residents is pushing to recall the pro-mandate councilors. The mayor did not respond to interview requests.

While Coeur d'Alene adopted a mandate, nearby Post Falls and Hayden rejected similar proposals. All three cities are less than 20 miles from the Washington border. Idaho Gov. Brad Little has also remained steadfast in opposition to the idea, unlike Iowa's Reynolds. “Idaho's health officials have been mindful of the challenges of mitigating spread of COVID-19 in border communities since the onset of the pandemic,"" a spokeswoman for Little said in an email. The governor's “priority at this time is mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in Idaho and preserving health care capacity for those in need.""

For the Panhandle health board, however, the situation became too dire to ignore. On Nov. 19 it reversed itself again and passed a mask mandate for all five of its counties, including Bonner, the site of the blues festival. But county sheriffs have ignored enforcing the mandate or made it a low priority, according to local media.

The move came too late to save Gilliard. “Until everyone in this country can do the same thing, all states on the same page, limit crowd size and mask mandates that are enforced, this is going to happen,"" said Ball, his ex-wife. “It only makes sense. Because what we have been doing hasn't been working.""",0
28,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/white-nationalists-caught-trying-film-video-front-emmett-till-memorial-n1075776,"A group of people carrying a white nationalist flag were caught on camera Saturday attempting to record a video in front of the Emmett Till memorial in Sumner, Mississippi.

Patrick Weems, executive director of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, told NBC News that the group was captured on camera by a new surveillance system that was updated when the bulletproof memorial was dedicated on Oct. 19.

""This is the first incident we’ve seen of what appears to be white nationalists making a propaganda video,"" Weems said.

One man can be heard in the video identifying the sign as a monument representing the ""civil rights movement for blacks.""

""What we want to know is, where are all of the white people?"" he continued.

In another clip, the group can be seen scrambling for their cars after sirens go off, a newly added security feature.

A clip of the video was posted to the Sumner Courthouse and Emmett Till Interpretive Center Facebook page on Saturday.

Since the incident, the site has been monitored by the Tallahatchie County Sheriff's Office.

The group was carrying a white flag with a black St. Andrews cross, a symbol authorities said were connected to a neo-Confederate group called the League of the South in Alabama, according to Weems.

Southern Poverty Law Center identifies the League of the South as a hate group that has ""increasingly embraced violence, criticized perceived Jewish power and warned black people that they would be defeated in a future race war.""

Emmett Till was 14 years old when he was abducted, tortured and brutally murdered by two white men in 1955 after the teen was accused of whistling at a white woman. Till was visiting family in the area when he was kidnapped and then found dead days later in the Tallahatchie River.

Signs memorializing Till have been vandalized and shot at multiple times since the first marker was put up in 2007, according to the commission. A bulletproof sign, the fourth Till memorial in the area, was dedicated on Oct. 19, to replace a sign that had been ""riddled with 20 bullet holes.""

The memorial commission launched the Emmett Till Memory Project the same day, an app that uses GPS markers at historic sites to tell the story of Emmett Till. The landowner who owned the farm by the river where Till's body was found has donated the land, where the memorial commission hopes to raise funds to create another memorial site.

Weems told NBC News that the organization was proud to work with the community to keep the legacy of Emmett Till alive.

""We want to respond to this hate speech by continuing to do this work.""",0

The woman is currently under the Trump administration's remain in Mexico program, and her attorney says sending her there was an “incredibly egregious” example of the types of cases the U.S. said would be exempt from the policy.

“They’re putting us at risk. We’re at risk of being kidnapped, tortured,” said Elizabeth, who asked that only part of her name be used out of fear of retaliation.

Elizabeth, who went to Juarez, Mexico, in the summer to claim asylum with her 11-year-old daughter after fleeing gender-based violence in Guatemala, said she was tortured and sexually assaulted after arriving there and held for around 18 days in July and August.

“In this line of work you see horrific things, but this is incredibly egregious,” said Nico Palazzo, an attorney with the Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center who is representing Elizabeth.

At a court hearing in the U.S. on Friday morning, she asked immigration officials for a third time to allow her to stay in the United States and receive treatment while her case plays out. Her hearing came on the same day the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to reinstate a block on the policy in a long-anticipated decision that dealt a blow to the Trump administration.

Elizabeth's attorneys are calling on immigration officials to release her from custody and allow her to be in the United States as a result of the ruling.

""We are hopeful but proceeding with caution,"" Palazzo said. ""The implications of this are monumental and clearly illustrate this policy is not only appalling and dehumanizing but clearly unlawful.""

""The mandate of this ruling is clear -— they cannot return her and her daughter,"" he said.

Elizabeth was chemically burned down large portions of legs during the kidnapping and is still at great risk of infection, her lawyer said. But the U.S. has twice turned Elizabeth back to Mexico, once in November and once in January, under the Trump administration policy forcing asylum-seekers to wait there for court cases in the U.S., he said.

About 60,000 migrants have been forced to wait in Mexico under the program, which is formally called the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP.

Customs and Border Protection said in its guiding principles, published in January 2019, that migrants with “known physical/mental health issues” would not be amenable to the program.

On its website, the Department of Homeland Security said unaccompanied children will not be subject to the policy and others “from vulnerable populations” may be excluded “on a case-by-case basis.” Migrants who claim a fear to return to Mexico could be exempt from the policy if they are determined to be “more likely than not” to face persecution or torture in Mexico.

But immigration advocates and attorneys say that standard places an unfair burden on migrants and that some with serious health issues are still being sent back. Elizabeth has been turned back on two occasions, despite showing immigration officials her wounds and detailing her kidnapping, her attorney said.

“She clearly fits the medical exception to MPP based on the severity of her wounds but also based on the fact that she is afraid of returning to Mexico because she's been tortured,” Palazzo said.

According to Elizabeth and her attorney, the harrowing ordeal began after Elizabeth and her daughter got off a bus taking her to Juarez and took what she believed to be an Uber. She believes she was targeted because she is a migrant.

Elizabeth said she was threatened, kidnapped and taken to an unknown location where she was held for around 18 days.

“They told us not to make noise, that they would kill us,” she said.

Her captors sexually assaulted her in front of her daughter and demanded ransom money from relatives, she and her attorney said. When they could not get it, they used a chemical to burn her legs, Elizabeth said.

“I just screamed and screamed and my daughter covered her eyes and ears because of my cries,” she said.

Eventually, the two were able to escape and when Elizabeth was found she was described as being “disoriented and having suffered a heat-stroke,” Palazzo said.

She spent days in a hospital but has not received the full medical treatment she needs and is still at great risk of infection, Palazzo said.

Photos provided by her attorney appear to show massive injuries all along both of her legs. Palazzo provided a letter from a doctor saying he had reviewed her medical records and photographs and said her open wounds are still at risk of infection.

“Like all burn victims, victims of chemical assault need to be treated in a multidisciplinary burn center that has the resources to provide holistic care and recovery across a lifetime to achieve a good outcome,” wrote Dr. Barclay Stewart, an assistant professor at the University of Washington Medicine Regional Burn Center.

""By being denied access to a multidisciplinary burn center or the services aforementioned, she will suffer needlessly and unconscionably,"" he wrote.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to request for comment about the program Friday, but has previously defended it.

In late January, the one-year anniversary of the policy, spokesperson Heather Swift, said in a statement to NBC News that the U.S. and Mexican governments “100 percent support MPP, which is firmly authorized by bipartisan Congressional statute and has allowed the U.S. to provide the opportunity for due process to more than 57,000 migrants.”

“DHS is always looking at ways to expand and strengthen the program to include new locations, populations, and procedures in order to further enhance protections for migrants and ensure safe and lawful migration, while deterring smugglers and traffickers,” she said. “We continually work with Mexico and have provided more than $17 million in aid for safety and security measures. MPP is one of the most important and effective tools we have implemented to confront the crisis on the border and we will continue to strengthen and expand.”

On Friday, Palazzo and Elizabeth are called on the government to allow her and her daughter to stay in the United States and receive the treatment she needs.

“The reason we are putting so much emphasis at this point is this is the third time now that she's coming into the country and she just cannot afford to be returned back,” he said.",0
30,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/new-york-city-good-legal-case-mandating-vaccines/,"Five anonymous parents recently filed a lawsuit in Brooklyn Supreme Court against the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and its commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot. At issue is an emergency order making measles vaccinations mandatory, which opponents claim violates their religious beliefs.

Clearly, this is a highly sensitive issue, especially since the Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn has been hit quite hard by this latest measles outbreak. Across New York City, just shy of 300 cases have been reported, many of those in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. However, based on prior case law, the Brooklyn Supreme Court has compelling reason should it rule against the parents in this case.

In essence, the suit touches on the difficult question of when personal religious beliefs are outweighed by public safety concerns. According to the New York Post:

Mayor de Blasio on Tuesday declared a public health emergency over an outbreak of measles in Williamsburg and ordered mandatory vaccinations in the Brooklyn neighborhood under the threat of $1,000 fines — and even the possibility of forcible injections. The unprecedented move, which covers more than 212,000 people living in an area covered by four ZIP codes, followed the diagnoses of 285 cases of measles in the city — mostly in Williamsburg — since October. Under the order signed by Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot, everyone who lives, works or attends school within the 11205, 11206, 11211 and 11249 ZIP codes and isn’t already immune to measles must be vaccinated within 48 hours. Parents are responsible for getting their children vaccinated, and the only exception is for people who can prove they ‘should be medically exempt.’ Health Department inspectors will also visit Jewish religious schools to make sure that yeshiva students who haven’t been vaccinated ‘are being appropriately excluded [from school] under this order,’ Deputy Mayor of Health and Human Services Herminia Palacio said.

According to the Post, opponents to this order allege that the measles outbreak isn’t serious enough for the quick 48-hour vaccination requirement, since no deaths have been reported in the outbreak. They also allege that they are being forced to vaccinate for rubella and mumps, which they claim is risky, and that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine carries risks for children under 12 months of age and young women who may become pregnant.

The lawsuit claims that “the respondents’ emergency orders unnecessarily override the petitioners’ and their children’s religious practices and the children’s lawful exemptions from vaccination to attend school, which they have obtained in full compliance with Public Health.”

This is a very difficult issue, as it pits the right to individual autonomy, informed consent, and the free exercise of religion against the city’s need to protect the public. However, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s order appears to be somewhat well-supported from a legal perspective.

In Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905), the United States Supreme Court considered the issue of mandatory vaccinations with regard to a smallpox outbreak. In discussing the Jacobson case, the AMA Journal of Ethics explained:

There the Court ruled that the police power of a state absolutely included reasonable regulations established by legislature to protect public health and safety. Such regulations do not violate the 14th Amendment right to liberty because they fall within the many restraints to which every person is necessarily subjected for the common good. Real liberty for all cannot exist if each individual is allowed to act without regard to the injury that his or her actions might cause others; liberty is constrained by law. The Court went on to determine in Jacobson that a state may require vaccination if the board of health deems it necessary for public health or safety.

While people have varying opinions about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, the question is whether such concerns and the decision not to vaccinate should outweigh the potential public health risks. The answer to this question, based on Jacobson, appears to be no. A subsequent question is whether the decision not to vaccinate based on deeply held religious beliefs should be protected when there is a risk or threat to the public.

Interestingly, as noted by Stat News, Jacobson did not involve a religious exemption from vaccination. In other words, the argument against mandatory vaccination revolved around the harmful effects of the smallpox shot on the plaintiff and his son. It had nothing to do with Jacobson’s religious beliefs.

According to Stat News, citing Wendy Parmet, a professor of public health law at Northeastern University, “multiple cases over the years have, if indirectly, created the impression that the Constitution does not enshrine the right to object to vaccination on religious grounds. It’s pretty clear there is no constitutional right to a religious exemption.” Moreover, according to The Jewish Star, some rabbis have opined that there are no legitimate religious grounds to oppose vaccination. There are, however, clear religious grounds to make vaccination of kids obligatory.

Undoubtedly, this case will slowly work its way through the court system. Of course, by the time it reaches the end of the road from a legal standpoint, the outbreak could be over. Regardless, it will be interesting to see how the courts handle this difficult and very delicate legal issue.

In the segment titled, “Kids Meet Someone Who’s Had an Abortion,” Amelia Bonow – who created the “Shout Your Abortion” movement that recently published a coffee table book celebrating abortion – boasts about having an abortion to the children.

In her conversation with the children, Bonow denies she was being “reckless” with sex when she and her sex partner took a “short cut” and chose to have unprotected sex.

Bonow describes abortion to the children as a procedure that “sucks out the pregnancy,” and compares it to going to the dentist. If that is not shocking enough, Bonow then tells the children abortion is part of “God’s plan.”

“You go to the doctor, and they put this little straw inside of your cervix, and then inside of your uterus, and then they just suck the pregnancy out,” Bonow tells two young girls who ask her what happens during an abortion. “And it was like a crappy dentist appointment or something. It was just like, ‘This is a body thing that’s kind of uncomfortable,’ but then it was over, and I felt really just grateful that I wasn’t pregnant anymore.”

Bonow then asks a young boy if he believes there are times when abortion is not right.

“I want to say if, like, you are being reckless [or] if there’s nothing wrong going on,” the boy replies.

“Do we want people to just have all those babies?” Bonow retorts.

“No,” the boy answers.

“So, what do we do with them?” she questions.

“Put them up for adoption,” the boy states.

But Bonow continues to disagree with the boy, insisting that putting her baby up for adoption would still force her “to create life.”

“I feel like if I am forced to create life, I have lost the right to my own life,” she states. “I should be the one to decide if my body creates a life. Even if you give a kid up for adoption, you still have a kid out there somewhere.”

When the two girls – one of whom identifies as Catholic – tell Bonow they believe the decision to have an abortion belongs to the person, Bonow says, “I feel supported by that.”

In Bonow’s next piece of indoctrination, she tells the children the word “pro-life” is “propaganda, because often the people that say that don’t want to take care of people who have babies that they can’t afford and then are totally poor.”

“They want to deprive people access to healthcare,” she insists. “And I’m just like, ‘You guys aren’t pro-life. I’m pro-life.’”

At the conclusion of the video, one teen asks Bonow if she has any tattoos. Bonow then turns her bottom lip out to reveal her tattoo of the word “abortion.”",2

Calling the 2018 massacre of 17 students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida “another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America,” Pelosi remarked, “That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that emergency, Mr. President?”

“A Democratic president,” she threatened, “can do that.”

By painting the tragic Parkland shooting as a failure of gun control, however, Pelosi disregards the indisputable fact that the shooter’s rampage was enabled by years-long, system-wide failures of policy and personnel.

Andrew Pollack, the father of shooting victim Meadow Pollack, is on a campaign to hold those who failed the Parkland victims accountable. This includes the resource officer and deputies whose inadequate response allowed the shooting spree to continue for 11 long minutes, the FBI officials who ignored a tip about the shooter’s intentions just over a month prior to the attack, the Broward County superintendent whose “Promise” program kept students’ criminal activities from being reported to police, and the school officials, mental health providers, and officials from the Broward Sheriff’s Office who ignored a series of red flags, not to mention murderer’s lengthy history of violence and mental health issues.

These Tragedies Happened Despite Legal Barriers

Judging by the sheer number of pending legal claims against Broward Country Public Schools (103 as of December 2018), Pollack is not the only parent of a victim or survivor to find that fault extends beyond the shooter and his weapon. The families of two Parkland victims are also filing suit against the manufacturer of Cruz’s AR-15, and the store where he purchased it.

On Friday, just one day after Pelosi threatened future gun control initiatives, America experienced another preventable and horrific shooting in Aurora, Illinois. After he was fired from his job, Gary Martin used a pistol he unlawfully possessed to shoot employees in his workplace. Martin killed six employees, and wounded five of the police officers who responded to the scene before he was killed by police.

As a convicted felon, Martin should not have possessed a weapon. When applying for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card in January 2014, he lied about his previous felony conviction for aggravated assault. After he purchased his pistol in March, Martin also applied for a concealed carry permit. When the fingerprinting process revealed Martin’s criminal history in Mississippi, police turned down Martin’s application, revoked his FOID card, and informed him that he must relinquish his weapon within 48 hours. Instead, Martin kept the pistol.

Non-compliance with police orders regarding weapons and FOID turnover is not uncommon. In 2018, 10,818 FOID cards were revoked by the Illinois State Police, who admitted on Monday that “in most instances” a weapon and official record are not returned. Law enforcement is able to petition a judge for a search warrant to retrieve guns that are not turned over, but according to Illinois law, they are not required to do so.

In Aurora, existing gun laws failed. In Parkland, a host of authorities and policies failed. Democrats are shortsighted if they simply believe that creating new limits on gun ownership will increase Americans’ safety.

Pelosi’s threat of future gun control initiatives does not stand alone. During the 2018 midterm elections, more candidates aired “spots promot[ing] gun control than oppos[ing] it.” In the wake of the Aurora attack, Democratic presidential candidates are loudly decrying gun violence, and advocating for stricter gun control measures.

Worth noting, however, is that Democrats have also been notably two-faced on gun control. Last Wednesday, while the House Judiciary Committee passed a bill to require background checks on every gun sale or transfer, Democrats rejected Republicans’ efforts to add an amendment that would ensure law enforcement is notified “when an individual attempting to purchase a firearm fails a federal background check.”

Most Americans Favor Legal Gun Ownership

A majority of Americans do not agree with Democrats’ gun violence demagoguery. According to a March 2018 poll, 58 percent of Americans believe that gun ownership “increase[s] public safety by allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves.”

James Craig, who returned to his native Detroit as its chief of police in June 2013, believes in the strength of a legally armed populace. After working as a police officer for nearly three decades in Los Angeles, “where ‘it took an act of Congress’ to get permission to carry a gun,” Craig transferred to Portland, Maine. There, he discovered a vastly safer city, and one where gun ownership was common. It was in Portland that Craig realized “the effect…good Americans who are armed can have on reducing violence.”

Prior to Craig’s arrival, Detroit was among the most violent cities in the country. According to FBI statistics, 80 in 1000 Detroit residents “became victims of violent or property crime each year.” In 2012, 386 criminal homicides had been reported in the city. To bring down crime rates, the new chief of police urged Detroit residents to legally and safely arm themselves.

In 2014, Craig’s department issued 1,100 handgun permits. That year, the number of home invasions decreased by 38 percent, with the numbers of shootings and robberies likewise decreasing. Of the 1,800 felons queried in a 2015 survey, 57 percent identified their biggest fear as “armed citizens.”

Since Craig took over the department, Detroit has experienced “double-digit drops” in “nonfatal shootings, robberies, and carjackings.” Although the city’s levels of violence still leave much to be desired, in 2017, Detroit recorded its “lowest number of homicides since 1966.”

Craig believes a conversation surrounding guns should not be about gun control, but “crime control.” As he explains, “individuals who are criminally inclined…when in possession of a weapon, create the problems.”

Before Democrats look to new measures of gun control, they should concern themselves with the enforcement of existing gun laws, keeping weapons out of the hands of criminals, and holding accountable institutions and policies which allow threats to go undetected.

If Democrats impede law-abiding Americans from arming themselves to protect their fellow citizens, and themselves, then the only people with access to weapons will be those who purchase them illegally, with criminal intent.",2
33,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/06/06/poll-public-opposes-male-transgenders-womens-sports-two-one/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,"A narrow plurality of Democrats favor allowing men who say they are transgender to enter women’s sports, but the change is opposed two-to-one by adults, independents, parents, and middle-class voters, says a poll by Rasmussen Reports.

The poll shows “a huge opportunity for us,” said Terry Schilling, the executive director of the American Principles Project. He continued, “It shows how far out the left has come on this; they claim to be pro-feminist and pro-woman, but they support things that will destroy women’s sports.”

Democrats favor men’s participation in women’s sports by 43 percent to 36 percent, said the survey of 1,000 adults, which was conducted May 28 and 29.

But the entry of men into women’s sports is opposed 54 percent to 28 percent among all adults, by 52 percent to 27 percent among independents, and by 77 percent to 13 percent among Republicans.

The question asked: “Do you favor or oppose allowing transgender students to participate on the sports teams of the gender they identify with, letting biological males, for example, play girls’ sports?”

The survey also shows that only 31 percent of adults favor “allowing transgender students to use the bathrooms of the opposite biological sex.”

Both questions also showed that 23 percent of the female respondents said they are “not sure” how to answer the questions. That high percentage suggests that many women have not made up their minds — and that many are reluctant to reveal their views amid pro-transgender advocacy by establishment media outlets.

The greatest sympathy for the transgender claims came from younger, lower-income, female, Democrat respondents.

The poll surveyed 1,000 adults. Whites comprised just 63 percent of the panel. Thirty-five percent said they are Democrats and 28 percent said they are Republicans.

The poll does not show if the voters “strongly” and “somewhat” oppose or endorse the transgender demands.

The Rasmussen results match prior surveys, which show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology’s claim that people’s legal sex is determined by their feeling of “gender identity,” not by biology.

The rejection is a problem for Democrat legislators in the House, who almost unanimously voted to establish the unpopular ideology in a May 17 vote on H.R. 5, The Equality Act.

The GOP’s base — and a core group of GOP legislators — are opposing the ideology, while most GOP legislators and the top leaders are trying to avoid taking a public stand.

The GOP legislators who led the May 17 opposition included California’s Rep. Tom McClintock, Missouri’s Rep. Vicky Hartzler, Arizona’s Rep. Debbie Lesko, and North Carolina’s Rep. Virginia Foxx. Hartzler, a former track coach, said:

This bill legalizes discrimination, government-imposed, top-down discrimination against those with time-honored views of marriage and gender. … [it will] dismantle female athletics … men are taking home the gold in women’s sports.

After the debate, a spokeswoman for the GOP White, Rep. Steve Scalise, told Breitbart:

The so-called Equality Act tramples on the religious liberty of Americans, rights of parents and doctors, and has dire consequences for female athletics under Title IX. No one should be discriminated against, but that also includes parents, doctors, people of faith, and female athletes, who are dangerously targeted in this bill.

The poll showing the public’s rejection spotlights the donor dilemma for GOP leaders, who are zigzagging between their base and a few pro-transgender donors.

“It is incredibly important for Republicans to ignore the donor class on this issue,” said Schilling.

This is an area where the elites and the elite donors are completely out of line with the voters on an issue in which the voters care passionately about. We’re talking millions of voters whose daughters are playing sports … [GOP] leaders need to ignore the donor class.

The transgender issue may help the GOP close the big gap with suburban and women voters. The Rasmussen poll shows that just 30 percent of women support men entering women’s sports and that 47 percent of women oppose the move. That divide will likely widen as videos show more men publicly taking podiums, prizes, and status from obviously smaller, defeated women.

This pushback is being aided by increasingly vocal networks of women’s athletes who fear their sports will be overwhelmed by males. But many critical women and girls try to hide their identity for fear of retaliation by progressives and angry men.

“It is cruel, it is disgraceful,” said Schilling.

President Trump’s deputies have decisively rolled back former President Obama’s pro-transgender rules in military, health care, housing, and other areas. Almost universally, reporters have refused to describe or explain the administration’s popular policy, in part, because Trump does not tout his popular policy directly to voters.

For example, Trump told a London TV host that transgender people are excluded from the military “because they take massive amounts of drugs. They have to, and also — and you’re not allowed to take drugs. You’re in the military. You’re not allowed to take any drugs. You take an aspirin.”

Trump’s Pentagon deputies say in court that they do not recruit people who demand to be treated as members of the opposite sex in training, physical fitness, showers, accommodations, promotions, and other circumstances. The inevitable conflicts are avoided by determining each recruit’s sex via the non-political “bright line of biology.”

Trump “is a practical guy,” said Schilling. “I was not surprised by his comments.” But to win the debate, “we need to have Donald Trump to take the lead and [GOP leaders] will follow,” said Schilling. “Any controversy on this issue is going to be a major plus.”

Background Facts and Figures on Transgender Ideology:

In general, the transgender ideology says a person’s sex is determined by his or her “gender identity,” not by his or her biology.

The ideology insists that men and women’s bodies are more or less identical, and it objects to the public’s view of the two sexes as simultaneously different, complementary, and equal. The transgender advocates want to impose their ideology on Americans by establishing “transgender rights” laws, which would require the Department of Justice to penalize individuals and groups that insist that women and girls are biologically different — and have different priorities — than men and boys.

Transgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent.

But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo transition surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study. A 2018 Pentagon report commissioned by former Defense Secretary James Mattis said that “rates for genital surgery are exceedingly low- 2% of transgender men and 10% of transgender women.”

The transgender movement is diverse, so the different factions have competing goals and priorities.

It includes feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes, masculine autogynephile men who demand sex from lesbians, as well as revenue-seeking drug companies and medical service providers. It includes wealthy donors, ambitious politicians, and professional advocates. The movement also includes sexual liberationists and many progressives who are eager to liberate people from their bodies, non-political people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, high-profile children, troubled teenage girls trying to flee teenage strife, and people trying to “de-transition” back to their sex, plus parents who are eager or willing to endorse transgender claims.

The gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies.

The progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of “gender identity” has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.

These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K–12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in child-rearing, children’s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women’s ideals of beauty, culture and civil society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children’s sexual privacy.",2

While there is a raft of motivations for such historic perfidy — with several GOP senators politically benefiting from some of the same corrupting influences — one under-examined, non-Russian reason is personal greed.

A new report reveals that the 2017 GOP tax law was rife with monumental self-dealing by rich GOP lawmakers who have since benefited bigly. According to a Center for Public Integrity analysis, several Republican members of Congress directly cashed in on the multibillion-dollar windfall from the corporate tax cuts the GOP pushed through on a party-line vote. With the lowest effective tax rate in the last 40 years, America's largest corporations proceeded to pour $1 trillion not into increased wages for workers but buybacks of their own stocks, causing stock prices to soar. Coincidentally, many Republican lawmakers who voted for the largest tax cut signed into law by Trump personally owned some of the same stocks whose values significantly increased as a result.

At least seven Republican senators owned stocks in companies that spent billions on buybacks, resulting in great personal profit, according to the Center for Public Integrity. The report came on the same day that former New York Rep. Chris Collins, who was the first sitting GOP congressman to support Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was sentenced to 26 months in prison for insider trading.

It is no wonder why Republicans insisted on ramming through incredibly unpopular tax cuts for American corporations that were already making near-record profits, even at the risk of losing control of the House of Representatives. Of course, billionaires and corporations that reaped millions of dollars from the GOP tax cuts pumped some of that windfall into Republican campaigns, allowing Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to retain control of the Senate. With that, Trump's fate in a Senate impeachment trial was all but sealed.

While the report is a less than shocking look into the kleptocratic ways of the modern GOP, it shows that the transactional core of the 2017 tax cuts has ramifications far beyond the $1.8 trillion increase in the national debt. Republican senators in purple states, like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and David Perdue of Georgia, have personally reaped hundreds of millions from the tax law and are repaying the president by serving as his impeachment propaganda machine rather than impartial jurors — even as half of registered voters and a majority of independents in a Fox News poll released on Sunday said the Senate should convict Trump.

Now, in addition to running defense for Trump, McConnell's repeating Trump's empty promises of a middle-class tax cut in an election year.

""We're talking a fairly substantial … middle-class tax cut that'll be subject to taking back the House and obviously keeping the Senate and keeping the White House,"" Trump told the Wall Street Journal during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week. He promised a plan would be revealed in 90 days.

Before the 2018 midterms, Trump actually admitted that his tax bill was never aimed at cutting middle-class taxes, promising to actually deliver in 2019. ""We're putting in a resolution some time in the next week and a half to two weeks [and] we're giving a middle-income tax reduction of about 10 percent,"" Trump told reporters at the time.

The first Republican rule of ""middle-class tax cuts"" is to speak about them but never actually pass them. They've been pulling the same bait-and-switch since at least 1980. But while they were cutting taxes for the rich and corporations, the GOP left in place the income taxes a majority of seniors pay on their Social Security income. Now they are again touting cuts to Medicare and Social Security to cover the payoff they gave to themselves.

""The president directed me to produce what we're calling tax cuts 2.0,"" senior White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow explained last week. ""It will be published sometime during the campaign, as a message for future Trump economic growth policies, [with] particular emphasis on the middle class, in his second term. ... We are looking at a variety of tax cuts, sometimes making permanent some existing tax cuts, some existing corporate tax cuts.""

That last part gives the game away. The promise of continued corporate tax cuts is how Trump builds his 2020 election war chest from the super-rich and buys the continued allegiance of Republican impeachment jurors, even in the face of ever more damning evidence of his public corruption.

A plan known as the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act introduced in the Senate by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), as well as Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), would eliminate the U.S. country caps in the legal immigration system that would fast track outsourcing of white-collar American jobs to mostly Indian and Chinese nationals imported to the country by businesses, outsourcing firms, and multinational corporations.

The country caps were originally implemented to prevent any one country from monopolizing the legal immigration system. Eliminating the country caps would immediately fast track up to 300,000 green cards, and eventually American citizenship, to primarily Indian nationals in the U.S. on the H-1B visa, so long as they agree to take high-paying white-collar jobs from Americans.

In the process, not only would other foreign workers be crowded out from receiving employment-based green cards, but the elimination of the country caps would fast track the outsourcing of high-paying American jobs that would otherwise go to U.S. graduates.

The Kochs’ Libre Initiative organization has announced their support for the mass middle-class outsourcing scheme, with the group’s president Daniel Garza saying in a statement:

We thank Senators Lee and Harris, as well as Representatives Lofgren and Buck, for introducing this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to eliminate an unfair policy that favors high-skilled workers from one nation over another. According to a recent estimate, workers from some countries will have to wait more than 150 years to obtain a green card, while others face no wait at all. This unfair system makes no sense, which is why there is such broad support in both the House and Senate to eliminate it. [Emphasis added] This is a good step towards positive reform of our immigration laws. Congress should consider bills like this, which will help deliver a more transparent, efficient, and navigable system that welcomes immigrants who will contribute to this country. We hope leaders will move promptly to debate and pass this worthwhile legislation. [Emphasis added]

There has been an enormous effort by Republicans and Democrats — including Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH), Sen. Corey Gardner (R-CO) — to ram the plan through Congress with huge donor class support.

The plan is a boon to Silicon Valley billionaires, big business elites, and outsourcing firms, as they would be able to readily import more lower-paid Indian and Chinese foreign workers to take American jobs that would have otherwise gone to American citizens.

Experts have said that should the country caps be eliminated, India would be able to monopolize the country’s legal immigration system for the next ten years. After that decade of an Indian-first legal immigration system, the legal immigration flow from India to the U.S. would likely stabilize to make up around 75 percent of all employment-based legal immigration.

Likewise, U.S. employers would be incentivized to more readily outsource American jobs through the H-1B visa and the L-1 visa programs.

The nation’s workforce now includes roughly 1.5 million foreign visa workers who are imported via the H-1B, L-1, OPT, O-1, J-1, and other visa programs. These outsourcing workers are not immigrants, but rather contract workers hired for one to six years, at lower wages, to take U.S. jobs that would otherwise go to American graduates.

Every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of an American workers’ occupation reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent, researcher Steven Camarotta concludes. This means the average native-born American worker today has their wage reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels.

Likewise, every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of low-skilled U.S. occupations reduces wages by about 0.8 percent. Should 15 percent of low-skilled jobs be held by foreign-born workers, it would reduce the wages of native-born American workers by perhaps 12 percent.

Overall, four million young Americans enter the workforce every year, but their job opportunities are further diminished as there are roughly two new foreign workers for every four American workers who enter the workforce.

According to the Marist poll and its partner, the Knights of Columbus, the survey demonstrates that the label “pro-choice” can be deceptive when it is interpreted to mean supportive of abortion at any point in pregnancy.

A new KofC/Marist poll on American attitudes toward abortion finds that overwhelming majorities support substantial restrictions on abortion, and would like to see Roe v. Wade reinterpreted to allow restrictions. https://t.co/YW1y7rEWFx pic.twitter.com/6nQNNYHBHI — Knights of Columbus (@KofC) January 15, 2019

“As in past years, this poll shows that the pro-choice label on the abortion issue is simply insufficient,” said Knights of Columbus CEO Carl Anderson. “The majority of Americans – in both parties – support legal restrictions on abortion. Two-thirds of Americans want Roe revisited to allow for state regulation of abortion or to ban it altogether. The majority of the American people deserve to have their opinions heard.”

According to the poll, 75 percent of Americans say abortion should be limited to — at most — the first three months of pregnancy. Among those who identify as Republicans, 92 percent want that restriction, as do 78 percent of independents and 60 percent of Democrats. Perhaps most significantly, that view is shared by 61 percent of those who identify as “pro-choice.”

In addition, the survey finds 65 percent of Americans say if the Supreme Court revisits Roe v. Wade, the high court should either return the issue of the legality of abortion to the states (49 percent) or outlaw the procedure altogether (16 percent). Only 30 percent of those surveyed would prefer that the Supreme Court rule in favor of unrestricted abortion.

Regarding taxpayer funding of the procedure, 54 percent oppose any taxpayer funding of abortion, while 39 percent support it.

On the issue of taxpayer funding of the procedure overseas, the poll finds 75 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding abroad, through non-governmental organizations such as International Planned Parenthood, with only 19 percent in favor of such funding. When political affiliation is a factor, 94 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of independents, and 56 percent of Democrats oppose taxpayer funding of abortion overseas.

When asked if medical professionals with moral objections to abortion should be permitted to opt out of performing them, 55 percent of those surveyed agreed, while 35 percent did not agree.

The majority of Americans (62 percent) oppose abortions for unborn babies with Down Syndrome. Additionally, 59 percent are in favor of banning the procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy, except to save the life of the mother.

When questions regarding the nature of the unborn are asked, 56 percent of Americans say, “scientifically,” a fetus is “a unique life,” while 35 percent say it is “part of a woman’s body.” Additionally, 42 percent say life begins at conception while 13 percent say life begins at birth.

“Most Americans also believe that laws can protect both the mother and her unborn child (83 percent to 10 percent).”

The survey of 1,066 adults was conducted January 8-10 using landline or mobile phone numbers. Results are statistically significant within plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.

A poll released Monday by Students for Life of America also found that labels such as “pro-life” and “pro-choice” can hide what Millennials actually prefer in terms of policy on abortion.

That poll revealed that 70 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 support limits on abortion, with 42 percent opposing the procedure broadly.

Despite the image portrayed of popular culture in the media, of those Millennials surveyed, only seven percent supported abortion without any exceptions and funded by taxpayer dollars — the position embraced by the Democrat Party.",2

“A student in Wendy Petersen Boring’s climate-change-focused class said she woke at 2 a.m. and then cried for two solid hours about the warming ocean,” CNN reported.

“This is a computer science major,” Petersen Boring said.

Peterson Boring is an associate professor of history, religious studies, women and gender studies at Willamette University in Oregon also has taught climate change classes for more than ten years.

“In that short time, she has watched her students’ fear, grief, stress, and anxiety grow,” CNN reported.

”Back in 2007, it was the mouse in the room; then, it became the elephant in the room,” Peterson Boring said. “By 2016, those concerns and fears began to flood over.”

CNN bolsters her claim by citing polls it says show many Americans are worried about global warming without linking to any of those polls.

But the media outlet does link to a 2007 abstract on a federal website that puts a name on the so-called climate change anxiety.

“There’s no clinical definition, but climate anxiety and grief or solastalgia — ‘the distress that is produced by environmental change impacting on people while they are directly connected to their home environment’ — has become such a concern that the American Psychological Association created a 69-page climate-change guide to help mental health care providers,” CNN reported.

“Increasing adoption of active commuting, public transportation, green spaces, and clean energy are all solutions that people can choose to support and integrate into their daily lives,” the 2017 report stated. “These climate solutions, among others, can help to curb the stress, anxiety, and other mental illnesses incurred from the decline of economies, infrastructure, and social identity that comes from damage to the climate.”

And groups have sprung up to address the phenomenon, including Good Grief in Salt Lake City, “created to help people build resilience while discussing ‘eco-anxiety,’ despair and inaction on the environment.”

CNN notes that some people are so distraught that they have decided to join groups like BirthStrike, which advocates for not having children because of the grim future they would face because of climate change.

CNN does not question conclusions reached by the United Nations, including human activity causing the extinction of as many as a million species and that it could be just a matter of years until mass death and destruction if no action to stop climate change is taken.

“It’s going to take an enormous global effort to keep the planet from that catastrophic point,” CNN reported.

Then the news outlet blames the election of President Donald Trump for an increase in anxious students in Peterson Boring’s classes.

“With the Trump election, the change in my students, the sense of grief and fear and paralysis in the room, became palpable,” Petersen Boring said.

“Anxiety is something people feel more and more when they get closer to an anti-goal, meaning a negative result, like the destruction of the planet,” Janet Swim, a psychology professor at Penn State said in the CNN report.

CNN’s report includes a list of things people can do to lessen their climate change anxiety, including becoming a climate change activist, adopting a “plant-based diet,” walk or bike instead of driving, and bring your own coffee cup and utensils to work or the local coffee shop.

The Appeal reported:

On Sunday afternoon, a veto-proof majority of Minneapolis City Council members will announce their commitment to disbanding the city’s embattled police department, which has endured relentless criticism in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, on May 25. “We’re here because we hear you. We are here today because George Floyd was killed by the Minneapolis Police. We are here because here in Minneapolis and in cities across the United States it is clear that our existing system of policing and public safety is not keeping our communities safe,” Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender said Sunday. “Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.”

Reuters sought to determine where Joe Biden stands on the growing issue.

“A Biden campaign spokesman declined to comment,” Reuters reported.

“Defund the police” has become a litmus test of sorts for far-left activists, and some Democrats are adding fuel to that fire.

Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-MN) threw her support behind the idea, saying it was time to “disband” the Minneapolis police force and “reimagine” public safety.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was forced into a walk of shame Saturday night after he refused to support defunding police.

RICHMOND, Va. — A push by Virginia Democrats to loosen restrictions on late-term abortions is erupting into a fierce partisan clash as video of a legislative hearing goes viral.

Democrats back legislation to reduce the number of doctors required to certify late-term abortions from three to one. It also would delete the words “substantially and irremediably” when referring to the threat that continuing a pregnancy poses for impairing a woman’s health.

House Republicans tweeted a one-minute excerpt from the lengthy hearing, in which Democratic Del. Kathy Tran acknowledged that her bill would allow abortions up until moments before birth.

In reality, existing state law already provides for abortions throughout the third trimester, if three doctors certify a woman’s health would otherwise be substantially and irremediably impaired.

In the tweet, which as of Wednesday afternoon was viewed more than 2.3 million times, Republicans said her response shows Democrats have “extreme” abortion views.

Headlined “The Coronavirus May Make Trump Stronger,” it argues that President Trump’s abysmal and malfeasant handling of the greatest public health emergency in a century is a feature, not a bug, in his quest for a second term.

The piece is located behind Rupert Murdoch’s pay wall, but in summary, it argues that the recent blip in Trump’s poll numbers is indicative of the vast reservoir of populist sentiment in the country. He calculates Trump voters as roughly 42 percent of all American voters, and adding what he calls the Sanders base (at 36 percent of the Democratic base, or 13 percent of national voters), he says that 55 percent of the country is solidly populist.

Mead lectures us that the establishment is totally clueless about this. The elites arrogantly attribute Trump’s popularity among his supporters to racism, religious fundamentalism, and ignorance.

But, says Mead, the pointy-heads discount the populist base’s profound distrust of establishment competence and wisdom on economic policy (meaning, mainly, outsourcing), while skimping on health care and infrastructure items like good roads and bridges, and at the same time piling up enormous deficits. He even gets in a few licks against social promotion and virtue signaling, whatever that is. All of this points to a Trump reelection, even as the establishment refuses to face the facts.

Meade might well be right in his electoral prediction. That said, it is absolutely impossible for anyone aside from Nostradamus to confidently predict the reaction of the American public, too many of whom are (as ever) grossly misinformed, have microscopic attention spans, and can change their view of events based on reasons that no one can reliably deduce in advance.

This caveat applies particularly when considering transient phenomena like poll numbers.

We should recall that George H.W. Bush had a popularity rating of 89 percent after the Persian Gulf War, but he lost the 1992 election. Will there be a similar letdown after the current coronavirus crisis abates? Possibly, but it is just as possible that those who are unscathed by coronavirus will say the whole megillah was exaggerated, that it merely hurt their economic position, and that Trump was right to dismiss it.

An example of this phenomenon of dismissing incompetence is 9/11. The August 6, 2001 intelligence brief gave clear warning of an Osama bin Laden-orchestrated terrorist attack, but George W. Bush, after telling the briefer, “you covered your ass, now,” preferred to play golf and cut brush during his five week vacation rather than attend to the duties his oath of office required.

Yet in the wake of the attack, Bush’s favorability rating skyrocketed to 90 percent. To some extent that is understandable given the clampdown on information about the Bush administration’s prior negligence, a disregard which bordered on the criminal. But over the next three years, that adverse information all came to light—yet Bush was reelected.

So there is really no way we can tell for sure which way the public will break. But it does seem that Mead consistently overrates “economic anxiety” and other ostensibly legitimate factors such as lack of health care and infrastructure as motivating the Trump cultists, while asserting that the establishment willfully overlooks these explanations in favor of such derogatory rationales as racism.

Mead’s assertion about so-called economic anxiety is mostly untrue. For too long, the national media have fed us a tale of economic anxiety in the Great Heartland being responsible for Trump’s election. It is not that the tale is wholly false, but it is told in the wrong context, and without important qualifiers attached.

Of course, opposing explanations have been advanced: “status anxiety” (a euphemism for fear of minorities) and “racial resentment” (although how this term is functionally different from garden-variety racism is not clarified). But economic anxiety as a rationale is still widely circulated by the prestige media.

Closer study has corrected this canard. Racism, not economic anxiety, fed the motivations of Trump supporters, many of whom are not notably in economic distress. Mead excoriates media “elites” for being out of touch, yet he has adopted precisely the same fallacious conventional wisdom that they generated.

Granted, there remain large numbers of Trump voters who are by most measures in poor economic circumstances. Unfortunately for his thesis, Mead neglects to tell us why these people consistently (and long before Trump arrived) vote precisely for Republican politicians who promise to outsource their jobs and take away their Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. Why would a laid-off Kentucky coal miner, relieved to get Obamacare, vote for Matt Bevin, a zealot for eliminating Obamacare in that state?

Indeed, why did farmers, who voted in overwhelming numbers for Trump in 2016, opt so heavily for the candidate who promised, explicitly and repeatedly, to launch a tariff war with the country that in many cases constituted their largest export market? Could it be that Jesus, Duck Dynasty, and putting minorities in their place might have loomed larger in their political imagination than sober calculations about where they will sell their soybean crop, or how long they’d be able to keep their Obamacare policy?

Mead’s lumping the Sanders vote in with Trump supporters is also problematic. Yes, many at the diehard and inflexible core of his support, the gamers and cosplayers, may stay home or even vote for Trump as a middle finger to The Man, but the great majority of Sanders supporters presumably voted for him simply because they liked his message about universal health care and correcting income inequality. Those are issues on which Trump is a disaster, yet Mead counts them all as potential Trump voters.

Again, he may be right about his prediction, as the future is not predetermined, although it is hard to assume great predictive accuracy if his analysis of the voters in question seems inaccurate and ideologically slanted.

There is also another possibility: as the disgraced Chris Matthews once said, a clever (and publicity-seeking) pundit should make a number of wild-ass predictions. If wrong, they will all be forgotten, but if he gets one “black swan event” right, he’ll be considered a genius on the order of a biblical prophet. (Matthews’s embarrassing man-crush on putative future president Fred Thompson certainly came a cropper!).

Has Yale’s Professor Walter Russell Mead (using the middle name in one’s moniker is a flashing caution light when it comes to pretention) ever actually ventured into Wheeling or Steubenville or Youngstown to see, unblinkered, what motivates their residents? The American class system is riven with more denial, fake guilt and crocodile tears, snobbery, reverse-snobbery, and sheer humbug than any social organization on earth. Academics often play a vanguard role in this pantomime by performing their clichéd Tom Joad routine, although it might be hard to keep a straight face when one is tenured at an institution like Yale that is home to Skull & Bones and has a $29-billion endowment.

Looking at Mead’s background, we find he has been described as a Trump influencer or Trump “whisperer.” Why is there now a portrait of Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office? Apparently, it was Mead who sold the whole Jacksonian hogwash to Steve Bannon and Trump. (In reality, Jackson was a terrible president: the Trail of Tears was the precedent for a dictatorial executive disregarding the rule of law and civil liberties, and his relentless war against the Second Bank of the United States triggered the Panic of 1837, one of the deepest recessions of the century).

We can speculate that rather than conscripting some right-wing talk show ranter to bolt together a semi-literate screed on Townhall.com triumphantly announcing Trump’s immanent victory, the president’s campaign called in their tame house academic to insert a “serious” thumb-sucker of an op-ed into a nominally prestigious journal so as to psychologically rattle the chattering classes with the specter of their worst nightmare coming true.

41,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/12/06/report-wealthy-college-students-borrow-more-money-for-education/,"A recent study found that college students from high-income households are borrowing more money for school than students from households with lower incomes. The report added that students from wealthier families are responsible for some of the more drastic borrowing increases in recent years.

A new report discovered that students from wealthy households borrowed larger amounts of money — and more frequently — in recent years, which have risen higher than the increase of borrowing among students from less well-off households, according to a report by Inside Higher Ed.

The report added that between 1995 and 1996, just 16 percent of first-year college students from households making an inflation-adjusted income of more than $114,000 took out student loans, with 24.3 percent of students from households making $22,000 or less taking out loans.

Between 2015 and 2016, the student loan borrowing rates jumped to about 30 percent — for all income groups. According to the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), the borrowing amounts had risen faster for students from high-income households.

Jason Delisle, a resident fellow at AEI and author of the report, noted that students from high-income households have student loan debt making up a “disproportionately large share of the total amount borrowed,” according to Inside Higher Ed.

The data examined in the AEI report does not include debt incurred by students who never completed their degrees.

The report added that the increase in borrowing is in part due to what students from high-income families choose to study, and in which institutions they enroll — noting that these students are more likely to enroll in four-year degree programs, and at pricey private institutions.

As for students from low-income families, the report said that they are more likely to enroll in shorter programs resulting in certificates or associate’s degrees, and at public institutions, which are less costly.

Moreover, it was mentioned that average net tuition and fees for high-income students have gone up by $4,400 between 1995-1996, and 2015-2016, which is roughly twice as much as the increase for other income groups.

“They’re paying more for tuition,” said Delisle. “The other thing, for the universities, is that price discrimination is getting more intense. They’re charging those students more with high sticker prices and pushing some of the aid down to lower-income students.”

Sandy Baum, a nonresident senior fellow at the Urban Institute, suggested that another reason for the increase in borrowing could be that student loans might have gotten easier to obtain than other types of debt.

“It is reasonable to believe that at least some of the increase in this borrowing is the result of the increased difficulty of obtaining home equity loans,” wrote Baum to Inside Higher Ed in an email. “We don’t have the data to verify this, but that phenomenon could explain some of the increase in borrowing among students from more affluent households.”

“It is clear that people who stay in school longer borrow more than others,” she added, “and students from more affluent backgrounds are more likely to stay in school to earn bachelor’s degrees.”

Part of the push is that certain items, including computers and clothing, can be purchased throughout the Volunteer State free of sales tax, which promotes consumerism while helping out families purchasing items for kids who are about to go back to school. The Charlotte Observer reports that a proposal to include feminine hygiene products among sales tax-free items has been receiving big-time pushback from Republicans.

Republican state Sen. Joey Hensley explained that he was worried about … how many tampons women might buy. While debating against the bill in the state legislature, he said, “I would think since it’s a sales tax holiday, there’s really no limit on the number of items anybody can purchase.” He went on to say he didn’t know of a way to limit how many feminine hygiene products someone could buy.

The fight to rid our culture of the stigmas surrounding woman’s menstruation has been going on for decades. One obstacle that seems especially frivolous is sales taxes on feminine hygiene products, like tampons. States have taxed the sale of items like tampons the same way one would tax luxury items like a necklace or a flatscreen television. This means that the government does not classify items like tampons and sanitary pads as necessities.

Groups like the American Medical Association have tried to pressure state legislatures into eliminating taxes on feminine hygiene products. Activists have made headway in recent years on this front, including getting states like Georgia to invest in providing financial assistance to low-income people in need of feminine hygiene products. In some cases, activists have succeeded in getting states to eliminate the tax on hygiene products. Nevada became the 10th state to do this in 2018.

A reminder: The bill that Republicans in Tennessee are trying to quash would make these hygiene products tax-free for THREE DAYS, once a year!!!! The bill’s fiscal impact to the state of Tennessee is estimated at around $132,700 per year. Of course, Republicans like state Sen. Hensley seem to fear that Tennesseans looking to make a life-size replica of the Titanic out of tampons might break the state’s bank.",0

On Monday, a UN report circulated around establishment media outlets like Reuters, AFP, and NPR reported a false story that claimed Trump was currently holding about 100,000 migrant children in custody.

“More than 100,000 children are currently being held in migration-related detention in the United States, often in violation of international law, the UN said Monday,” an AFP story on the UN report stated.

NPR ran with the UN report as well, writing that the Trump administration “is still holding more than 100,000 children in migration-related detention.”

The author of the UN report, though, now admits that the migrant child detention figures are from 2015, when Obama was president.

On Tuesday, The New York Times published a story about a woman who accuses McGregor of assaulting her at the Beacon Hotel in Dublin, where McGregor is an occasional guest. Irish news media first reported the alleged assault in late 2018 but did not identify McGregor by name.

The UFC did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the allegations. Karen J. Kessler, a spokeswoman for McGregor, told HuffPost the story “has been circulating for some time and it is unclear why it is being reported now.”

“Should Conor fight in the future it must be in an environment where fighters are respected for their value, their skill, their hard work and their dedication to the sport,” Kessler wrote in a statement, without addressing the allegations against McGregor.

Law enforcement arrested and questioned the 30-year-old in January, but released him pending further investigation. Authorities have not charged him with a crime.

The news of McGregor’s alleged sexual misconduct comes on the heels of his announcement that he’ll be retiring from the UFC.",0

46,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/10/white-supremacist-las-vegas-guilty-plea-conor-climo/4717616002/,"An avowed white supremacist pleaded guilty on Monday for planning bomb and shooting attacks at a synagogue and LGBTQ bar in Las Vegas.

Conor Climo, a former security guard, told U.S. District Judge James Mahan he possessed materials to make a destructive device and is a member of the Feuerkrieg Division, an offshoot of a U.S.-based neo-Nazi group called Atomwaffen Division.

The 24-year-old also pleaded guilty to felony possession of an unregistered firearm and could face between two and three years behind bars. An anti-terrorism task force arrested Climo in August after he told an FBI informant he was scouting places to attack. Federal agents reviewed his encrypted messages to white nationalists.

When searching his home, authorities found hand-drawn schematics and firebomb parts including flammable liquids, oxidizing agents and circuit boards, according to federal documents. They also found a journal with sketches of mass shootings at a McDonald’s restaurant and LGBTQ bar in a downtown tourist corridor, according to federal documents.

""Climo drew what he described as two infantry squads attacking the bar with firearms from the outside and one attacking it with firearms from the inside,” the complaint said. “Agents seized an AR-15 rifle and a bolt action rifle from Climo’s bedroom.”

The Las Vegas resident referred to his journal as a manifesto, a U.S. magistrate judge said. A review of his posts in online message boards revealed he wanted to plant neo-Nazi propaganda inside Nevada middle and high schools. Climo claimed he also targeted college campuses – particularly University of Nevada, Reno, where he described plans to infiltrate student-run political groups.

He also planned an attack on the Las Vegas headquarters of The Anti-Defamation League – an organization that tracks the spread and evolution of extremist activities.

In the two years before his arrest, Climo chatted with the leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, offering details about his job and asking questions about starting a local chapter.

“I’m beginning to work towards chapter formation in my area, Las Vegas,"" Climo wrote in April 2017, ""so that way then the chapter can begin working on defunding and shutting down Section 8 alongside white community building.”

The Feuerkrieg Division, which Climo said he is a member of, calls for the destruction of “the system,” or society at large, according to the Anti-Defamation League. It is an offshoot of the Atomwaffen Division, which has been linked to several killings, including the 2017 shooting deaths of two men at an apartment in Tampa, Florida.

The group “encourages, and may even commit, violent attacks on people of the Jewish religion, homosexuals, African Americans and federal infrastructures,” a U.S. magistrate judge wrote when she rejected Climo’s bid for release last August.

47,https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/new-study-helps-unravel-the-mystery-behind-the-coronaviruss-baffling-symptoms/,"A new report from a well-respected medical journal suggests that the coronavirus may be a blood vessel disease as well as a respiratory infection. That explanation would tie together a number of disparate manifestations of the novel coronavirus that were previously confounding researchers. That includes the emergence of pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a coronavirus-related syndrome which only affects children; and the presence of toe rashes, a condition that has been dubbed ""Covid Toe.""

The study, which was published in The Lancet in April, demonstrates that endothelial cells — that is, cells which form the barrier between blood vessels and organ tissues and control the transmission of fluids between the two — are involved in various health problems associated with the coronavirus. They observed this in multiple patients with COVID-19. One patient, a 71-year-old man who had had a kidney transplant, died of multisystem organ failure after being diagnosed with COVID-19, and a subsequent analysis of his transplanted kidney found that viral inclusion structures were in his endothelial cells. They also found inflammatory cells associated with endothelial cells in his heart, small bowel and lungs.

A second patient, a 58-year-old obese woman with diabetes and arterial hypertension, suffered multi-organ failure and eventually died of a cardiac arrest. According to the authors of the Lancet article, they discovered ""lymphocytic endotheliitis in lung, heart, kidney, and liver as well as liver cell necrosis.""

As the researchers write, ""the development ""of this disease seems to be that it utilizes the ACE2 receptors as an entry way to a range of cells causing destruction.. . . This explains why the disease has such a variety of presentations and makes it potentially more dangerous,"" they continue. ACE2 receptors refers to a specific protein that allows coronavirus to infect human cells.

Georges Benjamin, Executive Director of the American Public Health Association, expressed optimism about the report, telling Salon by email that ""the study has major potential implications for understanding and treating the coronavirus, which often causes complications deemed unusual for strictly respiratory ailments.""

Other medical professionals had similar outlooks.

""This paper describes evidence of microscopic damage and direct viral infection in blood vessels from multiple organs in three patients infected with SARS-CoV2,"" Dr. Russell Medford, Chairman of the Center for Global Health Innovation and Global Health Crisis Coordination Center, told Salon by email. ""These findings are consistent with a growing body of scientific and clinical evidence that strongly suggests that the SARS-CoV2 virus can infect and damage multiple organs in addition to the lungs, such as the kidney, heart, intestines and liver, by targeting the endothelial cells that line the inner surface of their blood vessels.""

William Li, MD, president of the Angiogenesis Foundation, told Medium that ""all these Covid-associated complications were a mystery. We see blood clotting, we see kidney damage, we see inflammation of the heart, we see stroke, we see encephalitis [swelling of the brain].""

Mandeep Mehra, MD, medical director of the Brigham and Women's Hospital Heart and Vascular Center, had a similar observation, telling the publication that ""a whole myriad of seemingly unconnected phenomena that you do not normally see with SARS or H1N1 or, frankly, most infectious diseases. If you start to put all of the data together that's emerging, it turns out that this virus is probably a vasculotropic virus, meaning that it affects the [blood vessels].""

Prior to this study, scientists were baffled as to why blood clots were a common symptom of the coronavirus. The clots alone were not what confused them, but also the fact that blood thinners did not seem to prevent them and people would die of strokes caused by brain blockages. As of last month, one report found that up to 30 percent of patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus develop blood clots that become dangerous.",0
48,https://www.foxnews.com/science/arctic-ocean-ice-free-summers-next-30-years,"A shocking new study says that the ice in the Arctic Ocean will disappear by 2050, which could have ""substantial"" implications on the ecosystem and the climate in the region.

The study notes that ice levels during the summer have been steadily shrinking over the past 30 years, due to climate change. The researchers ran a number of simulations, with most showing the ""the Arctic Ocean becomes practically sea ice-free (sea‐ice area < 1 million km2) in September for the first time before the year 2050.""

“While the Arctic sea ice extent is decreasing during this transition to an ice-free Arctic, the year-to-year variability in extent greatly increases, making life more difficult for local populations and ice-dependent species,” said study co-author Bruno Tremblay, associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at McGill University, in a statement.

GREENLAND SHED ENORMOUS 600B TONS OF ICE LAST YEAR, SCIENTISTS WARN

The researchers add that the sea-ice loss in the future is dependent on carbon emissions. ""If emissions are reduced rapidly, ice-free years only occur occasionally,"" the statement added. ""With higher emissions, the Arctic Ocean will become ice-free in most years.""

More than 40 climate models from 21 research institutes around the world were used by the researchers to come up with their findings. The rapid decline in sea ice levels is believed to be linked to high carbon dioxide emissions and ""little climate protection,"" according to the statement.

The research was published in the scientific journal Geophysical Research Letters.

In September 2019, the sea ice level in the Arctic was the second lowest on record, just 1.6 million square miles, Fox News previously reported.

Since the late 1970s, when satellite records were first kept, NSIDC reports that the 13 smallest sea ice minimums have all occurred in the last 13 years. The lowest amount on record came in 2012, when sea ice dropped to 1.37 million square miles.

In November, it was reported that the Arctic's most stable sea ice area, known as ""Last Ice Area,"" is disappearing faster than researchers initially believed.

The sea ice minimum area has declined 12.8 percent per decade over the past 40 years, which scientists believe is partially a result of climate change.

Skeptics have largely dismissed fears over man’s impact on global warming, saying climate change has been going on since the beginning of time. They also claim the dangers of a warming planet are being wildly exaggerated and question the impact that fossil fuels have had on climate change.

49,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/global-criticism-grows-trump-move-end-who-funding-amid-pandemic-n1184146,"President Donald Trump's move to halt funding to the World Health Organization has been met with severe criticism at home and abroad, with the United Nations secretary-general saying ""now is not the time"" for such a drastic move while the coronavirus pandemic is gripping the globe.

Trump made the announcement Tuesday pending a review of the WHO's response to the initial coronavirus outbreak in China. He claims the agency has been too close to Beijing and covered up for its mistakes.

Congressional Democrats are disputing the president's authority to do this. Republican lawmakers are planning their own investigation, examining the early response by the WHO and the Chinese government.

""Now is a time for unity in the global battle to push the COVID-19 pandemic into reverse, not a time to cut the resources of the World Health Organization, which is spearheading and coordinating the global body's efforts,"" U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement Tuesday.

China expressed ""deep concern"" about Trump's announcement, its foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said at a news briefing.

""As the most authoritative and most professional organization, the World Health Organization has played an irreplaceable role in global public health crisis,"" Zhao said. ""The decision of the U.S. will undercut the ability of the WHO and damage the global cooperation of fighting the epidemic.""

The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, tweeted similar misgivings.

Deeply regret US decision to suspend funding to @WHO. There is no reason justifying this move at a moment when their efforts are needed more than ever to help contain & mitigate the #coronavirus pandemic. Only by joining forces we can overcome this crisis that knows no borders. — Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF) April 15, 2020

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov slammed Trump’s move as ""a very selfish approach."" He told the TASS news agency, ""We urge the United States to abandon further attacks on the WHO and pursue a responsible line.""

And Moussa Faki Mahamat, the chairman of the African Union Commission, called the decision ""deeply regrettable.""

It's not just governments and international organizations that have lined up to express dismay at Trump's move. Experts, entrepreneurs and others have also been quick to condemn the announcement.

Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates told his 50 million Twitter followers that halting the WHO's funding was ""as dangerous as it sounds.""

""Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped, no other organization can replace them,"" Gates tweeted. ""The world needs the WHO now more than ever.""

Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar with Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Reuters, ""The move sends the wrong message during the middle of a pandemic."" While the WHO has made mistakes in the past, he added, ""it's not the middle of a pandemic that you do this type of thing.""

And Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the Lancet medical journal, described Trump's move as ""a crime against humanity."" He tweeted that ""every scientist, every health worker, every citizen must resist and rebel against this appalling betrayal of global solidarity.""

A slew of other world leaders and senior officials lined up to express their dismay over what they said was Trump's willingness to hamper the WHO just when the world needs it the most.

The U.S. is the world's largest financial contributor to the organization, accounting for roughly 15 percent of its budget. Trump has said that amounts to some $500 million each year.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that ascribing blame ""does not help"" because ""the virus knows no borders. We have to closely work together.""

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that ""at time like this when we need to be sharing information and we need to have advice we can rely on, the WHO has provided that.""

Not everyone was quite so scathing. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he sympathized with some of Trump's criticisms of the WHO, but nevertheless said now was not the time ""to throw the baby out with the bathwater"" and hobble the agency at a time of global crisis.

Trump has accused the WHO of ""severely mismanaging and covering up"" the coronavirus crisis, specifically the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China. He also claimed that the WHO ""pushed China's misinformation about the virus ... and there was no need for travel bans.""

He took particular issue with the agency's criticism of his order to temporarily deny entry to the U.S. by most foreign nationals who had recently been in China. The order was issued Jan. 31, when China was the center of the outbreak.

The agency was informed of the first cases Dec. 31. The next day, it requested information from Chinese officials, and the Wuhan market where the outbreak is believed to have originated was closed for disinfection, according to a WHO report.

Then, on Jan. 30, it declared a global health emergency as the number of cases hit 10,000.

Trump's move to halt funding for the agency that oversees international public health has raised questions about whether it could affect efforts by other countries to curtail coronavirus cases.

Dr. Patrice Harris, the president of the American Medical Association, excoriated the president in a statement Tuesday for making the move ""during the worst public health crisis in a century.""

""Cutting funding to the WHO — rather than focusing on solutions — is a dangerous move at a precarious moment for the world,"" Harris said. ""The AMA is deeply concerned by this decision and its wide-ranging ramifications, and we strongly urge the President to reconsider.""",0
50,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/01/15/survey-62-percent-of-respondents-would-give-up-2020-vote-to-get-student-debt-forgiven/,"A solid majority of student loan borrowers in a recent survey said they would trade their 2020 vote for debt forgiveness. The LendEDU website conducted the survey, which found that 62 percent of respondents would rather be debt-free than vote.

The website noted that the average student loan borrower has $28,565 in student loan debt and many will be paying their loan off for at least the next decade.

The survey gathered information about today’s student loan borrowers:

For Americans trying to move forward with their finances after college, monthly student loan payments year after year can be a drag. Buying a house or starting a family in your mid-to-late twenties isn’t as easy as it once was, and student loan debt plays a major factor in that. How desperate are borrowers to move on from their student loan debt? LendEDU posed a series of questions to 1,000 adult Americans with student loan debt to find out. Respondents had to decide if they would go through with each hypothetical scenario to have their student loan debt completely forgiven.

It turns out that respondents would be willing to give up a lot of things to get rid of their debt, including those willing to give up social media for five years (68 percent), give up all streaming services for life (60 percent), and give up all forms of payment except for cash for life (52 percent).

Other findings of the survey include:

Give up internet access for one year

55 percent of borrowers answered “Yes”

45 percent of borrowers answered “No”

Give up the use of Google Search for life

51 percent of borrowers answered “Yes”

49 percent of borrowers answered “No”

Give up being vegan for life or have to become vegan for life

49 percent of respondents answered “Yes”

51 percent of respondents answered “No”

Give up the use of a smartphone for life (can still use flip phone/standard cell phone)

35 percent of borrowers answered “Yes”

65 percent of borrowers answered “No”

Enlist to fight in a hypothetical World War 3

30 percent of borrowers answered “Yes”

70 percent of borrowers answered “No”

Give up the ability to travel anywhere on vacation for the next 30 years

24 percent of borrowers answered “Yes”

76 percent of borrowers answered “No”

Give up hot showers for the next 25 years

17 percent of respondents answered “Yes”

83 percent of respondents answered “No”

LendEDU’s methodology came from the an online survey commissioned by LendEDU and conducted by Pollfish polling company. The website states:

Respondents were only allowed to proceed to the survey if they were 18 or older, from the United States, and had some amount of student loan debt. The first two criterion were found through Pollfish’s filtering features that allowed us to filter on both age and location. The last criterion was found through a screener question that respondents had to answer correctly to proceed.

The poll was conducted on January 10, 2020.

51,https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/08/nationalism-populism-and-saving-ourselves-from-a-dark-future/,"A specter is haunting the West; our elites see intolerant authoritarianism—along with a plethora of related “-phobias” and “-isms”—everywhere. Populist eruptions and governments from Brexit to Budapest to President Trump are perceived as confirmation of their fears, necessitating increasingly ferocious efforts to defend liberal democratic pluralism and its virtues of openness, tolerance, and inclusivity.

In his new book, Return of the Strong Gods: Nationalism, Populism, and the Future of the West, First Things editor R.R. Reno argues that these fears are mistaken. Rather than protecting us from intolerance and fascism, they are casting out the human loves that sustain cultures and nations against such darkness.

Unlike many writers sympathetic to nationalism and populism, Reno does not direct the blame for our present discontents upon anything so broad as liberalism, modernity, or the Reformation, or anyone so specific as John Locke or William of Ockham.

Rather, he addresses the postwar consensus that blamed the horrors of two World Wars on the “strong gods” that inspire strong loves and strong truth claims. The strong gods are not “golden idols or characters in ancient mythologies…They are whatever has the power to inspire love.” In public life, they are “the objects of our shared loves,” including not only the nation but also its symbols and heroes. And they have been banished as disturbers of the peace.

‘Negative Piety’

Reno presents the philosopher Karl Popper, author of The Open Society and Its Enemies, as a preeminent apostle of this “negative piety.” Popper argued that the Western philosophical tradition inaugurated by Plato was oppressive because it sought to know the truth, and “insofar as truth is known, it must be affirmed, which is to say obeyed. Therein lies the danger…Popper sees any form of transcendence as implicitly totalitarian.” In this analysis, we would be better off without capital-T Truth, for it divides us; it does not bring peace, but a sword.

Therefore, the postwar imperative of “never again!” necessitated disenchantment, openness, and weakness to dissolve the “strong beliefs and powerful loyalties thought to have fueled the conflicts that convulsed the twentieth century.” For instance, the project of the European Union is not just of easier trade and travel, but a deliberate dissolution of national identity and loyalty.

Reno demonstrates the development and eventual dominance of this viewpoint by examining a variety of figures, including George H. W. Bush, Friedrich Hayek, Albert Camus, and Jacques Derrida. Each contributed to the consensus against the strong gods and the trend, only accelerated by the end of the Cold War, toward greater openness: open minds, open economies, open borders, and open marriages.

Reno does overlook John Lennon, whose “Imagine” might be the purest popular expression of this: “Imagine there’s no countries/It isn’t hard to do/Nothing to kill or die for/And no religion, too.” A peaceful “brotherhood of man” will be achieved by weakening and dissolving strong loves and loyalties, when there are no differences worth killing or dying for.

Reservations about this program have withered among Western elites. Reno notes that “the center-left reconciled itself to openness in the economy, the center-right made its peace with ever-greater cultural openness.” The letters LGBT are now brought to you by Wall Street.

Of course, the demands of tolerance are not universal. The strong gods are still suppressed and exiled, and the heretic-hunting inquisitors of diversity have become more paranoid and vindictive in triumph. Pronouns are policed, nonconformist bakers are punished, and from the campus to HR, the bureaucracy of tolerance is a hybrid of the Kafkaesque and the Orwellian. New forms of intolerance and oppression are constantly discovered, and the exquisite sensibilities of the “woke” are able to detect racism, sexism, and so on down to 1 part per million.

Becoming Homeless

Advocates of the postwar consensus point to populist outbreaks as evidence that these repressive measures are necessary to protect the open society from its enemies. But the current populisms in the West are responses to the excess and failures of the postwar consensus, not to its absence. The immediate danger is not that of dark, strong gods, but of a vacuum. Our problems are not those of a closed society, but of one that is too open. We are not suffering from too much solidarity and loyalty, but dissolution.

This is exemplified by a leadership class that is disloyal to those it seeks to lead. On issues of economics and immigration, the rhetoric of openness has gone hand in hand with the ruthless exploitation of cheap labor and the disavowal of economic solidarity with fellow citizens. As Reno notes, “Our center-left leadership class will promise to subsidize working-class consumption, but it won’t reorient the global economy toward their employment.” Welfare, yes; jobs, no—just give the proles some cash so they can distract themselves with cheap consumer goods made in China. The costs of working-class decline are just one more thing for corporations to outsource.

Populist claims that the system is rigged resonate because there is truth in them. Elites are insulated from the worst effects of the cultural and economic dissolution they support. Reno observes that, “For all their talk of an open economy and open society, those in the upper echelons of our society work very hard to protect their children.” Everyone wants a secure future for their children, even if it requires ideological hypocrisy—just look at well-off white liberal parents in New York City and the schools they send their children to.

A broader sense of solidarity no longer informs our culture and economy. We are becoming homeless; a place to live is not the same as a place to belong, and the postwar consensus has deconstructed the sources of belonging. We were told that diversity and inclusion would provide “a home without walls” in which everyone felt welcomed and accepted, but this has not come to pass. Those subjected to these therapies of the open society still seek loyalty and solidarity, which often leads to nurturing grievances and embracing identity politics.

The postwar consensus is in crisis because it is unbalanced; the more dominant it becomes, the more destabilizing its neglect of basic human needs for belonging and solidarity becomes. Reno therefore declares that “We don’t need more diversity and innovation. We need a home. And for that, we will require the return of the strong gods.” The peace and prosperity the postwar consensus promised (and to some degree delivered) is not enough, for humans are not livestock.

The Anti-Human Consensus

We are not fulfilled by a boundless world of autonomous individuality and weak loves. We long to love and be loved. We long for a “we” to belong to and share our love with. In Reno’s words:

We desire to live shoulder to shoulder with our fellow man in the service of shared loves. So no, we are not safer with never-ending critique, the spontaneous order of the free market, technocratic management of utilities, and the other therapies of weakening. Disenchantment will not make our society more humane. When the open society becomes an enemy of shared loves, when critical intelligence wages total war against our anchoring convictions, our spiritual, cultural, and political consensus becomes anti-human.

Discontent is the inevitable result of a political and cultural consensus that is, “at root, fearful of love.” Men may do terrible things for strong loves and loyalties. The strong gods may demand dreadful sacrifices. But “the project of peace without love cannot go on much longer. Man was not created to be alone…We yearn to join ourselves to others, not only in the bond of matrimony, but in civic and religious bonds as well.” Thus, it is not a question of whether the strong gods will return, but what they will be.

The strong gods are coming back. They cannot be wished or sneered or critiqued away. Denouncing tribalism and complaining about ingratitude (as many advocates of the current consensus do) will not keep populism and other passions at bay. Limiting and restraining the dark potential of the strong gods of politics requires the stronger gods of family and faith.

G.K. Chesterton’s observation regarding the Roman Republic remains relevant, for “only men to whom the family is sacred will ever have a standard or status by which to criticize the state. They alone can appeal to something more holy than the gods of the city; the gods of the hearth.” We may also appeal to a God above the gods of the city. A man’s love for God above him, and for his family around him, provide strength that can defy the demands of the state.

As Reno puts it, “The perverse gods of blood, soil, and identity cannot be overcome with the open society therapies of weakening.” They can only be defeated by strong gods that ennoble and elevate. Therefore, he concludes that our task “is to restore public life in the West by developing a language of love and a vision of the ‘we’ that befits our dignity and appeals to our reason as well as to our hearts.”

Reno ends with this call to action, but he has not provided a definitive treatise. Rather, this slim volume is a self-conscious conscious reframing that surveys subjects from statesmen, theologians, and philosophers to architects, authors, and economists. Readers may quibble with parts of it (I would place much more emphasis on the continuity between liberal ideology and the postwar consensus), but the broad argument is persuasive and timely.

This book provides a disenchantment and deconstruction of the postwar consensus itself, revealing that it is not an eternal verity or the sole legitimate basis for culture and government, but a contingent response to the catastrophes of the last century. As such it was understandable, but mistaken. The goal of preventing fanaticism and authoritarianism was laudable, but the method of draining away particularity and its loyalties was not.

Endless openness is making us lonely, homeless, and anxious amidst our material plenitude, and has enervated the elevating loves that alone can resist the strong, dark gods of this world. The strong gods are returning. We will choose whom we serve by who and what we love.

Authors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health institutions used vaccine ordering data through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides government-purchased vaccines to about 50 percent of children in United States. The CDC’s Vaccine Tracking System and Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) vaccine administration data also was incorporated.

The study compared orders for the period from Jan. 7 through April 21 this year to the same period last year.

“On March 24, CDC posted guidance emphasizing the importance of routine well child care and immunization, particularly for children aged [less than] 24 months, when many childhood vaccines are recommended,” the CDC report states.

The website reported on the study:

The findings suggest childhood vaccination efforts nearly ground to a halt between March 13 — when the national emergency was declared — and April 19. There was a 2.5 million-dose decline in orders of regular childhood vaccines — not counting influenza vaccines — and a 250,000-dose decline in vaccines containing measles protection in that period, the authors reported. Doctors and public health experts have worried that a vast number of regular health care needs — including preventive care interventions like vaccinations — have gone unmet in the past few months as people shy away from interacting with a health system that has, at least in some places, been overwhelmed by caring for Covid-19 patients. Pediatricians in particular have been concerned that children may be missing critical vaccinations, which the new data confirm has happened.

“Routine immunizations in young children are critical to maintain during the pandemic,” Kathryn Edwards, a pediatrician and scientific director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program in Nashville, Tennessee, said in the Stat report. “The usual childhood diseases are still around and we need to protect our children from them.”

“I think that didn’t happen,” Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccines expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said in the Stat report. “I think there were a number of practices that didn’t do that because they were too scared. And so this is the result. You have this dramatic decline.”

Neither Edwards nor Offit was involved in this study, the Stat report said.

“The identified declines in routine pediatric vaccine ordering and doses administered might indicate that U.S. children and their communities face increased risks for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases,” the study authors wrote.

53,https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/prominent-republicans-mock-trumps-legal-claims-in-supreme-court-brief-and-blow-up-presidents-absolute-immunity-claim/,"A Supreme Court filing lays bare the deep chasm between prominent Republicans who believe in the rule of law and wannabe president for life Donald Trump, whose says he enjoys absolute immunity from any inquiry into his conduct.

Trump audaciously claims that any crimes he may have committed crimes before assuming office cannot even be investigated, not even if he committed murder, in effect trying to extend the protections of bankruptcy law with which he is so familiar to criminal law. No statute, court decision or our Constitution supports this claim of being above the law.

In a friend of the court brief filed Monday the prominent Republicans argue that Trump cannot block the Manhattan district attorney’s garden variety criminal tax fraud investigation. They note that the issue before the high court is a subpoena for business records held by Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA. The firm says it will comply with the subpoena, but Trump’s lawsuit blocked that.

Trump is a man without principles or scruples, and the Republicans are warning the court not to enable Trump or any future president who lacks respect for the rule of law.

Trump, the Republican brief states, “asks this Court to depart radically” from the principle that no one is above the law “by holding that criminal investigations may not touch the president’s affairs in any way, even when those investigations require nothing at all from the president. This extraordinary assertion is not based on any specific claim of privilege, but rather on a sweeping claim of absolute immunity. There is no principled reason to depart from the Court’s historical approach and create such a far-reaching, per se rule shielding all of the president’s unofficial affairs from criminal investigation.”

There, in a nutshell, is the issue: “principled reason.” Trump is a man without principles or scruples and the Republicans are warning the court not to enable Trump or any future president who lacks respect for the rule of law.

‘Absolute Immunity’ Debunked

The Republicans warn that “Trump’s assertions of absolute immunity from process while in office—and more generally, his arguments against accountability in any forum—could impose lasting damage on our constitutional system of checks and balances as well as on the rule of law.”

Significantly, the grand jury investigation focuses on whether Trump cheated on his New York State taxes and falsified business records before he took office. No court has ever held that a president enjoys any immunities or privileges for conduct before his election.

The grand jury no doubt already has Trump’s state income tax returns dating to 2011 and federal tax return information that the IRS routinely shares with the state, all of which are available to it under New York State tax law.

Uncovering Tax Fraud

The real issue is grand jury access to the business records, and drafts of the tax returns before they were filed. They would be crucial in establishing whether Trump engaged in criminal tax fraud, which is a virtual certainty given evidence already in the record of the Trump family’s massive gift, estate and income tax frauds detailed by The New York Times in 2018.

Trump has a well-documented record of lying in filings with governments to escape paying money he owed, such as his farcical efforts to hide records from the New York City auditor general in an attempt to evade almost $3 million a year in rent for the Grand Hyatt hotel when he ran it. That story is detailed in my 2016 Trump biography.

The Republicans cite an 1807 ruling by Chief Justice John Marshall compelling President Thomas Jefferson to comply with a subpoena in the Aaron Burr treason case. Jefferson did, establishing that no sitting president is immune from subpoenas for records.

Reagan Invoked

The Republicans also cite Ronald Reagan, a smart move given GOP reverence for that former president.

The “genius of our constitutional system is its recognition that no one branch of government alone could be relied on to preserve our freedoms” and that “the great safeguard of our liberty is the totality of the constitutional system” that ensures that no branch of government gets “the upper hand,” Reagan said in 1987.

The 37 Republicans on the court brief include, former Senator David Durenberger of Minnesota, 19 former members of Congress and others who served in senior executive branch positions as far back as the Nixon era including John Dean, Nixon’s White House counsel and Charles Fried, Reagan’s solicitor general.

Also signing the brief: Trump antagonist George Conway, aka Mr. Kellyanne Conway.

The brief points out that the Manhattan grand jury is investigating conduct before Trump took office. No court has held that any president enjoys privileges or immunities before his election and enjoys only extremely limited protections during the period between the vote and taking the oath of office.

Making Criminal Law Like Bankruptcy Law

Trump’s claim that once he became president no investigation of any kind is permitted into his conduct either in office or when he was a private citizen would effectively expand the core principle of bankruptcy law to criminal law, at least so far as a president is involved.

Federal bankruptcy allows individuals and businesses to wipe out debts they cannot repay and start afresh. A Trump casino company wiped away its debts six times, four of them when Trump was in charge.

Now Trump claims that as president he can wipe out any debt to society for past criminal conduct. Actually, Trump’s claim goes far beyond that. Trump says that he cannot even be investigated.

Federal Judge Denny Chin said two months ago that he was skeptical of Trump’s claims of absolute immunity. He asked about Trump’s campaign statement he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue under the immunity claims made by Trump lawyer George Consovoy.

“Local authorities couldn’t investigate? They couldn’t do anything about it?… That is your position?”

“That is correct,” attorney Consovoy replied.

Days later a federal appeals court held that was incorrect. Trump then appealed to the Supreme Court, two of whose members he appointed.

Supremacy Clause Abuse

The Republicans also challenge Trump’s claims that any sitting president is immune from state criminal proceedings under our Constitution’s supremacy clause. The Supremacy Clause “is concerned with the supremacy of federal law, not the supremacy of federal officials,” The Republican brief states.

“A subpoena for documents that concern the president’s personal affairs—rather than his official conduct—cannot possibly implicate the Supremacy Clause, because it does not impede federal law or the operations of the federal government in any way,” the Republicans argue.

“Occupying high office does not shield an individual from ordinary legal obligations; and that no person, regardless of rank or station, can wholly exempt himself and his affairs from the legal process,” they also argue.

In an almost mocking tone, the Republicans note that in the Trump criminal case “the subpoena was not even issued to the president, and it requires him to do literally nothing. Moreover, the subpoena seeks documents unrelated to and remote from the president’s official duties. Nothing in Article II bars a state from seeking such documents in the course of a legitimate criminal investigation, from a party who is not even the president.”

Enter the Prince of Wales

To show how absurd Trump’s claim of absolute immunity from investigation is the Republicans cite Jeremy Bentham, the 18th and 19th Century British economist and legal reformer:

“Were the Prince of Wales, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Lord High Chancellor, to be passing by . . . while a chimney- sweeper and a barrow-woman were in dispute about a halfpennyworth of apples,” could they later refuse to testify about what they had seen?

“No, most certainly,” Bentham answered.

The Republican brief also argues that Trump wrongly conflates the Office of the President with his person. Without directly quoting Louis XIV, they attack the French Sun King’s reputed claim of “l’état, c’est moi”—”I am the state.”

A President Isn’t a King

Our Supreme Court has consistently rejected claims of kingly exemption from the law, notably in the civil lawsuit that Paula Jones brought against President Clinton in 1994, saying he hurt her career because she declined to have sex with him.

“The mere holding of high office cannot excuse an individual” from their duties under the law, the Supreme Court ruled.

The Supreme Court also distinguished between the President and the person holding that title. “Immunities for acts clearly within official capacity are grounded in the nature of the function performed, not the identity of the actor who performed it.”

The high court will hear oral argument on March 31 and is expected to rule in June. The Supreme Court case filings are available here.",0
54,https://www.foxnews.com/us/omar-furor-reflects-intensifying-national-debate-over-israel,"For Congress, the allegations of anti-Semitism directed toward Rep. Ilhan Omar have no precedent. Yet on college campuses, in state legislatures and in many other venues nationwide, the polarized debate about Israel is a familiar conflict and likely to intensify in the months and years ahead.

Fueled by a wave of youthful activists, including many Jews aligning with Muslims, criticism of Israel's policies toward the Palestinians has grown in volume and scope, with persistent calls for boycotts and disinvestment. Pro-Israel organizations and politicians have countered with tough responses, and efforts to reconcile the differences have gained little traction.

Among those fearing escalation is Deborah Lipstadt, a history professor at Emory University and author of a new book, ""Antisemitism: Here and Now,"" about the recent resurgence of anti-Semitism in the United States and Europe. She calls herself an optimist, but she says it's hard to be hopeful in the current political climate.

""Leaders on the left and the right are using this phenomenon as a way of drumming up support, claiming they're victims,"" she said. ""I fear it will get far worse before it gets better.""

Congress has never experienced this kind of furor involving a Muslim member accused of anti-Semitism.

Omar, a freshman congresswoman from Minnesota, sparked turmoil within the Democratic caucus with her criticisms of Israel and suggestions that Israel's supporters wanted lawmakers to pledge ""allegiance"" to a foreign country. Divided Democrats eventually drafted a resolution that condemned a wide range of bigotry and did not mention Omar by name.

One of the first two Muslim women in Congress, Omar supports a contentious part of the overall dispute — the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement, or BDS, which promotes various forms of boycotts against Israel.

Some celebrities — including actress Natalie Portman and singer Lana Del Ray — have withdrawn from appearances in Israel in recent months out of concern over Israeli policies. Several scholarly associations, including the American Studies Association and the Association for Asian American Studies, have supported an academic boycott, even as other associations and academic leaders have opposed that campaign.

One of the bitterest cases in academe involved Steven Salaita, whose offer of a tenured faculty position at the University of Illinois was revoked in 2014 after he posted a series of tweets harshly critical of Israel. He sued the university and won a financial settlement, but he was unable to find a permanent academic positon elsewhere. He posted a blog piece in February mentioning his current job as a school bus driver near Washington.

In response to the BDS movement, 26 states have passed laws seeking to deter businesses and individuals from participating in it. For example, a Texas law requires contractors who work for or do business with the state to certify that they do not boycott Israel or Israeli-occupied territories.

The American Civil Liberties Union has filed lawsuits challenging the Texas law and similar laws in three other states, saying they violate the right to free speech. A separate lawsuit was filed in Texas by a speech language pathologist, Bahia Amawi, who said she lost her contract with the state because she would not sign the certification.

Among the companies entangled in the conflict is Airbnb, which announced in November that it would stop listing properties in the West Bank. Texas officials say the state will halt business with Airbnb because its move ran afoul the anti-BDS law. Airbnb says it opposes the BDS campaign and was simply implementing a policy to de-list residences in disputed territories around the world.

One of the groups supporting BDS is Jewish Voice for Peace, which was founded in 1996 and endorsed the boycott campaign in 2015. Rabbi Alissa Wise, the group's deputy director, says the boycott campaign has been effective, even in the face of state laws seeking to curtail it.

""These laws are meant to silence and repress,"" she said. ""But they can't change people's hearts and minds.""

The Anti-Defamation League, whose mission is to combat anti-Semitism, denounces Jewish Voice for Peace as ""a radical anti-Israel activist group"" that advocates a total boycott.

The ADL's CEO and national director, Jonathan Greenblatt, says not all people engaged in the BDS campaign are anti-Semitic, but he contends the movement itself ""is anti-Semitic in its origins.""

""It is not focused on resolving the conflict in the best interest of all parties,"" Greenblatt said.

For now, supporters of Israeli policy have some key advantages: Republicans in Congress are solidly in their camp, as are many Christian evangelicals, who make up a key part of President Donald Trump's political base. But there are some shifts — notably a widening split of viewpoints among Democrats.

Peter Beinart, a journalist, TV commentator and university professor, is one of the prominent American Jews who has been outspoken in criticizing Israeli policy. He says his views are shared by an ever-growing portion of younger generations in the U.S., including Jews.

""You see mobilization of young millennial Jews in quite a confrontation with their own communal Jewish establishment, which can include their own parents,"" he said.

Muqtedar Khan, a professor of political science and international relations at the University of Delaware, shares Beinart's views about shifting attitudes, but he worries about the response from hardline supporters of Israel.

""For a lot of people who take pro-Palestinian positions, a lot of nasty things are going to happen to them,"" he said.

Atiya Aftab, who teaches in the Middle Eastern Studies Program at Rutgers University and chairs Rutgers' Center for Islamic Life, has worked for years to promote interfaith dialogue between Muslims and Jews.

She is encouraged by the breadth of support extended to Omar after the congresswoman was criticized, but she worries that bridge-building will become more difficult amid the polarizing ideological conflict.

""It's always lurking in the background,"" she said. ""The political situation we find ourselves in just creeps in, and I don't know the solution.""

Both Muslims and Jews have reason to be alarmed by data on hate crimes. The latest FBI report showed a sharp increase in anti-Jewish hate crimes in 2017. FBI data also shows that anti-Muslim attacks have doubled since 2013.

""With anti-Semitism and Islamophobia on the rise, we have a lot of work to do,"" said Aziza Hasan, executive director of a Los Angeles-based Muslim-Jewish partnership called NewGround. ""Our destiny is intertwined and we should act like it.""

The story has become a viral sensation on Chinese social media as the public awaits the results of an investigation.

According to the South China Morning Post’s summary, the girl’s pet dog scratched her on the finger and she received a rabies shot after her father took her to the hospital. Medical staff cautioned her father she might run a mild fever after the vaccination, but instead she developed an uncontrollable fever overnight and died the following afternoon.

The family agreed to an autopsy and also asked for the vaccine to be examined along with medical records and hospital surveillance camera footage. Guangzhou Promise Biological Products, a company with no previous record of vaccine problems, reportedly produced the vaccine.

The Chinese government has been attempting to restore public trust in the pharmaceutical industry after a series of vaccine scandals by greatly increasing the financial penalties for malpractice. The new rules would allow families to demand compensation in the event of sickness or death after immunization.

One of the recent vaccine debacles occurred in Jiangsu province at the beginning of the year when 145 children were given expired polio vaccinations. The Chinese government pledged an intensive nationwide probe to eliminate incompetence and corruption.

Parents alarmed by the case began investigating their children’s vaccination history and found the government gave them expired doses for diseases other than polio. Parents held rare public demonstrations as fears of a government cover-up grew, driven by a history of vaccine problems turning out to be much worse than Chinese officials originally admitted, combined with the government’s tendency to suppress popular discontent and suppress those who ask awkward questions.",2
56,https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/trump-loving-security-guard-who-gunned-down-a-black-man-in-tulsa-had-history-of-racism-report/,"A Trump-loving white security guard with a racist past shot and killed an unarmed Black man during an unprovoked hotel parking lot attack.

Former Tulsa detention officer Christopher Straight has been charged with first-degree manslaughter after he provoked and then fatally Carlos Carson earlier this month, and newly released surveillance video shows the 36-year-old Black man had his back turned when the attack began, reported The Guardian.

Carson had been a guest at the hotel who was asked to leave earlier in the morning of June 6, after he became upset that his car was vandalized while staying there.

He returned to the property a few minutes later when the 53-year-old Straight, who was working as a security guard, got out of his pickup and sprayed Carson with pepper spray while his back was turned.

Straight later admitted that Carson had not made an aggressive move toward him, but told officers he used chemical irritant to “deter” the Black man from becoming aggressive and planned to detain him for trespassing until police arrived.

Security footage shows Carson walking away from Straight’s truck when the security guard sprayed him.

Carson then confronted Straight and the two men struggled as Carson tried to pull him from his vehicle.

A few seconds later, Straight shot Carson in the head, killing him.

Straight was arrested afterward and released on $50,000 bond.

The Guardian reviewed documents that show Straight was previously accused of racist behavior by a black colleague while working as a guard at city’s jail, and inmates accused him of negligence.

The Tulsa county Sheriff’s Office, which operates the jail, declined to answer questions about Straight’s resignation from the department in 2018, after 16 years, on the same day he was told he would be demoted.

The day before killing Carson, Straight shared a Facebook meme with the words: “How about all lives matter. Not black lives, not white lives. Get over yourself no one’s life is more important than the next. Put your race card away and grow up.”

A week earlier, on May 31, he shared another meme that read: “If you are anti-police: I’m blue family, unfriend me,” along with the hashtag #Bluelivesmatter.

Three days prior to that, he shared an image that stated, “I support Trump and I will not apologize for it,” and Facebook photos show Straight wearing a red “Make America Great Again” cap.

President Donald Trump will visit Tulsa on Saturday for his first campaign rally since the coronavirus pandemic, and then nationwide protests over racism and police brutality.",0

The victim, known only as “Hannah”, spoke to the Mail on Sunday to recount the horrific attack, which occurred at a flat in Crouch End, London, when she was just 16 years old.

Yaqub Ahmed was one of four men who carried out the attack 12 years ago. The men reportedly lured the victim from a bar, telling her that her friend was at their flat. When she arrived her friend wasn’t there and the gang repeatedly assaulted her. She spoke of being held down by the gang as she was repeatedly raped and being punched in the face by one member as she resisted the attack.

She managed to escape and run out of the flat just as police arrived, thanks to neighbours having heard her cries for help. The four men were arrested at the scene. The men denied the attack but were convicted due to “extensive” DNA evidence. Three of the men received short 9-year prison sentences and a fourth received a shorter 8 years — even shorter than they first appear, considering criminals in the United Kingdom are typically released from prison “on licence” halfway through their sentences.

One of her attackers was Yaqub Ahmed, who served just four years.

He was due to be deported to Somalia but, after screaming and resisting on his deportation flight, many passengers stepped in to obstruct the deportation from going ahead.

One passenger approached Ahmed and then told fellow travellers, “‘He says they’re separating him from his family, his family’s here.” The passengers then chanted “take him off the plane”, with one shouting “you’re free man” as security officers finally gave up and led Ahmed from the plane.

The victim said of the passengers’ actions, “How could you defend a rapist? How could you intervene? He was in handcuffs, he was being taken out of the country… who are you people to interfere with justice?”

“‘You think that was a bad scream?” she asked. “Try hearing the screams that I made.”

“The more they stuck up for him, the more he screamed. It’s like a kid having a tantrum, the more attention you give that kid, the worse their screams get,” she added.

She said of the officials on the flight, “They should have executed their job, which is to calm things down, to tell the passengers if they don’t stop causing trouble they will be removed from the flight just like any other unruly passenger.”

The passengers may have been in breach of a variety of aviation and immigration laws related to conduct and obstruction, with some arguing they were also perverting the course of justice — but as yet there is no information suggesting police have taken any action against them, or that the Home Office has taken steps to deprive British national involved of their passports or put any foreign nationals on the ban list.

Swedish SJW Facing Jail After Blocking Deportation of Criminal Afghan https://t.co/brkD9cggdS — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 22, 2018

Ahmed was not immediately put on another flight and remains in a detention facility, costing taxpayers up to £100 a day, and is reportedly still scheduled for deportation.

Another member of the rape gang, Ondogo Ahmed, left Britain to fight for Islamic State while still on licence from prison. He was believed to have been killed in Syria in 2013, though a warrant remains open for his arrest.

The outcry from passengers was not the first time that “social justice warrior” members of the public have interfered with a deportation.

In July 2018, Swedish immigration activist Elin Errson, a member of the “Sitdown Strike” collective, was single-handedly responsible for preventing a man convicted of assault from being deported to Afghanistan.

Errson had reportedly booked a seat on the flight from Gothenburg to Turkey specifically to disrupt the deportation, and was later fined 3,000 Krona (£250) for the protest.

58,https://www.alternet.org/2020/09/abc-anchor-cuts-trump-off-in-the-middle-of-a-stream-of-lies-to-deliver-a-brutal-fact-check/,"ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos cut off President Donald Trump on Tuesday during an egregious string of lies about health care at an event with voters.

Trump had been responding to a question about his health care policy. Since he knows almost nothing about health care policy and cares even less, he launched into a meaningless and obfuscatory rant about how his administration will supposedly protect pre-existing conditions.

""What we're is we're going to be doing a health care plan protecting people with pre-existing conditions,"" he said. ""We're going to be doing a health care plan very strongly and protect people with pre-existing conditions. I will say this: They [Democrats] will not do that. Because they have socialized —""

At that point, Stephanopoulos felt compelled to cut in and correct Trump's lies.

""I have to stop you there—"" he began.

""George, they have socialized medicine,"" Trump continued.

""I just have to stop you there just on a couple points,"" Stephanopoulos said. ""Number one, Joe Biden has run against Medicare for All in the primaries. But much more importantly, Obamacare guaranteed people with pre-existing conditions could buy insurance. Guaranteed they could buy it at the same price as everyone else. Guaranteed a package of essential benefits. Guaranteed that insurance companies couldn't put a lifetime limit on those benefits.""

He continued: ""You fought to appeal Obamacare. You're arguing in the Supreme Court right now to strike it down. That would do away with pre-existing conditions.""

""No,"" Trump said, with irritation in his voice. ""So that we can do new health care.""

""But you've been promising a new health care plan!"" Stephanopoulos shot back. ""I interviewed you in June of last year. You said the health care plan would come in two weeks. You told Chris Wallace this summer it would come in three weeks. You promised an existing order on pre-existing conditions.""

""I have it already! I have it already,"" Trump said. He does not, in fact, have a health care plan, and the fact that he has lied about it continuously since becoming president indicates that he has no intention of ever developing one.

""But you've been trying to strike down pre-existing conditions,"" the host responded.

""It doesn't matter,"" Trump said. ""I have it already, and it's a much better plan for you. And it's a much better plan.""

Again, he doesn't have a plan.

Trump also tried to interject that he got rid of the individual mandate of Obamacare, which was gutted in the GOP's 2017 tax bill. But that had nothing to do with actually providing coverage to people who need it now and was irrelevant.

Overall, Stephanopoulos's performance was exemplary — he knew the relevant facts, and he challenged Trump when he lied and misled. It's exactly the type of journalism that is needed for voters to make informed decisions in November.
