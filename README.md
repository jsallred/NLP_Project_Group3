**Description:**: <br/>
Welcome to our NLP Project! We are group 3 in the Natural Language Processing course CSCI 3832-001 at CU Boulder 
in the Spring 2024 Semester. In this project we will construct a variety of text classification models and train them on a 
dateset of news articles labeled as 'real news' and 'fake news'. Our goal in this project is to implement a series of three different 
models varying in complexity (Such as Naive Bayes, RNN, BiLSTM), and to analyze their performance vs complexity 
ratio to see which models can give us the best performance when applied on our test set with respect to their training time.

**Further Exploration:** <br/>
In addition to our performance analysis, we have a couple different studies we want to conduct
on our data using our trained models,they are as follows:
* *Temporal Analysis*: As politics and media voices change over time, so do the news articles describing them. 
What our group wants to discover is if our models trained on real vs fake news data from the following range of dates: XXXX
Can still perform adequately when tested on news articles from this later range of dates: XXXX
* *Ensemble Method*: Using the average of the three different labels applied from each model on test set articles, 
we'd like to see if the combined influence of our three independent models can result in a performance greater 
than any individual model.
